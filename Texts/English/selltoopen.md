# Sell to Open
## What Is Sell from Open's point of view?

Sell to open is a phrase utilized by numerous financiers to address the opening of a [short position](/short) in an options or different derivatives transaction.

## Understanding Sell to Open

Sell to open alludes to examples in which an option investor starts, or opens, an option trade by selling or laying out a short position in an option. This empowers the option seller to receive the premium paid by the buyer on the contrary side of the transaction. Options are a type of [derivative](/derivative) security.

Selling to open permits an investor to be eligible for a premium as the investor is selling the opportunity associated with the option to one more investor inside the market. This puts the selling investor in the short position on the call or put, while the subsequent investor takes the [long position](/long), or the purchase of a security with the hope that it will increase in value. The investor shorting the position is trusting the underlying asset or equity doesn't move past the [strike price](/strikeprice), as this permits them to keep the underlying security and benefit from the long investor's premium.

## Put and Call Options

Sell to open can be laid out on a [put option](/putoption) or a [call option](/calloption) or any combination of puts and calls relying upon the trade bias, whether bullish, bearish or neutral, that the option trader or investor needs to execute. With a sell to open, the investor composes a call or put in hopes of collecting a premium. The call or put might be covered or naked relying upon whether the investor composing the call is right now in possession of the securities being referred to.

An illustration of a sell to open transaction is a put option sold or written on a stock, for example, one offered through Microsoft. In this case, the put seller might have a neutral to bullish view on Microsoft, and might want to face the challenge of the stock being assigned, or put, in the event that it dips under the strike price in exchange for getting the premium paid by the option buyer.

As another model, a sell to open transaction can include a covered call or naked call. In a [covered call](/coveredcall) transaction, the short position in the call is laid out on a stock held by the investor. Producing premium pay from a stock or portfolio is generally utilized. A naked call, likewise alluded to as an uncovered call, is riskier than a covered call, as it includes laying out a short call position on a stock not held by the investor.

This means that the trader is estimating on a downward move at ABC's cost and selling its call options to the market maker, who has wagered that ABC's price will go up. Opening the short position empowers XYZ to collect premiums on ABC's call options.
