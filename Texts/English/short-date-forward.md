# Short Date Forward
## What Is a Short Date Forward?

A short date forward is a [forward](/forwardcontract) contract that lapses in under one year. A forward is an obligation including two gatherings that concur upon a set price to sell or buy an asset at a pre-determined date and time from here on out.

In forex trading, a short dated forward typically includes trading a currency at a predetermined spot date that is before the normal [spot date](/spot-date), going from multi week to one month after the trade date.

A short dated forward can be stood out from [long dated forwards](/long-date-forward) with a settlement date in excess of one year, and to the extent that at least 10 years into what's in store. Companies or financial institutions utilize the two types of these contracts to hedge certain currency openings.

## How Short Date Forwards Works

A forward exchange contract is an agreement to exchange some underlying security or asset at a pre-determined future date, for example, the currencies of various countries at a predefined exchange rate (the forward rate). Typically, forward contracts call for delivery (either physical or cash delivery) out on the town past the spot contract settlement.

Dissimilar to [futures](/futurescontract) contracts, which are standardized and traded on [exchanges](/exchange), forward contracts don't occur on regulated exchanges and don't include delivery of standard currency amounts. They are said to trade over-the-counter ([OTC](/otc)). The terms and specifications of a specific forward contract are negotiated and agreed upon by the [counterparties](/counterparty) involved, and can be dropped exclusively with the consent of the other party to a trade.

Short dated forward contracts are safer instruments than forwards with longer maturities since there is less chance for a counterparty to [default](/default2) on their obligations inside a shorter time period. Moreover, farther long dated forward contracts frequently have greater [bid-ask spreads](/bid-askspread) than shorter-term contracts, making their utilization fairly costly.

## Why Use Short Date Forwards

Financial backers can utilize short date forward contracts to hedge risks or as a speculative investment vehicle. The matured value of a forward contract can be calculated by the difference between the delivery price and the underlying price of the security on that date. A forward contract permits a trader, bank, or a bank's customer, to sort out for delivery (or sale) of a specific amount of currency on a predefined future date, at the current market price. This safeguards the buyer against the risk of fluctuating rates while getting foreign exchange expected to meet future obligations.

As opposed to a commonplace forward contract, short date forwards will include conveying a currency on a spot date that is before the normal spot date, going from multi week to one month after the trade happens. These short-term contracts might be put in place as a temporary hedge when listed futures contracts don't exist for the required contract month, or on the other hand in the event that they lapse too soon or later than is required for a [perfect hedge](/perfecthedge).
