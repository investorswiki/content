# Fixed Income
## What Is Fixed Income?

Fixed income comprehensively alludes to those types of investment security that pay investors fixed interest or dividend payments until its [maturity](/maturity) date. At maturity, investors are repaid the principal amount they had invested. Government and corporate bonds are the most common types of fixed-income products. Not at all like equities that might pay no cash flows to investors, or variable-income securities, where payments can change in light of some underlying measure —, for example, short-term interest rates — the payments of a fixed-income security are known in advance.

In addition to purchasing fixed income securities directly, there are several fixed-income [exchange-traded funds (ETFs)](/etf) and mutual funds accessible.

## Understanding Fixed Income

Organizations and governments issue debt securities to fund-raise to fund everyday operations and finance large projects. For investors, fixed-income instruments pay a set interest rate return in exchange for investors lending their money. At the maturity date, investors are repaid the original amount they had invested — known as the principal.

For instance, a company might issue a 5% bond with a $1,000 [face or par value](/facevalue) that matures in five years. The investor buys the bond for $1,000 and won't be paid back until the finish of the five-years. Over the course of the five years, the company pays interest payments — called coupon payments — in view of a rate of 5% each year. As a result, the investor is paid $50 each year for a considerable length of time. At the finish of the five-years, the investor is repaid the $1,000 invested initially on the maturity date. Investors may likewise track down fixed-income investments that pay coupon payments monthly, quarterly, or semiannually.

Fixed-income securities are suggested for conservative investors seeking a diversified portfolio. The percentage of the portfolio dedicated to fixed income relies upon the investor's investment style. There is likewise an opportunity to expand the portfolio with a mix of fixed-income products and stocks creating a portfolio that might have half in fixed income products and half in stocks.

Treasury bonds and bills, municipal bonds, corporate bonds, and certificates of deposit (CDs) are instances of fixed-income products. Bonds trade over-the-counter (OTC) on the [bond market](/bondmarket) and secondary market.

## Special Considerations

Fixed income investing is a conservative strategy where returns are generated from low-risk securities that pay predictable interest. Since the risk is lower, the interest coupon payments are additionally, generally, lower too. Building a fixed income portfolio might remember investing for bonds, [bond mutual funds](/bondfund), and certificates of deposit (CDs). One such strategy utilizing fixed income products is called the [laddering](/bondladder) strategy.

A laddering strategy offers steady interest income through the investment in a series of short-term bonds. As bonds mature, the portfolio manager reinvests the returned principal into new short-term bonds extending the ladder. This method allows the investor to approach ready capital and abstain from losing out on rising market interest rates.

For instance, a $60,000 investment could be isolated into one-year, two-year, and three-year bonds. The investor partitions the $60,000 principle into three equivalent portions, investing $20,000 into every one of the three bonds. At the point when the one-year bond matures, the $20,000 principal will be rolled into a bond maturing one year after the original three-year holding. At the point when the subsequent bond matures those funds roll into a bond that extends the ladder for another year. In this manner, the investor has a steady return of interest income and can take advantage of any higher interest rates.

## Types of Fixed Income Products

As stated before, the most common illustration of a fixed-income security is a government or corporate bond. The most common government securities are those issued by the U.S. government and are generally alluded to as Treasury securities. Be that as it may, many fixed income securities are offered from non U.S. governments and corporations too.

Here are the most common types of fixed income products:

- **Treasury bills (T-bills)** are short-term fixed-income securities that mature within one year that don't pay coupon returns. Investors buy the bill at a price not exactly its face value and investors earn that difference at the maturity.
- **Treasury notes (T-notes)** come in maturities between two and 10 years, pay a fixed interest rate, and are sold in multiples of $100. At the finish of the maturity, investors are repaid the principal but earn semiannual interest payments until maturity.
- **The Treasury bond (T-bonds)** are like the T-note except that it matures in 20 or 30 years. Treasury bonds can be purchased in multiples of $100.
- **Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS)** protects investors from inflation. The principal amount of a TIPS bond adjusts with inflation and deflation.
- A [municipal bond](/municipalbond) is like a Treasury since it is government-issued, except it is issued and backed by a state, municipality, or county, instead of the federal government, and is utilized to raise capital to finance neighborhood expenditures. Muni bonds can have tax-free benefits to investors also.
- [Corporate bonds](/corporatebond) come in different types, and the price and interest rate offered largely relies upon the company's financial stability and its creditworthiness. Bonds with higher credit ratings typically pay lower coupon rates.
- [Junk bonds](/junkbond) — likewise called high-yield bonds — are corporate issues that pay a greater coupon due to the higher risk of default. Default is the point at which a company neglects to pay back the principal and interest on a bond or debt security.
- A **certificate of deposit (CD)** is a fixed income vehicle offered by financial institutions with maturities of under five years. The rate is higher than a typical saving account, and CDs carry FDIC or National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) protection.
- **Fixed-income mutual funds (bond funds)** —, for example, those offered by Vanguard — invest in different bonds and debt instruments. These funds allow the investor to have an income stream with the professional management of the portfolio. Nonetheless, they will pay a fee for the convenience.
- Asset-allocation or **fixed income ETFs** works similar as a mutual fund. These funds target specific credit ratings, durations, or other factors. ETFs likewise carry a professional management expense.

## Advantages of Fixed Income

Fixed income investments offer investors a steady stream of income over the life of the bond or debt instrument while simultaneously offering the issuer much-required access to capital or money. Steady income lets investors plan for spending, an explanation these are well known products in retirement portfolios.

The interest payments from fixed-income products can likewise assist investors with stabilizing the risk-return in their investment portfolio — known as the [market risk](/marketrisk). For investors holding stocks, prices can fluctuate resulting in large gains or losses. The steady and stable interest payments from fixed-income products can partly offset losses from the decline in stock prices. As a result, these safe investments help to expand the risk of an investment portfolio.

Additionally, fixed-income investments as Treasury bonds (T-bonds) have the backing of the U.S. government. Fixed income CDs have Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) protection up to $250,000 per individual. Corporate bonds, while not insured are backed by the financial viability of the underlying company. Should a company declare bankruptcy or liquidation, bondholders have a higher claim on company assets than do common shareholders.

Although there are many benefits to fixed income products, likewise with all investments, there are several risks investors ought to know about before purchasing them.

## Risks Associated with Fixed Income
### Credit and Default Risk

As mentioned before, Treasurys and CDs have protection through the government and FDIC. Corporate debt, while less secure still positions higher for repayment than do shareholders. While picking an investment take care to take a gander at the credit [rating of the bond](/investmentgrade) and the underlying company. Bonds with ratings below BBB are of low quality and consider junk bonds.
The credit risk linked to a corporation can varyingly affect the valuations of the fixed-income instrument leading up to its maturity. On the off chance that a company is struggling, the prices of its bonds on the secondary market might decline in value. In the event that an investor tries to sell a bond of a struggling company, the bond might sell for not exactly the face or par value. Likewise, the bond might become difficult for investors to sell in the open market at a fair price or at all since there's no demand for it.

The prices of bonds can increase and diminish over the life of the bond. Assuming the investor holds the bond until its maturity, the price movements are immaterial since the investor will be paid the face value of the bond upon maturity. Nonetheless, on the off chance that the bondholder sells the bond before its maturity through a broker or financial institution, the investor will receive the current market price at the time of the sale. The selling price could result in a gain or loss on the investment relying upon the underlying corporation, the coupon interest rate, and the current market interest rate.

### Interest Rate Risk

Fixed-income investors might face [interest rate risk](/interestraterisk). This risk occurs in an environment where market interest rates are rising, and the rate paid by the bond falls behind. In this case, the bond would lose value in the secondary bond market. Additionally, the investor's capital is tied up in the investment, and they cannot put it to work earning higher income without taking an initial loss. For instance, on the off chance that an investor purchased a 2-year bond paying 2.5% each year and interest rates for 2-year bonds leaped to 5%, the investor is locked in at 2.5%. For better or more terrible, investors holding fixed-income products receive their fixed rate paying little mind to where interest rates move in the market.

### Inflationary Risks

Inflationary risk is likewise a threat to fixed income investors. The pace at which prices rise in the economy is called inflation. Assuming prices rise or inflation increases, it eats into the gains of fixed income securities. For instance, whenever fixed-rate debt security pays a 2% return and inflation rises by 1.5%, the investor misses out, earning just a 0.5% return in real terms.

The interest amount is fixed and gives you a steady income. The company receives the $10,000 and utilizes the funds to build the overseas plant. Upon maturity in five years, the company pays back the principal amount of $10,000 to the investor who earned a total of $2,500 in interest over the five years ($500 x five years).
