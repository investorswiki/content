# Annuitization Method
## What Is an Annuitization Method?

The term annuitization method alludes to a [annuity](/annuity) distribution structure. Annuities are financial contracts distributed by [financial institutions](/financialinstitution) that permit individuals to invest money throughout some stretch of time to provide them with a source of income later on â€” regularly during retirement. Annuity contracts frame the method of payment. These options permit annuitants to receive lifetime payments or period certain options.

## Grasping Annuitization Methods

As referenced above, annuities are financial contracts offered by financial institutions and [insurance](/insurance) companies. These contracts permit individuals to invest customary regularly scheduled payments or a lump sum amount. Individuals can pick between immediate or deferred annuities.

Immediate annuities permit individuals to save with a lump-sum amount for payout, as a rule soon. Deferred annuities typically include regularly scheduled payments where the money is put something aside for a future date, as a rule for [retirement](/retirement).

The period of time when an individual beginnings getting payments is called the [annuitization phase](/annuitizationphase). When somebody arrives at this point in their contract, the whole amount of money saved is effectively changed over into a flood of income. The way the [annuitant](/annuitant) decides to receive this income is called the annuitization method. The annuitant can decide to receive payments through a life option or period certain options.

The insurance company guarantees the income stream in a [life option](/lifeoption) for the whole life of the annuitant. Going this route ought to be risky, especially assuming that the investor passes on before expected, and that means the leftover balance is forfeited to the insurance company. Most annuities, be that as it may, offer [period certain](/periodcertain) options or spousal coverage, which decreases the risk of forfeiture in the event of a sooner than-expected death.

## Special Considerations

The annuitization phase is the place where the annuitant begins to receive payments from the [annuity](/annuity). This period is otherwise called the annuity phase. It comes after the [accumulation phase](/accumulationphase), which is the point at which the money is initially invested in the annuity.

After retirement, annuities are turned over from the accumulation phase to the [annuitization](/annuitization) phase, turning out revenue for retired people. The more somebody invests in the annuity, the more they receive when the annuity arrives at the annuitization phase.

## Types of Annuitization Methods

The annuitization phase is the place where the annuitization method becomes possibly the most important factor. Annuitants can pick either normal month to month withdrawals or they can decide to receive a lump-sum payment from their annuity.

With the [systematic withdrawal schedule](/systematicwithdrawalschedule), the annuitant picks the amount they need to receive every month until the balance in the annuity account runs out. Lump-sum payments, then again, include a specific sum of money paid out at the same time.

As referenced before, there are a couple of options accessible to the annuitant with regards to their annuitization method. Coming up next are the absolute most common types.

### Life Option

This option regularly gives the highest payout in light of the fact that the regularly scheduled payment is calculated exclusively on the life of the annuitant. This option turns out a revenue stream forever, which is an effective [hedge](/hedge) against outlasting your retirement income.

Investors ought to keep the risks as a primary concern. Assuming that an annuitant kicks the bucket sooner than expected, the insurance company will keep the leftover balance in the annuity. The leftover balance doesn't go to their beneficiaries except if a rider is purchased. Be that as it may, on the off chance that the investor lives longer, they will keep on getting money until they pass on.

The [joint-life option](/joint-life-payout) keeps on paying the spouse in the event of the annuitant's death. The regularly scheduled payment from a joint-life annuity is lower than that of the life option in light of the fact that the calculation depends on the [life expectancy](/lifeexpectancy) of the two spouses.

### Period Certain Option

The value of the annuity is paid out over a defined period of season fitting your personal preference for the period certain annuitization method. This could be for 10, 15, or 20 years. Dissimilar to the life option, this is as yet the case on the off chance that the annuitant passes on. This means that assuming somebody chooses to receive payments under a period certain option for quite a long time yet passes on after 10, the contract guarantees to make payments to the [beneficiary](/beneficiary) for the excess five years.
