# Contingent Commission
## What is a contingent fee?
A contingent fee is a charge that is paid once a specific legal outcome happens, like winning a lawsuit.
## More profound definition
In legal terms, a contingent fee is generally paid to a lawyer on the off chance that certain conditions are met, for example, a settlement arriving at a satisfactory resolution.
In this case, the lawyer frequently consents to acknowledge a certain amount or percentage of the settlement or recovery in lieu of payment. On the off chance that the case is won, the lawyer gets the settled upon amount.
Assuming that you lose the case, the lawyer doesn't get anything and you are not required to pay the attorney for any work the individual in question did. No matter what the outcome, you are as yet responsible for any court fees and charges, except if they are remembered for your damages after winning.
Contingency fees are not accessible for all areas of the law. Areas of the law where contingency fees are accessible include:
- Any type of vehicle accidents, including automobiles and boats.
- Work accidents and other personal injury cases.
- As a part of the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act for infringement by creditors in pestering debtors.
- Cases including a defective product that caused injury.
- Debates among employees and employers over time-based compensations.
- While gathering a large debt.

Common contingency fees range from a low of around 15 percent to as high as 50 percent. Generally, individuals who hire a lawyer on contingency frequently lack the fundamental funds to pay the lawyer outright, albeit this isn't generally the case.
## Illustration of a contingent fee
Contingent fee agreements for the most part occur in seeking after damages experienced in an automobile accident.
The guarding party is the one to blame in the accident, and the offended party is the one suing for damages due to injury, property damage or even death. In this case, assuming that the offended party wins the case, the lawyer gets his percentage of the settlement, with the offended party getting the rest.

## Highlights
- Contingent commissions vary from traditional commissions in that they are possibly paid out on an event happening as opposed to when a policy is sold to a customer.
- A contingent commission is a commission paid to an intermediary broker by an insurance or reinsurance company.
- The value of the contingent commission depends on different factors, like the danger of the policyholder and on the off chance that a claim is paid out.
- Contingent commissions have fallen undesirable since it makes an incentive for an intermediary broker to push its clients to certain insurers or reinsurers, in view of compensation, making a conflict of interest.
