Starting around 2022, the eurozone comprises of 19 countries in the [European Union](/europeanunion) (EU): Austria, Belgium, Cyprus, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, Netherlands, Portugal, Slovakia, Slovenia, and Spain. Around 340 million individuals live in the eurozone area.

## Grasping the Eurozone

The eurozone is one of the biggest economic regions in the world and its [currency](/currency), the euro, is viewed as one of the most [liquid](/liquidasset) when compared to other people. This region's currency keeps on creating over the long haul and is taking a more noticeable position in the reserves of numerous [central banks](/centralbank). It is in many cases utilized as an illustration while examining [trilemmas](/trilemma), an economic theory that hypothesizes that nations have three options while going with choices in regards to their international monetary policies.

## History of the Eurozone

In 1992, the countries making up the [European Community (EC)](/european-community) marked the [Maastricht Treaty](/maastricht-treaty), in this way making the EU. The creation of the EU had a couple of areas of major effect — it advanced greater coordination and cooperation in policy, in general, it explicitly affected citizenship, security and defense policy, and economic policy.

As to policy, the Maastricht Treaty intended to make a common economic and monetary union, with a central banking system — the [European Central Bank](/europeancentralbank) (ECB) — and a common currency (the euro).

To do this, the treaty called for the free development of capital between the member states, which then graduated into increased cooperation between national central banks and the increased arrangement of economic policy among member states. The last step was the presentation of the euro itself, along with the implementation of a particular [monetary policy](/monetarypolicy) coming from the ECB.

## Special Considerations

In light of multiple factors, not all EU nations are members of the eurozone. Denmark has opted out from joining, in spite of the fact that it can do as such from here on out. Some EU nations have not yet met the conditions expected to join the eurozone. Different countries decide to involve their own currency as a method for keeping up with their financial independence in regards to key economic and monetary issues.

A few countries that are not EU nations have adopted the euro as their national currency. The Vatican City, Andorra, Monaco, and San Marino have monetary agreements with the EU permitting them to issue their own euro currency under certain limitations.

For an EU nation to demonstrate price stability, it must demonstrate sustainable price performance and average inflation something like 1.5 percent over the rate of the three best-performing member states. To demonstrate sound public finances, the government must run a [budget deficit](/fiscaldeficit) no greater than 3% of GDP and hold public debt no greater than 60% of GDP.

A nation's solidness of convergence is assessed through its long-term interest rates, which can't be multiple percent over the rate in the three member states with the most stable prices. In conclusion, the nation must demonstrate exchange rate stability by participating in the [Exchange Rate Mechanism](/exchange-rate-mechanism) (ERM) II for no less than two years "without extreme strains" and without degrading against the euro.
