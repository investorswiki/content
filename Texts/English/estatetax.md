# Estate Tax
## What is an estate tax?
An estate tax is imposed when the [assets](/assets) of a deceased individual are distributed to that person's [heirs](/main successor). Starting around 1916, the estate tax has been one of the major wellsprings of federal tax revenue. In any case, not very many individuals need to pay the estate tax since it just applies to estates worth huge number of dollars.
## More profound definition
At the point when a person passes on, the value of her gross estate is calculated. This commonly incorporates every last bit of her assets, both financial and real. It likewise incorporates her share of jointly owned properties and life insurance proceeds from policies they owned. Starting around 2017, each dollar in gross estate above $5.49 million is subject to an estate tax, implying that a great many people are totally [exempt](/gifttax). The [tax rate](/marginaltaxrate) is currently 40%.
On the off chance that the deceased's assets are to be distributed in view of the terms of a [will](/will), the executor of the will is responsible for presenting a special tax return to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) in the span of nine months of the person's death. She will pay the estate tax utilizing funds left by the estate. In the event that there is no executor of the estate, for example, when a person bites the dust without a will, the court will name an administrator who fills a similar need.
While most estate taxes are exacted at the federal level, many states have their own inheritance taxes. The deceased doesn't have to have lived in that frame of mind to be subject to its inheritance tax the length of she possesses registered property in the state. In those states, the exemption commonly finishes at a much lower amount.
Some [deductions](/tax-derivation) apply to the estate tax, for example, memorial service expenses, legal claims against the state, and charitable contributions.
Special provisions can reduce the estate tax or spread payments after some time on properties, for example, closely held organizations and family-owned ranches.
