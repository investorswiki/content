# Conditionally Renewable Policy
## What is conditionally renewable?
Conditionally renewable is a provision in [health insurance](/healthinsurance) policies that gives the company the right not to restore the policy because of reasons determined in the contract. Conditions shift by contract and the conditional renewal is frequently at the next premium payment period, that is to say, quarterly, every year, after second year or third year.
## More profound definition
Conditionally renewable policies benefit the insurer over the policyholder. The insurer makes and places conditions that permit the policy to be canceled or not restored on the off chance that the conditions are not met.
Once in a while, [the premium](/riskpremium) that the insured person pays might be increased on the off chance that a condition isn't met, yet the insurer can choose to let the policyholder reestablish for another period.
The conditions can't be contingent on the insured's wellbeing. All things being equal, most conditions determined in an insurance contract are connected with the insured's age or employment status.
Most working environments have insurance policies that cover disability and other labor concerns. Some of the time, on the off chance that a new position is viewed as substantially less secure than the previous job, the policyholder will be unable to restore the disability policy on the grounds that the risks are too high.
That means the medical coverage company has gauged the risks and concluded that there is a greater probability of the [policyholder](/insurance) making an injury claim due to the new work.
Conditionally renewable policies are generally offered to those insured individuals who work in high-risk occupations. These types of policies are every now and again found in group coverage circumstances.
Conditionally renewable policies generally have recognizably lower premiums than insurance policies that are noncancelable or guaranteed renewable. This is on the grounds that the insurer has a substantial amount of power to cut coverage in the event that its claims' losses arrive at a certain threshold. The lower premium is proportional to the coverage guarantees.
## Conditionally renewable model
Danny has a conditionally renewable medical coverage policy. He used to be a truck driver, however changed jobs and turned into a window cleaner on high-ascent structures. At the point when his insurance came up for renewal, the company canceled his policy since his job as a window cleaner is [substantially riskier](/risk) than that of a truck driver.

## Highlights
- Conditionally renewable policies can be stood out from noncancellable or guaranteed renewable policies, which are a more policyholder-accommodating policy option.
- Conditionally renewable policies are an insurer-accommodating policy option, as it permits the insurer greater freedom to cancel, not restore, or increase premiums on a policy under certain conditions.
- Conditionally renewable policies have below premiums on average since they offer a lower coverage guarantee.
