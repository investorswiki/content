## What Is Fixing?

Fixing is the practice of setting the price of a product as opposed to allowing it not set in stone by [free-market](/freemarket) forces. Fixing a price is illegal on the off chance that it includes [collusion](/collusion) among producers or providers.

While fixing quite often alludes to price-fixing, it might likewise apply to other related settings. For instance, the supply of a product can be fixed to keep up with its price level or push it higher.

## Figuring out Fixing

In a free market, the price of a product or not entirely settled by the [law of supply and demand](/law-of-supply-demand). Assuming the price is too high, a lot of individuals will be anxious to create it, yet couple of individuals will actually want to pay for it. On the other hand, assuming that the price is too low, scarcely any will find it advantageous to deliver, and many will be anxious to buy it. At last, financial specialists tell us, the price will settle at a figure that is acceptable to the two sides. That is the [fair market value](/fairmarketvalue).

In its classic form, price-fixing is much of the time a method for compelling consumers to pay more than they're willing to pay. It generally includes contenders getting together to subtly consent to keep their prices at a certain level, keeping away from [price competition](/competitive-estimating) that would hurt every one of them monetarily.

One more form of price-fixing is an agreement among contenders to decline to pay in excess of a set amount for a product or service. For instance, assuming at least two large hospital bunches subtly consent to pay something like a certain price for medical supplies that every one of them use, it could qualify as price-fixing.

This is illegal in the U.S. As defined by the [Federal Trade Commission](/ftc) (FTC), illegal price-fixing is a written, verbal, or construed agreement among contenders that "raises, lowers, or balances out prices or competitive terms." Such cases are sought after as infringement of antitrust laws.

## Instances of Price-Fixing

One classic illustration of price-fixing was carried out during the 1970s by the [Organization of Arab Petroleum Exporting Countries](/oapec) (OAPEC). The individuals from the organization agreed to seriously cut back on the supply of oil accessible to its customers around the world. The outcome was huge deficiencies of oil and a quadrupling of its price to consumers.

One more infamous case of price-fixing prompted a record U.S. fine. In 1999, the Swiss drug monster Roche agreed to pay $500 million, then the largest lawbreaker fine ever, to settle a price-fixing case connected with the price of nutrients. A German contender, BASF, was likewise fined, while a French company got away from a penalty due to its cooperation with the U.S. Justice Department.

## Special Considerations

A number of countries, for example, a few Caribbean and Latin American nations, peg their [currencies](/currency) to the U.S. dollar, both to ease trade and the travel industry and to safeguard their own currency stability. This form of [exchange rate fixing](/fixedexchangerate) is a completely legal part of the global economy.
