Notwithstanding silver and gold, countries have additionally incorporated supposed [bimetallic standards](/bimetallic), which permit conversion into both of the two [precious metals](/preciousmetal).

This trend was reverberated by a developing number of different countries, to such an extent that today there is definitely not a single country in the world that operates on either a silver standard or a gold standard.

Eventually, nonetheless, all countries would come to take on the fiat currency system. In the United States, the gold standard was abandoned by Richard Nixon in 1971, while the silver standard authoritatively reached a conclusion when China and Hong Kong abandoned it in 1935.
