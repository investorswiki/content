# Scheduled Recast
## What Is a Scheduled Recast?

A scheduled recast is a recalculation of the leftover payment schedule of principal and interest payments for a mortgage. A [mortgage](/mortgage) is a type of loan where a bank loans to a borrower for the purchase of a home. The recast is finished on a predetermined or scheduled date.

Some mortgage programs allow homeowners to make early payments on loans that are not completely amortizing, meaning the payments don't reduce the [principal](/principal) balance owed. Later on, at the scheduled recast date, a new [amortization](/amortization) or payment schedule is calculated in view of the principal balance at that time and the excess term (or time left to pay).

A scheduled recast is important since it assists with guaranteeing that the mortgage will be paid off toward its original term's end. In any case, a scheduled recast can bring about an increase in the payment amounts for the excess payments.

## How a Scheduled Recast Works

A [mortgage recast](/mortgagerecast) is an option remembered for certain mortgages that can bring about lower interest rates and an extension of the excess term of the mortgage. At times, a borrower could make a principal payment to reduce the loan amount outstanding. The loan payment schedule can be recast, which makes another payment schedule to mirror the reduced borrowed amount.

The payment schedule of a mortgage is called an amortization schedule when a portion of every payment is applied to the interest due and the outstanding principal balance. The scheduled recast date is the point at which the lender calculates the new payment and amortization schedule in light of the mortgage's leftover principal balance and term. At the end of the day, the leftover balance owed is spread out over the existing term of the loan to calculate the regularly scheduled payments.

On the off chance that a principal reduction payment has been made, the borrower would probably anticipate that the regularly scheduled payment should diminish following the scheduled recast of the mortgage. Many mortgage suppliers offer a scheduled recast of the payment schedule in the event that the borrower has made an extra payment to reduce the principal amount owed. In any case, lenders typically expect that the loan is on favorable terms, significance there are no late payments due.

## Scheduled Recast versus Refinancing

A mortgage recast can be a better option than [refinancing](/refinance) a mortgage. With a refinance, the current mortgage is supplanted with another mortgage loan, which is ordinarily done when interest rates in the market are lower than the original rate on the loan. Notwithstanding, since the refinancing is technically another loan, it very well may be expensive with added fees, and the loan approval relies upon the borrower's credit standing.

Then again, a mortgage recast is certainly not another loan and subsequently, needn't bother with another approval, nor a credit check of the borrower. All things being equal, the recast changes the loan payments, yet the original mortgage loan isn't supplanted.

## Scheduled Recast of Adjustable-Rate-Mortgages

[An adjustable-rate mortgage](/arm) (ARM) is a type of mortgage wherein the initial interest rate is fixed for a while, and after which, the interest rate is reset to reflect current rates in the market. There are various types of ARMs, which could allow borrowers to make interest-only payments for a period or change the size of the payments during the life of the loan.

### Payment Option ARM

Scheduled recast is common with a [payment option adjustable-rate mortgage](/paymentoptionarm). A payment-option ARM is a month to month adjusting ARM, which allows the borrower to pick among the following:

- Several regularly scheduled payment options, including a 30-or 40-year completely amortizing payment
- A 15-year completely amortizing payment
- An interest-only payment
- A base payment, or a payment of any amount greater than the base

Payment-option ARMs have a feature that allows for the accrual of deferred interest. The deferred interest made at every payment date is added to the principal balance of the mortgage. This is known as negative amortization. Frequently, toward the finish of the fifth year, there is a scheduled recast date. On this recast date, the amortization schedule is recalculated so that, in view of the leftover principal balance and the [fully indexed interest rate](/fullyindexedinterestrate) at that point, the future payments will amortize the mortgage over its excess term.

### Scheduled Recasts and Higher Monthly Payments

Adjustable-rate mortgages, including payment-option ARMs, allow borrowers to make more modest payments, which can assist with affordability. Notwithstanding, the overall debt or mortgage amount owed can develop substantially after some time. For instance, on the off chance that the payments don't pay down any of the principal, the interest on the debt holds building to the point where the loan balance increases. Subsequently, the scheduled recast could lead to a higher mortgage payment to pay off the loan in time.

## Capabilities for a Scheduled Recast

Not all mortgages fit the bill for recasting. In practically all cases, a mortgage can't be recast except if it is backed by Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac, which are federally-backed home mortgage organizations that guarantee mortgage loans for lenders.

Loans backed by the [Federal Housing Administration](/fhaloan) (FHA), which will quite often help low-income, first-time homebuyers, and [Veterans Administration](/valoan) (VA) loans are not eligible for a mortgage recast. Nonetheless, there is an exception on account of a [loan modification](/loan_modification), which is a change to the terms of the loan â€” generally when the borrower can't repay the loan. USDA Rural Development loans in all actuality do allow for recasting the whole loan.

During a scheduled mortgage recasting, an individual pays a large sum toward their principal, and their mortgage is then recalculated in view of the new balance. That principal contribution amount must meet or surpass the base requirement of 10% of the current balance owed. Borrowers are ordinarily given the opportunity to recast their mortgage once during the term of the loan. Be that as it may, a few lenders offer extra recasts in the event that another principal payment is made later in the life of the loan.
