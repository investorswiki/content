# Price-Weighted Index
## What Is a Price-Weighted Index?

A price-weighted index is a [stock index](/index) in which each company remembered for the index makes up a negligible part of the total index proportional to that company's share stock price per share. In its simplest form, adding the price of each stock in the index and isolating by the total number of companies decides the index's [value](/value).

A stock with a higher price will be given more weight than a stock with a lower price and will consequently impact the index's performance.

## Understanding a Price-Weighted Index

In a price-weighted index, a [stock](/stock) that increments from $110 to $120 will affect the index as a stock that increments from $10 to $20, even however the percentage move for the last option is far greater than that of the higher-priced stock. Higher-priced stocks apply a greater influence on the index's, or the [basket's](/bin), overall bearing.

To work out the value of a simple price-weighted index, find the sum of the share prices of the individual companies, and separation by the number of companies. In certain averages, this divisor is adjusted to keep up with continuity in the event of stock splits or changes to the rundown of companies remembered for the index.

Price-weighted indexes are helpful in light of the fact that the index value will be equivalent to (or if nothing else proportionate to) the average stock price for the companies remembered for the index. This permits the construction of indexes that will follow the average stock price performance of a specific sector or market.

One of the most well known price-weighted stocks is the [Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA)](/djia), which comprises of 30 distinct stocks, or parts. In this index, the higher-price stocks move the index more than those with lower prices, hence the price-weighted assignment. The Nikkei 225 is one more illustration of a price-weighted index.

## Other Weighted Indexes

Notwithstanding price-weighted indexes, other fundamental types of weighted indexes incorporate [value-weighted indexes](/capitalizationweightedindex) and [unweighted indexes](/unweightedindex). For a value-weighted index, similar to those in the MSCI family of strategy indexes, the number of outstanding shares is a factor. To decide the weight of each stock in a value-weighted index, the price of the stock is duplicated by the number of shares outstanding.

For instance, if Stock A has five million outstanding shares and is trading at $15, then, at that point, its weight in the index is $75 million. Assuming that Stock B is trading at $30, however just has 1,000,000 outstanding shares, its weight is $30 million. Thus, in a value-weighted index, Stock A would have more say in how the index moves than Stock B.

In an unweighted index, all stocks samely affect the index, regardless of their share [volume](/volume) or [price](/provided cost estimate). Any price change in the index depends on the return percentage of every part. For instance, if Stock An is up 30%, Stock B is up 20%, and Stock C is up 10%, the index is up 20%, or (30 + 20 + 10)/3 (i.e., the number of stocks in the index).

Different types of weighted indexes incorporate revenue-weighted, [fundamentally weighted](/fundamentally_weighted_index), and float-adjusted. All have their up-sides and negatives, contingent upon the financial backer's objectives and market information.

## Features
- Price-weighted indexes give greater weight to stocks with higher prices in terms of their contribution to the index value and changes in the index.
- A price-weighted index can be utilized to follow the average stock price of a given market or industry.
- In a price-weighted stock index, each company's stock is weighted by its price per share, and the index is an average of the share prices of the relative multitude of companies.
