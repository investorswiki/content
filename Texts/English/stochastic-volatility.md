# Stochastic Volatility
## What Is Stochastic Volatility?

Stochastic volatility (SV) alludes to the way that the [volatility](/volatility) of asset prices shifts and isn't steady, as is assumed in the [Black Scholes](/blackscholes) options pricing model. Stochastic volatility modeling endeavors to address for this problem with Black Scholes by permitting volatility to change over the long haul.

## Figuring out Stochastic Volatility

"Stochastic" means that some variable not set in stone and can't be anticipated unequivocally. Notwithstanding, a likelihood distribution can be discovered all things considered. With regards to financial modeling, [stochastic modeling](/stochastic-modeling) emphasizes with successive values of a [random variable](/random-variable) that are non-independent from each other. What non-independent means is that while the value of the variable will change randomly, its starting point will be dependent on its previous value, which was consequently dependent on its value prior to that, etc; this depicts a purported [random walk](/randomwalktheory).

Instances of stochastic models incorporate the [Heston model](/heston-model) and SABR model for pricing options, and the [GARCH](/garch) model utilized in breaking down time-series data where the variance mistake is accepted to be sequentially [autocorrelated](/autocorrelation).

The volatility of an asset is a key part to pricing options. Stochastic volatility models were developed out of a need to change the Black Scholes model for pricing options, which failed to successfully take the way that the volatility of the price of the [underlying security](/underlying-security) can change into account. The Black Scholes model rather makes the improving on assumption that the volatility of the underlying security was consistent. Stochastic volatility models right for this by permitting the price volatility of the underlying security to change as a [random variable](/random-variable). By permitting the price to shift, the stochastic volatility models worked on the exactness of estimations and gauges.

## The Heston Stochastic Volatility Model

The Heston Model is a stochastic volatility model made by finance researcher Steven Heston in 1993. The Model purposes the assumption that volatility is pretty much random and has the following attributes that recognize it from other stochastic volatility models:

- It factors in the correlation between an asset's price and its volatility.
- It comprehends volatility as [reverting to the mean](/meanreversion).
- It gives a shut structure solution, meaning that the response is derived from an accepted set of mathematical operations.
- It doesn't need that stock price follow a [lognormal](/log-ordinary distribution) likelihood distribution.

The Heston Model likewise consolidates a [volatility smile](/volatilitysmile), which takes into consideration more implied volatility to be weighted to downside strike relative to upside [strikes](/strikeprice). The "smile" name is due to the curved state of these volatility differentials when diagramed.

## Features
- Stochastic models that let volatility change randomly, for example, the Heston model endeavor to address for this blind spot.
- Numerous fundamental options pricing models, for example, Black Scholes accepts steady volatility, which makes shortcomings and errors in pricing.
- Stochastic volatility is a concept that takes into consideration the way that asset price volatility changes after some time and isn't consistent.
