# Prepackaged Bankruptcy
## What Is Prepackaged Bankruptcy?

A prepackaged bankruptcy is a plan for financial reorganization that a company prepares in cooperation with its creditors that will produce results once the company enters [Chapter 11](/chapter11). The aim of a prepackaged bankruptcy — which must be decided on by shareholders before the company records its petition for bankruptcy — is to save expenses and abbreviate the [turnaround](/turnaround) time to rise up out of bankruptcy.

## How Prepackaged Bankruptcy Works

The thought behind a prepackaged bankruptcy plan is to abbreviate and work on the bankruptcy cycle to set aside the company cash in legal and accounting fees, as well as the amount of time spent in bankruptcy protection. A proactive company in distress will tell its creditors that wish to arrange terms of bankruptcy before it records for protection in court.

These [creditors](/creditor) — loan specialists, inventory providers, service suppliers — normally could do without the distressed situation of the company, yet will work with it to limit time and expenses associated with bankruptcy reorganizations. Creditors are bound to be managable during the exchanges to modify terms since they will have a voice before the bankruptcy filing. The alternative would be a surprise and afterward a scramble to deal with the delinquent [debtor](/debtor) with more vulnerability about what amount of time the cycle will require.

A company and its creditors can expect a resolution inside a lot more limited time span under a prepackaged bankruptcy than a conventional one. Three to nine months is commonplace. The sooner the company can rise out of bankruptcy, the sooner it can carry out its reorganization trying to return to solid business operations.
