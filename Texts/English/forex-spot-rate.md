# Forex Spot Rate
## What Is the Forex Spot Rate?

The forex spot rate is the current [exchange rate](/exchangerate) at which a currency pair can be bought or sold. It is the predominant quote for some random currency pair from a forex broker. In forex currency trading it is the rate that most traders use while trading with an online retail [forex broker](/currency-trading-forex-brokers).

## Understanding the Forex Spot Rate

The forex [spot rate](/spot_rate) is the most normally quoted price for currency pairs. It is the basis of the most frequent transaction in the forex market, an individual forex trade. This rate is substantially more widely distributed than rates for [forward exchange contracts (FECs)](/forward-exchange-contract) or forex swaps. The spot forex rate contrasts from the [forward rate](/forwardrate) in that it prices the value of currencies compared to foreign currencies today, rather than sooner or later.

In 2019, the global forex spot market had a daily turnover of more than $6.6 trillion, which makes it greater in nominal terms than both the equity and bond market. Rates are established in continuous, real-time distributed quotes by the small group of large banks that trade the [interbank rate](/interbankmarket). From that point, rates are distributed by forex brokers around the world.

Spot rates don't take into account forex contract delivery. Forex contract delivery is sideways to most retail forex traders, but brokers deal with the utilization of currency futures contracts, which support their trading operations. The brokers need to roll those contracts every month or week, and they give the costs to their customers.

In this manner, forex dealers bring about costs dealing with their risk while giving liquidity to their customers. Most often they utilize the [bid-ask dealing spread](/bid-askspread) and a lower [rollover credit](/rollover-credit) (or higher rollover debit, contingent upon the currency pair you hold and whether you are long or short) to offset those costs.

## Delivery of Forex Contracts

The standard delivery time for a forex spot rate is T+2 days. Ought to a counterparty wish to defer delivery, they should take out a forward contract. Most of the time it is the forex dealers that need to deal with this. For instance, if an EUR/USD trade is executed at 1.1550, this will be the rate at which the currencies are exchanged on the spot date. Notwithstanding, assuming European interest rates are lower than they are in the U.S., this rate will be adjusted higher to account for this difference. So if either a dealer or their counterparty wishes to claim EUR and short USD for a while it will cost them more than the spot rate. It ought to be noted that spot rate delivery times are not standard and may shift for certain pairs.

Although the forex spot rate calls for delivery within two days, this rarely happens in the trading community. Retail traders that hold a position for longer than two days will have their trades "reset" by the broker, i.e., closed and returned at a similar price, just prior to the two-day cutoff time. Nonetheless, when these currencies are rolled there will be a premium or discount attached as an increased rollover fee. The size of this fee relies upon the difference in interest rates, through the short-term FX swap.

Since the spot rate is the rate of delivery with no adjustment for interest rate differential, it is the rate quoted in the retail market.

## Forward Rates

Not at all like a spot contract, a forward contract, or futures contract, includes an agreement of contract terms on the current date with the delivery and payment at a predetermined future date. Contrary to a spot rate, a forward rate is utilized to quote a financial transaction that takes place on a future date and is the settlement price of a forward contract. In any case, contingent upon the security being traded, the forward rate can be calculated utilizing the spot rate. Once calculated, it is adjusted for the cost of carry to determine the future interest rate that equates the total return of a longer-term investment with a strategy of rolling over a shorter-term investment.
