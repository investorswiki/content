# Distributing Syndicate
## DEFINITION of Distributing Syndicate

Distributing syndicate is a group of investment banks that cooperate to sell a [initial public offering](/ipo) (IPO) of stock or different securities to the market. Investment banks frequently form syndicates while working on large securities offerings to reduce risk and to increase the speed and productivity of selling the securities to investors. This is particularly true on account of [firm commitment](/firmcommitment) offerings, where the primary underwriter might open itself to inventory risk in the event that the full offering can't be sold by its own group of salespersons. The underwriter will form a [syndicate](/syndicate) to market the new securities and pay these different banks that disseminate them.

## BREAKING DOWN Distributing Syndicate

At the point when a large offering is involved, heavyweight investment banks that act as lead [underwriters](/underwriter) like JP Morgan Chase, Bank of America Merrill Lynch and Goldman Sachs regularly decide to form syndicates to serve their clients. Distributing syndicates are of particular significance to more modest investment banks. These "[boutique](/boutique)" banks would be unable to endorse numerous IPOs since they lack the capacity to sell large offerings alone. Further, a boutique bank would simply have the option to deal with each or two offerings in turn. Banding together as part of a syndicate permits boutique banks to deal with several offerings all the while, take on larger offerings and all the more successfully rival large investment banks.

## Distributing Syndicate Process

At the point when a company starts working with a lead underwriter to prepare securities for the market, whether stocks, bonds or different types of securities, the underwriter thinks about the number of other investment that banks would be expected to market and disseminate the securities in the planned time period. The underwriter then chooses different banks it accepts is best capable of smooth distribution. These banks then contact their clients to acquire "[indications of interest](/ioi)" in the new offering. The [ballpark figures](/ballpark-figure) are conveyed and refreshed to the underwriter leading up the issuance date. In light of these numbers, the underwriter then allots parts of the whole securities offering to the distributing syndicate at or around the issuance date.
