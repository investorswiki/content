## What Is a Land Trust?

Land trusts are living trusts that take into account the management of property while alive. Notwithstanding, as different types of trusts, each land trust's terms are unique and can be tailored to individual necessities.

## How a Land Trust Works

Land trusts, which are trusts tied to real estate, are frequently utilized for estate planning. It's intended to be utilized during your lifetime for overseeing properties. They are revocable trusts, meaning they can be terminated or changed. Land trusts can incorporate real estate (for example structures or homes) or property notes and mortgages.

Land trusts have three key parts — the grantor, trustee, and [beneficiary](/beneficiary). The grantor is who makes the trust and [transfers the property](/trust-property). The trustee deals with the trust and the beneficiary is the one that benefits from the land trust.

Grantors handle how the transferring of assets into the trust and sets the terms of the trust. Trustees handle the personal subtleties of the property.

## Types of Land Trusts

There are two key types of land trusts — title-holding and preservation land trusts. Title-holding trusts permit individuals or elements to namelessly hold land. The big difference with a preservation land trust is that the owner must surrender some land use and development rights.

### Title-Holding Land Trust

To avoid this law, affluent businessmen and legislators would utilize land trusts to purchase land namelessly, along these lines protecting their voting rights.

### Preservation Land Trust

Preservation land trusts expect that the property owner surrender a few rights over land use and development. The goal of a preservation land trust is to protect untamed life, historical or social locales, and natural resources from commercial development or different activities that might lead to disruption or pollution.

## Requirements for a Title-Holding Land Trust

In a title-holding land trust, the landowner signs a document called a Deed in Trust, which transfers legal ownership of the property. While setting up the trust, the landowner (who is both the trust grantor and the beneficiary) can indicate how the land is to be managed, who has control over it, and how any income it produces is distributed. This means that while the trust is the title-holder on paper, the landowner keeps up with complete control over the property.

Title-holding trusts are utilized as a way for property owners to keep up with obscurity and keep significant assets out of probate. They can likewise provide a number of other estate planning benefits and protect assets from decisions or liens. This can be especially helpful for the extremely rich, superstars, and large companies who might need to keep development plans hush.

## Requirements for a Conservation Land Trust

In a protection land trust, the trust doesn't be guaranteed to assume control over the land title except if the property is given completely. All things being equal, a landowner can go into a legally binding agreement, called a protection [easement](/easement), subsequently "giving" their development rights to the trust. The trust is entrusted with guaranteeing the easement is enforced and, at times, dealing with the property.

Preservation easements can be tailored so the landowner holds ownership and use rights —, for example, the right to keep cultivating or raising animals — while as yet guaranteeing that the land stays undeveloped in perpetuity. Preservation easements "follow the land," and that means that the terms of the easement stay in force even assuming the land is sold or passed to heirs.
