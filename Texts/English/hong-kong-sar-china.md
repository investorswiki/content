# Hong Kong SAR, China
## What Is the Hong Kong SAR?

Hong Kong is the head financial and business center in China and a regional financial leader. Hong Kong is one of China's [special administrative regions (SARs)](/special-administrative-region). A SAR is a generally autonomous regions inside the People's Republic of China that keep up with separate legal, administrative, and judicial systems from the remainder of the country.

## Breaking Down Hong Kong SAR, China

Hong Kong is a special administrative region (SAR) that exists as part of the People's Republic of China under the "One Country, Two Systems" doctrine, negotiated in the Sino-British Joint Declaration, negotiated and endorsed in 1984, yet producing results in 1997. The "One Country, Two Systems" doctrine stipulated that the People's Republic of China's communist system wouldn't be drilled in Hong Kong, and Hong Kong would keep up with its political and economic semi independence for a considerable length of time after the transfer of power, until 2047.

What's the significance here? Since July 1, 1997, when the United Kingdom transferred power of Hong Kong to China, Hong Kong has kept a separate political and economic system from China — democratic(ish), and capitalist — and a separate currency (the[ Hong Kong Dollar, HKD$](/hkd-hong-kong-dollars)). Hong Kong holds free executive, legislative and legal executive powers, in all matters other than military defense and foreign affairs. English and Chinese are the two official dialects.

## Hong Kong's Economy

Hong Kong has been positioned as the world's freest economy in the Heritage's [Index of Economic Freedom](/index-of-economic-freedom) since the index's commencement in 1995. In 1990, [Milton Friedman](/milton-friedman) composed that it was maybe the best illustration of a free market economy. The service economy in Hong Kong is described essentially by low taxation, close to free port trade, and a deep rooted international financial market. Service economy, here, meaning an economy that isn't industrial, or manufacturing based, however is rather based in financial services, wellbeing, and human services, cordiality, data technology, and so forth.

Furthermore, utilizing its political and economic independence, Hong Kong has situated itself as the place where international and Chinese businesses figure out something worth agreeing on. It is likewise viewed as the principal financial center in China. Subsequently, in excess of 1,300 companies from everywhere the world are settled in Hong Kong.

This popularity based government and the free market has been fruitful, somewhat. It's the world's 33rd biggest economy with a population more modest than the city of Tokyo, at 7.34 million. Hong Kong has an annual GDP of $320.9 billion, giving it the world's seventeenth most elevated GDP per capita, at $43,681.

## Hong Kong and China's Tension

By and large, China has had significant incentive to shun meddling in Hong Kong's political and economic systems. At the transfer of power in 1997, Hong Kong, with a population of 6.5 million at that point, had an economy one fifth the size of the Chinese economy, with its population of 1 billion.

This is not true anymore. Throughout recent years, Hong Kong's economy has deteriorated, changing next to no in cosmetics, with GDP development slowing, and inequality rising altogether. In that equivalent time, China has turned into an economic superpower. Hong Kong presently accounts for only 3% of Chinese GDP.

A think that the most serious risk to Hong Kong's independence is political and business elites in the region ceding it to the Liaison Office, to eliminate political strains from the region, and return Hong Kong to an economic city. This might demonstrate a poor decision however, as a marriage of business and government has proven counterproductive in Hong Kong, leading to an increase conflicts of interest and cronyism, also a non-responsive government, that won't widen its tax base, or lower property taxes, and hosts excluded political get-togethers from majority rule participation. All of this has prompted a public impression of the Hong Kong SAR government as not generally so real as it used to be.

Given these recent trends, the Liaison Office, the People's Republic of China representative in Hong Kong, has been doing whatever it may take to increase its influence and clout in the region, meddling in both domestic affairs and decisions meaningfully. For instance, the Liaison Office gives advances, purchased Hong Kong's biggest distributing house (eliminating titles critical of the Communist Party), and campaigned for Hong Kong's new chief executive, Carrie Lam.
