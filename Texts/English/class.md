Owners of companies that have been [privately owned](/privately-owned) and open up to the world frequently make class An and B share structures with various voting rights to keep up with control as well as to make the company a more troublesome target for a takeover. Two of the primary types of stock are common shares, addressing the majority of shares accessible across the market, and preferred stock, which ordinarily guarantee a fixed dividend yet don't have voting rights.

The multi-class share structure at Google happened because of the company's restructuring into Alphabet Inc. in October 2015 (NASDAQ: GOOG). Founders Sergey Brin and Larry Page found themselves claiming not as much as majority ownership of the company's stock, yet wished to keep up with control over major business choices. The company made three share classes of the company's stock subsequently. Class-A shares are held by normal investors and carry one vote for every share. [Class-B shares](/classbshares), held fundamentally by Brin and Page, have 10 votes for every share. [Class-C shares](/cshare) are ordinarily held by employees and have no voting rights.
