# A-/A3
## What Is A-/A3?

A-/A3 are a pair of rating categories issued by two different rating agencies, Moody's and S&P, to reflect long-term investment grade bond creditworthiness. Both A-and A3 address medium-level [investment grade](/investmentgrade) credit ratings for a debt issuer or a debt instrument.

## Understanding A-/A3

The [credit ratings](/creditrating) assigned by the various rating agencies are based primarily upon the safety net provider's or alternately issuer's creditworthiness; one might say, they are a quantified assessment of the [creditworthiness](/credit-value) of a borrower. A-and A3, similar to all ratings, can be deciphered as a direct measure of the probability of default. In any case, credit stability and priority of payment are also factored into the rating.

A-/A3 ratings are issued to long-term bond issuers by [Moody's](/moodys) and S&P, individually. The rating of the issuer designates the creditworthiness of the issuer. A-/A3 is the seventh-highest rating a debt issuer can receive. Four rankings above the cutoff separates investment grade debt from high-yield, or non-investment grade debt.

The A-/A3 rating connotes that the issuer or carrier has for the most part financial backing and some [cash reserves](/cash-reserves). The risk of [default](/default2) for investors or policyholders is somewhat low.

A-/A3 is a credit rating in the investment grade credit ranking system. The rankings for Moody's and S&P from highest to lowest in the investment grade category are [Aaa/AAA](/aaa), Aa1/AA+, [Aa2/AA](/a-a2), Aa3/AA-, [A1/A+](/a-a1), A2/A, A3/A-, Baa1/BBB+, Baa2/BBB and Baa3/BBB-.

## Example of A-/A3 Rating

XYZ Corp is hoping to raise capital by giving [long-term debt](/longtermdebt). It creates a consumer product that used to be popular yet has lost [market share](/marketshare) as of late, and the company's revenues have been contracting.

XYZ is encountering decreased [free cash flow](/freecashflow) and its balance sheet fundamentals are weakening. Be that as it may, the company actually has a great record of servicing its debt. Thus, Moody's and S&P rank XYZ's debt A-/A3.

## Special Considerations: Credit Downgrades

Investors ought to know that an agency [downgrade](/downgrade) of a company's bonds from "BBB" to "BB" reclassifies its debt from investment grade to "[junk](/junkbond)" status. Although this is just a one-step drop in credit rating, the repercussions can be serious.

The drop to junk status telegraphs that a company may battle to pay its debts. The downgraded status can make it even more hard for companies to source financing options, causing a downward spiral as [costs of capital](/costofcapital) increase.

## Highlights
- A-/A3 are medium investment grade credit ratings offered by Moody's and Standard and Poor's.
- The two ratings mean that the issuer has financial backing and some cash reserves with a low risk of default.
- A-/A3 is the seventh-highest rating a debt issuer can receive and is four rankings above the cutoff for junk bonds.
