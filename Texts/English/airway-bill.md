An air waybill (AWB), otherwise called an air consignment note, is a type of [bill of lading](/billoflading). In any case, an AWB serves a comparable function to ocean bills of lading, however an AWB is issued in non-negotiable form, importance there's less protection with an AWB versus bills of lading.

## Air Waybill (AWB) versus Bill of Landing

AWBs are not normal for different bills of lading, in that they are non-negotiable instruments, implying that it doesn't determine on which flight the shipment will be sent, or when it will arrive at its objective. [Bills of lading](/billoflading) are legal documents between the transporter of goods and the carrier, itemizing the type, quantity, and objective of the goods being carried.

Bills of lading likewise act as a receipt of shipment when the goods are delivered at a foreordained objective. This document goes with the goods and is endorsed by authorized agents of the transporter, the carrier, and the beneficiary. Be that as it may, in contrast to a bill of landing, an air waybill (AWB) is non-negotiable. Being [non-negotiable,](/nonnegotiable) the AWB is a contract just for transportation and doesn't cover the merchandise value.

## Requirements for an Air Waybill

Every airline AWB must incorporate the carrier's name, head office address, logo, and air waybill number. Neutral air waybills have a similar design and format as airline AWBs; they just aren't prepopulated.

An air waybill has 11 numbers and accompanied eight duplicates of changing varieties. With the Multilateral Electronic Air Waybill Resolution 672, paper air waybills are not generally required. Named the e-AWB, it's been being used beginning around 2010 and turned into the default contract for all air cargo shipments on empowered trade lines starting around 2019.
