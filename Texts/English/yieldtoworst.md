# Yield to Worst (YTW)
## What Is Yield to Worst (YTW)?

Yield to most terrible is a measure of the least conceivable [yield](/yield) that can be received on a bond that fully operates inside the terms of its contract without defaulting. A type of yield is referred to when a bond has provisions that would permit the issuer to close it out before it develops. Exiting the workforce of the bond could be forced through maybe one or two provisions point by point in the bond's contract â€” most usually callability.

The yield to most terrible measurement is utilized to assess the worst situation imaginable for yield at the earliest reasonable retirement date. YTW assists investors with overseeing risks and guarantee that specific income requirements will in any case be met even in the most terrible scenarios.

## Understanding Yield to Worst

A [bond's](/bond) YTW is calculated in view of the earliest call or retirement date. It is assumed that a prepayment of principal happens assuming a bond issuer utilizes the call option. After the call, principal is generally returned and coupon payments are stopped. An issuer will probably exercise their callable option in the event that yields are falling and the issuer can get a lower [coupon rate](/coupon-rate) through new issuance in the current market environment.

The YTW may likewise be known as the [yield to call](/yieldtocall) (YTC). To recognize the YTW, yield to call and yield to maturity ought to both be calculated. As a general rule, YTW might be equivalent to yield to maturity, yet it can never be higher since it addresses yield for the investor at a prior prepayment date than the full maturity. YTW is the least conceivable return an investor can accomplish from holding a specific bond that fully operates inside its contract without defaulting. YTW isn't associated with defaults, which are various scenarios out and out.

## The Mechanics

The yield to call is an annual rate of return expecting a bond is recovered by the issuer at the earliest suitable callable date. A bond is callable on the off chance that the issuer has the privilege to reclaim it prior to the maturity date. YTW is the lower of the yield to call or yield to maturity. A [put provision](/put-provision) gives the investor the right to sell the bond back to the company at a certain price at a predetermined date. There is a yield to put, yet this doesn't factor into the YTW on the grounds that it is the investor's option on whether to sell the bond.

The equation for working out YTC is the accompanying:

- **YTC** = (coupon interest payment + (call price - market value) \u00f7 number of years until call) \u00f7 (( call price + market value ) \u00f7 2 )

## Examining Yields

Yields are typically consistently reported in annual terms. On the off chance that a bond isn't [callable](/callablebond), the yield to maturity is the most important and fitting yield for investors to utilize in light of the fact that there is no yield to call.

[Yield to maturity](/yieldtomaturity) is calculated from the accompanying equation:

In the event that a bond is callable, it becomes important to check the YTW out. The yield to maturity will continuously be higher than the YTW (YTC) in light of the fact that the investor acquires more when they hold the bond for its full maturity. The YTW is important however on the grounds that it gives further due diligence on a bond with a [call provision](/callprovision). The more limited time period a bond is held for, the less the investor procures. YTW gives a reasonable calculation of this potential scenario showing the most reduced yield conceivable.

A few different types of yield that an investor could likewise need to consider include: running yield and nominal yield.

## Features
- Yield to most obviously terrible is in many cases equivalent to yield to call.
- Yield to most terrible must continuously be not as much as yield to maturity since it addresses a return for an abbreviated investment period.
- Yield to most terrible is a measure of the least conceivable yield that can be received on a bond with an exit from the workforce provision.
