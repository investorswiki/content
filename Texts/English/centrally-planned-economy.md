## Analysis of Centrally Planned Economies

One major critique, associated with [Friedrich Hayek](/friedrich-hayek), is that central planners can't efficiently answer supply and demand. In a market economy, businesses answer price announces expanding or decreasing the production of their goods.

In a planned economy, there are no price signals, so planners can't precisely forecast which products will be required or adjust to evolving conditions. This means that there might be pointless deficiencies or overflows of certain goods.

Another critique is that command economies might be less efficient, due to the lack of competitive pressures. While private companies must keep away from squander to stay beneficial, enterprises in a command economy have no pressure to earn profits or reduce expenses.
