# General Order (GO)
## What Is a General Order (GO)?

A general order (GO) is a status given to [imported](/import) goods that are missing the legitimate documentation or won't be easily cleared through customs for different reasons. Merchandise might be held under broad order if the legitimate duties, fees, or interest are not paid, in the event that the owner neglects to complete the required customs desk work, or on the other hand in the event that it isn't accurately or legally invoiced. Goods will be held under broad order in the event that they stay uncleared for over 15 days.

## Grasping General Orders (GOs)

Following 15 days, any broad order merchandise will be moved to a Class 11 reinforced warehouse under the authority set forward in Title 19, United States Code (U.S.C.), section 1555. The risk of transportation and storage of the goods stays with the owner of the merchandise.

Assuming the goods stay under broad order for over six months, the merchandise will be seized by the government or put up for an auction run by the U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) agency. Live auctions happen every month online (from one side of the country to the other) or at public scenes like a lodging found close to ports. Auctions are available to anybody with the exception of CBP employees and their immediate family individuals. Bidders must place down a $5,000 deposit to take part. Purchases are nonrefundable and the purchasers are responsible for picking up the merchandise.

> The port of entry or company that initially gets the goods into the United States is responsible for letting U.S. Customs know in the span of 20 days of appearance that unclaimed or mistakenly reported things are being held â€” dependent upon a fine of up to $1,000.
