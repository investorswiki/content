# Energy Sector
## What Is the Energy Sector?

The energy [sector](/sector) is a category of stocks that connect with delivering or supplying energy. The energy sector or industry incorporates companies associated with the exploration and development of oil or gas reserves, oil and gas drilling, and refining. The energy industry additionally incorporates integrated power utility companies like renewable energy and coal.

## Understanding the Energy Sector

 The energy sector is a large and sweeping term that depicts a complex and between related network of companies, straightforwardly and by implication, engaged with the production and distribution of energy expected to power the economy and work with the means of production and transportation.

The companies inside the energy sector are engaged with different types of energy. Generally, energy companies are many times classified based on how the energy that they produce is obtained and will commonly fall into one of two categories:

### Non-renewable
- Petroleum products and oil
- Natural gas
- Gasoline
- Diesel fuel
- Heating oil
- Nuclear

### Renewable
- Hydropower
- Biofuels like ethanol
- Wind power
- Sunlight based power

The energy industry additionally incorporates secondary sources like electricity. Energy prices — alongside the earnings performance of energy producers — are largely driven by the supply and demand for worldwide energy.

Oil and gas producers will generally perform well during periods of raised oil and gas prices. Nonetheless, energy companies earn less when the price of energy commodities falls. Oil purifiers, then again, benefit from the falling cost of feedstock to deliver petroleum products like gasoline when crude oil prices drop. Moreover, the energy industry is sensitive to political occasions, which generally have prompted unpredictability — or wild vacillations — in the price of oil.

Probably the largest companies in the U.S. energy sector incorporate Exxon Mobil (XOM) and Chevron (CVX), the two of which are large international integrated oil companies. In 2020, Peabody Energy (BTU) was America's largest coal producer estimated by lots of output.

How investors decide to invest in the energy sector will probably rely upon their inclinations and specific perspectives about the growth and earnings possibilities of the different companies. The energy industry is greater and diversified than only the oil and gas industry. Numerous investors accept renewable and alternative energy sources will play an important job from now on, particularly as the demand for electric cars keeps on developing.
