A social impact statement — otherwise called [corporate social responsibility (CSR)](/corp-social-responsibility) statement — is a report or press release issued by a company that frames the means it has taken to work on the social and environmental standards of its business operations. Many companies will issue these statements one time each year, delivering them alongside their [annual reports](/annualreport) to shareholders.

All essentially, the consumer products goliath Procter and Gamble (PG) has a stated mission of powering its plants with 100% renewable energy sources, alongside a record of other aggressive environmental goals. Maybe the most impressive of these goals is the company's stated goal of delivering 15 billion liters of clean drinking water through its [non-benefit organization](/non-profitorganization), Children's Safe Drinking Water.

This program, which was ignited by a creation by a Procter and Gamble [research and development (R&D)](/randd) scientist which permits utilized clothing water to be quickly changed over into clean drinking water, initially set out to deliver 15 billion liters by 2020.
