# Liability Swap
## What Is a Liability Swap?

A liability swap is a [financial derivative](/derivative) consisting of a [interest rate swap](/interestrateswap) (IRS) or currency swap used to change the interest rate exposure or the currency risk exposure assumed by a party to the transaction emerging from liability from exposure to a specific interest rate structure or foreign currency exposure.

The terms and structure of a liability swap are basically equivalent to they are for a [asset swap](/assetswap). The difference is that with a liability swap the gatherings' separate liability exposures linked to a given liability are being exchanged, decreasing the gatherings' risk exposure to the interest rate or the currency, while an asset swap exchanges exposure to an asset. The term "swap" can allude to the derivative itself or the derivative plus the package wherein it is traded.

## Understanding Liability Swaps

Most swaps include cash flows in light of a [notional principal amount](/notionalprincipalamount). Typically, the principal doesn't change hands. One [cash flow](/cashflow) is fixed, while the other is variable, that is to say, in view of a benchmark interest rate, floating currency exchange rate, or index price.

In effect, with an interest rate swap, one stream of fixed interest payments is exchanged for an alternate stream of floating interest payments. In a currency swap, the gatherings are trading the principal amount of a loan and its interest in one currency for the principal and interest in another currency, initially at the current market or [spot rate](/spot_rate). Swaps can be outstanding for long periods, making certainty in the number of payments that an entity should make toward the finish of the swap.

Swaps don't trade on exchanges, and retail investors typically don't take part in swaps. All things being equal, swaps are modified [over-the-counter](/otc) (OTC) contracts negotiated between businesses or financial institutions as private gatherings. Liability swaps are utilized to exchange a fixed (or floating rate) debt for a floating (or fixed) debt. The two gatherings included are trading cash outflows.

For instance, a bank might swap a 3% debt obligation in exchange for a floating rate obligation of the [London Interbank Offered Rate](/libor) (LIBOR) plus 0.5%. LIBOR may currently be 2.5%, so the fixed and floating rates are a similar right at this point. Over time, however, the floating rate might change. Assuming LIBOR increments to 3%, presently the floating rate on the swap is 3.5%, and the party that locked in the floating rate is currently paying something else for that liability.

On the off chance that LIBOR moves the other way, the party will be paying short of what it was initially (3%). It ought to be noticed that since December 2021, the financial markets have been participated in a transition away from utilizing LIBOR. The United States, for instance, will utilize the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR). The concepts beyond the utilization of LIBOR continue as before for the utilization of SOFR.

Principal amounts are not ordinarily exchanged, and the liabilities don't change hands. Therefore, changes in the interest rate over time are managed by making netting settlements at standard stretches or when the swap lapses. As the counterparties set the terms of the swap, they make the transaction terms to which the two players concur.

## Benefits of Liability Swaps

Businesses and financial institutions use liability swaps to modify whether the rate they pay on liabilities is floating or fixed. They might wish to do this assuming they accept interest rates will change and they need to benefit from that change possibly.

Gatherings may likewise go into a liability swap so the idea of the liability (fixed or floating) matches up more closely with their assets, which might create fixed or floating cash flows. Swaps can likewise be utilized to hedge.

Businesses likewise use liability swaps to get the benefits of hedging a risk exposure. A hedged risk frequently conveys a lower interest rate and gets certain types of preferred accounting treatment.

## Limitations of Liability Swaps

Liability swaps are neither perfect nor risk-free. In the first place, swaps are profoundly illiquid financial instruments. Not at all like exchange-traded futures which are effectively traded or liquidated, swaps are contracts negotiated and placed into by private gatherings. The legalities engaged with trading the "proprietorship" interests in such a contract are complex and likely not worth the difficulty.

Likewise with any contract between private gatherings, swaps additionally feature counterparty risk. In an exchange environment, for example, in interest rate futures contracts, there is a third-party, for example, a clearinghouse, that expects the counterparty risk of the two sides to a transaction. While ISDA gives certain functions to swap market participants, as seen below, it's anything but a clearinghouse and doesn't expect counterparty risk.

Foreign currency futures and interest rate futures, when traded on an exchange, are profoundly liquid and have next to zero counterparty or default risk. Swaps really do feature default and counterparty risk.

## International Swaps and Derivatives Association

The International Swaps and Derivatives Association (ISDA) has, beginning around 1985, attempted to further develop the swaps marketplace, especially by fostering the ISDA Master Agreement, the primary normalized document used to draft agreements for the terms of some random over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives transaction.

Since OTC derivatives are traded between private gatherings, the utilization of a normalized agreement brings consistency, transparency, and higher liquidity to the swaps market. ISDA likewise attempts to reduce counterparty credit risk, which is a risk-oversaw in exchange-traded instruments using a [clearinghouse](/clearinghouse) or comparable institution.

## Illustration of a Liability Swap

For instance, Company XYZ swaps a six-month SOFR interest rate plus 2.5% liability for ABC's six-month fixed rate of 5% liability. The notional principal amount is $10 million.

Company XYZ presently has a fixed liability rate of 5%, while Company ABC is taking on the SOFR plus 2.5% liability. Expect the six-month SOFR rate is currently 2.5%, so the floating rate is likewise 5% currently.

Expect that following three months, SOFR has increased to 2.75%, and the floating rate is currently 5.25%. Company ABC is presently more terrible off than it was before on the grounds that it is currently paying a higher floating rate than the fixed-rate it initially had. All things considered, companies don't normally enter swaps to make or lose money, yet rather to exchange rates in light of their business needs.

On the off chance that SOFR drops to 2.25%, the floating rate will be 4.75%, and Company ABC will be paying a lower rate than the 5% it was initially paying.
