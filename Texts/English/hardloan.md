# Hard Loan
## What Is a Hard Loan?

A hard loan is a foreign loan that must be paid in [hard currency](/hardcurrency), which is the currency of a nation that has political stability and a reputation for economic strength. For instance, a country classified as an emerging nation might borrow through a hard loan [denominated](/denomination) in U.S. dollars.

## How a Hard Loan Works

A hard loan is a type of loan between a lender and borrower happening in two distinct counties, and which is designated in the hard currency. Hard currency alludes to a monetary system or [reserve currency](/reservecurrency) that is widely accepted around the world as a form of payment for goods and services. It normally comes from a country that has strong economic and political standing, and it may not be the currency of either the borrower or the lender. A hard loan substantially decreases the risk that would exist in the event that the loan were designated in less-stable currencies.

There are a few risks, be that as it may. Assuming that the borrower's home currency falls decisively against the hard currency they might have great difficulty repaying the loan. For example, on the off chance that a Brazilian manufacturer takes out a hard loan designated in euros, and the euro strengthens by 20% against the **real** over the life of the loan, it will really increase the interest rate on the loan by 20%, as well as the principal amount.

## Forex Considerations on Hard Loans

What permits a currency to qualify as hard? It is expected to remain somewhat stable through a short period of time and to be exceptionally liquid in the foreign exchange — or [forex](/forex) (FX) — market, in which currencies are traded. The forex market is the biggest, most liquid market in the world, with average traded values of trillions of dollars each day. It remembers each of the currencies for the world.

Forex transactions occur on either a spot or forward basis and are executed over the counter and around the clock. There is no centralized market for forex transactions. The biggest foreign exchange markets are situated in major financial centers, like London, New York, Singapore, Tokyo, Frankfurt, Hong Kong, and Sydney.

The hard currency must have a stable value. The value of a currency is generally founded on economic fundamentals like gross domestic product ([GDP](/gdp)) and employment. The international strength of the U.S. dollar is intelligent of America's GDP, which, as of the finish of 2019, stood first in the world at $21.43 trillion. China and India had the second-and fifth-, separately, positioned GDPs in the world, yet neither the Chinese yuan nor the Indian rupee is viewed as a hard currency. This makes sense of how central bank policies and stability in a country's money supply likewise factor into exchange rates. The U.S. dollar is viewed as the world's foreign reserve currency, which is the explanation it is utilized in 88% of international trade transactions.

## Illustration of a Hard Loan

An illustration of a hard loan would be a loan agreement between a Brazilian company and an Argentinean bank in which the debt is to be paid in U.S. dollars is a type of hard loan in light of the fact that U.S. dollars are viewed as hard currency and more stable than either the Brazilian real ([BRL](/brl-brazilian-real)) or the Argentine peso ([ARP](/arp-argentinian-peso)).

## Features
- Hard loans are frequently taken out by borrowers in agricultural nations, since loans named in less stable currencies can be risky for lenders.
- A hard loan happens when a foreign borrower takes a loan designated in a hard currency, for example, a reserve currency like the U.S. dollar.
- Currency volatility can hurt borrowers in hard loans since a devalued currency will make it more costly to repay the loan.
