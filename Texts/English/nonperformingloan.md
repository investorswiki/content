# Nonperforming Loan (NPL)
## What Is a Nonperforming Loan (NPL)?

A nonperforming loan (NPL) is a loan that is in [default](/default2) due to the fact that the borrower has not made the scheduled payments for a predetermined period. Albeit the exact components of nonperforming status can differ contingent upon the specific loan's terms, "no payment" is generally defined as zero payments of one or the other principal or interest.

The predetermined period additionally changes, contingent upon the industry and the type of loan. Generally, notwithstanding, the period is 90 days or 180 days.

## How a Nonperforming Loan (NPL) Works

A nonperforming loan (NPL) is viewed as in default or close to default. When a loan is nonperforming, the chances the debtor will repay it in full are substantially lower. On the off chance that the debtor resumes payments again on a NPL, it turns into a [reperforming loan](/reperforming-loan) (RPL), even on the off chance that the debtor has not made up for lost time with every one of the missed payments.

In banking, commercial loans are considered nonperforming on the off chance that the debtor has made zero payments of interest or principal in the span of 90 days, or is 90 days past due. For a consumer loan, 180 days past due orders it as a NPL.

A loan is falling behind financially when [principal](/principal) or [interest](/interest) payments are late or missed. A loan is in default when the lender believes the loan agreement to be broken and the debtor is unable to meet the obligations.

## Types of Nonperforming Loans (NPLs)

A debt can accomplish nonperforming loan status in more than one way. Instances of NPLs include:

- A loan where 90 days' worth of interest has been capitalized, renegotiated, or delayed due to an agreement or an amendment to the original agreement.
- A loan where payments are under 90 days late, yet the lender no longer accepts the debtor will make future payments.
- A loan where the maturity date of principal repayment has happened, yet some fraction of the loan stays outstanding.
