# Exit Point
## What Is an Exit Point?

An exit point is the price at which an investor or trader [closes a position](/closeposition). An investor will typically sell to exit their trade because they are buying assets as long as possible. A trader may likewise sell at an exit point, or they might decide to buy to close the position (in the event that they were [short](/short)).

The exit point might be determined in advance based on a trader's or alternately investor's strategy. The exit point may likewise be determined based on real-time market conditions or life requirements, for example, [liquidating](/liquidate) some investments to pay a bill.

Exit points can be contrasted with [entry points](/entry-point).

## Understanding Exit Points

An exit point is often predetermined based on a trading strategy or valuation model. Then, an order is sent on a mission to initiate the exit. The exit point could result in a profit or loss, depending on what direction the price went after purchase.

Subsequently, exit points can be used to manage the risk of loss and furthermore to set [profit targets](/profit-target). Investors regularly use [conditional orders](/conditionalorder) to set exit points.

Investors might use fundamental analysis or technical analysis — or a combination of both — to determine exit points for a trade. For example, a value investor might buy a low P/E stock and sell it once its price-to-earnings multiple has increased by a set amount. Alternatively, an informal investor might hope to chart patterns to identify an exit point based on signals that indicate trends and reversals.

Some investors use more heuristic methods for determining their exit points; for instance, if the price of a stock hits a round number like $100 per share, or on the other hand in the event that the price rises by a round number percent, like 10%.

Traders and investors will likewise often have an exit point to the downside to limit losses on a losing trade. Therefore, many trades will come with two exit points: one to take profit and the other to limit losses.

## Exit Points With Bracketed Orders

One example of an exit strategy that integrates premeditated exit points at the time of the initial investment is a [bracketed buy order](/bracketedbuyorder). A bracketed buy order is a conditional order that includes both a profit target and a [stop loss](/stop-lossorder) exit point.

In a bracketed buy order, an investor initially buys a security. Then, they set a profit target order at a specified price to lock in a gain. The stop loss is placed at a specified price to limit risk (in case the price moves in the opposite direction the investor expects). On the off chance that one of the orders is hit, the other is canceled because the position is currently closed.

The investor can shift the price of their stop-loss order and profit target order as per their [risk tolerance](/risktolerance) and expectations for the investment. Typically the further away the orders are from the entry point, the more longer-term the trade will be. Assuming that the stop loss and profit target are close to the entry point, then the trade will likely be closed quite rapidly when one of the orders is hit.

Once an investor possesses a security, they can place conditional exit point orders whenever. Profit target orders help investors exit with a planned profit, while stop loss orders help investors to set a cap on losses.

## Types of Exit Point Orders

A profit target is typically a [limit order](/limitorder). On the off chance that the investor is long an asset, they would place a limit order above the current price. When the price reaches that level, their order will be staying there ready to be [filled](/fill).

A stop loss order is typically a [stop market order](/stoporder). In the event that an investor is long, the stop loss goes below their entry price. The order is triggered provided that the stop price is reached. When it is, a market order is sent on a mission to sell the asset at the current market price.

Orders can have extra parameters attached to them, for example, an expiry date or [good-until-canceled](/gtc) (and that means the order will remain active until canceled). An order can likewise be set to just be active during the regular trading session or to likewise be active during the pre-and post-market sessions.

The investor may likewise simply use a traditional [market order](/marketorder) to exit their position whenever. Or on the other hand, they could utilize a [trailing stop loss](/trailingstop) order to participate when the price is moving in their direction yet get out when the price begins moving against them.

## Real World Example of an Exit Point in the Stock Market

Exit points apply to both long and short positions. Consider a trader who has entered a short position in a falling stock.

This type of scenario might have occurred in Macy's Inc. (M), as depicted in the chart below. The stock broke below a rising [trendline](/trendline) and entered into a downtrend. There was a brief rally, yet as the price started to drop again, a trader jumped into a short position at $36.40.

They placed a stop loss order (stop market order) at $39, just above the recent [swing high](/swinghigh), in case the price went up instead of down.

Since they expect the price to drop, the trader placed a profit target (limit order) at $29.40, below the prior swing low.

This type of trade creates a favorable [risk/reward](/riskrewardratio) scenario because the trader is risking $2.60 per share ($39 - $36.40) while expecting to make $7 per share ($36.40 - $29.40).

## Business Exit Points

A [business exit strategy](/business-exit-strategy) is an entrepreneur's strategic plan to sell their ownership of a company to [investors](/investor) or another company. An exit strategy gives a business owner a method for reducing or liquidate their stake in a business and, on the off chance that the business is successful, make a substantial profit.

Investors or institutions making large capital investments in private companies will likewise seek to manage exit points and exit strategies across their investments. Generally, an exit point and exit strategy is a part of all long-term business investment plans. For some investors, the exit point might be a [initial public offering](/ipo) (IPO). In other cases, an investor will set a profit target and maximum loss as part of their overall investing strategy.

An exit from a non-publicly traded company can be more troublesome because the investor needs to find someone else to buy their share(s) of the company.
