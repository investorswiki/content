# Quality Management
## What Is Quality Management?

Quality management is the act of overseeing movements of every sort and tasks that must be achieved to maintain an ideal level of greatness. This includes the determination of a quality policy, creating and implementing quality planning and assurance, and quality control and quality improvement. It is additionally alluded to as [total quality management (TQM)](/total-quality-management-tqm).

As a rule, quality management centers around long-term objectives through the implementation of short-term initiatives.

## Understanding Quality Management

At its core, TQM is a business philosophy that support the possibility that the long-term progress of a company comes from customer satisfaction and loyalty. TQM expects that all partners in a business cooperate to further develop processes, products, services and the culture of the company itself.

While TQM appears as though an intuitive cycle, it happened as a progressive thought. The 1920s saw the rise in dependence on [statistics](/statistics) and statistical theory in business, and the very first realized control chart was made in 1924. Individuals started to build on hypotheses of statistics and ended up on the whole creating the method of statistical interaction control (SPC). Nonetheless, it wasn't effectively carried out in a business setting until the 1950s.

It was during this time that Japan was confronted with an unforgiving industrial economic environment. Its residents were believed to be generally unskilled, and its products were known to be of low quality. Key businesses in Japan saw these lacks and hoped to roll out an improvement. Relying on pioneers in statistical thinking, companies, for example, Toyota integrated the possibility of quality management and quality control into their production processes.

Toward the finish of the 1960s, Japan totally flipped its account and became known as one of the most efficient export countries, with the absolute most appreciated products. Effective quality management brought about better products that could be created at a less expensive price.

## Certifiable Example of Quality Management

The most well known illustration of TQM is Toyota's implementation of the [Kanban](/kanban) system. A kanban is a physical signal that makes a chain reaction, resulting in a specific action. Toyota utilized this plan to carry out its just-in-time (JIT) inventory process. To make its assembly line more efficient, the company chose to keep just sufficient inventory close by to fill customer orders as they were created.

Thusly, all parts of Toyota's assembly line are assigned a physical card that has an associated inventory number. Right before a part is installed in a vehicle, the card is taken out and climbed the supply chain, effectively requesting one more of a similar part. This allows the company to keep its inventory lean and not overload pointless assets.
