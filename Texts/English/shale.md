# Oil Shale
## What Is Oil Shale?

Oil shale is a type of sedimentary stone formation that can be utilized to create oil and gas. Oil shale can deliver oil and gas as a result of the presence of kerogen, a type of organic matter that consumes when presented to fire. In spite of the fact that oil shale can be utilized as a source of [petroleum](/petroleum), the difficulty of separating it has generally made it a [unconventional play](/uncoventional-oil) in the oil and gas industry.

In spite of the similitudes in name, oil shale is not quite the same as "[shale oil](/shaleoil)". The last option alludes to the [unconventional oil](/uncoventional-oil) found in oil shale formations that must be using pressurized water broke to be separated.

## Grasping Oil Shale

To recuperate and deal with oil shale, it is important to initially separate the sedimentary stone materials utilizing surface or subsurface mining. These raw materials must then be shipped off different processing facilities to remove the kerogen contents. During the extraction interaction, a portion of these raw materials might demonstrate to have low levels of kerogen deposits.

Some processing methods, known as "ex-situ processing", include mining the kerogen deposit and afterward moving it to a separate facility for processing. Different methods, for example, "in situ processing", include separating kerogen from inside the mine itself.

The U.S. is home to the largest deposits of oil shale in the world, the vast majority of which can be found between Colorado, Utah, and Wyoming in what is known as the Green River Formation. Other active producers of oil shale incorporate the United States, Russia, Germany, and China. By and large, Estonia has likewise been a major oil shale producer, inferable from large deposits in that country.

## Special Considerations

Notwithstanding the overflow of oil shale in the U.S., the costs associated with extricating kerogen from rock formations make the overall cycle uneconomical compared with the extraction processes for conventional crude oil. Moreover, when there is a mining cycle engaged with removing oil shale, there are extra [environmental](/environmental-financial matters) concerns.

Oil shale is usually utilized in circumstances when the price of conventional crude oil becomes restrictive â€” frequently because of transitory supply disturbances or [geopolitical concerns](/politicalrisk).

## History of Oil Shale

Oil shale turned into a decisively critical commodity during World War II when the United States looked for a dependable source of energy that could endure the tensions facing overseas [supply chains](/supplychain).

In response to this need, the U.S started a program of commercial double-dealing of its oil shale reserves during the 1960s. Notwithstanding, the additional cost and complexity of separating oil shale made it less effective as an alternative to conventional oil wells. The oil shale industry encountered a period of resurgence during the 1970s when the purported oil crisis momentarily made oil shale monetarily competitive.

Notwithstanding, this trend was turned around during the 1980s as oil prices declined. In later years, interest in unconventional oil plays, for example, oil shale and shale oil-have proceeded to rhythmic movement relying upon the price of crude oil.

## Features
- Oil shale alludes to shake formations that contain hydrocarbon deposits that can be removed for use.
- By and large, the production of oil shale has been conversely connected with the market price of conventional crude oil.
- The production cycle for oil shale is typically more costly and capital-serious than conventional crude oil.
