# Stimulus Check
## What Is a Stimulus Check?

A stimulus check is a check shipped off a taxpayer by the U.S. government. Stimulus checks are expected to invigorate the economy by furnishing consumers with some spending money. Taxpayers receive this money since supporting consumption and drive revenue at retailers and manufacturers, prodding the economy is expected.

A stimulus check can be part of a bigger federal [stimulus package](/stimulus-package) intended to support the economy, which was the case with the stimulus payments that were part of the CARES Act in 2020 and the American Rescue Plan in 2021.

## Understanding a Stimulus Check

Stimulus checks have been sent out to U.S. taxpayers on several events. These checks shift in amount as per the [taxpayer's filing status](/filingstatus). Joint taxpayers by and large receive two times as much as those filing independently. In certain occurrences, the people who had unpaid back taxes saw their stimulus checks consequently applied to their outstanding balance.

Research posted on the National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER) found that the means of delivery of fiscal stimulus has an effect on the overall spending examples of consumers. Carrying out fiscal stimulus by sending checks brought about an increase in [consumer spending](/consumer-spending) activity. Nonetheless, applying [tax credits](/taxcredit) equivalent to the amount of money gave in a stimulus check didn't bring about an equivalent increase in consumer spending activity.

## Instances of Stimulus Checks
### Financial Crisis of 2008

One illustration of the utilization of stimulus checks happened when the U.S. economy entered an extreme recession after the [financial crisis](/financial-crisis) of 2008. The approaching Obama administration estimated that conveying checks would prevent unemployment rates from going past 8%.

The payments were part of the Economic Stimulus Act of 2008, which was enacted during the administration of President George W. Bush. The government conveyed checks to those with something like $3,000 in qualifying income from, or in combination with, [Social Security](/socialsecurity) benefits, Veterans Affairs benefits, Railroad Retirement benefits, and earned income. The checks amounted to:

- Eligible people: somewhere in the range of $300 and $600
- Married taxpayers filing joint returns: somewhere in the range of $600 and $1,200
- With eligible children: an extra $300 for each qualifying child

### Coronavirus Pandemic

In March 2020, the U.S. government approved a bill to send Americans stimulus payments to give relief to economic difficulties brought about by the coronavirus pandemic. Among different provisions, the CARES Act indicated tax rebates of $1,200 per grown-up and $500 per qualifying child. The amount of the rebate phases out for incomes above $75,000 each year for people and $150,000 for joint filers.

The second round of $600 stimulus checks went out in December 2020. Then, at that point, in March 2021, the American Rescue Plan Act was agreed upon. It included direct stimulus payments of $1,400 to individuals making $75,000 or less each year.

## Special Considerations

Do stimulus programs work to assist with pulling the economy out of a spiral? In 2011, **The Washington Post** surveyed a series of studies that took a gander at the impact the [American Recovery and Reinvestment Act](/american-recovery-and-reinvestment-act) (ARRA) of 2009 had on the economy. Out of nine studies, they found that six of them reasoned that "the stimulus had a huge, positive effect on employment and growth, and three observe that the effect was either very small or difficult to recognize."

The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) found that the stimulus given by the ARRA had by 2011 made between 1.6 million and 4.6 million positions, increased real [gross domestic product](/gdp) (GDP) by somewhere in the range of 1.1% and 3.1%, and decreased unemployment by between 0.6 percentage points and 1.8 percentage points. It's important to note that not at all like the Economic Stimulus Act of 2008, the ARRA did exclude direct stimulus check payments to Americans.

All things being equal, as per the CBO, the full stimulus package worked by:

>
> Giving funds to states and areas — for instance, by raising federal matching rates under Medicaid, giving aid to education, and expanding financial support for some transportation projects. Supporting individuals out of luck —, for example, by broadening and growing unemployment benefits and expanding benefits under the [Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program](/electronic-benefits-move) (formerly the Food Stamp program), and purchasing goods and administrations — for example, by funding construction and other investment activities that could require several years to finish; and giving impermanent tax relief to people and businesses —, for example, by raising exemption amounts for the alternative least tax, adding another Making Work Pay tax credit, and making enhanced deductions for depreciation of business equipment.

## Analysis of Stimulus Checks and Programs

Pundits battle that the stimulus added a $1 trillion to the deficit and just moved economic activity that would have happened at any rate. A Mercatus study highlighted unemployment rates, which rose even after the stimulus was executed, as proof that stimulus checks were ineffective during the 2008 recession.

As per the study, the median duration of unemployment arrived at a high of 25.5 weeks in June 2010, subsequent to averaging 7.2 weeks from 1967 to 2008. Others, similar to American economist Paul Krugman, have battled that the stimulus amount was too small to be effective.
