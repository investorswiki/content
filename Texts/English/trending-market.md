# Trending Market
## What Is a Trending Market?

A price series that consistently closes either higher or lower (on average over a defined number of periods) is supposed to trend. A vertical trending market is one that might change all over however on average will in general close periodically higher. A downward trending market closes periodically lower paying little heed to interim moves. Securities in any asset class will generally show trending behavior or the like.

## Understanding Trending Markets

The [Efficient Market Hypothesis](/efficientmarkethypothesis) (EMH) posits that markets are not unsurprising through prior information like price or earnings data. This appears to suggest that prices ought to display a [random walk](/randomwalktheory) over the long haul. Trends would appear to be an anomaly in this model yet as a matter of fact, they are not. Since random data in any series will in general trend as a rule, trends are commonplace in any asset class.

A trending market can give different trading opportunities to investors, traders, and [technical analysts](/technical-expert). Technical analysts will chart the price pattern of a security or market index to recognize trending bearings for setting investment trades. Investors may likewise follow the trending heading of an index that fills in as a benchmark for a specific security. These trending market lines can act as an overlay to a security price chart which can assist with forming an extra indicator for market trends.

Trending markets are of primary interest in [technical analysis](/technicalanalysis). Technical analysts accept that trending markets happen with a few degree of routineness and predictability. The ability to accurately recognize these trends can considerably affect investment returns.

## Distinguishing a Trending Market

Traders utilize different patterns and [trend lines](/trendline) to recognize trending market bearings and trading signals for a single security. A trending market can be classified as such for either the short-, mid-or long-term. Several trading channels can be drawn to follow a security trend. The absolute most common trading channels incorporate the following:

- Ascending: In an ascending channel, a security is showing a [bullish](/bull) trend. This is addressed by two positive inclining trend lines drawn over a security's pinnacles and box.
- Descending: In a descending channel, a security is showing a [bearish](/bear) trend. This is addressed by two negative inclining lines drawn above and below the candlestick pattern.
- Sideways: A security or market index can likewise be showing a sideways channel. This trend will be flat. In a sideways channel, two zero-slanting trend lines will be drawn from a security's pinnacles and box.

Accepting the price of a security is expected to stay inside its trended pattern, traders can utilize resistance and support lines to demonstrate buy and sell signals. Hence, when a price arrives at a resistance line, traders can be expected to start sell orders to benefit from a possible reversal to a bearish trend. Adversely, when a price arrives at support lines, buy orders would ordinarily be initiated to profit from a possible reversal to a bullish trend.

One caveat for standard trading channels is that they don't completely include price movement through [reversals](/reversal) and changing trends after some time. This can lead to the utilization of wedge price patterns which are ascending or descending channels with non-equal trend lines highlighting a condition sooner rather than later where a potential trend reversal can happen.

Envelope channels can likewise be utilized to expand the scope of price levels and accommodate a single channel utilized over a long period of time. Envelope channels utilize non-direct trend lines drawn at resistance and support levels to make a moving channel over an extended period of time that can incorporate both bullish and bearish trends.
