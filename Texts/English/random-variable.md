## What Is a Random Variable?

A random variable is a variable whose value is obscure or a function that assigns values to every one of a trial's outcomes. Random variables are often designated by letters and can be classified as [discrete](/discrete-distribution), which are variables that have specific values, or continuous, which are variables that can include any values inside a continuous reach.

Random variables are often utilized in [econometric](/econometrics) or [regression](/regression) analysis to decide statistical connections among each other.

## Grasping a Random Variable

In likelihood and [statistics](/statistics), random variables are utilized to evaluate outcomes of a random occurrence, and hence, can take on many values. Random variables are required to be quantifiable and are commonly real numbers. For instance, the letter X might be designated to address the sum of the subsequent numbers after three dice are rolled. In this case, X could be 3 (1 + 1+ 1), 18 (6 + 6 + 6), or somewhere close to 3 and 18, since the highest number of a bite the dust is 6 and the least number is 1.

A random variable is not quite the same as a [algebraic](/algebraic-technique) variable. The variable in an algebraic equation is an obscure value that can be calculated. The equation 10 + x = 13 demonstrates the way that we can ascertain the specific value for x which is 3. Then again, a random variable has a set of values, and any of those values could be the subsequent outcome as found in the case of the dice above.

In the corporate world, random variables can be assigned to properties like the average price of an asset throughout a given time span, the [return on investment](/returnoninvestment) after a predetermined number of years, the estimated turnover rate at a company inside the accompanying six months, and so on. Risk analysts assign random variables to risk models when they need to estimate the likelihood of an adverse event happening. These variables are introduced utilizing apparatuses, for example, scenario and [sensitivity analysis](/sensitivityanalysis) tables which risk managers use to go with choices concerning risk alleviation.

## Types of Random Variables

A random variable can be either discrete or continuous. Discrete random variables take on a countable number of distinct values. Consider an examination where a coin is thrown three times. On the off chance that X addresses the number of times that the coin comes up heads, then, at that point, X is a discrete random variable that can have the values 0, 1, 2, 3 (from no heads in three successive coin throws to all heads). No other value is workable for X.

Continuous random variables can address any value inside a predefined reach or interval and can take on a limitless number of potential values. An illustration of a continuous random variable would be an examination that includes measuring the amount of precipitation in a city north of a year or the average level of a random group of 25 individuals.

Drawing on the latter, assuming Y addresses the random variable for the average level of a random group of 25 individuals, you will observe that the subsequent outcome is a continuous figure since level might be 5 ft or 5.01 ft or 5.0001 ft. Obviously, there is an endless number of potential values for level.

A random variable has a [probability distribution](/probabilitydistribution) that addresses the probability that any of the potential values would happen. Suppose that the random variable, Z, is the number on the top face of a bite the dust when it is rolled once. The potential values for Z will in this manner be 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. The likelihood of every one of these values is 1/6 as they are similarly liable to be the value of Z.

For example, the likelihood of getting a 3, or P (Z=3), when a kick the bucket is tossed is 1/6, as is the likelihood of having a 4 or a 2 or some other number on each of the six faces of a bite the dust. Note that the sum of all probabilities is 1.

## Illustration of a Random Variable

A run of the mill illustration of a random variable is the outcome of a coin throw. Consider a likelihood distribution wherein the outcomes of a random event are not similarly liable to occur. Assuming the random variable Y is the number of heads we get from flipping two coins, then Y could be 0, 1, or 2. This means that we could have no heads, one head, or the two heads on a two-coin throw.

In any case, the two coins land in four unique ways: TT, HT, TH, and HH. Consequently, the P(Y=0) = 1/4 since we have a single chance of getting no heads (i.e., two tails [TT] when the coins are thrown). Likewise, the likelihood of getting two heads (HH) is additionally 1/4. Notice that getting one head has a probability of happening two times: in HT and TH. In this case, P (Y=1) = 2/4 = 1/2.

## Features

- A random variable can be either discrete (having specific values) or continuous (any value in a continuous reach).
- Risk analysts utilize random variables to estimate the likelihood of an adverse event happening.
- The utilization of random variables is most common in likelihood and statistics, where they are utilized to evaluate outcomes of random occurrences.
## FAQ
### What Is a Continuous Random Variable?
A continuous random variable represents any amount inside a specific reach or set of points and can mirror a limitless number of expected values, like the average precipitation in a region.
### What Is a Discrete Random Variable?
A discrete random variable is a type of random variable that has a countable number of distinct values that can be assigned to it, for example, in a coin throw.
### What Is a Mixed Random Variable?
A mixed random variable joins components of both discrete and continuous random variables.
