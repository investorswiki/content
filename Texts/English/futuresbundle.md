# Futures Bundle
## What Is a Futures Bundle?

A futures bundle is a type of futures order. The bundle empowers an investor to all the while purchase or sell a predefined number of [futures contracts](/futurescontract) in each back to back quarterly delivery month for at least one years. This single purchase of different futures contracts is referred to as buying [futures strips](/futuresstrip).

## Understanding Futures Bundles

A futures bundle is an order that contains every one of the quarterly futures contracts inside bundle periods stretching out similar to 10 full years into what's in store. In this manner, futures bundles can have up to 40 terminations in four quarterlies north of 10 years. The primary contract in any bundle is regularly the principal quarterly contract in a [futures strip](/futuresstrip); notwithstanding, bundles can be ordered starting with any quarterly contract.

There are many reasons that investors could benefit from purchasing futures bundles, for example, to lock in a specific price for their target course of events, improve [liquidity,](/liquidity) and reduce operational complexity. For instance, a large gold-mining company could profit from utilizing a futures bundle to settle the price it will receive for its gold throughout the next four years.

An investor might decide to purchase a futures strip to lock in the price of natural gas for a long time as opposed to rolling over their trade and paying extra trading costs for extra futures contracts each time a more limited term contract lapses. A wheat rancher could sell a futures bundle to gain certainty about the amount they will earn from a predefined amount of wheat for the next several years.

Futures bundles are normally traded in the [Eurodollar](/eurodollar) market. Eurodollar futures bundle strips are much of the time tone coded to improve on reference to specific contract months. The [Chicago Mercantile Exchange](/cme) developed a variety coding system for which white addresses the primary year, red the second, green for third, blue for fourth, gold for fifth, purple for 6th, orange for seventh, pink for eight, silver for 10th, and copper for 10th. For instance, a three-year green bundle would incorporate the initial 12 quarterly lapses together in one package, and a five-year gold bundle would include 20 quarterly terminations generally remembered for one transaction.

### Futures Bundles and Futures Packs

Like futures bundles, [futures packs](/futurespack) are one more approach to executing a strip trade. Packs are futures contracts delivered north of four back to back months, basically making them more limited term bundles. The prices of futures packs and bundles are quoted in terms of the average net change from the previous day's settlement prices for the whole group of contracts in additions of one-fourth of a basis point. In 2016, packs and bundles made roughly 20% out of all Eurodollars futures contract transactions. Futures strips, packs, and bundles are normally utilized in trading interest rates, agricultural goods, and energy futures.
