## What is the American Taxpayer Relief Act Of 2012

The American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 is a bill endorsed into law by President Barack Obama on Jan. 2, 2013. The act made many tax cuts presented somewhere in the range of 2001 and 2010 permanent and extended several different forms of tax relief for as long as five years.

## BREAKING DOWN American Taxpayer Relief Act Of 2012

The American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 (ATRA) was passed to deflect the enactment of an assortment of fiscal [austerity](/austerity) measures that had become known as the [fiscal cliff](/fiscalcliff) on January 1, 2013. Federal Reserve Chair Ben Bernanke begat that term in February 2012 to depict a package of tax increments and spending cuts set forward in the Budget Control Act of 2011. ATRA tended to just the taxation side of the approaching fiscal cliff. Federal spending would be viewed as a couple of months after the fact as part of the sequester cycle.

ATRA's entry forestalled the expiration of a large portion of the major tax cuts enacted somewhere in the range of 2001 and 2010. It made permanent the tax savings remembered for the Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001 and the Jobs and Growth Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2003. ATRA extended through 2017 the tax cuts incorporated into the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. Alongside these extended tax cuts, ATRA raised [payroll taxes](/payrolltax) for some Americans and turned around cuts for the highest earners that had been passed fully backed by the George W. Bush administration. At that point, the White House guaranteed the act would reduce the [fiscal deficit](/fiscaldeficit) by $737 billion.

## Political Considerations of the American Tax Relief Act of 2012

As the fiscal cliff moved toward in the last months of 2012, Congress thought about three possible blueprints. To start with, it could make no move and permit the spending cuts and tax increments to produce results. Most financial specialists concur that doing so would have hampered economic growth to the point of sending the U.S. into another [recession](/recession). The political ramifications for individuals from Congress would have been comparatively catastrophic. The subsequent choice was to pass legislation to cancel the whole austerity package. This path would most likely have sent the U.S. debt upward and gambled with the federal government's creditworthiness. A third option addressed a middle path. This was a combination of spending cuts and tax expands intended to limit the vertical pressure on the nation's debt. Conservative individuals from Congress firmly supported tax and spending cuts, and were at last convinced to consent to a modest bunch of politically tasteful tax increments. Congress eventually selected this third option, passing the tax measures of ATRA determined to address spending cuts through the subsequent [sequestration](/sequestration) process.
