## What is a Bonus Issue?

A bonus issue, otherwise called a scrip issue or a capitalization issue, is an offer of free additional[ shares](/shares) to existing shareholders. A company might choose to disseminate further shares as an alternative to expanding the dividend[ payout](/payout). For instance, a company might give one [bonus](/bonus) share for each five shares held.

Shareholders might sell the bonus shares and meet their liquidity needs. Bonus shares may likewise be issued to rebuild company reserves. Giving bonus shares doesn't include cash flow. It increases the company's share capital however not its net assets.

Bonus shares are issued by every shareholder's stake in the company. Bonus issues don't weaken shareholders' equity, since they are issued to existing shareholders in a consistent ratio that keeps the relative equity of every shareholder equivalent to before the issue. For instance, a three-for-two bonus issue entitles every shareholder three shares for each two they hold before the issue. A shareholder with 1,000 shares gets 1,500 bonus shares (1000 x 3/2 = 1500).
