## Illustration of Customs Barriers

In 2018, the United States, under President Donald Trump, started monumental various new tariffs on steel, aluminum, and different goods from China in response to worries about national security and [intellectual property](/intellectualproperty) theft. In response, China placed retaliatory tariffs on goods from the United States.

These policies have helped a few organizations while harming others. Some steel makes reported increased revenue and earnings because of the increase in prices following the trade sanctions. For instance, Reliance Steel and Aluminum (RS) reported record sales after the new tariffs were executed.

In any case, not all organizations have benefited. Harley Davidson, General Motors, General Electric, 3M, and numerous different manufacturers rushed to increase prices and change their supply chains to combat the rising prices that have been affecting their profits since the tariffs started. Also, in spite of the fact that Reliance Steel and Aluminum reported record sales, not all steel companies encountered a similar rise in earnings from the price bump. Numerous more modest companies didn't see an increase in revenues like their bigger partners. At times, the justification for this is that companies were locked into [fixed pricing agreements](/salesandpurchase) and wouldn't see a change in that frame of mind until those contracts expired and could be re-composed.

At the time the Trump organization's tariffs were proposed, a few financial specialists warned that such customs barriers could be fit for introducing a recession. Customs barriers can adversely affect trade, which thus harms certain fragments of the economy.

The overall consensus among financial specialists is that the trade war negatively affected both the economy of the U.S. furthermore, the economy of China.
