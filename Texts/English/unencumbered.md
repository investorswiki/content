## What Is Unencumbered?

Unencumbered alludes to an asset or property that is [free and clear](/freeandclear) of any encumbrances, for example, creditor claims or liens. An unencumbered asset is a lot more straightforward to sell or transfer than one with a [encumbrance](/encumbrance). Instances of common unencumbered assets are houses free from mortgages and different liens, cars with paid off loans/notes, or stocks purchased in a [cash account](/cashaccount).

## Understanding Unencumbered

Creditors don't have claims to unencumbered assets as there are no associated debts. Thus, these assets are the full property of the person(s) listed as the owner(s) in an official capacity, like on a title or deed. Unencumbered assets are not listed as [collateral](/collateral) for any debt and are not subject to contending claims, for example, past-due property taxes.

For the majority of consumers, especially youthful couples and recent alumni, high-value assets, like real estate and cars, are probably not going to be unencumbered. This is on the grounds that these purchases are many times financed, leading to the acquisition of debt, with the asset as collateral. After some time, as the mortgage or vehicle loan is paid off, these assets become unencumbered. A [title search](/titlesearch) is a key part of the due diligence process for a buyer of real estate or a trade-in vehicle to affirm that the asset is unencumbered or has outstanding liens.

## Encumbered versus Unencumbered Assets

This permits the debt to be really paid off as part of the sales transaction.

## Special Considerations

In most bankruptcy procedures including liquidations, encumbered assets are first viewed as the property of those holding rights to the property through the encumbrance, permitting the institution to recover a portion of the losses through the acquisition, and a potential later sale, of the assets being referred to.

In certain conditions, the IRS, state, or even neighborhood taxing specialists can place a lien on beforehand unencumbered property to collect past due taxes.
