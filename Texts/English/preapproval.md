## What Is a Pre-Approval?

Pre-approvals are generated through soft inquiry analysis which permits a lender to investigate a portion of a borrower's credit profile data to decide whether they meet indicated lender qualities. Generally, a borrower's credit score will be the leading factor for pre-approval qualification.

## Types of Pre-Approval Offers

Lenders send high volumes of pre-approval qualifications for credit cards, auto insurance, or private loans, for instance, every year through both direct mail and electronic mail.

Most pre-approval offers accompany a special code and an expiration date. Utilizing the special code given by the lender can assist with separating a borrower's credit application and give the borrower some higher priority inside the lending system.
