## What Is Dollarization?

It is an illustration of [currency substitution](/currency-substitution). Dollarization typically happens when a country's own currency loses its convenience as a medium of exchange, due to hyperinflation or instability.

## Understanding Dollarization

Dollarization typically happens in developing countries with a weak central monetary authority or an unstable economic environment. It can happen as an official monetary policy or as a de facto market process. Either through official decree or through adoption by market participants, the U.S. dollar comes to be recognized as a generally accepted medium of exchange for use in everyday transactions in a country's economy. Once in a while the dollar expects official status as [legal tender](/legal-tender) in the country.

The principal justification for dollarization is to receive the benefits of greater stability in the value of currency over a country's domestic currency. For instance, the residents of a country inside an economy that is undergoing uncontrolled inflation might decide to utilize the U.S. dollar to conduct everyday transactions, since inflation will make their domestic currency have reduced [buying power](/buyingpower).

One more part of dollarization is that the country enables up some to influence its own economy through [monetary policy](/monetarypolicy) by adjusting its money supply. The dollarizing country actually [outsources](/rethinking) their monetary policy to the [U.S. Federal Reserve](/federalreservebank). This can be a negative factor, to the degree that U.S. period monetary policy is set in the interest of the U.S. economy and not the interests of dollarized countries.

Notwithstanding, it tends to be beneficial assuming it assists takes with advantaging of a [economy of scale](/economiesofscale) in monetary policy that permits the dollarizing country to streamline on resources that would should be devoted to supplying and dealing with its own money supply. It might likewise be the case that domestic specialists have proven themselves awkward to deal with their own monetary policy. Surrendering an independent monetary policy can draw the dollarizing country nearer to a [optimal currency area](/federalreservebank) with the dollar. Small countries that take part in a somewhat large volume of trade with and have strong economic connections to the U.S. will particularly benefit.

## An Example of Dollarization

Zimbabwe ran a dollarization test to check whether the adoption of foreign currency could fight off high [inflation](/inflation) and settle its economy. Zimbabwe dollar inflation arrived at estimated annual rate of 250 million percent in July 2008. Zimbabwe's currency had become so worthless that it was widely being utilized as protection and stuffing in furniture, and numerous Zimbabweans had started either to take on foreign currencies for transacting business or turning to simple barter. The acting finance serve announced that the U.S. dollar would be accepted as legal tender for a select number of merchandisers and retailers. After the trial, the finance serve announced that the country would embrace the U.S. dollar, by legalizing its general use in 2009 and later suspending utilization of the Zimbabwe dollar in 2015.

Dollarization in Zimbabwe quickly attempted to reduce inflation. This reduced the instability of the country's overall economy, permitting it to increase its residents' buying power and realize increased economic growth. Furthermore, long-term economic planning became more straightforward for the country, since the stable dollar pulled in some foreign investment.

In any case, dollarization was certainly not an altogether smooth ride for the country, and there were disadvantages. All monetary policy would be made and carried out by the United States, around great many miles from Zimbabwe. Decisions made by the [Federal Reserve](/federalreservebank) don't consider the best interests of Zimbabwe while making and establishing policy, and the country needed to hope that any decisions, like open market operations, would be beneficial. Further, Zimbabwe became disadvantaged while trading with nearby partners, for example, with Zambia or South Africa. Zimbabwe couldn't make its goods and services less expensive in the world market by devaluing its currency, which would draw in additional foreign investments from these countries.

In 2019, Zimbabwe switched course by once again introducing another Zimbabwe dollar known as the Real Time Gross Settlement dollar in February and prohibiting the utilization of the U.S. dollar and other foreign currencies in June. Inflation in the new Zimbabwe dollars has been steep, and substantial utilization of the U.S. dollar as a black market currency endures.
