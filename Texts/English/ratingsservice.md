While fixed income and bonds investments can infuse a measure of [diversification](/diversification) in a [common stock](/commonstock) portfolio, these vehicles can be convoluted, with variation risk profiles. A standardized ratings methodology that compares and differentiations their a venture's risk qualities with different offerings of a similar kind, can go a long way in prudent decision making.

In deciding bond ratings, a large group of factors are thought of, for example,

**Economic sensitivity**: the sensitivity levels of a company's financial position, relative to a shifting economy- - whether that economy is reinforcing or debilitating.

**Interest coverage ratio**: whether a company, a government or a region is constantly able to cover the interest payments on its bond offerings, given different stress test results. Interest coverage ratios are seemingly the most critical measures, since they signal definitively how risky a bond is, in the event that the revenue of a company or government declines or evaporates totally.

**Recoverability**: a measure demonstrating how effectively a company, government, or other bond-giving entity would have the option to cover any remaining debt â€” exclusively with the extra cash it has overseas, should entity go into default.

**Seniority**: As certain bondholders are paid before others, on the off chance that the responsible entity runs out of cash, position measures whether a given bond is probable default, contingent upon its positioning on the dominance hierarchy.
