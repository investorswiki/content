# Environmental Impact Statement
## What is an environmental impact statement?
An environmental impact statement is a legally required evaluation of the likely impact on the environment of a major federal project or of proposed legislation that could cause an environmental impact.
## More profound definition
Falling under the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), an environmental impact statement (EIS) is required at whatever point a federal agency proposes a project or action that could impact the environment.
The initial step is to lay out in the event that the proposed action is probably going to essentially affect the human environment. If so, an environmental assessment (EA) is conducted to check that there will be an environmental impact.
On the off chance that the EA lays out the environmental impact will be huge, a full environmental impact statement must be prepared. An EIS is a complex interaction that proceeds through several clearly defined phases:
- Recognize the proposed project.
- Make sense of why the project is being thought of.
- Talk about alternatives.
- Detail the environmental results.

Key milestones of an environmental impact statement process incorporate the accompanying:
- The issuance of a notice of intent to conduct an EIS.
- Preparation of a draft EIS for public comment.
- A waiting period of 45 days to consider comments from closely involved individuals.
- Conclusion and publication of the last EIS.
- Following a mandatory least waiting period of 30 days, the proper federal agency reports a Record of Decision (ROD) along with alternatives considered and steps to be taken to relieve adverse environmental impacts.

Albeit the law doesn't need that companies associated with private sector projects conduct an environmental impact statement, all such improvements must follow nearby, state and federal regulations.
## Environmental impact statement model
A model is a proposal for the construction of a 500 kilovolt electrical transmission line over a distance of 305 miles, between southwest Idaho and northeast Oregon. The environmental impact statement frames the reasons for the project, distinguishes the impact of this project on the environment and examines alternatives. The last step is for the Bureau of Land Management to issue a Record of Decision with respect to this project.

## Features
- Environmental impact statements are reports that examine the likely impact on the environment of proposed federal government projects.
- An EIS must incorporate a reasonable scope of alternatives to the proposed action, as well as their outcomes.
- Environmental impact statements are accessible on the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) website.
- An EIS is unique in relation to an environmental assessment, a more limited report that might lead to an EIS.
- The public can say something regarding environmental impact statements when they are in the draft stage.
## FAQ
### When Is an Environmental Impact Statement Required?
Any major project that utilizes federal land, federal funding, or that is under the jurisdiction of a federal agency must incorporate an assessment of that project's environmental effects. However, this doesn't necessarily in all cases require a full EIS. At times, a more modest project could require a more limited environmental assessment. In different cases, there may a find of "no huge impact" (FONSI), permitting the project to continue.
### Who Prepares an Environmental Impact Statement?
An EIS must be documented by the federal agency in charge of the project being referred to. Agencies frequently re-appropriate this work to contractors.
### What Should be Included in an Environmental Impact Statement?
Among the things required in an EIS are a summary, submitted alternatives, data, and examinations assembled from public comments and ideas, the purpose and need of the EIS, and a rundown of environmental outcomes.
### What Is the Difference Between an Environmental Assessment (EA) and an Environmental Impact Statement (EIA)?
The difference between an EA and an EIS is mostly in its length and depth of research. An EA is restricted in scope report making sense of the account and requirements for such a proposal, recommending alternatives, and giving a concise survey of the impacted environment. An EIS is an exceptionally exhaustive report that requires what an EA does as well as it calls for an in-depth examination of the proposal and contemplations by the public, including nearby, state, and ancestral governments.
