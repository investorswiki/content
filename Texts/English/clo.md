# Collateralized Loan Obligation (CLO)
## What Is a Collateralized Loan Obligation (CLO)?

A collateralized loan obligation (CLO) is a single security backed by a pool of debt. The most common way of pooling assets into a marketable security is called [securitization](/securitization). Collateralized loan obligations (CLO) are in many cases backed by corporate loans with low credit ratings or loans taken out by private equity firms to conduct [leveraged buyouts](/leveragedbuyout). A collateralized loan obligation is like a [collateralized mortgage obligation](/cmo) (CMO), then again, actually the underlying debt is of an alternate type and character — a company loan rather than a mortgage.

With a CLO, the investor gets scheduled debt payments from the underlying loans, expecting a large portion of the risk if borrowers default. In exchange for taking on the default risk, the investor is offered greater diversity and the potential for higher-than-normal returns. A [default](/default2) is the point at which a borrower neglects to make payments on a loan or mortgage for an extended period of time.

## How Collateralized Loan Obligations (CLOs) Work

Loans — typically first-lien bank loans to organizations — that are positioned below investment grade are initially sold to a CLO manager who packs (generally 150 to 250) different loans together and deals with the unions, actively buying and selling loans. To fund the purchase of new debt, the CLO manager sells stakes in the CLO to outside investors in a structure called [tranches](/tranches).

Every tranche is a piece of the CLO, and it directs who will be paid out first when the underlying loan payments are made. It likewise directs the risk associated with the investment since investors who are paid last have a higher risk of default from the underlying loans. Investors who are paid out first have lower overall risk, yet they get more modest interest payments, therefore. Investors who are in later tranches might be paid last, however the interest payments are higher to make up for the risk.

There are two types of tranches: debt tranches and equity tranches. Debt tranches, which as additionally called mezzanine tranches, are dealt with just like bonds and have credit ratings and coupon payments. These debt tranches are generally toward the front of the line in terms of [repayment](/repayment), despite the fact that inside the debt tranches, there is likewise a food chain. Equity tranches don't have credit ratings and are paid out after all debt tranches. Equity tranches are rarely paid a cash flow yet offer ownership in the CLO itself in the event of a sale.

A CLO is an actively managed instrument: managers can — and do — trade individual bank loans in the underlying collateral pool with an end goal to score gains and limit losses. Moreover, the majority of a CLO's debt is backed by excellent collateral, making liquidation more uncertain, and improving it prepared to endure market volatility.

## Special Considerations

Some contend that a CLO isn't simply risky. Research conducted by Guggenheim Investments, an asset management firm, found that from 1994 to 2013, CLOs experienced altogether lower default rates than corporate bonds. Just 0.03% of tranches have defaulted from 1994 to 2019. Even in this way, they are sophisticated investments, and regularly, just large institutional investors purchase tranches in a CLO.

At the end of the day, companies of scale, for example, insurance companies, immediately purchase senior-level debt tranches to guarantee low risk and consistent cash flow. Mutual funds and ETFs regularly purchase [junior-level debt tranches](/junior-debt) with higher risk and higher interest payments. On the off chance that an individual investor puts resources into a mutual fund with junior debt tranches, that investor faces the proportional risk challenges default.
