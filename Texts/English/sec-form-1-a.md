# SEC Form 1-A
## What Is SEC Form 1-A?

SEC Form 1-A will be a filing with the [Securities and Exchange Commission](/sec) (SEC) by substances seeking exemption for registration requirements for certain public offerings. Securities issued in reliance upon Regulation A provisions must furnish investors with an offering statement that meets the requirements of Form 1-A. The form is also known as the "Regulation An Offering Statement" under the [Securities Exchange Act of 1933](/securitiesact1933).

## Understanding SEC Form 1-A

The Securities Exchange Act of 1933, also known as the truth in securities law, expects companies to file registration forms that reveal important information about their [securities](/security).

Form 1-An is an offering statement that must be filed no later than 21 days before the offering statement is qualified by the SEC. The form is completed by anyone who wants an exemption under Regulation A. This regulation waives registration requirements for any [public offering](/publicoffering) of securities of $75 million or less inside a year period.

The statement can be utilized for two portions of offerings limited by their value.

- Tier 1 is capped at $20 million for the aggregate offering price and aggregate sales of securities offered more than a year period. Tier 1 offerings of something like $6 million can be offered by all selling security holders that are [affiliates](/affiliate) of the issuer.
- Tier 2 is limited to $75 million in securities offerings in a year period. The limit for Tier 2 offerings is $20 million for all selling security holders that are affiliates of the issuer. Tier 2 offerings are subject to regular reporting requirements including [annual reports](/annualreport), special financial reports, and exit reports.

There are three parts to Form 1-A. The initial segment frames basic information about the issuer including the security and where it will be offered. Part two requires specific [disclosures](/exposure) including information about the business and its management, for example, compensation, information about [beneficial ownership](/beneficialowner), how the proceeds of the offering will be utilized, as well as potential risks implied with the security offering. The third part normally incorporates specific records and different exhibits.

## Special Considerations

Entries of Form 1-A may incorporate additional information as a supplemental part of the filing.

The supplemental information can also incorporate reports referred to in the offering circular or utilized externally by the issuer or principal [underwriter](/underwriter) in relation to the offering.

In the event that such reports were utilized, a statement must be incorporated that characterizes their actual use and how they were distributed.
