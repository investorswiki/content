# Nondiscrimination Rule
## What Is a Nondiscrimination Rule?

A nondiscrimination rule is a clause found in [qualified retirement plans](/qrp) expressing that all employees of a company must be eligible for similar benefits, regardless of their position inside the company. The rule holds plans back from being unfair toward profoundly compensated employees and company executives. Nondiscrimination rules are required for a plan to be considered qualified under the [Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA)](/erisa).

## Understanding Nondiscrimination Rules

Nondiscrimination rules must be kept up even when retirement plans, for example, [401(k)s](/401kplan) are amended or moved to another trustee, as indicated by ERISA guidelines. A company might offer [nonqualified plans](/non-qualified-plan), meaning that contributions are not tax-deductible, that are unfair or specific in nature, notwithstanding standard qualified plans.

A [investment policy statement](/ips) is prescribed to act as a guideline for investment choices to be made. The statement might remember remarks for [risk tolerance](/risktolerance), investment philosophy, time skylines, asset classes, and expectations in regards to rates of return.

ERISA has requirements for [vesting options](/vesting) also. Plan benefits might require a vesting period before employees earn the right to the benefit on the off chance that they leave the company. ERISA regulations limit the length of such a vesting period to a reasonable schedule.

### IRAs Not Subject

Not all employer plans are subject to ERISA. For instance, government retirement plans are exempt from ERISA. IRAs are not subject to ERISA in light of the fact that a [individual retirement account (IRA)](/ira) isn't viewed as an employer plan. Additionally, nonqualified plans, which don't qualify for[ tax-deductible ](/tax-deduction)contributions, are not subject to ERISA.

For small organizations, a [Simplified Employee Pension](/sep) plan is fundamentally an IRA set up by an employer with the goal that it can add to employee retirement savings. Ordinarily, these plans are not subject to ERISA regulations.

## ERISA History

ERISA was enacted in 1974 to safeguard the rights of employees under retirement plans offered by their employers. Specifically, this set of laws was put into spot to address abnormalities in the administration of certain large [pension plans](/pensionplan). Notwithstanding its nondiscrimination rules specifying that all plan participants must be dealt with similarly, ERISA shields [retirement](/retirement) funds from employer blunder.

The plan's [trustee](/trustee) must oversee plan assets and pursue choices to the greatest advantage of the plan participants. The trustee can't sell assets to the plan or earn commissions from plan investments. Likewise, plan assets must be stayed with separate from assets. With respect to investment options, trustees for the plan must follow the [Prudent Investor Rule](/prudent-investor-rule).

## Features
