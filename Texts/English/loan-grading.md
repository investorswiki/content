# Loan Grading
## What Is Loan Grading?

Loan grading is a classification system that includes relegating a quality score to a loan in light of a borrower's [credit history](/credit-history), quality of the [collateral](/collateral), and the probability of repayment of the principal and interest. A score can likewise be applied to a portfolio of loans. Loan grading is part of a lending establishment's loan survey or credit risk system and is typically a part of the credit underwriting and endorsement processes.

There are many purposes for a loan survey system, for example, distinguishing loans with credit shortcomings so banks can do whatever it takes to limit credit risk, recognizing trends influencing the collectability of the loan portfolio, and for financial and regulatory reporting purposes.

## How Loan Grading Works

Having the option to deal with their lending capacity really is central to the outcome of a bank. Thus, banks must think of a loan grading system that precisely assesses credit risk, or the likelihood of loss due to a borrower's inability to make payments. The processes that banks use to grade loans assist examiners and management with settling on great lending choices. There is nobody right system for grading loans, albeit the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) expects that all lending institutions have a loan survey system. Bigger institutions might keep up with separate departments explicitly for loan checking on.

Contingent upon the size and complexity, banks foster various methodologies. Community banks frequently utilize more broad factors to judge the risk of a loan, while bigger, more complex institutions might depend on additional quantitative ways to deal with measure and monitor credit risk. While relegating a score to a loan, the examiner will survey the loan documentation, collateral, and the borrower's financial statements. The score considers the borrower's credit score as well as a combination of several indicators of credit risk from the credit report and loan application. These factors might incorporate the level of guarantor support, repayment history, cash flow, projected yearly expenses, and so forth.

More modest institutions ordinarily utilize an expert judgment system. In this system, a loan officer is entrusted with doling out a grade in light of their judgment and information. Different banks might utilize quantitative scorecards, or other displayed approaches, that consider changes in light of qualitative judgments. Since there are no regulatory requirements that order how a loan grading system is structured, it depends on banks to foster a system that is suitable for their size and complexity.
