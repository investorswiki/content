# Risk-Free Return
## What Is Risk-Free Return?

Risk-free return is the hypothetical return credited to an investment that furnishes a guaranteed return with zero risks. The [risk-free rate of return](/risk-freerate) addresses the interest on an investor's money that would be expected from a totally risk-free investment over a predefined period of time.

## Risk-Free Return Explained

The yield on [U.S. Treasury securities](/ustreasury) is viewed as a genuine illustration of a risk-free return. U.S. Treasuries are considered to have negligible risk since the government can't default on its debt. On the off chance that cash flow is low, the government can essentially print more money to cover its interest payment and principal repayment obligations. In this manner, investors generally utilize the interest rate on a three-month U.S. [Treasury bill](/treasurybill) (T-bill) as a proxy for the short-term risk-free rate since short-term government-gave securities have basically zero [risks of default](/defaultrisk), as they are backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. government.

The risk-free return is the rate against which different returns are measured. Investors that purchase a security with some measure of risk higher than a U.S. Treasury will demand a higher level of return than the risk-free return. The difference between the return earned and the risk-free return addresses the [risk premium](/riskpremium) on the security. As such, the return on a risk-free asset is added to a risk premium to measure the total expected return on investment.

## The most effective method to Calculate

The [Capital Asset Pricing Model](/capm) (CAPM), one of the fundamental models in finance, is utilized to compute the expected return on an investable asset by comparing the return on a security to the sum of the risk-free return and a risk premium, which depends on the [beta](/beta) of a security. The CAPM formula is displayed as:

R~a~ = Rf + [B~a~ x (R~m~ - Rf)]

where R~a~ = return on a security

B~a~ = beta of a security

Rf = risk-free rate

The risk premium itself is derived by taking away the risk-free return from the market return, as found in the CAPM formula as R~m~ - Rf. The market risk premium is the excess return expected to remunerate an investor for the extra volatility of returns they will experience far beyond the risk-free rate.

## Special Considerations

The idea of a risk-free return is likewise a fundamental part of the [Black-Scholes option pricing model](/blackscholes) and [Modern Portfolio Theory](/modernportfoliotheory) (MPT) on the grounds that it basically sets the benchmark above which assets that have risk ought to perform.

In theory, the risk-free rate is the base return an investor ought to expect for any investment, as any amount of risk wouldn't be tolerated except if the expected rate of return was greater than the risk-free rate. There is no such thing as in practice, in any case, the risk free rate; even the most secure investments carry a tiny amount of risk.

## Features
- Thusly, the interest rate on a three-month U.S. Treasury bill is in many cases utilized as a substitute for the short-term risk-free rate, since it has practically no risk of default.
- There is no such thing as a risk free return, and is in this manner hypothetical, as all investments carry some risk.
- Risk-free return is a hypothetical number addressing the expected return on an investment that conveys no risks.
- U.S. Treasuries are viewed as a genuine illustration of a risk-free investment since the government can't default on its debt.
