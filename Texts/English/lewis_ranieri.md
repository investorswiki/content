## Remarkable Accomplishments

In 1977, savings and loans banks were feeling the financial challenges engaged with funding short-term, higher-premium demand deposits with longer-term, low-premium mortgages. Therefore, banks would have rather not held such a large number of mortgages. This limited mortgage issuance and smothered the housing market. Ranieri conceived an original solution where he made five-and 10-year bonds from 30-year mortgages. These new [mortgage-backed securities](/mbs) (MBS) assisted Ranieri with drawing in a bigger crowd of investors, taking the mortgages off the banks' books and permitting them to issue new mortgages as the existing ones were cut up and sold off.

Ranieri wasn't the sole psyche behind the creation of the mortgage-backed security, however he was the greatest boss in guaranteeing that the new investment flourished. Notwithstanding the MBS, Ranieri assumed a part in making the [collateralized mortgage obligation](/cmo) (CMO), one more complex repackaging of debt.

Notwithstanding, when enunciated, the practice of securitization spread far and wide through the financial world. Right up 'til now, securitization assumes a critical part in all that from credit card debt to the national debts of non-industrial countries. Ranieri passed on Salomon Brothers to found Hyperion Partners before founding his current venture, Ranieri Partners, as an advisor and manager of private investments.

> Initially, MBSs were just recognized by a small bunch of states as genuine investments, however Ranieri's activities ultimately prompted federal government measures that upheld these securities as a substantial investment asset class, leading to the development of the bond market. Hence, Ranieri is viewed as the dad of securitization.
