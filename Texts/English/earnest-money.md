# Earnest Money
Buying a home accompanies upfront costs, including the down payment, closing costs, and earnest money.
## What is earnest money?
***
#### Earnest money definition
Earnest money is an upfront payment, otherwise called a deposit, that exhibits your intent to buy a home. By paying earnest money, you're showing that you're serious about the purchase.
***
"At closing, the earnest money deposit is credited toward the buyer's purchase of the home," makes sense of Lee Hunt, a senior loan originator with Motto Mortgage Simplified in Aiken, South Carolina.
## How does earnest money function?
The purpose of an earnest money deposit is to show the seller that the buyer is serious about their offer by putting some "dog in the fight," says Bill Golden, associate broker with RE/MAX Around Atlanta.
"It tells a seller that the buyer means to consent to the terms of the purchase and sale agreement," Hunt says.
By and large, you'll have to deposit the earnest money in the span of a little while after your offer is accepted. The funds are then held by the real estate brokerage in an escrow account while you and the seller work to conclude the deal. In Georgia, the earnest money is held by one of the real estate brokers in the transaction, or in some cases by an attorney, Golden says.
## Is earnest money required?
Earnest money isn't required by law, however it is standard practice, and the "majority of sellers demand it prior to accepting a contract," Hunt says.
## How much earnest money would it be a good idea for me to put down?
The amount of earnest money you'll have to pay is typically 1 percent of the home's purchase price, yet it can rely upon the type of transaction and the idea of the more extensive market. On a $355,000 home, for instance, you'd put down $3,550 as an earnest money deposit.
"In this competitive market, numerous buyers are offering essentially more to make their offer stick out," Golden notes. Since most real estate agreements have [contingencies](/contingency-proviso) to safeguard you as the buyer, giving over more earnest money to surrender you a leg accompanies moderately little risk.
"However long you pay severe thoughtfulness regarding the dates and terms, everything being equal, a buyer's earnest money is safe — the same length as they don't just try to walk away for an explanation excluded from the contract," Golden says.
## Is earnest money refundable?
"Earnest money is refundable under certain conditions, contingent upon how the contract is written," Golden says. "Most possibilities in the contract — including the inspection or due diligence period, the financing and the appraisal possibilities — safeguard the buyer's earnest money."
Thus, on the off chance that a deal falls through due to issues with the home inspection, for instance, you'll get your earnest money back. Here are a few common possibilities that permit you to recover your deposit:
- **Financing contingency:** This applies assuming the mortgage lender denies your loan and you can't get financing for the home purchase.
- Appraisal contingency: This becomes an integral factor on the off chance that the appraisal for the home turns out to be lower than the amount of the mortgage.
- **Inspection contingency:** This safeguards you on the off chance that the home inspection reveals issues you had close to zero insight into, or issues you and the seller aren't willing to address.

Assuming every one of the possibilities have been met, nonetheless, you actually back out of the deal, you're probably going to lose your deposit to the seller.
"Contracts are quite certain about the cycle in which the earnest money would be dispensed in such cases," Golden says.
## Step by step instructions to safeguard your earnest money deposit
You can safeguard your earnest money deposit in two ways:
- **Paying special attention to signs of** fraud - Do not give earnest money straightforwardly to a home seller, or wire the funds to the real estate brokerage, attorney or title company without first confirming the wire directions have been sent from a legitimate source. You can do this by calling the brokerage or company at the right telephone number — at times, fraudulent messages contain fake contact data, so be careful while settling on the decision.
- **Understanding how possibilities work** - Although a few buyers are forgoing possibilities to make their offer more competitive, that can misfire assuming that you want to walk away from the transaction. Have your real estate agent or attorney make sense of all possibilities and what your obligations are as the buyer, as well as the best method for deferring a contingency assuming that is the right strategy.
