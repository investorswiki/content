## What Is Behavioral Economics?

Behavioral Economics is the study of psychology as it connects with the economic decision-production processes of individuals and institutions. The two most important inquiries in this field are:

1. Are market analysts' suspicions of [utility](/utility) or profit maximization great approximations of real individuals' behavior?

2. Do individuals boost subjective expected utility?

Behavioral economics is frequently related with [normative economics](/normativeeconomics).

## Grasping Behavioral Economics

In an ideal world, individuals would continuously pursue optimal choices that furnish them with the best benefit and satisfaction. In economics, [rational choice theory](/rational-choice-theory) states that when humans are given different options under the conditions of [scarcity](/scarcity), they would pick the option that boosts their individual satisfaction. This theory [assumes](/ceterisparibus) that individuals, given their inclinations and limitations, are equipped for pursuing rational choices by effectively gauging the costs and benefits of every option accessible to them. An official conclusion pursued will be the best decision for the individual. The [rational person](/rational-behavior) has self-control and is unaffected by feelings and outer factors and, subsequently, realizes what is best for himself. Unfortunately behavioral economics makes sense of that humans are not rational and are unequipped for using sound judgment.

Behavioral economics draws on psychology and economics to investigate why individuals some of the time settle on irrational choices, and why and how their behavior doesn't follow the forecasts of economic models. Decisions, for example, the amount to pay for a cup of coffee, whether to go to graduate school, whether to seek after a solid lifestyle, the amount to [contribute towards retirement](/retirement-commitment), and so on are such decisions that the vast majority make eventually in their lives. Behavioral economics looks to make sense of why an individual chose to go for choice A, rather than choice B.

Since humans are emotional and quickly drawn offtrack creatures, they go with choices that are not in their [self-interest](/self-interest). For instance, as per the rational choice theory, to get in shape and is furnished with data about the number of calories accessible in every eatable product, he will opt just for the food products with negligible calories. Behavioral economics states that even if Charles has any desire to get more fit and focuses on eating quality food proceeding, his end behavior will be subject to cognitive bias, feelings, and social impacts. Assuming that a commercial on TV publicizes a brand of ice cream at an appealing price and statements that all human creatures need 2,000 calories per day to function effectively all things considered, the mouth-watering ice cream picture, price, and apparently substantial statistics might lead Charles to fall into the sweet enticement and fall off of the weight loss [bandwagon](/bandwagon-impact), showing his lack of self-control.

## Applications

One application of behavioral economics is [heuristics](/heuristics), which is the utilization of rules of thumb or mental easy routes to pursue a quick choice. Nonetheless, when the decision made leads to blunder, heuristics can lead to cognitive bias. Behavioral [game theory](/gametheory), a rising class of game theory, can likewise be applied to behavioral economics as game theory runs tries and examines individuals' decisions to go with irrational decisions. One more field in which behavioral economics can be applied to is behavioral finance, which looks to make sense of why investors settle on rash choices while trading in the [capital markets](/capitalmarkets).

Companies are progressively consolidating behavioral economics to increase sales of their products. In 2007, the price of the 8GB iPhone was presented for $600 and quickly marked down to $400. In any case, consider the possibility that the [intrinsic value](/intrinsicvalue) of the telephone was $400. In the event that Apple presented the telephone for $400, the initial reaction to the price in the smartphone market could have been negative as the telephone may be believed to be too pricey. Be that as it may, by introducing the telephone at a higher price and bringing it down to $400, consumers accepted they were getting a very decent deal and sales flooded for Apple. Likewise, consider a cleanser manufacturer who creates a similar cleanser yet markets them in two distinct packages to appeal to different target gatherings. One package promotes the cleanser for all cleanser users, the other for consumers with sensitive skin. The last option target could never have purchased the product in the event that the package didn't determine that the cleanser was for sensitive skin. They opt for the cleanser with the sensitive skin label even however it's precisely the same product in the general package.

As companies comprehend that their consumers are irrational, an effective method for implanting behavioral economics in the organization's decision-production policies that concern its internal and outside partners might end up being advantageous whenever done appropriately.

Outstanding individuals in the study of behavioral economics are [Nobel](/alfred-nobel) laureates [Gary Becker](/gary-s-becker) (thought processes, consumer botches; 1992), [Herbert Simon](/herbert-a-simon) (limited rationality; 1978), [Daniel Kahneman](/daniel-kahneman) (illusion of legitimacy, anchoring bias; 2002), [George Akerlof](/george-a-akerlof) (tarrying; 2001), and [Richard H. Thaler](/mentalaccounting) (prodding, 2017).
