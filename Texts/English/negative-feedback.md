# Negative Feedback
## What Is Negative Feedback?

Negative feedback can be defined as a system where results quiet or moderate the initial contributions, with a hosing effect. With regards to [contrarian investment](/contrarian), an investor utilizing a negative feedback strategy would buy stocks when prices decline and sell stocks when prices rise, which is something contrary to what a great many people do. Negative feedback, by this definition, helps make markets less unpredictable by pushing systems towards equilibrium.

Its inverse is [positive feedback](/positive-feedback), in which a decent outcome is propagated, or when herd mentality pushes raised prices ever higher.

Negative feedback is likewise utilized casually (despite the fact that it is technically wrong) as a system where results are directed back as contributions to intensify some negative outcome, in this manner deteriorating a terrible situation, like an economic panic or a [deflationary spiral](/deflationary-spiral). This utilization is technically erroneous as it is an illustration of a positive feedback loop that exacerbates a negative outcome. In any case, many individuals (erroneously) utilize the term negative feedback loop in this specific circumstance.

## How Negative Feedback Works

Many individuals accept financial markets can display feedback loop behaviors. Initially developed as a theory to make sense of economics principles, the idea of feedback loops is presently ordinary in different areas of finance, including [behavioral finance](/behavioralfinance) and capital markets theory.

With negative feedback, events like stock price drops, bearish news headlines, social media bits of hearsay, and shocks produce responses that settle or reverse that initial outcome. Dip buyers or profit-taking sellers, for example, can assist with limiting the seriousness of a selloff or rally.

This varies from positive feedback, where contribution from a generally minor initial event can snowball into a consistently intensifying lower spiral. Financial panics and market declines are instances of positive feedback in markets that head in the negative bearing. Bubbles are positive feedback loops that rather send prices higher.

> Warren Buffett is frequently quoted as saying the markets are regularly silly; this is as opposed to defenders of the [efficient market hypothesis](/efficientmarkethypothesis) (EMH), who might say that markets are consistently efficient. Thusly, troubled stocks might be priced lower than a rational investor would expect just on the grounds that a few investors are more panicked or critical than most. At the point when this cycle perseveres, the price can be driven below rational fundamental levels. This can happen in light of a negative feedback loop.

## Special Considerations

Feedback inside financial markets takes on essentially greater significance during periods of distress. Given people's propensity to blow up to greed and fear, markets tend to get sporadic during snapshots of vulnerability. The panic during sharp [market corrections](/rectification) outlines this point plainly.

Such feedback, even for harmless issues, turns into a negative inevitable cycle (or loop) that feeds on itself. Investors, seeing others panic, thusly, panic themselves, establishing an environment that is challenging to reverse.

Notwithstanding, many markets are reestablished to some kind of [equilibrium](/economic-equilibrium) through negative feedback. Arbitrage, [value investors](/valueinvesting), and spread traders all look to profit from mispricings created by positive feedback loops by taking restricting situations to the emotional response.

> One way investors can safeguard themselves from dangerous feedback loops is by [diversifying](/expansion) their investments. The negative, inevitable cycles displayed during the financial crisis of 2008, for instance, were exorbitant for a huge number of Americans.
