# Life Expectancy Method
## What Is the Life Expectancy Method?

The life expectancy method is an approach to computing [individual retirement account](/ira) (IRA) distribution payments by separating the balance or total value of a retirement account by the policyholder's anticipated length of life. The life expectancy method is the most clear method of computing [required least distributions](/requiredminimumdistribution) (RMDs) for retirement accounts by the [Internal Revenue Service](/irs) (IRS).

## Grasping the Life Expectancy Method

RMDs are required distributions that must be removed from certain retirement accounts once the owner arrives at age 72. If it's not too much trouble, note that the IRS suspended RMDs for retirement accounts, including IRAs and [401(k)s](/401kplan) for 2020 However, this exemption isn't in place for 2021.

The life expectancy method is utilized to compute RMDs from traditional IRAs or [qualified retirement accounts](/qrp, for example, 401(k) plans. The base withdrawal amounts must be taken from these accounts starting at age 72.

This method utilizes IRS life expectancy factors alongside the value of your IRA in the time of distribution before that year's withdrawal. This is, hence, a variable method, and on the off chance that your IRA value increases or diminishes, the year's distribution amount will increase or diminish in like manner. This is likewise the case with regards to your life expectancy.

## Types of Life Expectancy Methods

There are two types of life expectancy methods: the [term-certain](/termcertainannuity) method and the recalculation method.

### Term-Certain Method

In the term-certain method, [distribution](/distribution) or withdrawal from the retirement account depends on your life expectancy at the hour of the first withdrawal. With each following year, the account is consistently drained as life expectancy diminishes by one year. The retirement account will ultimately be vacant once you arrive at your life expectancy age. Consequently, certain individuals may totally run through their funds on the off chance that they outlast their life expectancy.

### Recalculation Method

To offset the risk of outlasting [annuity](/annuity) payments, some pick the recalculation method, which varies from the term-certain method by recalculating your life expectancy consistently. In this case, you are pulling out as little as conceivable from your account. Be that as it may, if your beneficiary bites the dust rashly, you would need to refigure withdrawals in view of your life expectancy alone.

## Illustration of the Life Expectancy Method

We should take a gander at the case of a 54-year-old single lady who picks the term-certain method of life expectancy withdrawals. In this scenario, if the lady has any desire to start getting IRA distributions in 2021, she must first compute the total account value as of Dec. 31, 2020, as well as her life expectancy as per IRS Publication 590 Appendix C. Assuming the account value were $100,000 and her life expectancy is 30.5 years, the amount she can receive in distributions every year is $3,278.69.

The next year, the now 55-year-old would again observe the account balance on Dec. 31 and partition the amount by 29.6, her new life expectancy. Basically, the more seasoned she turns into, the more limited her life expectancy becomes, albeit this relationship isn't linear.

## Features
- The life expectancy method is the primary approach to sorting out your RMD amounts.
- RMDs are required distributions that must be removed from certain retirement accounts once the owner arrives at age 72. (Note that RMDs were suspended for 2020.)
- The life expectancy method considers your actuarial life expectancy and the starting account balance.
