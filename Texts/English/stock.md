## What Is a Stock?

A stock (otherwise called an equity) is a security that addresses the ownership of a negligible part of a [corporation](/corporation). This entitles the owner of the stock to a proportion of the corporation's [assets](/center assets) and profits equivalent to how much stock they own. Units of stock are called "shares."

Stocks are bought and sold dominatingly on stock exchanges (however there can be private sales too) and are the foundation of numerous individual investors' portfolios. These transactions need to conform to government regulations that are intended to shield investors from fraudulent practices. By and large, they have outperformed most different investments over the [long run](/longrun). These investments can be purchased from most online stockbrokers.

## Figuring out Stocks

Corporations issue (sell) stock to raise funds to operate their businesses. The holder of stock (a shareholder) buys a piece of the corporation and, contingent upon the type of shares held, may have a claim to part of its assets and earnings. All in all, a [shareholder ](/shareholder)is now an owner of the responsible company. Not entirely set in stone by the number of shares a person claims relative to the number of [outstanding shares](/outstandingshares). For instance, on the off chance that a company has 1,000 shares of stock outstanding and one person possesses 100 shares, that person would claim and have a claim to 10% of the company's assets and [earnings.](/earnings)

Stockholders don't **own** corporations; they own shares issued by corporations. In any case, corporations are a special type of organization on the grounds that the law regards them as legal persons. At the end of the day, corporations file taxes, can borrow, can possess property, can be sued, and so forth. The possibility that a corporation is a "person" means that the corporation **owns its own assets**. A corporate office full of chairs and tables has a place with the corporation, and **not** to the shareholders.

This differentiation is important in light of the fact that corporate property is legally isolated from the property of shareholders, which limits the [liability](/liability) of both the corporation and the shareholder. In the event that the corporation fails, a judge might order its assets sold â€” yet your personal assets are all not at risk. The court couldn't force you to sell your shares, albeit the value of your shares will have fallen radically. In like manner, on the off chance that a major shareholder fails, they can't sell the company's assets to pay off their [creditors](/lender).

## Stockholders and Equity Ownership

What shareholders really own are shares issued by the corporation, and the corporation claims the assets held by a firm. So on the off chance that you own 33% of the shares of a company, it is wrong to declare that you own one-third of that company; it is rather right to state that you own 100% of one-third of the company's shares. Shareholders can't do however they see fit a corporation or its assets. A shareholder can't walk out with a chair on the grounds that the corporation claims that chair, not the shareholder. This is known as the "division of ownership and control."

Claiming stock gives you the right to vote in shareholder gatherings, receive [dividends](/dividend) (which are the company's profits) if and when they are distributed, and it gives you the right to sell your shares to another person.

On the off chance that you own a majority of shares, your voting power increments so you can in a roundabout way control the bearing of a company by delegating its board of directors. This turns out to be most apparent when one company buys another: The obtaining company doesn't circumvent buying up the building, the chairs, and the workers; it buys up every one of the shares. The board of directors is responsible for expanding the value of the corporation and frequently does as such by hiring professional managers, or officers, for example, the [chief executive officer](/ceo), or CEO.

For most ordinary shareholders, not having the option to deal with the company isn't a big deal. The significance of being a shareholder is that you are qualified for a portion of the company's profits, which, as we will see, is the foundation of a stock's value. The more shares you own, the bigger the portion of the profits you get. Many stocks, be that as it may, don't pay out [dividends](/dividend) and on second thought reinvest profits once more into developing the company. These [retained earnings](/retainedearnings), in any case, are as yet reflected in the value of a stock.

## Common versus Preferred Stock

There are two fundamental types of stock: common and preferred. [Common stock](/commonstock) generally qualifies the owner for vote at shareholders' gatherings and to receive any dividends paid out by the corporation. [Preferred stockholders](/preferredstock) generally don't have [voting rights](/votingright), however they have a higher claim on assets and earnings than common stockholders. For instance, owners of preferred stock receive dividends before [common shareholders](/common_shareholder) and have priority if a company fails and is liquidated.

Companies can issue new shares at whatever point there is a need to raise extra cash. This interaction weakens the ownership and rights of existing shareholders (gave they don't buy any of the new offerings). Corporations can likewise participate in stock buybacks, which benefit existing shareholders since they make their shares value in value.

## Stocks versus Bonds

Stocks are issued by companies to raise [capital](/capital), paid-up or share, to develop the business or embrace new activities. There are important differentiations between whether someone buys shares straightforwardly from the company when it issues them (in the [primary market](/primarymarket)) or from another shareholder (on the [secondary market](/secondarymarket)). At the point when the corporation issues shares, it does as such in return for money.

Bonds are fundamentally not the same as stocks in that frame of mind of ways. In the first place, bondholders are creditors to the corporation and are qualified for interest as well as repayment of principal. Creditors are given legal priority over different stakeholders in the event of a bankruptcy and will be made whole first on the off chance that a company is [forced to sell assets](/sellout) to repay them. Shareholders, then again, are last in line and frequently receive nothing, or simple pennies on the dollar, in the event of bankruptcy. This suggests that stocks are intrinsically riskier investments than bonds.

## The Bottom Line

A stock addresses fractional ownership of equity in an organization. It is not quite the same as a bond, which is more similar to a loan made by creditors to the company in return for periodic payments. A company issues stock to raise capital from investors for new undertakings or to extend its business operations. There are two types of stock: common stock and preferred stock. Contingent upon the type of stock they hold, the stock owner has certain rights. A common stockholder can vote in shareholder gatherings and receive dividends from the company's profits, while the preferred stockholder receives dividends and preference over the common stockholder during company bankruptcy procedures.
