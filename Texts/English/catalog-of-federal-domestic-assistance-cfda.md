The Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance (CFDA) was a gathering of federal U.S. assistance programs that gave a full listing of programs accessible to corporate and government agencies, United States domains, and individuals from the American public.

Substances seeking assistance to programs through the Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance (CFDA) were required to have the authorization to conduct [business](/business) with the federal government. Programs listed through the catalog were related to a unique five-digit number.

A significant number of the U.S. federal government's agencies and departments offer grants, loans, scholarships, property, counseling, and different sorts of assistance inside the U.S. Beginning around 1984, data about these domestic assistance programs was accumulated by the General Services Administration, which distributed it in the Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance (CFDA). Many, yet not all, programs gave financial assistance. [Foreign aid](/foreign-aid) was excluded.

Substances that utilized the CFDA included:

- State and nearby governments (counting the District of Columbia)

Each CFDA number contained five digits and appeared as ##.###. The initial two digits indicated the agency responsible while the last three digits indicated the actual program.

The catalog was streamlined with nine other federal government systems in May 2018. The purpose was to make it simpler to work with the government for those authorized to do as such. The CFDA and these different systems are presently accessible through the Assistance Listings section of the new site: sam.gov.
