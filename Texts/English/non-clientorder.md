# Non-Client Order
## What is a Non-Client Order?

A non-client order is an order on an exchange made by a participant firm for the benefit of itself or a partner, officer, director, or employee of the firm.

A participant firm qualified for trade on an exchange is known as a [member firm](/memberfirm). Most securities exchanges confine a participant firm and its employees from trading in similar securities as their clients simultaneously. The restriction is intended to limit irreconcilable situations — perceived or genuine — that might happen when a participant firm contends with its clients for the execution of orders.

A non-client order is otherwise called a "proficient order," and a client order may likewise be known as a "customer order."

## Comprehend the Non-Client Order

A non-client order is carried out for the benefit of a brokerage firm or investment company, instead of in the interest of one of its clients. While these orders are permitted, priority must be given to client orders for similar securities.

At the point when orders to trade securities advance down to an exchange, the order must be set apart with the sort of client assignment that will benefiting from the trade. Since a broker acts as a [agent](/agent) for their customers, client orders are given priority and must be executed in full before the firm can start trading similar security for its own account.

At the point when a firm exchanges for itself, it is a non-client order and such order tickets will be stamped "N-C", "N", or "Emp" contingent upon the exchange, demonstrating that the order is a non-client order.

At the point when a broker acts as [principal](/principal) — that is, the broker straightforwardly buys or offers to its client taking the opposite side of the trade — then, at that point, the trade must likewise be stamped as needs be.

Order priority for client over non-client order flow is essential to forestall [front running](/frontrunning) (trading ahead) and other [principal-agent problems](/principal-agent-issue) that can emerge in securities markets.

With the coming of fully electronic trading and momentary price execution, a firm can basically trust that its client's order will fill before executing its own orders. This simplifies the cycle than in the days of yore, when it could require investment for orders to fill and they could stack up. By the by, the cycle stays a vital part of the system to keep away from front-running.

## Illustration of a Non-Client Order

In the event that a client submits an order to a broker to buy 1,000 shares of Apple (AAPL) and the firm likewise needs to buy 1,000 shares of AAPL, then the broker must initially execute the client's all's order before starting to take care of its own request.

That, yet the client ought to be qualified for the more positive prices given executions at numerous price levels that fill both the client and participant firm. As such, the broker ought not be intentionally filling the client at a more terrible price than they fill themselves.

With electronic trading, clients place trades quickly, and can be filled in a flash with [market orders](/marketorder) for instance. This gives the client more control over when and where they get filled. Accordingly, the occasions of brokers genuinely taking care of clients orders has declined, yet front running is as yet unlawful.
