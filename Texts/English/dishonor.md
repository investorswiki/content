# Dishonor
## What Is Dishonor?

Dishonor, in the business world, is the action of declining to satisfy contractual [obligations](/obligation) or pay a charge. Dishonoring a [transaction](/transaction) can happen in the event that a seller doesn't deliver the goods that were guaranteed, or when the buyer doesn't give payment to goods received.

In contracts, a party might dishonor the agreement by modifying the details, delivering late payment or goods, or neglecting to act on their required duties. At the point when a party has broken an agreement or commitment, they are supposed to be dishonored. Dishonoring a contractual obligation can be a [breach of contract](/breach-of-contract).

## Figuring out Dishonor

A [notice of dishonor](/notice-of-dishonor) is a notice given by the holder of a payment instrument to the endorser or cabinet, informing them that the payment has been dishonored, or denied. For instance, a [check](/check) that is returned unpaid in light of the fact that there are deficient funds for payment in the account on which it is drawn might be joined by a notice of dishonor, illuminating the cabinet that the payment has been dishonored.

A notice of dishonor must distinguish the bill, [note](/note), or instrument being dishonored and pull out to all required gatherings inside a reasonable period of time.

## Outcomes of Dishonored Payments and Contracts

Generally speaking, dishonoring a contract might bring about the other party ending its obligations. For instance, suppose you have a contract where you agreed to pay a month to month fee for telephone service. Assuming that you were discontent with the service and chose to protest by declining to pay the fee, you would disrespect the contract. Accordingly, the telephone company will probably cut off your service, in this manner ending your contract, until you produce the payment.

A [fee](/fee) or penalty may be forced for dishonoring a contract or giving as payment a [negotiable instrument](/negotiable-instrument) that can't be respected. If, in the above model, you eventually delivered payment for your telephone service, the company would reserve the right to charge an extra fee to restore your contract, since you dishonored it.

At times, dishonoring a contract may likewise leave you obligated to pay any funds actually owed by the terms of the contract.

At the point when a negotiable instrument is dishonored, like on account of a returned or bounced check, this, too, may cause a fee from the bank or institution on which the instrument is drawn. Most banks charge a fee for paying a check drawn on an account with lacking funds or for [overdrawing](/overdraft) an account.
