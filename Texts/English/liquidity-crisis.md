# Liquidity Crisis
## What Is a Liquidity Crisis?

A liquidity crisis is a financial situation portrayed by a lack of cash or effectively convertible-to-cash assets close by across numerous businesses or financial institutions simultaneously.

In a liquidity crisis, liquidity problems at individual institutions lead to an intense increase in demand and lessening in supply of liquidity, and the subsequent lack of accessible liquidity can lead to widespread defaults and even bankruptcies.

## Figuring out a Liquidity Crisis

Maturity mismatching, among assets and liabilities, as well as a subsequent lack of appropriately coordinated [cash flow](/cashflow), are ordinarily at the root of a liquidity crisis. Liquidity problems can happen at a single institution, yet a true liquidity crisis for the most part alludes to a simultaneous lack of liquidity across numerous institutions or a whole financial system.

## Single Business Liquidity Problem

At the point when a generally dissolvable business doesn't have the [liquid assets](/liquidasset) — in cash or other profoundly marketable assets — important to meet its short-term obligations it faces a liquidity problem. Obligations can incorporate repaying loans, paying its continuous operational bills, and paying its employees.

These business might have sufficient value in total assets to meet all these over the long haul, however on the off chance that it needs more cash to pay them really, then it will default and could eventually enter bankruptcy as creditors demand repayment. The root of the problem is normally a mismatch between the maturities of investments the business has made and the liabilities the business has incurred to finance its investments.

This delivers a cash flow problem, where the anticipated revenue from the business' different tasks doesn't show up soon enough or in adequate volume to make payments toward the relating financing.

For businesses, this type of cash flow problem can be altogether kept away from by the business picking investment projects whose expected revenue matches the repayment plans for any connected financing all around ok to stay away from any missed payments.

Then again, the business can try to match maturities on a continuous basis by assuming extra short-term debt from lenders or keeping an adequate self-financed reserve of liquid assets close by (in effect depending on equity holders) to make payments surprisingly. Numerous businesses do this by depending on short-term loans to address business issues. Frequently this financing is structured for under a year and can assist a company with fulfilling payroll and different needs.

On the off chance that a business investments and debt are mismatched in maturity, extra short-term financing isn't accessible, and self-financed reserves are not adequate, then the business will either have to sell different assets to produce cash, known as liquidating assets, or face default. At the point when the company faces a shortage of liquidity, and in the event that the liquidity problem can't not tackled by liquidating adequate assets to meet its obligations, the company must declare bankruptcy.

Banks and financial institutions are particularly helpless against these sort of liquidity problems since a lot of their revenue is created by lending long-term on loans for home mortgages or capital investments and borrowing short-term from depositors accounts. Maturity mismatching is a normal and inherent part of the business model of most financial institutions, thus they are as a rule in a persistent position of expecting to secure funds to meet immediate obligations, either through extra short-term debt, self-financed reserves, or liquidating long-term assets.

## Liquidity Crisis

Individual financial institutions are not by any means the only ones who can have a liquidity problem. At the point when numerous financial institutions experience a simultaneous shortage of liquidity and draw down their self-financed reserves, look for extra short-term debt from credit markets, or try to sell-off assets to create cash, a liquidity crisis can happen. Interest rates rise, least required reserve limits become a binding imperative, and assets fall in value or become unsaleable as everybody attempts to sell on the double.

The intense requirement for liquidity across institutions turns into a mutually self-supporting [positive feedback loop](/positive-feedback) that can spread to impact institutions and businesses that were not initially facing any liquidity problem all alone.

Whole nations — and their economies — can become overwhelmed in this situation. For the economy as a whole, a liquidity crisis means that the two fundamental wellsprings of liquidity in the economy — banks loans and the commercial paper market — become suddenly scant. Banks reduce the number of loans they make or stop making loans through and through.

Since such countless non-financial companies depend on these loans to meet their short-term obligations, this lack of lending has a ripple effect all through the economy. In a trickle-down effect, the lack of funds impacts a plenty of companies, which thus influences individuals employed by those organizations.

A liquidity crisis can unfurl in response to a specific [economic shock](/economic-shock) or as a feature of a normal [business cycle](/businesscycle). For instance, during the financial crisis of the [Great Recession](/great-recession), many banks and non-bank institutions had huge segments of their cash come from short-term funds that were put towards financing long-term mortgages. At the point when short-term interest rates increased and real estate prices fell, such arrangements forced a liquidity crisis.

A negative shock to economic expectations could drive the deposit holders with a bank or banks to make sudden, large withdrawals, in the event that not their whole accounts. This might be due to worries about the stability of the specific institution or more extensive economic impacts. The account holder might see a need to have cash close by immediately, maybe on the off chance that widespread economic declines are feared. Such activity can leave banks lacking in cash and unfit to cover every single registered account.
