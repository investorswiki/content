# Auditor's Report

An auditor's report is a written letter from the [auditor](/auditor) containing their perspective on whether a company's financial statements conform to [generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP)](/gaap) and are free from material misstatement.

The independent and outer audit report is normally distributed with the company's [annual report](/annualreport). The auditor's report is important in light of the fact that banks and creditors require an audit of a company's financial statements before lending to them.

## How an Auditor's Report Works

An auditor's report is a written letter joined to a company's financial statements that offers its viewpoint on a company's compliance with standard accounting rehearses. The auditor's report is required to be documented with a public company's financial statements while reporting earnings to the [Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)](/sec).

Be that as it may, an auditor's report isn't an evaluation of whether a company is a wise investment. Additionally, the audit report isn't an analysis of the company's earnings performance for the period. All things considered, the report is just a measure of the dependability of the financial statements.

- The third section contains the [auditor's opinion](/auditors-assessment).

An extra passage might illuminate the investor regarding the consequences of a separate audit on one more function of the entity. The investor will key in on the third passage, where the assessment is stated.

The type of report issued will be dependent on the discoveries by the auditor. Below are the most common types of reports issued for companies.

For instance, an error could have been made in working out operating expenses or profit. Auditors normally state the specific reasons and areas where the issues are available with the goal that the company can fix them.

### Adverse Opinion

An adverse assessment is the absolute worst outcome for a company and can have an enduring impact and legal implications in the event that not revised.
