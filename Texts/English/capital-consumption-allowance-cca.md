# Capital Consumption Allowance (CCA)
## What Is Capital Consumption Allowance (CCA)?

Capital consumption allowance (CCA), once in a while alluded to as depreciation, is the amount of money a country needs to spend every year to keep up with its current level of economic production.

## Understanding Capital Consumption Allowance (CCA)

CCA is calculated as a percentage of [gross domestic product](/gdp) (GDP). The percentage of GDP not allocated to the CCA is called [net domestic product](/netdomesticproduct) and addresses investment spending.

A CCA that is too high a percentage of GDP is many times an indicator of poor [economic growth](/economicgrowth). This situation happened in the United States during [the Great Recession](/great-recession) of 2008. As indicated by a U.S. Census Bureau survey, nonfarm investment spending prior to the recession was $1.37 trillion. By 2009, it had declined to 1.09 trillion, a lessening of 20.7%. Real GDP, which is inflation adjusted, tumbled to $15.21 trillion toward the finish of 2009 from $15.64 trillion two years sooner. In the mean time, CCA rose to $1.56 trillion toward the finish of 2009 from $1.35 trillion of every 2007. Thus, CCA went to 10.2% of GDP by 2009 from 8.67% of GDP in 2007.

Capital goods allude to things that assist a producer with making consumer products and services. For example, on the off chance that a pizza is a consumer decent, the broiler it came from is viewed as a capital decent. Consumers don't buy pizza broilers, yet they buy the pizzas they cook surprisingly fast out. Capital stock likewise incorporates weighty equipment used to make different types of things that consumers buy, like cars, however it additionally incorporates more modest things like the computer a writer deals with.

All capital goods have what accountants call a [useful life](/usefullife), or how long that capital kindness have the option to take care of its business to assist a producer with keeping creating. The average pizza broiler, for example, has a helpful life of around 10 years. Each year, that broiler gets a ton of wear and tear, so it is worth not exactly the year before. Accordingly, the pizza place proprietor will devalue that broiler over its valuable life of baking pizzas. Accounting depreciation discounts the value of that broiler on the owners books consistently until it has a value of $0 toward the finish of its helpful life.

The CCA measures how much the value of the stock of capital goods owned by a country declines in a given year by measuring economic depreciation, which incorporates accounting depreciation as well as different explanations behind declines in value, like destruction or obsolescence.

A capital consumption allowance will decline in a nation on the off chance that enough of the underlying capital goods decline in value. Here are a portion of the reasons that such a decline could occur:

- Ordinary wear and tear from customary use.
- Capital goods break down before they should and become unusable. They can likewise be harmed or annihilated by fire or natural fiascos like flooding.
- Capital goods frequently become technologically obsolete. While the sewing machine was developed a long time back, all the old spinning jennies used to make clothing became obsolete.

Changes in the capital consumption allowance can in some cases help to affirm leading economic signs, yet it is a [lagging indicator](/laggingindicator) in practice.

## Highlights
- Eliminating the capital cost allowance from GDP gives you the net domestic product for that year.
- While changes in the CCA might affirm economic trends, it is as yet a regressive looking figure.
- The capital consumption allowance (CCA) addresses depreciation in the overall economy and is communicated as a percentage of GDP.
- CCA that is too high a percentage of GDP shows poor economic growth.
