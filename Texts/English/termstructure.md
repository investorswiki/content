# Term Structure Of Interest Rates
## What Is the Term Structure Of Interest Rates?

The term structure of interest rates, usually known as the [yield curve](/yieldcurve), portrays the interest rates of comparable quality [bonds](/bond) at various [maturities](/maturity).

## Understanding Term Structure Of Interest Rates

Basically, term structure of interest rates is the relationship between interest rates or [bond yields](/bond-yield) and various terms or maturities. At the point when diagramed, the term structure of interest rates is known as a yield curve, and it assumes a pivotal part in distinguishing the current state of an economy. The term structure of interest rates mirrors the expectations of market participants about future changes in [interest rates](/interestrate) and their assessment of [monetary policy](/monetarypolicy) conditions.

Overall terms, yields increase in accordance with maturity, leading to a vertical slanting, or normal, yield curve. The yield curve is principally used to illustrate the term structure of interest rates for standard U.S. official securities. This is important as it is a check of the debt market's inclination about risk. One normally utilized yield curve compares the three-month, two-year, five-year, 10-year, and 30-year [U.S. Treasury](/ustreasury) debt. (Yield curve rates are generally accessible at the Treasury's interest rate website by 6:00 p.m. Eastern Standard Time each trading day).

The term of the structure of interest rates has three primary shapes.

1. Up inclining — long-term yields are higher than short-term yields. This is viewed as the "normal" slant of the yield curve and signals that the economy is in an expansionary mode.
1. Descending slanting — short-term yields are higher than long-term yields. Named as an "inverted" yield curve and connotes that the economy is in, or going to enter, a latent period.
1. Level — very little variation among short and long-term yields. This signals that the market is uncertain about the future bearing of the economy.

## The U.S. Treasury Yield Curve

The U.S. Treasury yield curve is viewed as the benchmark for the credit market since it reports the yields of risk-free fixed income investments across a scope of maturities. In the credit market, banks and lenders utilize this benchmark as a check for determining lending and savings rates. Yields along the U.S. Treasury yield curve are essentially impacted by the [Federal Reserve's](/federalreservebank) federal funds rate. Other yield curves can likewise be developed in view of a comparison of credit investments with comparative risk qualities.

Most frequently, the Treasury yield curve is up inclining. One essential clarification for this phenomenon is that investors demand higher interest rates for longer-term investments as compensation for investing their money in longer-length investments. Incidentally, long-term yields might fall below short-term yields, making an inverted yield curve that is generally viewed as a harbinger of [recession](/recession).

## The Outlook for the Overall Credit Market

The term structure of interest rates and the heading of the yield curve can be utilized to judge the overall credit market environment. A straightening of the yield curve means longer-term rates are falling in comparison to short-term rates, which could have suggestions for a recession. At the point when short-term rates start to surpass long-term rates, the yield curve is inverted, and a recession is reasonable happening or drawing closer.

At the point when longer-term rates fall below shorter-term rates, the outlook for credit over the long term is weak. This is frequently predictable with a weak or recessionary economy. While different factors, including foreign demand for U.S. Treasuries, can likewise bring about an inverted yield curve, by and large, an inverted yield curve has been an indicator of an approaching recession in the United States.
