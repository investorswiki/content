# Consumer Internet Barometer
## What Was the Consumer Internet Barometer?

The Consumer Internet Barometer was a quarterly survey report delivered by the [Conference Board](/conferenceboard) and TNS NFO that recorded, examined, and reported on the Internet utilization of 10,000 U.S. households.

The barometer was last distributed in 2009 and is presently not widely accessible or utilized as a reference. Be that as it may, the Consumer Internet Barometer could give a few helpful data of historical interest with regards to this critical period of transformation of the economy.

## Grasping the Consumer Internet Barometer

As levels of Internet utilize increased through the 1990s and 2000s, it was expected that online purchases would turn into a more important driver of the economy. In cooperation with TNS NFO, the Conference Board distributed the Consumer Internet Barometer trying to estimate this effect as the U.S. economy changed and digitized.

For instance, In a report from the Conference Board from November 2009, the Board noticed that consumers were expected to spend less over special times of year versus the year before, and refered to statistics from the final quarter 2009 Consumer Internet Barometer Survey.

All through the 2000s, the Consumer Internet Barometer archived the course of change in the economy as an ever increasing number of households got associated, trust in the security and financial infrastructure of web based business developed, and individuals invested more energy and money online. The survey measured things like:

- The significance of the Internet in the daily existences of households
- Overall satisfaction of Internet clients
- Online purchase attributes, times, and dates
- Clients' perceptions of security for online transactions and general Internet use

## Special Considerations

The rate of response to the survey was exceptionally high, making the Consumer Internet Barometer one of the most widely depended upon measures of U.S. consumer Internet use at that point. With the [dotcom](/dotcom) boom and bust, the rise of web based business, and the coming of big data, Internet use went from an original frontier in the economy to a prevailing and omnipresent force that essentially all organizations and industries are currently dependent on.

Amusingly, the strength and speed of the trends that the Consumer Internet Barometer was intended to measure at last outperformed the helpfulness of this indicator.

A significant number of the survey things and definitions that were pertinent to contemporary conditions appear to be ridiculously outdated by modern standards. For instance, in the survey, a household was viewed as "online" on the off chance that it reported being on the Internet no less than one time each month.

Today, when consistent Internet access through cell phones is basically the standard and when interruption of Internet services for even a couple of hours can make major disturbances of organizations and consumers, this criterion appears to be wonderful crude.

Besides, as the speed of change and transformation in the tech and telecommunications industries have accelerated many years, a quarterly survey of internet activity turned out to be less and less significant.

Today, when data on consumer behavior (online and off) is frequently collected, handled, and examined in real-time, a quarterly barometer of consumer internet activity is effectively obsolete, with the exception of maybe in the most marginal districts of the world that may not be completely penetrated by telecom services.

## Highlights
- The Consumer Internet Barometer was a quarterly survey and report on consumer Internet use in the U.S.
- The very growth and outcome of the Internet as an economic phenomenon was a major factor in the eventual obsolescence of the barometer.
- The barometer was last distributed in 2009.
