## The First Admission Board in America

In the midst of the show of the 1792 market crash, what might turn into the first "admission board" for a stock exchange met under a buttonwood tree at 68 Wall Street (as legend has it) and pledged to deal fundamentally among themselves and to respect least commission rates.

On March 8, 1817, a group that included four of the original endorsers of the [Buttonwood Agreement](/buttonwoodagreement) made an organization called the "New York Stock and Exchange Board," casually known as the "Board of Brokers." The Board of Brokers designed their constitution on that of the Philadelphia Exchange with seventeen rules that represented trading, accommodated admission and discipline of individuals, and looked to fix their control over the industry.

At this original exchange, the president sat before the individuals and "called the stocks." Members were required to go to all auction meetings, accommodated one-day delivery of securities, and precluded "[fictitious trades](/fictitious-exchange)," like matched orders or wash sales, usually used to impersonate genuine trading activity and invigorate outside investment. Punishments forced for infringement of these rules went from fines to suspension and ejection.

All along, admission standards stated that individuals needed to have drilled in the city for essentially a year. In 1820, commencement fees were forced to give evidence that a trader could follow through with losses. All new individuals were chosen by the full participation, with one repudiate adequate to keep a sketchy candidate out. The Board of Brokers likewise looked for some control over the industry in general, screening listed securities and distinguishing deceitful traders in a "dark book."
