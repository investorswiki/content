# Bitcoin Classic
## What Is Bitcoin Classic?

Bitcoin Classic was a proposed hard fork from Bitcoin Core that proposed expanding the maximum size of transaction blocks. In spite of early triumphs, Bitcoin Classic has failed to be widely adopted by the bitcoin community and didn't ultimately emerge. All things being equal, [Bitcoin Cash](/bitcoin-cash) was the primary effective fork to address bigger blocks in practice.

## Figuring out Bitcoin Classic

The original Bitcoin was developed by the anonymous Satoshi Nakamoto, who distributed a paper in 2008 called "Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System." The paper portrayed the utilization of a [peer-to-peer](/peertopeer-p2p-administration) network as a solution to the problem of double-spending (utilizing bitcoin for more than one transaction), with transaction subtleties added to the furthest limit of blockchains.

Due to the computational power expected to attack and decipher a blockchain, bitcoin can hold a high level of security. This has limited the requirement for transactions to go through centralized outsiders, like financial institutions.

At the core of Bitcoin is its reference software. The software standard for Bitcoin was delivered by [Satoshi Nakamoto](/satoshi-nakamoto) in 2008 and is alluded to as Bitcoin or Bitcoin Core. Since its send off, a number of improvements to the software have been proposed. These proposals frequently center around expanding the number of transactions that the system can handle, either by speeding up processes or by expanding the size of bitcoin blocks.

[Blocks](/block-bitcoin-block) are documents where Bitcoin data is permanently recorded. They are made when [miners](/bitcoin-mining) — individuals who give the computing power required to keep up with records of bitcoin transactions — add new transaction data through a hashing algorithm. Each time a block is completed it gives way to the next block in the blockchain, with blocks in Bitcoin Core are limited to one megabyte. As the number of transactions has increased, this size limit has brought about the development of bottlenecks that have dialed back transaction processing speeds. Bitcoin Classic tried to address this capacity issue by expanding the size of the blocks.

## The Block Size Debate

In 2016, Bitcoin Classic proposed expanding [blockchain](/blockchain) sizes from 1 megabyte to 2 megabytes. In effect, this would double the number of transactions that could be handled each second. The proposed increase was less aggressive than what was proposed by Bitcoin XT, which in 2015 proposed expanding the size of blocks to 8 megabytes.

Since Bitcoin isn't controlled by a single entity, choices concerning changes are made through consensus. Any changes proposed need to receive substantial support from the greater Bitcoin community. One of the primary explanations behind this approach is that any organization that pushes forward with a change that different gatherings have not agreed to can result in "[forking](/hard-fork)," and that means that the network that runs Bitcoin splits between various standards.

Guaranteeing that a proposal receives majority support decreases the possibility of clashing standards being utilized by various Bitcoin hubs and excavators. When another standard is accepted, previous software standards become obsolete.

Regardless of the number of over-burden blocks and transaction fees expanding, the number of hubs utilizing Bitcoin Classic never arrived at critical mass and the stage has since stopped operation. Toward the finish of 2016, Bitcoin Classic moved its position from expanding block sizes to 2 megabytes to permitting hubs and excavators to set their own block estimates, a comparable approach taken by Bitcoin Unlimited; by November of 2017, it had closed down altogether.

Be that as it may, the Bitcoin scalability problem stays squeezing for engineers and users, many actually see expanding blockchain sizes as the best method for speeding up transaction times as the number of transactions increases. Another Bitcoin [hard fork](/hard-fork) called Bitcoin Cash actually works on this rule; nonetheless, Bitcoin Cash's total number of transactions actually predominates that of Bitcoin.

## Highlights
- The block size banter was the consequence of increased interest and transaction volume in Bitcoin in the late 2010s. Several different proposals, for example, Bitcoin Cash were carried out.
- Bitcoin Classic was a proposed solution to worries about Bitcoin's limited block size.
- The proposal would have brought about a hard fork, yet never acquired sufficient community support to send off.
