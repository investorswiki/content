## What Is a Blow-Off Top?

A blow-off top is a chart pattern that shows a lofty and fast increase in a security's price and trading [volume](/volume), followed by a precarious and quick drop in price — as a rule on critical or high volume too. The quick changes indicated by a blow-off top, likewise called a blow-off move or exhaustion move, can be the consequence of genuine news or pure [speculation](/speculation).

## Figuring out the Blow-Off Top

Blow-off tops happen in all markets and can impact stocks, [futures](/futures), commodities, bonds, and currencies. A blow-off top shows that a [security's](/security) price is going to fall. However, this doesn't mean the price will fall right away. The rising part of a blow-off can last weeks. The early part of this rise might look uncommon, with big daily and week after week price gains. Yet, now and then, it actually may keep on raising for several additional weeks.

It is difficult to judge when precisely a blow-off top is in its reversal stage (and in addition to a [pullback](/pullback)) until the price begins dropping. Even then, at that point, it at times isn't until four or five days after the decline begins that it tends to be called a blow-off top. This is on the grounds that when a security is rising quickly, the price might pull back for a couple of days however at that point rise.

A blow-off top has several key traits, yet it is just in hindsight that we know whether it made a genuine top in price. Once in a while the price will rise quickly, then delay or pull back somewhat, and afterward keep rising. Subsequently, the blow-off top must be made out of a precarious rise and steep fall to qualify.

Blow-off top patterns are common in securities where there is a great deal of speculative interest. Prices rise, for the most part on positive news or on the prospect of good future news, like future growth or the release of a positive medication trial, for instance.

As the price rises, an ever increasing number of individuals get energized. More individuals likewise begin to feel they are missing out, and they would rather not pass up a great opportunity any longer, so they buy. The higher the price goes, the greater the number of individuals tricked in to buy, bringing about additional price increases and rising volume.

Blow-off tops are frequently outstandingly [volatile](/instability). Close to the end, when the reversal is happening, [slippage](/slippage) on orders is undeniably more probable as the price is moving so fast. When the price begins to drop, it tends to be extremely challenging to go anyplace close to the top since everybody scrambles for the exits, selling, at the same time.

After the enormous rise, thus many individuals buying, there is nobody passed on to buy. In any case, there are loads of individuals who are overreacting to sell, [locking in profits](/lock_in_profits), or attempting to limit losses.

## Distinguishing Blow-Off Tops

From the beginning, blow-off tops might seem like strong meetings. A strong [rally](/rally) may rise at a 45-degree point, yet in a blow-off situation the point of climb is practically vertical.

A few common qualities of blow-off tops include:

- **Limited Pullbacks**: Blow-off tops are gigantic — close to vertical — rallies with no significant pullbacks. This separates them from securities that are just in a strong [uptrend](/uptrend). On the off chance that pullbacks do happen, they are normally only one to three days, after which the price energizes again.
- **Gigantic Price Increases**: These types of tops don't come after average rises. The price might rise a couple hundred or even two or three thousand percent, with the biggest dollar (not really percentage) gains in the stock price coming in the last week or not many days of the move.
- **Negative Volume**: Blow-off tops are followed by sharp moves lower on gigantic volume, which demonstrates that [long](/long) traders are exiting the stock by the thousand.
- **Broader Market**: Blow-off tops are much of the time exacerbated by more extensive market conditions, and that means that a broad market [sell-off](/sell-off) could lead to a move lower.

In the event that traders have misidentified a blow-off top, or traded it wrong, it's generally expected best to exit the position from the get-go to try not to turn into a [bag holder](/bag-holder). Going [short](/short) too right off the bat in a blow-off can mean very large losses in the event that the loss isn't cut rapidly. Essentially, going long too late in a blow-off top scenario can mean tremendous losses when the price begins dropping and doesn't return to prior levels.

The people who effectively distinguish blow-off tops have a unique opportunity to capitalize on the overreaction of different traders.

## Illustration of a Blow-Off Top in Bitcoin

In 2017, [bitcoin](/bitcoin) was seeing a consistent price rise. From the get-go in the year, it traded momentarily above $1,000 and momentarily below $800, however at that point began to creep higher out of that reach. By mid-year, it was drawing nearer $3,000. By September it [tested](/test) $5,000, and by October it tried $6,000. As of now, the blow-off hadn't even begun, even however the price was at that point higher by several hundred percent.

Volume fired picking up in November however increased more in December. In December alone, the price went from $10,000 to almost $20,000. This was by a long shot the biggest dollar gain in the price.

During the primary part of the blow-off in December, the longest pullback was three days before the price began rising again. When the price began to [reverse](/reversal), it dropped for six days straight.

The selling began slowly, which doesn't necessarily in all cases occur. The price began dropping on moderately low volume, however as the price continued to drop (not many buyers left to support the price) there is a gigantic selling volume spike on the 6th day of the decline. On that day, a whole bundle of buyers got flushed out on a gigantic [intraday](/intraday) drop where the price moved more than $500.
