# Down-and-Out Option
## What Is a Down-and-Out Option?

A down-and-out option is a type of exotic option known as a [barrier option](/barrieroption). These options define the payout conditions in light of whether the price falls enough from the strike price to arrive at a designated barrier price. What occurs at the barrier price relies upon what kind of barrier option it is, either knock-in or knock-out.

## Understanding Down-and-Out Options

Considered a [exotic option](/exoticoption), a down-and-out option is one of two types of [knock-out](/knock-outoption) barrier options, the other being an up-and-out option. The two kinds come in the put and call assortments. A barrier option is a type of option where the payoff and the actual presence of the option rely upon whether the underlying asset arrives at a predetermined price.

A barrier option can be a knock-out or a knock-in. A knock-out means it lapses worthless if the underlying arrives at a certain price, limiting profits for the holder and limiting losses for the writer. The barrier option can likewise be a [knock-in](/knock-inoption). As a knock-in, it has no value until the underlying arrives at a certain price.

The critical concept is if the [underlying asset](/underlying-asset) arrives at the barrier whenever during the option's life, the option is knocked out, or terminated, and won't return into reality. It doesn't make any difference on the off chance that the underlying moves back to pre-knock-out levels.

For instance, a down-and-out option has a [strike price](/strikeprice) of 100 and a knock-out (barrier) price of 80. At the option's inception, the price of the stock was 95, however before the option was exercisable, the price of the stock arrived at 80. This valuation means the option automatically terminates worthless even if the underlying hits 100 before the [expiration date](/expirationdate).

A down-and-out option can be a [call](/calloption) or [put](/putoption). Both get knocked out assuming the underlying tumbles to the barrier price. For a [up-and-out option](/up-and-outoption), on the off chance that the underlying ascents to the barrier price, the option ceases to exist. The two calls and puts cease to exist in the event that the underlying ascents to its barrier price.

## Using Down-and-Out Options

Enormous institutions or [market markers](/marketmaker) make these options by direct agreement, for the primary explanation that valuing them is a complex undertaking. For instance, a portfolio manager can involve them as a more affordable method to [hedge](/hedge) against losses on a long position. The hedge would be less exorbitant than buying [vanilla put options](/vanillaoption). Notwithstanding, it would be imperfect since the buyer would be unprotected in the event that the security price diminished below the barrier price.

Pricing relies upon every one of the average options metrics with the knock-out feature adding an extra aspect. [European style](/europeanoption) expiration means the exercise may just occur at the expiration date. The alternative would be a [American-style](/americanoption) option, where the holder might exercise the option out of the blue at the latest expiration.

## Features
- The payout depends on the price behavior corresponding to a pre-defined barrier price.
- It very well may be a knock-in or knock-out type of option and the payout varies for each type.
- Down and out options are exotic options in light of a strike price and a barrier price.
