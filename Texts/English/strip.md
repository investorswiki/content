## What Is a Strip?

A strip is a bond coupon that has been taken out from the bond so the two parts can be sold separately, as an interest-paying coupon bond and as a zero-coupon bond. This cycle is taken care of by the brokerage or other financial institution that sells the products.

A strip is likewise alluded to as a stripped bond or a [z-bond](/z-bond).

In options, a strip is a strategy that includes being long in one call position and two put options, all with a similar strike price, to mitigate the expected loss.

## Strip Explained
### Strips in the Bond Market

Most bonds accompany the commitment that interest will be paid to its owners in a series of payments, normally month to month, until the bonds arrive at maturity. The principal is then returned to the investor.

The interest payments are known as the coupon since they used to be bits of paper that the investor would count on when a payment was due.

The strip interaction separates the interest from the bond itself. The bond turns into a zero-coupon bond to be sold separately at a discount to its face value. The buyer trades it out for face value when it matures. The difference in price is the profit.

### At the point when Strips are STRIPS

STRIPS is an abbreviation for Separate Trading of Registered Interest and Principal of Securities. A U.S. [Treasury bond](/treasurybond) is stripped by the commercial book-entry system in a cycle that successfully makes the interest payment and principal payment separate elements. The outcome is known as a [strip bond](/stripbond) or a zero-coupon bond.

### Illustration of a Strip Bond

The U.S. Treasury issues [Treasury notes](/treasurynote) that have semi-annual interest payments and mature in 10 years. The STRIPS interaction produces 21 separate debt securities, including 20 strip bonds and one zero-coupon bond.

> The U.S. Treasury sells STRIPS that are changed into interest payment products and zero-coupon bonds.

The base investment in a stripped fixed-rule note or Treasury security is $100. Any par amount above $100 must be stripped in categories of $100. These types of stripped bonds are alluring to investors saving put something aside for retirement or seeking a fixed payment investment. The risk of these types of investment vehicles is very low.

### Strips as an Options Strategy

An investor leads a strip strategy by purchasing two [put options](/putoption) and one [call option](/calloption) on a single underlying stock.

The investor who embraces this strategy accepts that the underlying price of the stock will fall in the close term future.

Every one of the three of the options will have a similar expiration date and the equivalent [exercise price](/exerciseprice). In the event that the investor is right and the price drastically diminishes, the puts will pay out substantially. In the event that the investor is off-base and the price of the underlying asset builds, the call option will alleviate the loss.
