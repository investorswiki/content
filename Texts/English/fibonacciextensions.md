# Fibonacci Extensions
## What Are Fibonacci Extensions?

Fibonacci extensions are a device that traders can use to lay out [profit targets](/profit-target) or estimate how far a price might go after a [pullback](/pullback) is done. Extension levels are likewise potential areas where the price might reverse.

Drawn as associations with points on a chart, these levels depend on Fibonacci ratios (as rates). Common Fibonacci extension levels are 61.8%, 100%, 161.8%, 200%, and 261.8%.

## Making Fibonacci Extensions

Fibonacci ratios are common in regular day to day existence and nature, found in universe developments, architecture, shells, typhoons, and a few plants. Consequently, a few traders accept these common ratios may likewise have significance in the financial markets.

Fibonacci extensions don't have a formula. At the point when the indicator is applied to a chart, the trader picks three points. The primary point picked is the beginning of a move, the subsequent point is the finish of a move and the third point is the finish of the retracement against that move. The extensions then, at that point, help project where the price could go next. When the three points are picked, the lines are drawn at rates of that move.

Extensions are drawn on a chart, checking price levels of conceivable significance. These levels depend on Fibonacci ratios (as rates) and the size of the price move the indicator is being applied to.

## The most effective method to Calculate Fibonacci Retracement Levels

You can work out Fibonacci retracement levels by finishing the accompanying steps:

1. Duplicate the difference between points one and two by any of the ratios wanted, for example, 1.618 or 0.618. This gives you a dollar amount.
1. On the off chance that projecting a price move higher, add the dollar amount above to the price at point three. On the off chance that projecting a price move lower, deduct the dollar amount from step one from the price at point three.

For instance, assuming that the price moves from $10 to $20, back to $15, $10 could be point one, $20 point two, and $15 point three. The Fibonacci levels will then, at that point, be projected out above $15, giving levels to the upside of where the price could go next. On the off chance that all things considered, the price drops, the indicator would should be redrawn to oblige the lower price at point three.

Assuming the price ascends from $10 to $20, and these two price levels are points one and two utilized on the indicator, then the 61.8% level will be $6.18 (0.618 x $10) over the price picked for point three. In this case, point three is $15, so the 61.8% extension level is $21.18 ($15 + $6.18). The 100% level is $10 above point three for an extension level of $25 ((1.0 x $10) + 15).

The actual ratios depend on something many refer to as the golden mean or ratio. To find out about this ratio, begin a sequence of numbers with zero and one, and afterward add the prior two numbers to wind up with a number string like this:

>
> 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144, 233, 377, 610, 987...
>

The Fibonacci extension levels are derived from this number string. Excluding the initial not many numbers, as the sequence gets moving, in the event that you partition one number by the prior number, you get a ratio drawing nearer 1.618, for example, isolating 233 by 144. Partition a number by two spots to one side and the ratio approaches 2.618. Partition a number by three to one side and the ratio is 4.236.

The key Fibonacci extension levels incorporate 23.6%, 38.2%, half, 61.8%, and 78.6%. Additionally common are 100%, 161.8%, 200%, and 261.8%. The 100% and 200% levels are not official Fibonacci numbers, but rather they are helpful since they project a comparative move (or a numerous of that transition) to what just occurred on the price chart.

## What Do Fibonacci Extensions Tell You?

Fibonacci extensions are a method for laying out price targets or find projected areas of support or resistance when the price is moving into an area where different methods of finding support or resistance are not applicable or obvious.

In the event that the price travels through one extension level, it might keep moving toward the next. All things considered, Fibonacci extensions are areas of **possible** interest. The price may not stop or reverse right at the level, but rather the area around it very well might be important. For instance, the price might move just past the 1.618 level, or pull up just short of it, before taking a different path.

In the event that a trader is [long](/long) on a stock and another high happens, the trader can utilize the Fibonacci extension levels for a thought of where the stock might go. The equivalent is true for a trader who is [short](/short). Fibonacci extension levels can be calculated to give the trader thoughts on profit target placement. The trader then, at that point, has the option to choose whether to cover the position at that level.

Fibonacci extensions can be utilized for any time span or in any market. Normally, [clusters](/fibonaccicluster) of Fibonacci levels show a price area that will be critical for the stock, and furthermore for traders in their decision making. Since extension levels can be drawn on various price waves over the long haul, when numerous levels from these various waves merge at one price, that could be a vital area.

## The Difference Between Fibonacci Extensions and Fibonacci Retracements

While extensions show where the price will go following a retracement, [Fibonacci retracement](/fibonacciretracement) levels demonstrate how deep a retracement could be. All in all, Fibonacci retracements measure the pullbacks inside a trend, while Fibonacci extensions measure the [impulse waves](/impulsewave) toward the trend.

## Limitations of Using Fibonacci Extensions

Fibonacci extensions are not meant to be the sole determinant of whether to buy or sell a stock. Investors ought to utilize extensions along with different indicators or [patterns](/design) while hoping to decide one or numerous price targets. Candlestick examples and [price action](/price-action) are particularly useful while attempting to decide if a stock is probably going to reverse at the target price.

There is no assurance price will reach or reverse at a given extension level. Even on the off chance that it does, it isn't obvious before a trade is taken which Fibonacci extension level will be important. The price could travel through large numbers of the levels effortlessly, or not arrive at any of them.

## Highlights
- The Fibonacci extensions show how far the next price [wave](/elliottwavetheory) could move following a pullback.
- Since Fibonacci ratios are common in regular daily existence, a few traders accept these common ratios may likewise have significance in the financial markets.
- Extension levels signal potential areas of significance, however ought not be depended on solely.
- Fibonacci extensions don't have a formula. Rather, they are drawn at three points on a chart, stamping price levels of conceivable significance.
- In view of Fibonacci ratios, common Fibonacci extension levels are 61.8%, 100%, 161.8%, 200%, and 261.8%.
