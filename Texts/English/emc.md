# Equity Market Capitalization
## What Is Equity Market Capitalization?

Equity market capitalization is an aggregate calculation that measures the total value of the whole [equity market](/equitymarket). This value is calculated by taking the individual [market capitalizations](/marketcapitalization) of all suitable companies in the equity market and adding them together to show up at the capitalization for the market as a whole.

## Understanding Equity Market Capitalization

Changes in equity market capitalization are utilized to compare increases or diminishes in the size of the market as a whole. The measure is likewise used to compare the value of the equity market relative to the values of markets of other asset classes, for example, the bond market or different sections of the economy, including the value of the [real estate](/realestate) market.

Market capitalization (or "market cap") alludes to the total dollar market value of a company's outstanding [shares](/shares) as derived from its share price. Market cap is subsequently calculated by duplicating the number of a company's shares outstanding by the current market price of one share. The investment community utilizes this figure to decide a company's size. A company's size is an essential determinant of different qualities — like danger or unpredictability — that is of interest to investors. It is additionally simple to ascertain. For instance, a company with 20 million shares outstanding that sell at $100 per share would have a market cap of $2 billion.

## Limitations of Equity Market Capitalization

In spite of the fact that it is frequently used to depict the size of a company, market cap doesn't measure the equity value of a company. Just a careful analysis of a company's [fundamentals](/fundamentals) can measure a company's true value. Utilizing equity market capitalization to value a company is insufficient on the grounds that the market price on which it is based doesn't be guaranteed to reflect how much a piece of the business is worth. Shares are frequently overvalued or [undervalued](/undervalued) by the market, and that means that the market price just decides how much the market will pay for a company's shares.

Despite the fact that it measures the cost of buying a company's all's shares, the market cap doesn't decide the amount the company would cost to secure in a [merger or acquisition](/mergersandacquisitions) (M&A) transaction. A better method of working out the price of getting a business by and large is the company's [enterprise value](/enterprisevalue).

Two essential factors can additionally modify a company's market cap: huge changes in the price of a stock or when a company issues or repurchases shares. An investor who practices a large number of [warrants](/warrant) can likewise increase the number of shares on the market and negatively influence shareholders in a cycle known as [dilution](/dilution). In light of these factors, equity market capitalization, which is a composite sum of all the market caps of all equities in a market, is definitely not a decent measure for discovering the value of an equity market; just the size.

## Fund Flows and Equity Market Capitalization

[Fund flows](/fund-flow) are the net of all cash inflows and outflows [in and out](/inandout) of different [financial assets](/financialasset). Fund flow is typically measured on a month to month or quarterly premise; the performance of an asset or fund isn't considered, just share [redemptions](/reclamation), or outflows, and share purchases, or inflows. Net inflows make excess cash for managers to invest, which hypothetically drives interest for securities like stocks and bonds.

Investors and market experts watch fund flows to check investor sentiment inside specific [asset classes](/assetclasses), [sectors](/area), or the market as a whole. For example, on the off chance that net fund flows for equity funds during a given month are negative, decreasing equity market capitalization overwhelmingly, this might signal broad-based cynicism over the stock market.
