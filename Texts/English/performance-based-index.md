# Performance-Based Index

A performance-based index is a stock index that adds the amount of all [dividend](/dividend) payments, [capital gains](/capitalgain) and other cash distributions to the net stock price. While measuring the performance throughout a given time span, the performance-based index will add these exchanges to the net share price before working out the index return.

Interestingly, a non-performance index computes returns on weighted market value without respect for cash payment like the S&P 500. A few investors accept a performance-based calculation creates a more accurate measure of performance than the price approach.

## Breaking Down Performance-Based Index

A performance-based index contrasts from a price index in that performance equals the amount of corporate occasions and price movement. A price index, then again, considers capital gains or losses of a security without respect for cash distributions like dividend payments. Most US stock indexes are calculated on a price index. Nonetheless, numerous large European have adopted a performance-based calculation like the German stock market index DAX. Subsequently, the [DAX](/dax), a benchmark of 30 blue-chip companies in Germany, provides the cost estimate with dividends reinvested. This can befuddle investors contrasting title prices between various countries.

For example, the DAX could seem to outflank a non-performance index in a given year, yet the truth is price returns of the German index might be lined up with different markets. This can assist with making sense of why the DAX attained record highs in recent years compared to other European markets like the FTSE 100 and CAC 40.

To see a fair coordinated contrast, it is important to compare portfolio returns with the performance-based variant of an index. A [total return index ](/total_return_index)will consistently seem higher than the price return index as it incorporates extra factors that are unequipped for turning negative. It is fine to follow the price return index, yet it is smart to utilize the total return index while measuring or contrasting the returns of a portfolio and an index. This addresses the total amount an investor would bring back home past just capital gains.

## Benefits of a Performance-Based Index

Since a performance-based index incorporates all capital generating components, it furnishes investors with a more accurate portrayal of performance. This may not be huge for the relaxed market eyewitness, yet a passionate investor requires a performance-based measure to oversee risk and position sizing really. A large number of different benefits that accompany a performance-based index imitate a total return index, including diversification and lower fees.
