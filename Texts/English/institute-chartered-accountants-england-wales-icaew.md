# Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales (ICAEW)
## What Is the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales (ICAEW)?

The Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales (ICAEW) is a professional membership organization of accountants and finance professionals. With its headquarters in London, the ICAEW was made in 1880 and today flaunts more than 180,000 members.

## How the ICAEW Works

Likewise with different organizations like the United States' [American Institute of Certified Public Accountants](/american-institute-of-certified-public-accountants), the purpose of the ICAEW is to guarantee that those entering the accounting professional are outfitted with reliably high standards of professional information, capability, and ethical conduct. With that in mind, the ICAEW controls exams, gives career support services to accounting professionals, and distributes a [Code of Ethics](/code-of-ethics) which its members are required to stick to consistently.

In spite of the fact that it is settled in London, the ICAEW has offices all through the world, remembering branches for Beijing, Brussels, Dubai, and Vietnam. To turn into a member of the ICAEW, up-and-comers must initially get the ICAEW Chartered Accountant (ACA) assignment. To do as such, applicants must initially complete somewhere around three years of important work experience. When they are ready to compose the ACA exams, competitors must complete 15 modules of coursework zeroed in on areas like accountancy, finance, and business management. The ACA exam likewise places a strong accentuation on professional ethics.

To help that their educational plan reflects new improvements in the accounting calling, the ICAEW incorporates ten resources, each dedicated to a specific area of concentration inside the industry and staffed by experienced professionals inside each field. Through these resources, the ICAEW grows new material in areas going from [taxation](/charges) and [audit practices](/audit) to data technology.

## Real World Example of the ICAEW

In the United Kingdom (UK), those wishing to market themselves as "chartered accountants" must initially be members of either the ICAEW or another qualifying professional organization, like the Institute of Chartered Accountants of Scotland (ICAS) or the Chartered Accountants of Ireland (CAI). This regulatory requirement is the consequence of changes put in place during the Victorian period, in which another generation of technically sophisticated accountants should have been prepared to keep pace with the developing complexity of the time's new industrial businesses.

Today, competitors wishing to get the ACA qualification and become ICAEW members must show their capability through a combination of various decision and exposition questions. By and large, ACA competitors must complete 15 exams, one for every one of the program's modules. In the beginning phases, the exams comprise fundamentally of different decision questions, while the later stages start to require long-structure written reactions too. For especially aggressive students, the ICAEW likewise disperses prizes to the students who score most highly on the ACA exams. The esteemed "Peat Prize", for example, is given to the student with the highest overall score in any high level exam.
