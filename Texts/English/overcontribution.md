# Overcontribution
## What Is an Overcontribution?

The term overcontribution alludes to any amount that a [taxpayer](/taxpayer) saves to a tax-deductible retirement plan that surpasses the maximum allowable contribution for a given period. Contribution limits are determined and consistently adjusted by a retirement plan's registrar or the [Internal Revenue Service](/irs) (IRS). Overcontributing to your retirement plan can trigger punishments in the event that taxpayers don't deal with the excess amounts within a certain period of time.

## Grasping Overcontribution

The IRS restricts how much taxpayers can invest every year to their retirement savings accounts. The agency forces various limits for various plans and changes them annually for [inflation](/inflation). For example, individual taxpayers can contribute a maximum of:

- $19,500 out of 2021 ($20,500 in 2022) to a [401(k)](/401kplan), 403(b), or profit-sharing plan. Individuals 50 and more established can make an extra [catch-up contribution](/catchupcontribution) of $6,500 each year.
- $6,000 of every 2021 (and in 2022) to a [individual retirement account](/ira) (IRA) with an extra $1,000 each year for those 50 and more established
- $58,000 of every 2021 ($61,000 in 2022) to a [Simplified Employee Pension](/sep) (SEP) IRA
- $13,500 of every 2021 ($14,000 in 2022) to a [SIMPLE IRA](/simple-ira)

Despite the fact that it's important to max out your contribution limits, don't overdo it. Any amount you invest in these accounts over the limits is viewed as overcontributions. Thusly, they're ineligible for any [tax breaks](/tax-break) you might get — like those associated with IRAs, which reduce your tax bill. Truth be told, overcontributions run the risk of costing you more money in the tax year they're made.

The IRS forces a 6% penalty on the amount of the excess consistently until you fix the situation. Also, any excess contributions made toward an IRA can't be utilized to reduce your [taxable income](/taxableincome). This is what you can do to fix the situation:

- You have until the tax filing cutoff time of that year (generally April 15) to withdraw the excess and any connected earnings. The earnings on that excess must be reported as income on your tax return. Keep as a main priority that you'll cause a 10% [early withdrawal](/earlywithdrawal) penalty on the off chance that you're not 59\u00bd.
- You might apply the excess to the following year's contribution limit. Yet, this means that you'll need to pay the 6% penalty in the current year.

> The limits to employer-sponsored plans like a 401(k) just apply to employee contributions, like those made through payroll deductions. Any matches from employers don't count toward overcontributions.

## Special Considerations

Be certain you inform your [plan administrator](/plan_administrator) or employer in the event that you breach the IRS limit for your 401(k), 403(b), IRA, or some other sort of retirement account. The prior you make the warning the year after the overcontribution, the better. It's up to the plan administrator to return any excess payments to employees (on account of a [employer-sponsored plan](/employer_sponsored_plan)), as well as any earnings on the excess contributions.

Sending this notice as soon as conceivable gives plan administrators sufficient opportunity to do the essential paperwork — especially when the plans are held through an employer. This commonly incorporates adjusting any contributions that emerged from employees' checks on a pretax basis and counting them as wages on employees' [W-2 forms](/w2form). This allows employees sufficient opportunity to issue new forms before the annual tax filing cutoff time.

## Risks of Overcontribution

As verified over, it's important to rapidly address overcontributions. Otherwise, tax inconvenience frequently follows. In the event that the excess amount isn't returned to impacted employees in that frame of mind to file taxes, employees run the risk of [double taxation](/double_taxation). That is, they could pay taxes in the year the excess happened, regardless need to pay the following year, too.

To stay away from double taxation, a few employees can file a [amended return](/amendedreturn) with the excess contribution taken out, plus any connected earnings from the overcontribution. This must be finished by the tax extension cutoff time, however.

Overcontributions to IRAs are a bit simpler to address however they actually bring about punishments. Employees can leave their accounts alone and assign any overcontribution toward next year's limit. Keep in mind, that 6% penalty applies on any excess each year. Of course, any individual contributions must be adjusted proceeding to keep from again making an overcontribution the following year.
