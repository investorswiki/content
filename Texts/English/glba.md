## What Is the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999 (GLBA)?

The **Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act** of 1999 (GLBA) was a bi-partisan regulation under President Bill Clinton, passed by Congress on November 12, 1999. The GLBA was an endeavor to refresh and modernize the financial industry. The GLBA is most notable as the nullification of the Glass-Steagall Act of 1933, which stated that [commercial banks](/commercialbank) were not permitted to offer financial services — like investments and insurance-related services — as part of normal operations.

## Understanding the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999 (GLBA)

Due to the exceptional losses incurred because of 1929's [Black Tuesday](/blacktuesday) and [Thursday](/blackthursday), the **Glass-Steagall Act** was initially made to shield bank contributors from extra exposure to risk, associated with stock market volatility. Subsequently, for a long time, commercial banks were not legally permitted to act as [brokers](/dealer). Since numerous regulations have been founded since the 1930s to safeguard bank investors, GLBA was made to permit these financial industry participants to offer more services.

GLBA was passed closely following commercial bank Citicorp merger with the insurance firm Travelers Group. This prompted the formation of the conglomerate Citigroup, which offered commercial banking and insurance services, yet additionally lines of business related to [securities](/security). Its brands at this stage included Citibank, Smith Barney, Primerica, and Travelers. Citicorp merger was a violation of the then-existing **Glass-Steagall Act**, as well as the **Bank Holding Company Act** of 1956.

To permit the merger to happen, the [U.S. Federal Reserve](/federalreservebank) gave Citigroup an impermanent waiver in September 1998 — a forerunner to Congress' section of GLBA.

Revoking Glass-Steagall likewise eliminated the ban of "concurrent service by any officer, director, or employee of a securities firm as an officer, director, or employee of any member bank."
