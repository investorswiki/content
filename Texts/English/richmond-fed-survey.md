# Richmond Fed Survey
  **Official name**: Survey of Fifth District Manufacturing Activity; Survey of Fifth District Service-Sector Activity
**What exactly**? Regional manufacturing and nonmanufacturing indices that cover the District of Columbia, Maryland, North Carolina, South Carolina, Virginia and the majority of West Virginia. The manufacturing survey's shipments index and the help area survey's incomes index signal expansion when over zero and contraction when below it.
**Source**: Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond
**Frequency**: Monthly
**Delivered when**? Second business day after the 10th of the month at 10 a.m. Eastern. Data for prior month.
**Market importance**: None. Never moves markets. Not accessible until after the national Purchasing Managers' Index - - as well as a large group of other regional manufacturing indices - - have been delivered. Too dated. Not worth tracking.
