# Unit Sales

The unit sales number on a balance sheet addresses the total sales of a product in a given period. This sales data is utilized to decide the price point that takes into consideration the best profit per unit thinking about the real cost of production.

To stock analysts, unit sales are an important measure of a product's contribution to a company's balance sheet.

## Figuring out Unit Sales

Unit sales show up on a company's income statement. They are inspected over various accounting periods, like month to month, quarterly, or yearly.

Inside, company marketing executives could utilize this figure to assist with deciding the right price point for a product.

Analysts use it to assess a product's real contribution to the company's main concern.

In addition to other things, an analyst can see whether a product is facing [margin pressure](/marginpressure). For instance, accept XYZ Corp. has $250 million in revenue, and it sold 5 million units. By taking the ratio of the two ($250 million/5 million), the analyst can see that the average selling price (ASP) is $50 per unit. Assume that in the next reporting period that equivalent firm has an average selling price of $48. The analyst would think about this basically a red flag that calls for more research.

Contrasting unit sales consistently may assist analysts with deciding whether a company is moving in a positive heading.

These predicted sales were an emotional increase over the 2014 fiscal year sales of around 170 million units worldwide. By 2019, the figure had dropped to around 38 million.

For instance, it very well might be feasible to buy materials at lower costs when ordered at a higher volume, while putting away a bigger quantity might raise the fixed costs associated with material storage.
