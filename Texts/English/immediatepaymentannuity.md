## How an Immediate Payment Annuity Works

## Special Considerations

So an annuitant who passes on sooner than expected may not get the best possible deal out of the deal. Then again, an annuitant who lives longer might outpace the competition.

There are far to get around this problem. One is by adding a second person to the annuity contract (alluded to as a [joint and survivor annuity](/jointandsurvivorannuity)). Likewise conceivable to buy an annuity guarantees payments to the annuitant's beneficiaries for a [certain period](/periodcertain), or that will refund the annuitant's principal assuming the annuitant bites the dust early (known as a [cash refund annuity](/cash-refund-annuity)). Such provisions cost extra, notwithstanding.

When purchased, an immediate payment annuity can't be canceled for a refund. This might represent a problem should the annuitant need the money in a financial emergency. Consequently, it's smart to have a [emergency fund](/emergency_fund) set to the side for unanticipated requirements before concluding how much money will be put in the annuity.
