# London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR)
## What is LIBOR?
The London Interbank Offered Rate, or LIBOR, is the most common benchmark interest rate index used to make acclimations to variable-rate loans and credit cards. LIBOR is utilized by world banks while charging each other for short-term loans.
## More profound definition
LIBOR depends on five currencies:
- U.S. dollar (USD)
- Euro (EUR)
- Pound sterling (GBP)
- Japanese yen (JPY)
- Swiss franc (CHF)

LIBOR serves maturities that reach from overnight to one year. Every business day, banks work with 35 distinct LIBOR rates, yet the most commonly quoted rate is the three-month U.S. dollar rate. The Wall Street Journal distributes LIBOR rates daily.
To compute LIBOR rates, the British Bankers' Association reviews a panel of banks on the rates at which they could borrow money under certain conditions. The numbers are found the middle value of and reported.
LIBOR fills in as the benchmark reference rate for government and corporate bonds, mortgages, student loans and credit cards, as well as derivatives and other financial products. At the point when a loan rate goes up or down, a changing LIBOR rate is somewhat liable.
Taking into account an adjustable-rate mortgage? Figure out what an index, for example, LIBOR means for your rate and payment.
## LIBOR models
A bank might price a five-year loan with a floating rate at the half year LIBOR, plus 2.5 percent. Toward the finish of every half year period, the bank would then change the interest rate in light of the current half year LIBOR, plus a similar 2.5 percent spread. This could mean either a decline or an increase in the rate.
For instance, if the terms on a $25,000 personal loan depend on a six-month LIBOR of 2.5 percent, plus a spread of 2.5 percent, the interest rate on the loan would be 5 percent for the initial six months. Assuming the LIBOR rate increases to 4 percent following six months, the interest rate would change in accordance with 6.5 percent.
