# Price Talk
## What Is Price Talk?

Price talk is the discussion of the fitting price for a [upcoming security issue](/newissue). During the price talk phase, the investment community will examine and discuss a reasonable scope of prices inside which it's estimated the new security ought to be sold. Price talks commonly happen before a [initial public offering](/ipo) (IPO) or a bond issue. Since price talks happen before the real security issuance, they can assist investors with gaining the knowledge expected to pursue an investment choice.

## Understanding Price Talk

Price talk happens when dealers, investors, and brokers dissect and discuss the price of a [new security](/security) before the security is issued. Comparisons are made to benchmarks, like past issues by similar entity or comparative securities. Some investment banks, like JPMorgan Chase and Co. (JPM), furnish their customers with price talk prior to the auctions of securities, permitting the clients understanding into the new issue.

Price talks happen for IPOs and bond issues, for example, [auction rate securities](/auction-rate-security) (ARS). Numerous likely investors of another security will utilize price talk as one factor in their decision-production process before making an investment.

## Price Talk and Dutch Auction

Price talk can be seen in the [Dutch auction](/dutchauction) process, where the prices and interest rates of securities are set in the wake of taking in all bids and deciding the highest price (or most reduced [yield](/yield)) at which the total offering can be sold. Prior to the auction, brokers talk about the scope of potential yields or [spreads](/spread) with their clients.

This discussion is alluded to as price talk, and it gives clients and prospective investors a basis for probable rates, however investors are free to submit bids outside of this reach. Price talk gives an indication of the yield or spread that the responsible entity and the underwriters hope to bring the new financing. At the point when price talk is given in yield, it gives some reference with respect to what the [coupon rate](/coupon-rate) on a bond will be. Price talk on spreads is all the more frequently finished with [investment-grade securities](/investmentgrade).

Investors enter a competitive bidding process by [submitting bids](/bid) that indicate the number of shares they will purchase and the most reduced yield they might want to acknowledge from the bond. The yields submitted fall inside the scope of yields examined by underwriters. Bids are accepted until the cutoff time after which the auction agent ascertains the [clearing rate](/clearingprice) in view of the submitted bids.

The clearing rate is the interest rate that will be paid on the securities until the next auction. Assuming the investor's bid rate is not exactly the clearing rate, the investor will receive all or possibly part of their ideal bid. Bids placed over the clearing rate won't be filled.

Discussions about the fitting price for another security regularly goes before the IPO of a company's stock or upcoming bond issue. Early price talk happens just as the new issue is announced, and the official price talk happens nearer to when the security will be priced.
