# Trade in Value Added (TiVA)
## What Is Trade in Value Added (TiVA)?

Trade in Value Added (TiVA) is a statistical method used to estimate the sources of value added while creating goods and services for [export](/export) and [import](/import).

## Understanding Trade in Value Added (TiVA)

The TiVA joint [Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development](/oecd) (OECD)- [World Trade Organization](/wto) (WTO) initiative considers the value added by every country in the production of goods and services that are consumed worldwide. Goods and services purchased are made out of inputs from different countries around the world, yet the flows of the parts in these global supply and production chains were not precisely reflected in previous measurement indicators.

TiVA indicators are intended to better illuminate policymakers by giving data and bits of knowledge on commercial relations between nations. TiVA follows the value added by every industry and country in the production chain to the last export, and afterward dispenses the value added to these source industries and countries. TiVA perceives that exports in a globalized economy depend on global value chains (GVCs), which utilize intermediate things imported from different industries in a number of countries.

Traditional trade [statistics](/statistics) record gross flows of goods and services each time they cross a border. This makes a double-counting or various counting problem. For instance, a traded intermediate thing utilized as an input for an export might be included several times in trade figures.

The TiVA approach abstains from double-counting by accounting for the net trade flow between countries. For instance, a cellphone manufactured in China for export might require several parts, for example, memory chips, contact screens, and cameras from overseas companies situated in Korea, Taiwan, and the U.S.

The overseas companies thusly need intermediate inputs, for example, electronic parts and integrated circuits imported from different nations to deliver the cellphone parts that will be exported to the Chinese manufacturer. The TiVA method apportions the value added by every one of these companies associated with the production of the last cell telephone export.

## OECD Role in TiVA Measures

To improve and build on TiVA methodology, the OECD examines trade policy, investment policy, policies for development, and a scope of other domestic policies to aid policymakers to decide how economies can benefit from engagement in global [value chains](/valuechain).

The Inter-Country Input-Output (ICIO) system ascertains indicators to measure economic [globalization](/globalization), remembering trade-for occupations and skills to show the number of and what type of occupations are supported by foreign last demand. The ICIO plus emissions data produces estimates of trade-in encapsulated carbon to feature where carbon dioxide is being consumed as opposed to created. Furthermore, the OECD is developing accounting systems and content of national input-output and supply use tables to all the more precisely measure global trade.

## Illustration of TiVA

Quite possibly of the most common case gave to act as an illustration of a global value chain is that of Apple's products. The Cupertino company plans its products in the U.S. however, they are gathered in China with inputs and intermediate steps from a huge swath of companies arranged in various countries, from Germany to Japan to South Korea.

Convoluting the manufacturing system further is the relationship between various companies engaged with the cycle. For instance, Foxconn — the company that is responsible for the last assembly — has operations in Taiwan as well as Mainland China. Both are engaged with the production and assembly of Apple's products and part parts for its gadgets.

The complex interchange of parts and provider parts and intermediate steps included means that a traditional system, in which just the immediate source of a part is considered for accounting, would bring about errors. A TiVA accounting system makes a complete dataset that can account for the value added to the gadget at each step of the manufacturing system.

## Features
- The OECD examines trade policy, investment policy, and a large group of other policy measures to help countries in accounting for global supply chain value systems.
- The TiVA method takes out the double or numerous including problem predominant in traditional trade statistics.
- The Trade in Value Added (TiVA) statistical method considers the value added by every country in the production of goods and services that are consumed worldwide.
