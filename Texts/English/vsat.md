# Tiny Aperture Terminal (VSAT)
## What Is a Very Small Aperture Terminal (VSAT)?

A tiny aperture terminal (VSAT) is a two-way ground station that transmits and gets data from satellites. A VSAT is under three meters tall and is equipped for both narrow and broadband data to satellites in circle in real-time. The data can then be diverted to other remote terminals or hubs around the planet.

## How a Very Small Aperture Terminal (VSAT) Works

VSAT networks have a number of commercial applications, including, maybe most remarkably, [enterprise resource planning](/erp) (ERP). The utilization of VSAT to follow [inventory](/inventory-management) was one of the numerous innovations Walmart pioneered in retail to successfully deal with its immense inventory in real-time and reduce delivery costs between the warehouse and stores.

Combined with the [hub system](/hub_and_spoke_structure) of inventory storage, VSAT permitted Walmart to stock its stores all the more unequivocally and reduce how frequently a product needed to move between areas before being sold. Different manufacturers use VSAT to transfer orders, check production figures in real-time as well as different capabilities that are generally dealt with over a wired network.

The [National Stock Exchange (NSE) of India](/national_stock_exchange) has one of the largest VSAT networks in the world and offers it as one of its availability options. VSAT furnished the NSE with a way to offer access in areas where wired options are limited. With the exception of a periodic sun blackout due to sun based radiation mutilating signals from the satellite, the VSAT network has held up.

## Advantages and Disadvantages of a Very Small Aperture Terminal (VSAT)

VSAT networks enjoy a big benefit with regards to sending. Since the ground station is speaking with satellites, there is less [infrastructure](/infrastructure) required to service remote areas. This was one of the reasons Walmart picked VSAT as it began vigorously leveraged to rural America, where telecommunications infrastructure was less dense than in the urban areas.

This has pursued VSAT networks an optimal decision for giving availability to remote work locales, for example, exploratory drilling destinations that need to transfer daily drill logs back to headquarters. VSAT is likewise independent of neighborhood telecommunications networks, making it an optimal system to back up wired systems and reduce [business recovery risk](/business-recovery-risk). On the off chance that the wired network goes down, a business can in any case continue utilizing the VSAT network.

Nonetheless, VSAT has limitations. The clearest is latency, as it requires investment for data to arrive at the dish and the station due to one part of the system being way up in geosynchronous circle over the earth.

All in all, conventions that require a great deal of to and fro communication as opposed to one-way data transfer experience lag. The signal quality can likewise be impacted by the climate and different structures disrupting everything.

## Highlights
- Since the signal necessities to bounce, there can be a latency issue that wouldn't exist with a physical network. Be that as it may, most users feel this is the price you pay for remote access and less infrastructure and think of it as a fair trade.
- Weather conditions can adversely impact the viability of a VSAT network.
- A tiny aperture terminal (VSAT) is a data transmission technology utilized for some types of data management and in high-frequency trading.
- VSAT can be utilized in place of a large physical network as it bounces the signal from satellites as opposed to being shipped through physical means like an ethernet association.
