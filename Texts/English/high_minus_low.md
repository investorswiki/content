# High Minus Low (HML)
## What Is High Minus Low (HML)?

High Minus Low (HML), likewise alluded to as the value premium, is one of three factors utilized in the [Fama-French three-factor model](/famaandfrenchthreefactormodel). The Fama-French three-factor model is a system for assessing stock returns that the financial experts Eugene Fama and Kenneth French developed. HML accounts for the spread in returns between value stocks and growth stocks. This system contends that companies with high book-to-market ratios, otherwise called value stocks, outperform those with lower book-to-market values, known as growth stocks.

## Seeing High Minus Low (HML)

To comprehend HML, it is important to initially have a fundamental comprehension of the Fama-French three-factor model. Founded in 1992 by Eugene Fama and Kenneth French, the Fama-French three-factor model purposes three factors, one of which is HML, to make sense of the [excess returns](/excessreturn) in a manager's portfolio.

The underlying concept behind the model is that the returns produced by portfolio managers are due in part to factors that are unchangeable as far as the managers might be concerned. In particular, [value stocks](/valuestock) have historically outperformed [growth stocks](/growthstock) on average, while smaller companies have outperformed larger ones.

The first of these factors (the outperformance of value stocks) is alluded to by the term HML, while the subsequent factor (the outperformance of smaller companies) is alluded to by the term [Small Minus Big](/small_minus_big) (SMB). By determining the amount of the manager's performance is inferable from these factors, the client of the model can better estimate the manager's ability.

On account of the HML factor, the model shows whether a manager is depending on the value premium by investing in stocks with high [book-to-market ratios](/booktomarketratio) to earn a [abnormal return](/abnormalreturn). Assuming that the manager is buying just value stocks, the model regression shows a positive connection to the HML factor, which makes sense of that the portfolio's returns are owing to the value premium. Since the model can make sense of a greater amount of the portfolio's return, the original [excess return](/excessreturn) of the manager diminishes.

## Fama and French's Five-Factor Model

In 2014, Fama and French refreshed their model to incorporate five factors. Alongside the original three, the new model adds the concept that companies reporting higher future earnings have higher returns in the stock market, a factor alluded to as profitability. The fifth factor, alluded to as investment, connects with the organization's internal investment and returns, proposing that companies that invest forcefully in growth projects are probably going to underperform from now on.
