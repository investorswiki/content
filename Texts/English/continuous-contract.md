# Continuous Contract
## What Is a Continuous Contract?

A continuous contract is a [reinsurance](/reinsurance) contract that doesn't have a fixed contract end date, and which will keep on being recharged and be in effect until one of the gatherings in the contract terminates it. Continuous contracts are not the same as standard reinsurance contracts in that they don't give coverage to just a fixed period of time.

## How a Continuous Contract Works

While going into a reinsurance contract, the gatherings included may conclude that they believe a continuous contract all together should recharge the policy endlessly. The contract language will characterize the risks covered and will likewise show the procedures that either party can follow to give a [notice of termination](/notice-of-termination). The notice could be a written notice given one month before the contract is set to restore, or may follow anything notice period to which the two players concur. The legitimacy portion of the insurance contract might say, for instance, that the contract is viewed as continuous except if the two players demonstrate that it isn't to be considered accordingly.

Notice of termination must be given inside the time set forward in the termination clause or the contract will go on for another term. Both the reinsured's and reinsurers are much of the time in trouble about whether to give notice of termination or to permit the contract to proceed. For such cases, a practice hosts developed by which one or the two gatherings will send a provisional notice of cancellation (frequently called a "PNOC"). The provisional notice allows the gatherings an opportunity to survey the relationship, receive the annual update data for the treaty, and afterward conclude whether they ought to proceed with the contract. Assuming the decision is made to proceed, the PNOC is removed and the contract go on without interruption past the anniversary date.

## Special Considerations

While a continuous contract might be recharged for an endless period of time, it will just stay in force for a predefined contract period whenever. This means that the two players can end the contract while not breaking the terms of the agreement by ending the contract while it is as yet active. This type of contract is a fixed period contract, with a provision considering periodic renewal.

Assuming the insurance contract is terminated sooner than what the two gatherings agreed, the insurer will in any case receive the premium that it is qualified for the period of time that it has given coverage. By and large, the amount of premium earned is dependent on the amount of time for which the coverage has been given, however now and again, the two gatherings might have agreed to an alternative schedule not in light of time.
