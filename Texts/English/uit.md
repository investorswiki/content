# Unit Investment Trust (UIT)
## What Is a Unit Investment Trust (UIT)?

A unit investment trust (UIT) is a [investment company](/investmentcompany) that offers a fixed portfolio, generally of stocks and bonds, as redeemable units to investors for a specific period of time. It is intended to give [capital appreciation](/capitalappreciation) or potentially dividend income. Unit investment trusts, alongside [mutual funds](/mutualfund) and [closed-end funds](/closed-endinvestment), are defined as investment companies.

## Understanding Unit Investment Trust (UIT)

Investment companies offer individuals the opportunity to invest in a diversified portfolio of securities with a low initial investment requirement. UITs are sold by investment advisors and an owner can recover the units to the fund or trust, as opposed to setting a trade in the [secondary market](/secondarymarket). A UIT is either a regulated investment corporation (RIC) or a [grantor](/grantor) trust. A RIC is a corporation where the investors are joint owners, and a grantor trust awards investors proportional ownership in the UIT's [underlying securities](/underlying-security).

## How Investments Are Sold

Investors can recover mutual fund shares or UIT units at [net asset value (NAV)](/nav) to the fund or trust either straightforwardly or with the assistance of an investment advisor. NAV is defined as the total value of the portfolio partitioned by the number of shares or units outstanding and the NAV is calculated every business day. Then again, closed-end funds are not redeemable and are sold in the secondary market at the current market price. The market price of a closed-end fund depends on investor demand and not as a calculation of net asset value.

## The Differences Between UITs and Mutual Funds

Mutual funds are unconditional funds, implying that the [portfolio manager](/portfoliomanager) can buy and sell securities in the portfolio. The [investment objective](/investmentobjective) of each mutual fund is to [outperform](/outperform) a specific [benchmark](/benchmark), and the portfolio manager trades securities to meet that objective. A stock mutual fund, for instance, may have an objective to outperform the [Standard and Poor's 500 index](/sp500) of enormous cap stocks.

Numerous investors like to involve mutual funds for stock investing with the goal that the portfolio can be traded. On the off chance that an investor is interested in buying and holding a portfolio of bonds and earning interest, that individual might purchase a UIT or closed-end fund with a fixed portfolio. A UIT, for instance, pays the interest income on the bonds and holds the portfolio until a specific end date when the bonds are sold and the principal amount is returned to the owners. A bond investor can claim a diversified portfolio of bonds in a UIT, as opposed to oversee interest payments and bond recoveries in a personal [brokerage account](/brokerageaccount).
