# Mortgage Participation Certificate
## What Is a Mortgage Participation Certificate?

A mortgage participation certificate is a type of security that groups together mortgages held by the [Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (Freddie Mac)](/freddiemac), a government-sponsored enterprise. Mortgage participation certificates are guaranteed by Freddie Mac yet not the federal government itself, and they are taxable by federal, state, and neighborhood governments.

Mortgage participation certificates, which Freddie Mac calls PCs, are additionally alluded to as "pass-through securities" in light of the fact that the interest and principal payments are occasionally passed through to investors from debt holders after service fee deductions.

## Understanding Mortgage Participation Certificates

Mortgage participation certificates in some form have been an essential part of Freddie Mac's operation since its establishing by Congress in 1970. The original goal of Freddie Mac was to increase liquidity for [thrift banks](/thriftbank), which at the time issued most mortgages for people and families. Freddie Mac bought mortgages from the thrifts, giving the banks cash to loan out as new mortgages, then, at that point, packaged and resold them on the secondary market.

Until 1990, Freddie Mac paid PC investors under a system known as a "changed guarantee," meaning the payment was delayed until the 75th day after the mortgage payment was due from the original borrower.

Payment delays changed after the 1989 [Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery, and Enforcement Act](/financial-institutions-reform-recovery-enforcement) (FIRREA)when Freddie Mac was rebuilt as a market-situated corporate entity that was put under the regulatory control of the [Department of Housing and Urban Development](/us-department-housing-urban-development-hud) (HUD). Not long after that, Freddie Mac presented its supposed Gold program, which pays PC investors on the 45th day.

By far most of mortgage participation certificates are for pools of conventional 15-and 30-year mortgages on single-family homes. Notwithstanding, Freddie Mac additionally issues certificates for groups of [adjustable-rate mortgages](/arm) (ARMs). The base pool size is generally $1 million. In the past, Freddie Mac sold most PCs for cash, yet today most PCs are swapped for new mortgages from banks.

## Special Considerations

Since Freddie Mac guarantees them, mortgage participation certificates are viewed as moderately safe investments, yet they carry some risk. For instance, while HUD remains Freddie Mac's regulator about fair lending issues, since the [2008 subprime housing crisis](/subprime-implosion), the association's financial operations are presently under the conservatorship of the new [Federal Housing Finance Agency](/fhfa) (FHFA).

It is conceivable, however improbable that the FHFA could disavow Freddie Mac's guarantees. One more risk is liquidity since Freddie Mac PCs are not traded on any exchange. Should Freddie Mac diminish its mortgage investment portfolio, its PCs' secondary market could be impacted.
