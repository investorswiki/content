# Policy Mix
## What Is a Policy Mix?

A policy mix might be any combination of complementary fiscal and monetary policies that a country adopts to deal with its economy or to answer a particular economic crisis.

The policy mix is generally comprised of contributions from the nation's central bank, like the Federal Reserve in the U.S., and its federal government.

## How a Policy Mix Works

A country's economic policy comprises of two parts â€” its fiscal policy and its monetary policy.

- All a nation's [fiscal policy](/fiscalpolicy) is comprised of its programs that include spending money and fund-raising. These programs exist in part to support vital parts of the economy like employment, inflation, and demand for goods and services.
- The nation's [monetary policy](/monetarypolicy) is forced by its central bank, which controls the supply of money, principally by controlling short-term interest rates.

In most just countries, chose federal governing bodies control fiscal policy, while independent central banks handle monetary policy. In the U.S. this is the Federal Reserve (known as the Fed).

Governments and central banks generally share a broad set of objectives. They incorporate a low unemployment rate, stable prices, moderate interest rates, and sound growth.

Fiscal and monetary policymakers utilize various apparatuses to achieve these objectives and frequently stress various needs.

Governments are run by chose authorities who must win famous endorsement from the overall population at normal stretches, and that fact affects the timing and the idea of the policies they act upon. Central bankers are technocrats who don't directly pay all due respects to electors. This enables them to independently act.

## Illustration of a Policy Mix

So how does this all function? In various difficulties, controlling inflation is a prime illustration of a problem with a policy mix solution.

Inflation happens when prices rise and the purchasing power of a single unit of currency declines. This means that individuals buy less goods and services on the grounds that their money doesn't stretch to the extent that it once did.

The problem twistings, leading to a drop in consumer and business spending. A few businesses cut back production considering poor demand. Others put off plans to grow, waiting for better times. This prompts higher unemployment, among different effects.

A nation's federal government and central bank might step in to assist with curbing inflation through a policy mix. For example, the government might carry out tax cuts to empower consumers or businesses, or both, to spend more money.

Simultaneously, its central bank might reduce interest rates to empower new investments by the two consumers and businesses. The central bank may likewise increase the money supply, giving the banks an incentive to loan out more money.

### The Great Recession

Broadly talking, this was the policy mix that characterized the response to the 2008 financial crisis in the United States. The crisis was introduced by a collapse in the housing market, rising interest rates, and defaulting subprime borrowers.

This had a cascading type of influence that prompted a crash in the global financial market, at last coming about in [the Great Recession](/great-recession).

Fiscal and monetary policy can likewise push every which way. The central bank could ease monetary policy while fiscal policymakers seek after austerity measures. This is the very thing that occurred in Europe following the equivalent [financial crisis](/financial-crisis).

Or on the other hand lawmakers, anxious to win well known support, may choose to cut taxes or lift spending regardless of a tight labor market and inflationary tensions. These actions could force the central bank to raise interest rates.

## Special Considerations

There are times when fiscal and monetary policymakers actually cooperate.

For instance, the government might opt to give fiscal [stimulus](/economic-stimulus) by cutting taxes and expanding spending. The central bank might choose to give monetary stimulus by cutting short-term interest rates. In response to a crisis, that combination of actions can settle or even kick off economic activity.

### The COVID-19 Pandemic

The COVID-19 pandemic what began in mid 2020 compromised limitless damage to the economies of nations around the world. Periodic closures of retail businesses, limitations on movement, and supply chain disturbances started, ended, and continued capriciously. Family schedules were upended as work-at-home policies were quickly put in place. Many individuals lost their positions, or quit them for fear of contagion.

This is the U.S. policy mix that was put in place in response:

The Federal Reserve cut interest rates, and promised to keep rates at or close to zero as long as important. It likewise started purchasing debt securities in enormous sums to assist with balancing out the financial markets.

Recently chose President Joe Biden and the Congress pushed through a remarkable package of direct assistance to the individuals who had been harmed financially by the pandemic. Quite a bit of this assistance was targeted explicitly to bunches generally seriously impacted, including parents of young children, the jobless, and small businesses.

In a critique, a supporter of VoxEU, a policy analysis publication, contended that no nation might have traversed the COVID-19 crisis without facilitated action by fiscal and monetary policymakers.
