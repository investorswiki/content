## Franchise Tax versus Income Tax

There are a few key differences between a franchise and income tax. Dissimilar to state income taxes, franchise taxes are not in view of a corporation's [profit](/profit). A business entity must file and pay the franchise tax whether or not it creates a gain in some random year. [State income taxes](/state-income-tax) — and how much is paid — then again, are dependent on how much an organization makes during the year.

Income tax is additionally applied to all [corporations](/corporation) that get income from sources within the state, even however they may not carry on with work within its limits. Doing business might be defined diversely by certain states as several factors are viewed as in establishing nexus, including whether the company sells in the state, has employees in the state, or has a genuine physical presence in the state.

Delaware is notable as a tax shelter, especially for corporations that don't conduct business in Delaware. Instead, they need to pay a franchise tax administered by the Delaware Department of State.

## Illustration of a Franchise Tax

As verified over, each state might have an alternate method of calculating franchise taxes. How about we use Texas for instance. The state's [comptroller](/comptroller) demands taxes on all elements that carry on with work in the state and expects them to file an Annual Franchise Tax Report consistently by May fifteenth. The state calculates its franchise tax in view of a company's [margin](/margin) which is processed in one of four different ways:

- Total [revenue](/revenue) duplicated by 70%
- Total revenue minus [cost of goods sold](/cogs) (COGS)
- Total revenue minus compensation paid to all work force
- Total revenue minus $1 million

Corporate revenue is calculated by subtracting statutory prohibitions from the amount of revenue reported on a corporation's federal income [tax return](/taxreturn).
