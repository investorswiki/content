# Short Tax Year
## What Is a Short Tax Year?

A short tax year is a fiscal or calendar tax year that is under 12 months long. Individual taxpayers as a rule file on a calendar-year basis, so the short tax year applies fundamentally to businesses. It might happen when a business fires up in mid-year or changes its accounting period.

## Grasping the Short Tax Year

For any business, accounting isn't just a course of recording expenses and receipts. It's a cycle for reporting those expenses and receipts to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) to back up the numbers on the business' tax returns.

A business can utilize either the [calendar year](/calendaryear) or [fiscal year](/fiscalyear) as its tax year for income reporting. A calendar tax year alludes to the 12 successive months beginning January 1 and ending December 31. The fiscal year is any 12 successive months that end on any day of any month with the exception of the last day of December. At the point when an organization's tax year is shorter than 12 months, it is alluded to as a short tax year.

### Accounting Changes

An annual [accounting period](/accountingperiod) does exclude a short tax year which happens when a business has possibly existed for part of a tax year or when a business changes its accounting period. On the off chance that a business opens in May, and the business owner likes to file on a calendar-year basis, the business will have a short tax year, with income and expenses for just 7\u00bd months reported on [Form 1040](/1040).

A comparable situation would happen assuming that the business owner wished to utilize a fiscal year that started in an unexpected month in comparison to the one where the business was laid out. Even a business that fired up and afterward left business in the span of 12 months must in any case have its tax return for the short tax year reflect income and expenses for the period of time it was in operation.

Requirements for filing the return and calculating the tax are generally equivalent to the requirements for a return for a full tax year ending on the last day of the short tax year.

For instance, say a business that has reported income from one June to another consistently chooses to change its fiscal year to start in October. A short tax year from June to October must be reported for the change period.
