## What Are Annuities and How Do They Work?
Put essentially, an annuity is a contract that allows an investor to utilize present-day money to fund an interest/return-earning account they can use to pay themself during their retirement years later.
All the more specifically, annuities are financial instruments issued by insurance companies or financial institutions that give their owners (annuitants) with income payments consistently during a period known as the annuitization phase that typically concurs with retirement.
These income payments are funded with money invested by the holder of the annuity during a previous period known as the accumulation phase. An individual can fund an annuity with a single, lump-sum contribution, or a series of more modest contributions over the long haul. These contributions are frequently alluded to as premiums.
The payments dispensed from an annuity can start immediately or start later on a predetermined date. These payments might end on a specific date, upon the death of their holder, or upon the death of the holder's spouse, contingent upon the terms of the contract.
Annuities are binding contracts, and their sale is regulated both by the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).
## What Are the Different Types of Annuities?
Annuities can fall into one of several categories in light of two characteristics. To start with, annuities can be sorted by whether their accumulation phase starts immediately or later on. They can be additionally sorted by whether their payment amounts are fixed and guaranteed, change in view of the market, or a mix of the two.
###
### Immediate versus Deferred Annuities
All annuities can be partitioned into one of two categories — immediate and deferred — in view of when their periodic payments start.
#### Immediate
Immediate annuities start dispensing payments immediately, and hence, they are regularly funded with a single, lump-sum payment. Immediate annuities are great for investors who need or need standard passive income payments beginning immediately.
#### Deferred
Deferred annuities, then again, don't start dispensing payments until a future date determined in the annuity contract. Since payments don't start immediately, deferred annuities can be funded either with a single, lump-sum payment or a series of more modest payments over the long run.
The period leading up to the payment phase, during which a deferred annuity is funded, is known as the accumulation period. Deferred annuities are great for investors who are not yet retired or potentially need more money to fund their whole annuity with a single payment.
### Fixed versus Variable versus Indexed Annuities
All annuities can be additionally isolated into one of three categories — fixed, variable, or indexed — contingent upon the degree to which their gains (and hence, payment amounts) are guaranteed.
#### Fixed
Fixed annuities are not tied to a portfolio or [stock index](/marketindex), and they earn interest at a fixed rate of return (e.g., 2%) that is guaranteed by their contract before dispensing a series of equivalent payments during their annuitization phase.
At the end of the day, fixed annuities guarantee unobtrusive returns that are not tied to the performance of a portfolio or financial market. Along these lines, they are safer than variable or indexed annuities, yet they likewise have no growth potential past the [interest rate](/interestrate) guaranteed by their contract.
#### Variable
The money contributed to a variable annuity is put into a portfolio whose performance relies upon the market. At times, the money in a variable annuity is allocated completely to a specific fund — frequently one that tracks a famous benchmark stock index like the [S&P 500](/sp500). In different cases, the holder of the annuity might dispense their funds to a variety of financial [securities](/security) fitting their personal preference, including stocks, [bonds](/security), [ETFs](/indexfund), [mutual funds](/mutualfund), and different instruments.
Variable annuities are supposed on the grounds that their rate of return is neither fixed nor guaranteed — all things being equal, it shifts in light of the performance of the securities in the annuity's portfolios. This means that, in the event that the underlying portfolio performs well, a variable annuity can give a lot higher rate of return once payments start than a fixed annuity. Then again, assuming that the portfolio performs ineffectively, low rates of return or even losses can happen.
**Note:** Some variable annuities guarantee a return of premium, and that means that all invested funds (minus fees) will be paid out during annuitization even assuming the underlying portfolio loses value.
#### Indexed
Indexed annuities share parts of both fixed and variable annuities. Their performance is tied to the performance of at least one stock market indexes (e.g., the [Russel 2,000](/russell2000)), yet they offer a guaranteed least return (e.g., 2%) no matter what the performance of the underlying index(es). This means that even on the off chance that the annuity portfolio loses value, its holder will receive an unassuming return.
In exchange for this guaranteed return, the annuity portfolio's gains are capped at a certain percentage. For instance, assuming an indexed annuity's returns were capped at 75%, and the underlying index(es) filled in value by 20%, the value of the annuity portfolio would just increase by 15%, with the remainder of the gains going to the annuity provider.
This kind of annuity is really great for investors who are fairly risk-opposed yet maintain that their retirement income should have an exposure to potential market growth.
## Annuity Example: Deferred-Indexed
Suppose an investor set up a deferred indexed annuity with an insurance company at age 45. Assuming they intended to retire at 60, they could make ordinary, month to month contributions throughout the next 15 years, which would comprise the annuity's accumulation period.
Suppose this annuity had a guaranteed least return of 3% and was invested in a fund that followed the [Wilshire 5,000](/wilshire5000equityindex) index with returns capped at 80%. In the event that the Wilshire went up essentially in value, so would the investor's contributions, in spite of the fact that their gains would just amount to 4/5ths of the gains of the index fund itself. Assuming the fund went down in value, in any case, the investor's funds would in any case earn the 3% least interest guaranteed by their indexed annuity contract.
## How Safe/Risky Are Annuities?
How safe or risky any annuity is relies upon the specific terms of its contract. Fixed annuities are the safest, as returns are guaranteed at the rate determined in the contract. That being said, their upside potential is likewise capped going on like this, so contingent upon the rate of [inflation](/inflation), the fees paid to the annuity provider, and the length of the accumulation period, the funds paid out during annuitization may actually be worth not exactly the funds paid in initially.
Variable annuities are riskier however have higher upside potential, as their performance relies upon the performance of an underlying portfolio, which could go up or down in value relying upon the market and the portfolio's arrangement. That being said, variable annuities with a guaranteed return of premium have their risk capped at the rate of inflation plus any fees paid to the annuity provider.
Indexed annuities balance the possible upside of variable annuities with the guaranteed least return of fixed annuities, making them a reasonable option for investors seeking to balance retirement income security with growth potential.
## What Fees Are Associated With Annuities?

## How Are Annuities Taxed?
Annuities are regularly tax-deferred — like a [401(k)](/401kplan) — meaning contributions are not taxed during the accumulation phase. All things being equal, payouts are taxed at a similar rate as normal income during the annuitization phase. This means that all contributions are allowed to earn interest/returns pre-tax.
Since the annuitization phase regularly matches with retirement, annuity holders frequently fall into a lower tax bracket at this stage, allowing them to keep a higher percentage of their funds than they would have had they been taxed as contributions.
## How Are Annuities Set Up?
Annuities can be set up through certain insurance companies, certain financial institutions, and, since the death of the Secure Act in December of 2019, through certain business gave 401(k) retirement plans.
## What Befalls an Annuity When Its Owner Dies?
This relies upon the terms of the annuity's contract. A few annuities stop payments when the holder bites the dust, while others redirect payments to the late contract holder's spouse or family. What befalls an annuity's excess funds when the contract holder passes on can be chosen by every investor when their contract is made.
