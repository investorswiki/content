# Commuting Expenses
## What Are Commuting Expenses?

Commuting expenses are costs that are incurred because of the taxpayer's standard means of getting to and fro to their place of employment. Commuting expenses can incorporate vehicle expenses, trekking expenses, and public transportation costs. These costs are not tax-deductible in the U.S.

## Figuring out Commuting Expenses

The first and most important thing to realize about commuting expenses is that they are rarely deductible. Commuting is perceived by the tax code to be a cost of carrying on with work that influences both business owners and employees. Getting from your home to your work and back — even assuming that trip is 100 miles or all the more every way — is commuting, not business travel.

The equivalent is true assuming you telecommute however sometimes go to Starbucks with your PC. Your trip to the coffee shop is viewed as commuting, not [business travel](/travelexpenses), in light of the fact that you don't begin work until you arrive.

Business travel expenses are deductible, and those deductions follow the following rule of thumb: whenever you have begun working at your place of work, the movement you do to different workplaces is business travel and is a deductible expense.

Commuting expenses can incorporate train, tram, transport or ship tickets, or gas. A few businesses offer a commuting allowance or incorporate in costs into benefits, however regularly, commuting expenses are paid out-of-pocket by employees, managers, and business owners the same.

## Special Considerations

As indicated by the [Internal Revenue Service](/irs) (IRS), a Commuter Expense Reimbursement Account, permitted by chapter 132 of the Internal Revenue Code, allows employees to have their parking and worker expenses deducted on a pre-tax basis. In 2019, employees can deduct up to $260 each month for transit expenses or up to a maximum of $260 each month for parking.

At the point when the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act was endorsed into law on December 22, 2017, it impacted employers with commuting employees. Employers never again receive a federal deduction for offering mass transit, parking benefits, worker parkway vehicle, or parking benefits to employees, except if it is required due to keeping employees safe.

## Instances of Commuting Expenses

On the off chance that you drive a vehicle, ride a bicycle, or take public transit to your work, those expenses are not deductible on your taxes, even assuming you are the business owner. Go to and from work to your residence is viewed as commuting and not deductible business travel.

An employers really do give a commuting allowance to employees as a Qualified Taxable Fringe Benefit (QTFB), and that means employees can pay for transit with pre-tax dollars. Furthermore, a few employers will pay for employees' transit as an unqualified fringe benefit up to a certain amount (normally not more than the tax-deductible $260 permitted by the IRS).

On the off chance that you travel often for work, your commuting expenses end whenever you have arrived at work, and travel among then and when you leave work for home might qualify as business travel, not a commuting expense. For instance, on the off chance that you are a contractor and you travel ten miles to your first job site, that ten miles is considered commuting, yet not business travel. If you travel one more 10 miles to a subsequent site, and one more ten to a third site, that twenty miles is viewed as business travel, and it is deductible. After you leave the third site for home, the miles you travel are again drive miles and not business travel.

On the off chance that you telecommute yet choose to leave your work space for a coffee shop, the money you spend to get to the coffee shop is viewed as commuting and isn't deductible. This means that whenever you have begun work at the coffee shop, assuming you travel to meet a client at an alternate coffee shop, that movement might be viewed as business travel and might be eligible for a tax deduction.
