# Deferred Availability
## What Is Deferred Availability?

In finance, the term deferred availability alludes to a postpone in the processing an as of late deposited [check](/check).

To keep away from fraud that includes cashing terrible checks before they are cleared, regulations exist which limit the amount of time until a deposited check has been handled.

## Grasping Deferred Availability

The rules connecting with the processing speed of recently deposited checks are set out in [Regulation CC](/regulation-cc) of the [Federal Reserve](/federalreservebank). This regulation is responsible for executing the standards set out in the [Expedited Funds Availability Act (EFAA)](/expedited-funds-availability-act), which was enacted by Congress in 1987.

According to these regulations, banks are disallowed from keeping checks on hold for over two days, on account of nearby checks, or five days for away checks. Beginning around 2010, notwithstanding, these regulations have been additionally simplified as all checks deposited inside the United States are presently thought of "neighborhood checks" for the reasons for this provision.

The goal behind these regulations was to discourage fraud and [embezzlement](/embezzlement) schemes. In many such schemes, the culprits exploit the deferral between when a check is deposited versus when it is handled and liquidated by the bank. Through Regulation CC, the window of opportunity for such fraud is limited.

Albeit the standard limit for hold periods is two days for most deposits, there are exemptions accessible which permit banks to hold checks for seven days or longer. For instance, banks might concede the availability of deposits made to new accounts for up to nine business days. In any case, assuming the holder of the new account has aother account at that bank that has been open for over 30 days, the new account hold may not be placed.

Banks may likewise concede the availability of large deposits in excess of $5,000. This applies to deposits of a single instrument valued at $5,000 or more as well as aggregate deposits adding up to more than $5,000. A bank might concede the availability of the whole deposit until the seventh business day.

The bank may likewise do so in the event that the account being referred to has a history of [overdrafts](/overdraft). Regulation CC requires an account to have been overdrawn for no less than six business days out of the previous six months or two business days in the event that the overdraft amount was more than $5,000.

Finally, another conditions in which banks can concede the availability of deposited funds remember circumstances where the deposit for question depends on a picture replacement document (IRD) of a check which was previously dismissed or when the deposit occurred when the bank couldn't function typically, for example, due to a system disappointment or power blackout.
