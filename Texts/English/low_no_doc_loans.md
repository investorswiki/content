# Low/No Documentation Loan
## What Is a Low/No Documentation Loan?

A low/no documentation loan permits a possible borrower to apply for a mortgage while giving practically no data in regards to their employment, income, or assets. Regulation of these loans has advanced altogether beginning around 2008, however they stay an option for certain borrowers in nontraditional financial circumstances.

## How a Low/No Documentation Loan Works

Borrowers who search out these products will quite often have nontraditional income streams that might be more hard to document in a traditional mortgage application. Models could incorporate alternative investments or self-employment arrangements where the borrower limits income reporting for tax purposes. Lenders considering these loans will generally zero in on the candidate's [credit score](/credit_score), ability to make a bigger than-typical down payment, and nontraditional documentation like bank statements. Interest rates on these loans will generally be higher than traditionally documented mortgages.

## Starting points of the Low/No Documentation Loan

A low/no documentation loan might seem like a throwback to the pre-2008 days of liar loans and [subprime](/subprime) lending, yet it stays an option for certain fragments of the mortgage industry. The term's starting points in all actuality do lie in the development to the real estate crash of 2008. In the early and mid-2000s, lenders who were feeling pressure to issue loans with additional good terms released documentation requirements to the point that low-documentation products became typical. [NINJA loans](/ninja-loan) were one class of these products. NINJA is an abbreviation for "no income, job, or asset verification." Lenders frequently extended these loans to borrowers dependent absolutely upon their credit scores, with next to no further documentation of the singular's ability to make payments.

NINJA and other low-documentation loans — alongside subprime lending practices — drove straightforwardly to the crash of 2008. The housing market eased back during the 2000s, and borrowers were progressively unfit to keep up with required payments. Regulatory reactions to this meltdown incorporated a 2008 rule enacted by the Federal Reserve through the [Truth in Lending Act](/tila) (TILA) that required lenders to check a borrower's ability to make payments on any loan where a higher interest rate was forced due to a more vulnerable candidate profile. The 2010 [Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act](/dodd-frank-financial-regulatory-reform-bill) followed, and a modification to Dodd-Frank known as the [ability to repay](/ability-to-repay) rule was concluded by the [Consumer Financial Protection Bureau](/consumer-financial-protection-bureau-cfpb) (CFPB) in January 2013. This rule required lenders to sufficiently decide any borrower's ability to make required month to month mortgage payments. Lenders who failed to do so would be subject to punishments laid out by the U.S. Congress.

### The Return of Low/No Documentation Loans

Large numbers of the most hazardous low/no documentation loan categories, for example, NINJA loans, vanished after the crash of 2008 and the entry of Dodd-Frank. The ability to repay rule, in any case, permitted some room for low-documentation loans, including a class known as [alternative documentation](/alternative_documentation) loans.

A 2018 law canceling segments of the Dodd-Frank Act released standards for possible loans to be viewed as qualifying mortgages. The ability to repay rule was not impacted by this law, however the law made it more straightforward for borrowers to keep away from the low-documentation classification. Numerous more modest banks pushed for this adjustment, contending that the Dodd-Frank limitations were superfluously onerous on these banks. They contended that national lenders had abandoned less secure loans that could demonstrate beneficial to nearby networks, and that more modest banks could support the recovery of real estate markets with more indulgent lending practices.
