# Dividend Irrelevance Theory
## What Is the Dividend Irrelevance Theory

Dividend irrelevance theory holds the conviction that [dividends](/dividend) affect a company's stock price. A dividend is regularly a cash payment produced using a company's profits to its shareholders as a reward for investing in the company. The dividend irrelevance theory proceeds to state that dividends can hurt a company's ability to be competitive in the long term since the money would be better off reinvested in the company to produce [earnings](/earnings).

In spite of the fact that there are companies that have likely selected to pay dividends as opposed to supporting their earnings, there are numerous pundits of the dividend irrelevance theory who accept that dividends assist a company's stock price with rising.

## Figuring out the Dividend Irrelevance Theory

The dividend irrelevance theory recommends that a company's declaration and payment of dividends ought to no affect the stock price. Assuming that this theory holds true, it would mean that dividends don't enhance a company's stock price.

The reason of the theory is that a company's ability to earn a profit and develop its business determines a company's market value and drives the stock price; not dividend payments. The people who have confidence in the dividend irrelevance theory contend that dividends offer no additional benefit to investors and, now and again, contend that dividend payments can hurt the company's financial wellbeing.

## Dividends and the Stock Price

The dividend irrelevance theory holds that the markets perform effectively so any dividend payout will lead to a decline in the stock price by the amount of the dividend. As such, on the off chance that the stock price was $10, and a couple of days after the fact, the company paid a dividend of $1, the stock would fall to $9 per share. Accordingly, holding the stock for the dividend accomplishes no gain since the stock price changes lower for a similar amount of the payout.

Notwithstanding, studies show that stocks that pay dividends, in the same way as other laid out companies called [blue-chip](/bluechip) stocks, frequently increase in price by the amount of the dividend as the [book closure date](/bookclosure) approaches. Albeit the stock can decline once the dividend has been paid, numerous dividend-chasing investors hold these stocks for the reliable dividends they offer, which makes an underlying level of demand.

Likewise, the stock price of a company is driven by more than the company's dividend policy. Analysts conduct valuation activities to determine a stock's [intrinsic value](/intrinsicvalue). These frequently consolidate factors, like dividend payments, along with financial performance, and qualitative estimations, including management quality, economic factors, and a comprehension of the company's position in the industry.

## Dividends and a Company's Financial Health

The dividend irrelevance theory recommends that companies can hurt their financial prosperity by giving dividends, which is certainly not a phenomenal occurrence.

### Assuming Debt

Dividends could hurt a company on the off chance that the company is assuming debt, through giving [bonds](/cling) to investors or borrowing from a bank's [credit facility](/creditfacility), to make their cash dividend payments.

Suppose that a company has caused acquisitions in the past that to have brought about a lot of debt on its [balance sheet](/balancesheet). The [debt-servicing](/debtservice) costs or interest payments can be negative. Additionally, inordinate debt can keep companies from getting to more credit when they need it most. Assuming the company has a firm stance position of continuously paying dividends, defenders of the dividend irrelevance theory would contend that the company is harming itself. More than several years, those dividend payouts might have gone to paying down debt. Less debt could lead to better credit terms on the excess outstanding debt, allowing the company to reduce its debt servicing costs.

Likewise, debt and dividend payments could keep the company from making an acquisition that could be useful to increase earnings in the long term. Of course, it's hard to pinpoint with respect to whether dividend payments are the guilty party of a company's underperformance. Blundering its debt, poor execution by management, and outside factors, like slow economic growth, could all add to a company's hardships. Notwithstanding, companies that don't pay dividends have more cash close by to make acquisitions, invest in assets, and pay down debt with the money saved.

### CAPEX Spending

On the off chance that a company isn't investing in that frame of mind through [capital expenditures (CAPEX)](/capitalexpenditure), there could be a decline in the company's valuation as earnings and competitiveness dissolve over the long haul. Capital expenditures are large investments that companies make in their long-term financial wellbeing and can incorporate purchases of structures, technology, equipment, and acquisitions. Investors that buy dividend-paying stocks need to assess whether a management team is effectively adjusting the payout of dividends and investing in its future.

## Dividend Irrelevance Theory and Portfolio Strategies

Regardless of the dividend irrelevance theory, numerous investors center around dividends while dealing with their portfolios. For instance, a current income strategy tries to distinguish investments that pay better than expected distributions (i.e., dividends and [interest](/interest) payments). While moderately risk-disinclined overall, current income strategies can be remembered for a scope of allocation choices across an inclination of risk.

Strategies zeroed in on income are normally fitting for retired folks or risk-opposed investors. These income-chasing investors buy stocks in laid out companies that have the history of reliably paying dividends and have a low risk of missing a dividend payment.

Blue-chip companies generally pay consistent dividends. These are multinational firms that have been in operation for a number of years, including Coca-Cola, Disney, PepsiCo, Walmart, and Mcdonald's. These companies are prevailing leaders in their separate industries and have fabricated profoundly legitimate brands, getting through different downturns in the economy.

Additionally, dividends can assist with portfolio strategies based on the [preservation of capital](/preservationofcapital). In the event that a portfolio experiences a loss a decline in the stock market, the gains from dividends can assist with offsetting those losses, protecting an investor's well deserved savings.
