## What Is Skycoin (SKY)?

Skycoin is a blockchain project which tries to make a decentralized, peer-to-peer Internet service in which users give network services in exchange to cryptocurrency. Skycoin was sent off in 2013 and the Skywire network was sent off in 2019.

In contrast to [Bitcoin](/bitcoin), Skycoins can't be mined through proof-of-work. Each of the 100 million SKY tokens were made at the send off of the Skycoin blockchain, yet the majority are locked and distant to designers. As of Nov. 8, 2021, Skycoin was positioned the 1235th biggest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, as indicated by CoinMarketCap.

## Grasping Skycoin (SKY)

Skycoin was first considered in 2013 by Brandon "Synth" Smietana, who claims to have been an early engineer in the Bitcoin community.

While working on those projects, Smietana saw the imperfections of Bitcoin's proof-of-work system (for instance, energy shortcoming and the possibility that planned excavators could capture the decentralized system), and chose to make another consensus algorithm that would be both genuinely decentralized and impenetrable to malicious assaults or takeover endeavors.

Skycoin's consensus protocol is called Obelisk. This protocol depends on a "web-of-trust algorithm," in which every node buys into a select number of other network nodes, and the density of a node's network of supporters decides its influence on the network.

The system is hypothesized to circulate influence over the network and goes with consensus choices relying on the influence score of every node. To this end, every node in the network has its own blockchain that acts as a "public telecom channel." According to the white paper:

>
> The public record left by every node's personal blockchain permits the network to react to abandonments by cutting off associations with less trustworthy or malicious nodes. Under a similar principle, on the off chance that the community feels that power inside the network is too focused (or not thought enough), the community can shift the balance of power by and large changing their trust connections.

## Related Skycoin Projects

Skycoin works as an ecosystem of hardware and software products to support its blockchain solution. A portion of these elements look like comparative projects found on Ethereum or other contending blockchains.

### Skycoin Hours

Skycoin Hours, or Coin Hours, is a second-level currency tied to Skycoin expected to boost nodes on the Skycoin network. Holding one Skycoin for an hour in the Skycoin wallet qualifies the holder for one Coin Hour. Coin Hours can be utilized to trade bandwidth and different services inside the Skycoin platform.

### Fiber

Skycoin likewise works its own platform for decentralized applications, which can be utilized to run [Initial Coin Offerings](/initial-coin-offering-ico) (ICOs) or other commercial applications. As per the company, the architecture of Fiber can be depicted as "a vastly scalable network of blockchains laid one next to the other, similar to strands," each strand of which can handle velocities of 300 transactions each second.

Skycoin claims that Fiber is "lightning fast," utilizes little energy, and has no transaction fees. "Since each company has their own blockchain," as per the Skycoin white paper, "they don't face the congestion issues seen on platforms like Ethereum's ERC-20."

### KittyCash

Following the outcome of CryptoKitties, the Skycoin team announced their own cat themed collectibles game in 2018. Albeit basically the same as the Ethereum game, Skycoin claims that KittyCash, which runs on Skycoin Fiber, enjoys the additional benefit of lower transaction costs and higher velocities.

### Skywire

Skywire is estimated as a boosted network that is faster, more affordable, more available, and offers higher QoS than the current Internet. A designers' form of Skywire sent off on mainnet in March of 2019, and a "public mainnet" sent off a year after the fact.

Skywire can be imagined as a decentralized network that permits users to exchange data without undermining their namelessness. Traffic is steered through Skywire nodes, which give calculation, storage, and bandwidth in exchange for Skycoin and Coin Hours.

### Skyminer Hardware and Hardware Wallet

Skyminers are multi-processor fixes that act as network nodes on the Skywire meshnet, permitting operators to give network services in exchange to cryptocurrency. Official Skyminers can be requested from the Skycoin company for roughly $2,000 (currently sold out), however a DIY rendition can be worked for $600. The company has likewise alluded to the send off of remote radio wires, which would permit Skyminers to function as nearby ISPs in their area.

Skycoin likewise offers a crypto hardware wallet that is less expensive than the most well known wallets, yet it can hold Skycoin except if the client gives it a firmware upgrade.

## Worries About Skycoin

The desire of Skycoin's projects has driven a few spectators to censure the operation. Given the number of scams that multiplied in 2017 and 2018 and the collapse of numerous crypto projects through 2019, confirming the claims of the leftover projects has become central to protecting investors from being defrauded.

The greatest reactions of Skycoin are that it was [premined](/premining), with all tokens actually heavily influenced by Skycoin engineers. However Obelisk claims to take care of the issues inherent in proof-of-work systems, it isn't clear the way in which it constructs consensus in a way that isn't vulnerable to manipulation, given that Skycoin's creators hold a great majority of the surviving coins.

Smietana likewise has a questionable reputation as a businessman. In June 2018, the Chinese marketing team of Skycoin broke into his home and held him and his family prisoner. They additionally supposedly took more than 18 bitcoins (around then worth around $120,000).

Simon Chandler at Cointelegraph composes the assailants might have been encouraged in light of Smietana's obscure dealings: "There were additionally indications that insider trading was occurring inside the company," he says. "Assuming Skycoin was fraudulent, this might have contributed to the inclination among likely ruffians/looters that they could take Synth's crypto without risk of punishment, given that Synth might have been attentive about uncovering too a lot of his business to public examination."

## The Bottom Line

Skycoin is an aggressive project that claims to make hardware and software for a new, decentralized Internet, worked around the Obelisk consensus algorithm. Notwithstanding, a considerable lot of these commitments sound too great to be true, and the project's leaders have attracted numerous pundits and embarrassments.

## Features
- Skycoin (SKY) is the cryptocurrency associated with Skycoin, a project sent off by Brandon "Synth" Smietana. It runs on a proprietary consensus algorithm called Obelisk that looks to tackle the issues of proof-of-work and proof-of-stake systems.
- Skycoin produces hardware and software to support a decentralized, peer-to-peer Internet service in which infrastructure suppliers are boosted with the SKY cryptocurrency.
- Skycoin has been blamed for being an intricate fraud, however Skycoin supporters arduously deny this.
