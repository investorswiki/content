## What Is a Descriptive Statement?

A descriptive statement is a bank statement that rundowns [deposits](/deposit), [withdrawals](/withdrawal), [service fees](/service-charge), and other such transactions in sequential order. The term "descriptive statement" sometimes alludes specifically to information on a statement for which no physical thing (like a check) is encased.

## Understanding a Descriptive Statement

Under the Federal Reserve System's [Regulation E](/regulation-e), financial institutions must give statements to customers to each month to month cycle in which an electronic funds transfer (EFT) has happened. Specific instances of an EFT under Regulation E incorporate debit card and automated teller machine (ATM) transactions, as well as automated clearing house ([ACH](/ach)) and non-administrator helped telephone transfers. On the off chance that no EFT has happened, just quarterly statements are important.

The [Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act](/dodd-straight to the point financial-administrative reform-bill) in 2010 gave the recently made [Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB)](/consumer-financial-protection-bureau-cfpb) authority for rule making under the Electronic Funds Transfer Act. The CFPB has amended the rules, which additionally address gift cards and gift certificates, several times in the years since.

Separately, the CFPB likewise has authority over credit card statements, because of the [Credit Card Accountability, Responsibility and Disclosure Act of 2009](/credit-card-accountability-responsibility-and-disclosure-act-of-2009), otherwise called the CARD Act.

Such errors could incorporate the consumer getting some unacceptable amount of money from an ATM, unauthorized debit card activity, or an unauthorized wire transfer. Regulation E additionally frames the rules for reporting and settling incidents including lost or taken debit cards.

Progressively, banks will email descriptive statements or make them accessible electronically, due to the ascent in [online banking](/onlinebanking) and [mobile banking](/mobile-banking).

Consumers who receive their bank statements electronically need to take extra care to shield their sensitive data from programmers, utilizing complex passwords, secret word managers, and different forms of security. They additionally need to survey their statements, whatever form those come in, with the goal that they can report any errors speedily.
