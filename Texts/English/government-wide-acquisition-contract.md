## What Is a Government-Wide Acquisition Contract (GWAC)?

A government-wide acquisition contract (GWAC) is a contract where numerous government agencies adjust their requirements and purchase a contract for goods or services. Government-wide acquisition contracts (GWACs) allow for [economies of scale](/economiesofscale), which as a rule reduce per-unit costs.

These contracts are ordinarily used to purchase new technology, like PCs. With a GWAC, the federal government can get creative answers for data technology systems at a better cost to citizens paying. This type of contract might be initiated by one specific agency with the expectation that more agencies will follow suit.

## Understanding Government-Wide Acquisition Contracts (GWAC)

The rise of government-wide acquisition contracts has allowed government agencies to exploit their size to arrange lower prices. Their utilization has likewise established an environment in which a single vendor will give product and service support to more staff.

By having one agency assess a vendor for different agencies' requirements, the federal government can reduce the probability that different agencies should "waste time" by embraced their own, separate vetting process.

As indicated by the U.S. General Services Administration (GSA), the IT arrangements that GWACs give access to incorporate systems design, software engineering, data assurance, and enterprise architecture arrangements.

Notwithstanding GWACs under GSA, there are GWACs from NASA and the National Institute of Health (NIH). These substances allow for the government to secure various contracts to get enlightening technology arrangements for a minimal price with an assortment of [tech companies](/technology_sector) that have been approved to take part.

The GWAC Prices Paid Tool furnishes federal agencies with nitty gritty data on how their IT dollars are spent on GSA GWACs. These devices assist with giving a practical price analysis, discussions, independent government cost gauges (IGCE), and aid in benchmarking competitive prices.

Government-wide agency contracts (GWACs) have become more famous in the last five years when compared to agency-specific contracts. In 2015, GWACs were 12% of spend and developed to 20% of spend in 2019. The primary justification for the growth is cost and convenience and GWACs are expected to keep filling in notoriety.

## Types of Government-Wide Acquisition Contracts (GWACs)
### Stars II

The Stars II GWAC "offers access to exceptionally qualified, certified 8(a) small disadvantaged organizations. The contract has a $22 billion program ceiling." This is offered through the GSA.

### Vets 2

The VETS 2 GWAC is remarkably set to the side for the exclusive utilization of Service-Disabled, Veteran-Owned Small Businesses (SDVOSB). VETS 2 is designed to give a series of data technology systems for the federal government, including new and emerging technologies. The contract program ceiling is $5 billion. Vets 2 is offered through the GSA.

### Alliant 2 (A2)

The Alliant 2 GWAC gives IT arrangements that can be purchased as a total package, covering hardware, software, and services.This is likewise offered through the GSA.

### SEWP

NASA's GWACs are known as SEWPs (Solutions for Enterprise-Wide Procurement). They furnish the government with tablets, work areas, waiters, IT peripherals, network equipment, storage systems, security devices, software products, cloud-based services, and that's only the tip of the iceberg.

### NITAAC

The NIH Information Technology Acquisition and Assessment Center (NITAAC) works through the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and the National Institute of Health (NIH). It offers GWACs through three separate programs: CIO-SP3, CIO-SP3 Small Businesses, and CIO-CS, which is centered around IT commodities.
