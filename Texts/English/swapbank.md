# Swap Bank
## What Is a Swap Bank?

A swap bank is an institution that acts as a broker between two counterparties who wish to go into an interest rate or currency swap agreement and perhaps stay anonymous. It unites the two ends of the bargain and commonly procures a slight premium from both counterparties for facilitating the swap.

## Understanding Swap Banks

A swap is a subsidiary agreement through which two gatherings exchange financial instruments. There's really nothing that these instruments can't be nearly, however most swaps include cash flows in view of a [notional principal amount](/notionalprincipalamount) to which the two players concur. Normally, the principal doesn't change hands. Each cash flow contains one leg of the swap. One cash flow is generally fixed, while the other is variable, that is to say, in view of a benchmark interest rate, [floating currency exchange rate](/floatingexchangerate), or index price.

Swaps don't trade on exchanges, and retail investors don't generally take part in swaps. Rather, swaps are [over-the-counter](/otc) (OTC) contracts between organizations or financial institutions. In any case, smaller institutions might in any case approach this market through a swap bank.

Generally talking, companies don't straightforwardly approach other companies trying to make swap agreements. All things being equal, swap banks coordinate the swap agreements for companies. Generally speaking, the personalities of the counterparties are obscure to one another, and frequently to the swap bank, too.
