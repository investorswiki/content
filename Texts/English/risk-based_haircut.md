# Risk-Based Haircut
## What Is a Risk-Based Haircut?

A risk-based haircut reduces the recognized value of an asset to decide an OK degree of margin or [financial leverage](/leverage) when an investor purchases or keeps on possessing the asset. All in all, haircuts endeavor to measure the chance of an asset falling below its current market value and lay out an adequate buffer to safeguard the investor against a [margin call](/margincall). A margin call could force the investor to deposit more money into their brokerage account or sell assets held in the account.

## Understanding a Risk-Based Haircut

A risk-based haircut is a critical stage in protecting against the possibility of a margin call or a comparative type of over-leveraged position. A margin call is the point at which the value of an investor's [margin account](/marginaccount) falls below the broker's required amount, requiring the investor to either deposit more money or securities into the account to bring the amount back up to the broker's required least value or [maintenance margin](/maintenancemargin).

For instance, when an investor involves securities as [collateral](/collateral) on a loan, the lender will typically devalue the securities by a certain amount to give a cushion in case the market value of the securities falls. This amount might be greater in the event that the securities the investor tries to use as collateral are viewed as risky by the lender. That percentage of value reduction is called a risk-based haircut.

Misleadingly lessening the recognized value of an asset prior to taking a leveraged position allows the actual [market value](/marketvalue) of the asset to fall farther than a comparable asset without a haircut before a margin call occurs. This diminishes the chance of an inadequately planned margin call or the forced sale of a security at a lower price. The amount of the haircut mirrors the apparent risk of loss from the asset falling in value or being sold in a fire sale. In the event collateral is sold to cover the margin call, the lender will get an opportunity of breaking even.

The [haircut](/haircut) is typically communicated as a percentage of the collateral's market value. For instance, a risky stock worth $50 a share might receive a 25% haircut and might be valued at $37.50 in the event that it is utilized as collateral. Haircuts might comprise of positions in stocks, [futures](/futurescontract), and options on futures of similar underlying asset or profoundly related instruments. They additionally apply to various asset classes like equity, index, and currency products.

The risk-based haircut methodology joins parts of [options pricing theory](/optionpricingtheory) and portfolio theory to register capital charges. This system complies with guidelines set out by the [Securities and Exchange Commission](/sec) (SEC) net capital rule under the [Securities Exchange Act of 1934](/seact1934).

## What Determines the Haircut Amount?

The primary determinants that impact the haircut amount are the [default risk](/defaultrisk) of the borrower and the different viewpoints that might lead to a drop in the value of the collateral. The riskier the borrower is, meaning the almost certain they will default on the loan, the higher the haircut amount will be. Additionally, the higher the probability that the collateral will drop in value, the higher the haircut will be.

A lender needs to survey the ability and the value that they can recover the loan assuming the borrower defaults on it. Assuming a lender feels that they can sell the collateral for its market value with practically no issue, the haircut will be low. Then again, assuming that they predict difficulty in selling the collateral and especially at its face value, the higher the haircut will be.

## Calculation of a Risk-Based Haircut

The [Options Clearing Corporation](/occ) (OCC) gives both the benefit and loss values used to deliver the portfolio margin requirement. Working out this follows a proprietary deduction of the Cox-Ross-Rubinstein [binomial option pricing model](/binomialoptionpricing) developed by the OCC. This pricing model ascertains the projected liquidating prices for American-style options.

Projected prices are calculated by the closing price of the underlying asset every day plus or minus price moves from 10 equidistant data points from an extended period. The biggest projected loss for the whole class or gathering of eligible products (of the 10 potential market situations) is the required capital charge for the portfolio.

For European-style options, the OCC utilizes a [Black-Scholes model](/blackscholes). This model computes projected prices based on the daily closing underlying asset price combined with plus and minus moves at 10 equidistant data points covering a scope of market movement.

## Illustration of a Risk-Based Haircut

Hedge Fund ABC has a margin account with Broker XYZ and will purchase futures. The fund is required to post $10 million in [margin](/margin) into their account for their futures purchases. As margin, Hedge Fund ABC chooses to post securities, which are valued at $10 million.

Broker XYZ surveys the risk of these securities and confirms that they ought to have a risk-based haircut of 10% to think about the risk that the securities will devalue. This compares to a risk-based haircut of $1 million. The value of the securities is in this manner $9 million as margin into the fund's account, meaning they should in any case post an extra $1 million to meet the $10-million requirement.
