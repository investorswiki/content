# Production Credit Association (PCA)
## What Is a Production Credit Association?

A Production Credit Association (PCA) is a federal entity made through the Farm Credit Act of 1933 to give short-and intermediate-term credit to farmers, farmers, and rural inhabitants. The credit was extended so the beneficiaries could purchase housing, perform marketing activities, purchase farm equipment and animals, and operate farm-related organizations. At that point, credit was either not accessible or was accessible just at restrictively high interest rates in light of the [Great Depression](/great_depression). Farmland and commodities weren't worth so much, and banks previously had loads of agricultural loans on their books.

Production Credit Associations can make or guarantee loans whose terms don't surpass seven, 10, or 15 years, contingent upon the funding bank's policies.

## Understanding Production Credit Associations

Item Credit Associations are a part of a bigger body known as the [Farm Credit System](/farm-credit-system). The Farm Credit System, a government-sponsored enterprise laid out in 1916, gives financing and financial services connected with agriculture and incorporates a number of credit organizations. Notwithstanding Production Credit Associations, the Farm Credit System incorporates agricultural credit associations, agricultural credit banks, banks for cooperatives, farm credit banks, federal intermediate credit banks, federal land bank associations, and federal land credit associations. Production Credit Associations get their funding from farm credit banks and own their loan assets. The Farm Credit System fund-raises by selling debt securities to investors in the U.S. what's more, abroad.
