# Clean-Up Requirement
## What Is a Clean-Up Requirement?

A clean-up requirement is a condition that is frequently written into the contracts of yearly renewable lines of credit or revolving lines of credit. Clean-ups aren't normally required on [secured credit](/securedcard) cards or lines.

A clean-up requirement clause might require the borrower to pay off any remaining balance on the [line of credit](/lineofcredit) and afterward cease to involve the credit extension for a predefined period of time. Clean-up requirements are generally carried out for the purpose of keeping borrowers from involving lines of credit as continuous permanent [financing](/financing).

A clean-up requirement is some of the time alluded to as an "yearly clean-up."

## How a Clean-Up Requirement Works

The intent of a clean-up requirement clause is typically to guarantee that businesses don't begin depending too intensely on a credit extension they lay out and that their revenue from sales is the primary source of income. Without such limitations, it is conceivable that a business could pay its normal, recurring operating expenses like payroll, rent, or utilities-through a credit extension instead of from produced earnings. Such dependence on a credit extension could demonstrate the company isn't generating sufficient income to support itself or pay off its debt. This could lead to a cycle of a business taking out an ever increasing number of lines of credit to pay its bills until it maximizes all suitable credit options.

The terms of a clean-up requirement might call for the borrower to get the balance on its line free from credit and keep it at zero for 90 successive days (during a year period).

Different expectations of clean-up periods can incorporate customers not causing overdrafts for 30 or 60 days every year they utilize a revolving credit extension. There could likewise be a requirement that the amount of money that stays outstanding from the credit extension be kept inside certain limits. For instance, the customer might be under an imperative that for something like 30 days of the year period, the principal balance can't surpass a set percentage of the full credit extension. This would force the borrower to either limit the utilization of the credit line or to pay down the balance to keep it inside those boundaries.

Such requirements can assist financial institutions with decreasing their exposure by offering some guarantee that their customers are not gathering debts they can't repay. In any case, clean-up requirements are turning out to be more uncommon. Many banking institutions don't see the need to make their customers "clean up" their lines of credit for however long clients' accounts are up-to-date and principal and premium payments are received on time.
