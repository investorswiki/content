# Taxable Wage Base
## What Is the Taxable Wage Base?

The taxable wage base is the maximum amount of [earned income](/earnedincomecredit) that employees must pay Social Security taxes on. Generally, the employee's gross wages will be equivalent to the taxable wage base. Normally, an employer will handle this calculation and withhold the right amount of taxes from every one of the employee's paychecks; however, the employee is as yet responsible for reporting the tax on their tax return every year. The taxable wage base is otherwise called the Social Security wage base.

## Understanding the Taxable Wage Base

The [Social Security tax](/social-security-tax) rate is 12.4%. Half of the tax, which comes to 6.2%, is paid by the employer, and the employee is responsible for paying the other half. However, Social Security tax is applied to earnings up to a certain limit. Wages, salaries, and bonuses in excess of the stipulated maximum amount of earnings are not taxable. The limit changes annually, pegged to changes in the public average wage index.

Think about an employee, Rob, who earns $85,000 in [gross income](/grossincome) and has a 6.2% Social Security tax withheld from his pay. The federal government, in effect, will collect 6.2% x $85,000 = $5,270 from Rob to help fund [retirement](/retirement-planning) and disability benefits for retired folks. In certain occurrences, an employee will earn wages that can be classified as excess wage. The excess wage can be subtracted from gross income with the goal that the taxable wage base is lower than gross income.

For instance, assume another employee, Sue, earns $175,000 gross income. The Social Security tax rate will simply be applied up to the taxable wage base of $147,000, which is not as much as her gross income. Hence, Sue will pay 6.2% x $147,000 = $9,114 as her contribution to the country's Social Security account for retired folks and the disabled.

Note that albeit Social Security tax is applied up to the taxable wage base, [Medicare tax](/medicare) of 2.9% has no such limit; it is applied on 100% of income.

> Social Security tax and Medicare tax are collectively known as [Federal Insurance Contributions Act](/fica) (FICA) taxes. The 7.65% of gross income that an employee pays towards them shows up as FICA taxes on their paystub and on their annual W-2 form.
