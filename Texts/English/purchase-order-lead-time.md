# Purchase Order Lead Time (POLT)
## What Is Purchase Order Lead Time (POLT)?

Purchase order lead time (POLT) alludes to the number of days from when a company submits a request for production inputs it needs, to when those things show up at the [manufacturing](/manufacturing) plant. Put essentially, a POLT is the estimated time wherein it takes to receive an order after it's put. Purchase order lead times differ from one company to another and from [industry](/industry) to industry, and rely upon many factors, for example, the types of goods or materials being ordered, their relative overflow or scarcity, where the providers are found, and, surprisingly, the time of year.

## Understanding Purchase Order Lead Time

As referenced over, the purchase order lead time is the manner by which long it takes for an order to be satisfied â€” from the time the order is put until the estimated date of receipt. So on the off chance that a company puts in a request for supplies on May 1 and it's expected to be delivered on May 10, the POLT for the supplies is nine days. The POLT incorporates a number of various advances including the confirmation of the order, availability of the goods, the order placement, affirmation of the order, the delivery notice, receipt of the goods, [invoicing](/receipt), and payments.

Companies must carefully plan purchase order lead times while planning a manufacturing run since, in such a case that production inputs don't show up on schedule, manufacturing will be delayed, costing the company money in lost sales, idle worker time, and lower factory [overhead absorption](/absorptioncosting). Then again, in the event that inputs show up before the expected time, the company could bring about extra inventory storage costs.

Consequently, managers need to plan as the need might arise to order the materials required, in case they bring about extra [overhead](/overhead). In the event that they have a trusted [supply chain](/supplychain), this ought to be one of the main things added to a production as well as staffing calendar.

There are ways companies can reduce the number of days in a POLT:

- Expanding the number of orders. This is a better option compared to putting in a couple of large orders. Thusly, companies can set aside both time and cash, and can guarantee they have very little of a certain supply, while keeping up with sufficient stock to keep satisfying orders.
- Evolving providers. Utilizing neighborhood or domestic providers over international ones might assist with cutting down on lead times, which, once more, can set aside on time and cash.
- Robotizing the order cycle. By moving to a system that consequently puts in and satisfies requests, companies can free up labor for different tasks, and staff can have additional opportunity to take care of their responsibilities. Automation likewise helps cut back on any possibility of blunder with regards to order placement.

## Special Considerations

A company can set up a [two-bin inventory control system](/two-bin-inventory-control), which can largely robotize the reordering system for small or low-esteem things or materials. For additional important inputs, a company must keep at the top of the priority list the shipment time as well as the order processing time too.

In the event that supplies are ordered on Friday evening, the order may not be until Monday, and that means a loss of two days. If [raw materials](/rawmaterials) are in scant supply, a manufacturer may not receive the ideal quantity, and they may not show up on time in the event that the provider needs to source the materials from elsewhere before it boats to the customer.

In the event that there is high seasonal demand for a specific raw material, that might influence whether supplies are received in a timely fashion. Even however a producer might want to keep away from superfluous storage costs, they could decide to keep a buffer supply at any rate to safeguard against shipment delays.

Visibility of real-time inventory levels of raw materials is empowered by online software associations among manufacturer and provider who care about supply chain [logistics](/logistics). The more the buyer conveys its forward needs by giving demand gauges to the seller, the more accurate the order lead times will be.
