## What Is Benefit Offset?

Benefit offset is a reduction in the amount of benefit payments received by a participant in a retirement plan that might result when the participant owes money to the plan.

## Understanding Benefit Offset

Benefit offset is planned to change the retirement benefits the [plan participant](/planparticipant) receives, given the late contributions the participant ought to have paid in the past. Basically, the late contributions owed by the participant are deducted from their retirement payments to guarantee they are paid to the plan.

This type of offset can likewise happen assuming the participant is getting retirement benefits from sources other than the plan. The [U.S. Social Security Act](/social-security-act) accommodates the withholding of up to 10% of a plan participant's benefits to make up for funds owed to the plan.

## An Overview of Retirement Plan Benefits

The type of benefits paid from retirement plans depend on the [distribution](/distribution) options accessible under each plan and races made by participants and their [beneficiaries](/recipient).

Unmarried participants must receive a single-life annuity except if deferred.
