# Civil Rights Act of 1964 and Other Milestones in Civil Rights Law

The Civil Rights Act of 1964 was milestone legislation that prompted other civil rights laws throughout the long term. How could it happen? By the mid 1960s, the civil rights movement had brought national thoughtfulness regarding racial barriers in education, public transportation, and utilization of public facilities, like eateries and theaters. In 1963 — in the wake of unforgiving treatment of serene protestors by the police and the homicides of civil rights activists — President John F. Kennedy called for a significant civil rights bill. His efforts were delayed in the Senate. After Kennedy's death that year, his replacement, President Lyndon B. Johnson, took up the reason. With the backing of activists like Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., the bill passed in the House and Senate in 1964.

In the decades since the law's passage, restrictions against discrimination have been expanded. This is the thing the 1964 law incorporates, as well as a glance at subsequent civil rights legislation.

This milestone federal legislation restricted discrimination on the basis of race, variety, religion, sex, and national beginning.

## Effects and Limits of Civil Rights Law

Civil rights laws have made substantial gains for equivalent treatment in numerous areas of American life. They have not, in any case, managed to even the playing field of opportunity. Prejudice — the confidence in the mediocrity or prevalence of a specific race, which was utilized to "legitimize" subjugation — holds its hold. Systemic prejudice alludes to the system of laws, regulations, and cultural arrangements that keep many ethnic minorities in poverty and lift opportunities for White individuals.

Illegal-yet far and wide housing discrimination powers numerous to live in poor, higher-crime areas. Police violence kills many African Americans consistently, and oppressive captures and sentences have brought about the lopsided imprisonment of Black individuals. Low voter turnout prompts lack of representation and the underfunding of schools and civic undertakings in poor and minority areas. Poor education and job discrimination limit opportunities and income. Lack of healthcare prompts high disease rates and lower life expectancy. The COVID-19 pandemic has negatively affected U.S. Black, Latinx, and Native American people group. Poverty, unemployment, voting rights, access to healthcare, and quality education stay the main issues for civil rights.
