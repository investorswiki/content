Insurance companies run a fragile business. They guarantee to make payments for their policyholders to cover damages that the policyholder might experience in life. To guarantee that they are in the financial position to make these payments, insurance companies and regulators require different regulations to be met and tests to be run.

BCAR considers the premiums currently written by the insurer, [reinsurance](/reinsurance) coverage, and loss reserves. By laying out a guideline for the net required capital expected to support balance sheet strength, BCAR can help analysts in separating among the financial strength of insurers and in deciding if a rating unit's capitalization is proper for its risk profile.

The fundamental formula for BCAR is as per the following:

**BCAR = Adjusted Policyholders' Surplus (APHS)/Net Required Capital (NRC)**

APHS considers unearned [premiums](/insurance-premium), assets, [loss reserves](/loss-reserve), reinsurance (equity adjustments), surplus notes, debt service requirements (debt adjustments), and different adjustments, like potential catastrophe losses and future operating losses.
