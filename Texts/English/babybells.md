This gave AT&T almost complete control over both telephone service and equipment in the country.

AT&T felt it planned to lose the case and chose to propose another option — a deliberate breakup of perhaps of the biggest company in America. The proposal was accepted for certain adjustments. After the divestiture, the Baby Bell regional [holding companies](/holdingcompany) retained the Bell trademark.
