## What Is the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA)?

The Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) is a division of the U.S. federal government's [Department of Commerce](/department-of-commerce) that is responsible for the analysis and reporting of economic data used to affirm and anticipate [economic trends](/economic-conditions) and [business cycles](/businesscycle).

## Grasping the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA)

Reports from the BEA extraordinarily influence government [economic policy](/monetarypolicy) decisions, [investment](/investment) activity in the [private sector](/private-sector), and buying and selling designs in global [stock markets](/stockmarket). The BEA says its mission is to advance a better comprehension of the U.S. [economy](/economy) by giving the most convenient, significant, and accurate economic accounts data in an objective and savvy way. To accomplish its goal, the government agency takes advantage of a huge swath of data collected at neighborhood, state, federal, and international levels. Its job is to sum up this data and present it speedily and routinely to the public.

Reports are delivered at international, national, regional, and industry levels. Every one contains data on key factors, for example, [economic growth](/economicgrowth), regional economic development, between industry connections, and the nation's position in the world economy. This means that a ton of the data the bureau distributes is closely checked.

As a matter of fact, the BEA's data is known to routinely influence things like [interest rates](/interestrate), trade policy, [taxes](/taxes), spending, hiring, and investing.

## Statistics Analyzed by the BEA

Among the most compelling statistics dissected and reported by the BEA are [gross domestic product](/gdp) (GDP) data and the U.S. [balance of trade](/bot) (BOT).

### Gross Domestic Product (GDP)

The GDP report is one of the BEA's most vital outputs. It lets us know the monetary value of the multitude of completed goods and services delivered inside a country's lines in a specific time span.

GDP gives the public an indication of an economy's size. In addition, when compared against prior periods, this data can uncover whether the economy is [expanding](/development) (creating more goods and services) or [contracting](/withdrawal) (enlisting declining output). The heading of GDP helps [central banks](/centralbank) decide if it is important to intercede with monetary policy or not.

On the off chance that the growth rate is easing back, policymakers should seriously mull over introducing a [expansionary policy](/expansionary_policy) to give the economy a lift. If, then again, the economy is running at full choke, a decision may be made to curb [inflation](/inflation) and put spending down.

However GDP is generally calculated on an annual basis, it tends to be calculated on a [quarterly](/quarter) basis too â€” in the United States, for instance, the government releases a [annualized](/annualize) GDP estimate for each quarter and furthermore for a whole year.

> GDP has been positioned as one of the three most compelling measures that influence U.S. financial markets and is credited as the Department of Commerce's most noteworthy accomplishment of the twentieth century.

### Balance of Trade (BOT)

The [balance of trade](/bot) (BOT) measures economic [transactions](/exchange) between a nation and its trading partners, showing the difference between the value of a country's [imports](/import) and [exports](/send out) for a given period.

The BEA reports on the U.S. [balance of payments](/bop) (BOP), covering goods and services that move all through the country. [Economists](/financial specialist) utilize this data to check the relative strength of a country's economy. At the point when exports are higher than imports, it will in general lift GDP. In the contrary scenario, it makes a [trade deficit](/trade_deficit).

A trade deficit regularly lets us know that a country isn't delivering an adequate number of goods for its occupants, compelling them to buy them abroad. A deficit can likewise signal that a country's consumers are sufficiently rich to purchase a greater number of goods than their country produces.
