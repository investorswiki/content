# Intermarket Analysis
## What Is Intermarket Analysis?

Intermarket analysis is a method of dissecting markets by inspecting the correlations between various [asset classes](/assetclasses). At the end of the day, what occurs in one market could, and most likely does, influences different markets, so a study of the relationship(s) could end up being beneficial to the trader.

## Grasping Intermarket Analysis

Intermarket analysis takes a gander at more than one related asset class or financial market to decide the strength, or weakness, of the financial markets, or asset classes, being thought of.

Rather than taking a gander at financial markets or asset classes on an individual basis, intermarket analysis takes a gander at several strongly related markets, or asset classes, for example, [stocks](/stock), [bonds](/bondmarket), [currencies](/money trade), and [commodities](/commodity). This type of analysis develops basically taking a gander at every individual market or asset in detachment by likewise taking a gander at different markets or assets that have a strong relationship to the market or asset being thought of.

For instance, while studying the U.S. market, it is advantageous to check the U.S out. bond market, commodity prices, and the [U.S. Dollar](/usd-US dollar). The changes in the connected markets, for example, commodity prices, may affect the U.S. stock market and would should be perceived to get a greater comprehension representing things to come course of the U.S. stock market.

Intermarket analysis ought to be considered [fundamental analysis](/fundamentalanalysis) in that it depends more on relationships to give a general ability to know east from west, however, it is much of the time classified as a branch of [technical analysis](/technicalanalysis). There are various ways to deal with intermarket analysis, including mechanical and rule-based.

## Intermarket Analysis Correlations

Performing an analysis of intermarket relationships is somewhat simple where one would require data, widely accessible and free nowadays, and a calculation sheet or charting program. A simple correlation study is the least demanding type of intermarket analysis to perform. This type of analysis is the point at which one variable is compared with a second variable in a different data set.

A positive correlation can go as high as +1.0, which addresses a perfect correlation between the two data sets. A perfect inverse (negative) correlation portrays a value as low as - 1.0. Readings close to the zero line would show that there is no way to see a correlation between the two examples.

A perfect correlation between any two markets for an extremely long period of time is rare, however most analysts would presumably concur that any perusing supported over the +0.7 or under the - 0.7 level (which would compare to roughly a 70% correlation) is measurably critical. Likewise, in the event that a correlation moves from positive to negative, the relationship would in all probability be unsound, and presumably pointless for trading.

The most widely accepted [correlation](/correlation) is the inverse correlation between stock prices and interest rates, which proposes that as interest rates go up, stock prices go lower, and on the other hand, as interest rates go down, stock prices go up.

## Highlights
- Intermarket analysis is a method of breaking down markets by inspecting the correlations between various asset classes.
- A simple correlation study is the least demanding type of intermarket analysis to perform, where results range from - 1.0 (perfect negative correlation) to +1.0 (perfect positive correlation).
- The most widely accepted correlation is the inverse correlation between stock prices and interest rates, which hypothesizes that as interest rates go up, stock prices go lower, and vice versa.
