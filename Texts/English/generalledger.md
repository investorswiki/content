## What Is a General Ledger?

An overall ledger addresses the record-staying with system for a's financial data, with debit and credit account records approved by a [trial balance](/trial_balance). It gives a record of each financial transaction that happens during the life of an operating company and holds account data that is expected to prepare the company's [financial statements](/financial-statements). Transaction data is segregated, by type, into accounts for assets, liabilities, [owners' equity](/stockholdersequity), revenues, and expenses.

## How a General Ledger Works

An overall ledger is the foundation of a system employed by accountants to store and coordinate financial data used to make the company's financial statements. Transactions are posted to individual sub-ledger accounts, as defined by the company's [chart of accounts](/chart-accounts).

The transactions are then closed out or summed up to the overall ledger, and the accountant produces a trial balance, which fills in as a report of every ledger account's balance. The trial balance is checked for errors and adjusted by posting extra vital passages, and afterward the adjusted trial balance is utilized to create the financial statements.

## How a General Ledger Functions With Double-Entry Accounting

An overall ledger is utilized by organizations that utilize the [double-entry](/twofold entry) bookkeeping method, and that means that each financial transaction influences something like two sub-ledger accounts, and every entry has no less than one debit and one credit transaction. Twofold entry transactions, called "journal sections," are posted in two columns, with debit passages on the left and credit sections on the right, and the total of all debit and credit passages must balance.

The [accounting equation](/accounting-equation), which underlies twofold entry accounting, is as per the following:
<span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mtext>Assets</mtext><mo>−</mo><mtext>Liabilities</mtext><mo>=</mo><mtext>Stockholders’ Equity</mtext></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\text{Assets} - \text{Liabilities} = \text{Stockholders&#x27; Equity}</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.76666em;vertical-align:-0.08333em;"></span><span class="mord text"><span class="mord">Assets</span></span><span class="mspace" style="margin-right:0.2222222222222222em;"></span><span class="mbin">−</span><span class="mspace" style="margin-right:0.2222222222222222em;"></span></span><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.69444em;vertical-align:0em;"></span><span class="mord text"><span class="mord">Liabilities</span></span><span class="mspace" style="margin-right:0.2777777777777778em;"></span><span class="mrel">=</span><span class="mspace" style="margin-right:0.2777777777777778em;"></span></span><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.8888799999999999em;vertical-align:-0.19444em;"></span><span class="mord text"><span class="mord">Stockholders’ Equity</span></span></span></span></span>
The [balance sheet](/balancesheet) follows this organization and shows data at an itemized account level. For instance, the balance sheet shows several asset accounts, including cash and accounts receivable, in its short-term assets section.

The twofold entry accounting method works in view of the accounting equation's requirement that transactions posted to the accounts on the left of the equivalent sign in the formula must approach the total of transactions posted to the account (or accounts) on the right. Even on the off chance that the equation is introduced in an unexpected way (like Assets = Liabilities + Stockholders' Equity), the adjusting rule generally applies.

## What Does a General Ledger Tell You?

The transaction subtleties contained in the overall ledger are gathered and summed up at different levels to deliver a trial balance, [income statement](/incomestatement), balance sheet, statement of cash flows, and numerous other financial reports. This helps accountants, company management, analysts, investors, and different partners survey the company's performance on a continuous basis.

At the point when expenses spike in a given period, or a company records different transactions that influence its revenues, net income, or other key financial [metrics](/metrics), the financial statement data frequently doesn't recount the whole story. On account of certain types of accounting errors, it becomes important to return to the overall ledger and dive into the detail of each recorded transaction to find the issue. On occasion this can include evaluating many journal passages, yet it is basic to keep up with dependably blunder free and trustworthy company financial statements.

## A Balance Sheet Transaction Example

On the off chance that a company gets payment from a client for a $200 invoice, for instance, the company accountant increases the cash account with a $200 debit and finishes the entry with a credit, or reduction, of $200 to accounts receivable. The posted debit and credit sums are equivalent.

In this example, one asset account (cash) is increased by $200, while one more asset account (accounts receivable) is diminished by $200. The net outcome is that both the increase and the abatement just influence one side of the accounting equation. Subsequently, the equation stays in balance.

## An Income Statement Transaction Example

The income statement follows its own formula, which can be written as follows:

## Features
- General ledger transactions are a summary of transactions made as journal sections to sub-ledger accounts.
- The trial balance is a report that rundowns each broad ledger account and its balance, making changes simpler to check and errors more straightforward to find.
- General ledger accounts incorporate all the transaction data expected to deliver the income statement, balance sheet, and other financial reports.
- The overall ledger is the foundation of a company's twofold entry accounting system.
## FAQ
### What Is an Example of a General Ledger Entry?
Consider the accompanying model where a company gets a $1,000 payment from a client for its services. The accountant would then increase the asset column by $1,000 and take away $1,000 from accounts receivable. The equation stays in balance, as the equivalent increase and decline influence one side — the asset side — of the accounting equation.
### Is a General Ledger Part of the Double-Entry Bookkeeping Method?
Indeed, a company that utilizes a twofold entry bookkeeping method utilizes the overall ledger method of putting away company financial data. In particular, twofold entry bookkeeping is the point at which every transaction influences something like one debit and one credit transaction. As such, every transaction shows up in two columns, a debit column and a credit column, whose totals must balance. Under this adjusting rule, the accompanying equation applies:- Assets - Liabilities = Stockholders' Equity.
### What Is the Purpose of a General Ledger?
In accounting, an overall ledger is utilized to record a company's all's transactions. Inside an overall ledger, transactional data is organized into assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses, and proprietor's equity. After each sub-ledger has been closed out, the accountant prepares the trial balance. This data from the trial balance is then used to make the company's financial statements, for example, its balance sheet, income statement, statement of cash flows, and other financial reports.
