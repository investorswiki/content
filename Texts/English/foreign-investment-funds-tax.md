Investments that could have possibly fallen under the FIF tax incorporate personal retirement funds, like American [IRAs](/ira) and Canadian RRSPs, as well as [life insurance](/lifeinsurance) coverings, which are much of the time sold by overseas advisors. Also, the FIF tax applied to any income from foreign companies that were controlled by foreign citizens.

Beginning around 2010 the Foreign Investment Funds Tax has been revoked and supplanted with various tax regulations.
