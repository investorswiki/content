## What Is a Surrender Fee?

A normal annuity surrender fee could be 10% of the funds contributed to the contract inside the main year it is effective. For each successive year of the contract, the surrender fee could drop by 1%. Subsequently, the [annuitant](/annuitant), in this case, would effectively have the option of no-penalty withdrawals 10 years after the contract was agreed upon.

Surrender fees can apply for periods as short as 30 days or up to 15 years on a few annuity and insurance products. On account of mutual funds, a short-term surrender fee might apply.
