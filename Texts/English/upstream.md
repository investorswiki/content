# Upstream
## What Is Upstream?

Upstream is a term for the operations stages in the oil and gas industry that include exploration and production. Oil and gas companies can generally be partitioned into three segments: upstream, midstream, and downstream. Upstream firms deal fundamentally with the exploration and initial production stages of the oil and gas industry.

Many large oil companies are called "integrated" on the grounds that they join upstream activities with [midstream](/midstream) and [downstream](/downstream) operations, which occur after the production phase through to the point of sale.

## Seeing Upstream

The upstream sector of the oil and gas industry incorporates every one of the steps required from the preliminary exploration through the extraction of the resource. Upstream companies can be associated with every one of the steps of this phase of the life cycle of the oil and gas industry, or they may just be engaged with part of the upstream sector.

One more name for the upstream oil sector, which is more representative of what happens in this stage of development of an oil asset as well as natural gas asset, is the [exploration and production](/exploration-production-company) (E&P) sector. The E&P segment is the earliest portion of the oil and gas production process. Companies inside this segment are essentially centered around finding and extricating commodities from the earth.

The exploration stage includes the quest for [hydrocarbons](/hydrocarbon), which are the primary parts of petroleum and natural gas. Land overviews are performed to assist with distinguishing the areas that are the most encouraging. The goal is to find specific minerals underground to estimate the amount of oil and gas reserves before drilling. Geologists study rock arrangements and layers of silt inside the soil to distinguish assuming that oil or natural gas is available.

The interaction can include seismology, which involves substantial vibrations because of machinery or explosives to make seismic waves. How the seismic waves collaborate with a supply containing oil and gas assists with pinpointing the repository's location. Whenever it has been determined that there seem, by all accounts, to be reserves underneath the ground, the test drilling cycle can start.

> Upstream companies measure oil production in barrels. One barrel, normally abbreviated as bbl, is equivalent to 42 U.S. gallons. Companies frequently portray production in terms of bbl each day or bbl per quarter.

## The Oil Exploration Process

Oil and gas exploration is an important part of the upstream sector. [Petroleum](/petroleum) exploration requires exceptionally sophisticated strategies, and the technology accessible for petroleum exploration is quickly progressing.

Regularly, exploration begins in an area that has a high potential to hold a resource, ordinarily due to the neighborhood geography and realized close by petroleum deposits. In a high-expected area, further exploration is completed to portray a resource. The geophysical and geochemical analysis is finished utilizing strategies including induced polarization (IP) overviews, drilling and [assaying](/measure), electrical flows, etc.

In the exploration phase, the goal is to find and estimate the capability of a resource. In the event that an area shows potential to have a resource, exploratory wells are penetrated to test the resource. In the oil and gas sector, test drilling is an important part of the exploration phase. If the exploratory well is effective, the next step is to build wells and concentrate the resource. Upstream companies likewise operate the wells that bring the crude oil or natural gas to the surface.

## Midstream and Downstream

When the resource has been separated, the upstream part of the business is finished. [Midstream](/midstream) companies gather the raw resource and transport the resource through pipeline, rail line, or big hauler truck to treatment facilities. Processing plants are the [downstream](/downstream) phase of the oil and gas industry. They process the raw [crude oil](/crude-oil) into their end petroleum products. They likewise sell and disseminate natural gas and the products that are derived from crude oil.

### Midstream

Midstream is a term used to portray one of the three major stages of oil and gas industry operations. Midstream activities incorporate the processing, putting away, moving, and marketing of oil, natural gas, and [natural gas liquids](/natural-gas-liquids). Midstream companies center around the storage and transportation of oil and natural gas through pipelines. Midstream companies deliver the reserves to companies engaged with the last stage of production called downstream.

### Downstream

Companies in the downstream sector are those that give the nearest connection to regular users. Downstream operations are the processes associated with changing over oil and gas into the completed product. These incorporate refining crude oil into gasoline, [natural gas liquids](/natural-gas-liquids), diesel, and an assortment of other energy sources. The nearer an oil and gas company is to the most common way of furnishing consumers with petroleum products, the further downstream the company is supposed to be.

## Instances of Upstream Companies

Upstream oil and gas production and operations recognize deposits, drill wells, and recuperate raw materials from underground and are engaged with exploration and extraction. Large numbers of those employed in the upstream part of the industry incorporate geologists, geophysicists, service rig administrators, engineering firms, researchers, and seismic and drilling contractors.

China National Offshore Oil Corporation and Schlumberger (SLB) are instances of large companies that attention on upstream services.

Today, a large portion of the global oil goliaths have both upstream and downstream activities, and are known as [integrated oil companies](/integrated-oil-gas-company). A considerable lot of the largest upstream administrators today are subsequently major diversified oil and gas firms, like Exxon-Mobil (XOM) and Chevron (CVX)

## Highlights
- Today many large oil companies are integrated, in that they keep up with upstream, midstream, and downstream units.
- Upstream activities incorporate exploration, drilling, and extraction.
- Additionally called exploration and production (E&P), upstream is farthest from the end-client consumer in the oil and gas supply chain.
- Upstream is trailed by midstream (transportation of crude oil) and downstream (refining and distribution) phases.
- Upstream alludes to points in production that originate right off the bat in the processes.
## FAQ
### Is a Refinery Upstream or Downstream?
A refinery is viewed as downstream.
### What's the significance here in the Oil and Gas Industry?
Upstream alludes to the initial phases of oil and gas production, including exploration, drilling, and extraction of crude oil and natural gas.
### What Are the Three Sectors of the Oil and Gas Industry?
Notwithstanding upstream and downstream, the midstream sector is associated with the transportation of oil and gas separated from the earth through pipelines, ships, trucks, or trains to the treatment facilities.
### What Is the Difference Between Upstream and Downstream?
While upstream involves the initial phases of oil and gas production, downstream envelops the last phases including refining and distribution of completed products like gasoline to consumers. By and large, the farther a part of the cycle is from the end-client consumer, the more upstream it is.
### What Are Examples of Upstream Companies?
The upstream sector includes companies that quest for deposits of oil or gas (exploration) and afterward its extraction through drilling or different methods. Upstream likewise incorporates related services companies, for example, those dealing in rig operations, feasibility studies, machinery rental, and extraction of synthetic supply.
