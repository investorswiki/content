# Passively-Managed Funds
  This term generally alludes to index funds. The manager isn't really practicing attentiveness in that frame of mind of stocks. Rather, he is investing in a basket of stocks that reflects a predetermined index, similar to the **S&P 500**.
Since there's less work included, and little portfolio turnover, passive management generally produces less in expenses and taxes than active management. Simultaneously, their goal is to match the index, not beat it. Generally notable for its passive or index funds: **Vanguard**.
