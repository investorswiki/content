# Tier 2 Capital
## What Is Tier 2 Capital?

The term tier 2 [capital](/capital) alludes to one of the parts of a bank's required reserves. Tier 2 is designated as the second or strengthening layer of a bank's capital and is made out of things, for example, revaluation reserves, hybrid instruments, and subordinated term debt. It is viewed as less secure than [Tier 1 capital](/tier1capital) — the other form of a bank's capital — in light of the fact that it's more hard to [liquidate](/liquidate). In the United States, the overall capital requirement is partially based on the weighted risk of a bank's assets.

## Figuring out Tier 2 Capital

Bank capital requirements were designated as part of the international [Basel Accords](/basel_accord). This set of proposals was developed by the Basel Committee on Bank Supervision over a number of years dating back to the 1980s. According to the regulations, banks must keep a certain amount of cash or potentially different forms of [liquid assets](/liquidasset) close by to meet their obligations. Something like 25% of a bank's capital requirements can be contained Tier 2 capital.

Bank capital is partitioned into two layers — Tier 1 or core capital and Tier 2 or strengthening capital. A bank's capital ratio is calculated by partitioning its capital by its total risk-based [assets](/asset). The base capital ratio [reserve requirement](/requiredreserves) for a bank is set at 8% — 6% of which must be given by Tier 1 capital. The excess must be Tier 2 capital. Along with Tier 1 capital, it gives a bank a financial cushion in case it necessities to liquidate its assets.

There are four parts of Tier 2 capital. These include:

- **Revaluation reserves:** These are reserves made by the revaluation of an asset. A commonplace revaluation reserve is a building owned by a bank. Over the long haul, the value of the real estate asset will in general increase and can consequently be revalued.
- **General provisions:** This category comprises of losses that a bank might have of an at this point undetermined amount including from loans. The total general provision amount permitted is 1.25% of the bank's [risk-weighted assets](/riskweightedassets) (RWA).
- **Hybrid capital instruments:** This type of capital is a combination of both [debt](/debt) and [equity](/equity) instruments. [Preferred stock](/preferredstock) is an illustration of a hybrid instrument. A bank might remember hybrid instruments for its Tier 2 capital as long as the assets are adequately like equity so losses can be assumed the face value of the instrument without triggering the [liquidation](/liquidation) of the bank.
- **Subordinated debt:** Debt is subordinated as to ordinary bank contributors and different loans and securities that comprise higher-positioning [senior debt](/seniordebt). The base original term of this debt is north of five years.

Tier 2 capital is split into upper and lower levels. Upper-level Tier 2 capital comprises of securities that are ceaseless — meaning they have no [maturity date](/maturitydate) — revaluation reserves, and fixed asset investments. Lower-level Tier 2 capital comprises of subordinated debt and is generally reasonable for a bank to issue.

## Special Considerations

[Undisclosed reserves](/undisclosedreserves) might be considered part of a bank's Tier 2 capital in certain countries. These reserves are profits a bank procures that don't show up on openly accessible records, for example, a bank's [balance sheet](/balancesheet). In spite of not being uncovered, most banks actually believe these reserves to be real assets.

Regulatory experts in certain countries perceive their banks' undisclosed reserves as part of Tier 2 capital. Most countries, including the United States, don't permit this sort of capital to be utilized to meet reserve requirements honestly.

## Tier 2 Capital versus Tier 1 Capital

As referenced over, a bank's capital reserves are separated into tiers. Not at all like Tier 2 capital, Tier 1 capital is a bank's core capital or the primary source of funding for a bank. All thusly, it comprises of practically a foundation's all's funds including its unveiled reserves and any equity capital like [common stock](/commonstock). This capital assists a bank with engrossing any losses so it can proceed with its everyday operations. Since this level is made out of a bank's core capital, Tier 1 is a generally excellent indicator of its financial wellbeing. This tier is viewed as more solid than Tier 2 capital. That is on the grounds that the capital is a lot more straightforward to precisely compute. The assets that fall into this category are likewise a lot more straightforward to liquidate.
