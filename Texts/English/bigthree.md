# Big Three Automakers
## What Are the Big Three Automakers?

The Big Three in the automotive industry is a reference to the three largest vehicle manufacturers in the United States: General Motors Company (GM), Stellantis (STLA), formerly known as Fiat Chrysler, and Ford Motor Company (F). The Big Three are some of the time alluded to as the "Detroit Three." All three companies have production facilities in the Detroit area, so their performance fundamentally affects the city's economy. Employees of the Big Three are addressed by the United Auto Workers (UAW) union.

The companies' major rivals incorporate international automakers, for example, Toyota Motor Corp, Honda Motor Company, Hyundai Kia Auto Group, and Nissan Motor Company.

## Grasping the Big Three Automakers

For quite a long time, the Big Three automakers ruled the U.S. what's more, global markets; however, after [the oil crisis of the 1970s](/1979-energy-crisis) and the subsequent run-up in fuel prices, Japanese automakers started cutting into the Big Three's market share. Toyota, Honda, and Nissan pulled in a reliable customer base seeking lower-priced, eco-friendly cars. By the mid-1980s, the Japanese automakers proceeded with their pressure on the Big Three, [extending their brands](/brand-expansion) into lines of luxury cars also.

> In the United States, the automotive industry contributes around 3% to the overall [gross domestic product](/gdp) (GDP) of the country, manufacturing close to 10.88 million vehicles in 2019 and 8.8 million of every 2020.
>

From that point forward, General Motors, Stellantis, and Ford have faced a wide cluster of different difficulties, including poor management, labor debates, and rising production costs. The profits (and losses) of the Big Three are believed to be an indicator of the state of the overall U.S. economy. During the [financial crisis](/financial-crisis) in 2009, Chrysler and GM both closed a large number of showrooms, petitioned for Chapter 11 bankruptcy, and were rescued by the U.S. Treasury through a loan under the [Troubled Asset Relief Program](/troubled-asset-relief-program-tarp) (TARP).

## The Big Three by the Numbers

We can perceive how "big" the Big Three truly are by reviewing a few key metrics, for example, market capitalization and market share.

### Market Capitalization

[Market capitalization](/marketcapitalization) (likewise called "market cap") alludes to the total market value of a company's outstanding shares of stock. The market cap for a company is a simple calculation that increases the number of outstanding shares by the current price of the stock. As of Dec. 31, 2021, General Motors had a market cap of $91.8 billion, Ford had a market cap of $85.7 billion, and Stellantis had a market cap of $59 billion.

The market cap calculation shows a company's not set in stone by the stock market. In comparison, Toyota's market cap for a similar time span was an essentially higher $250.6 billion, an indication that the market values Toyota as a company more than the Big Three.

### Market Share

[Market share](/marketshare) is one more fascinating statistic to review since it shows the size of a company comparable to its market and its rivals. We can utilize the percentage of market share to compare the Big Three's sales to total industry sales.

In the principal half of 2021, General Motors was the leading automaker by market share in the United States, capturing 16.48% of the vehicle and light truck market. Coming in second was Toyota, with a market share of 15.01%. In third place was Ford, with a 11.92% market share, closely followed by Stellantis at 11.48% and Honda at 10.02%.

> In terms of revenue, the leading automotive producers globally are Toyota and Volkswagen.
>

However, when we investigate the global market share, we get an entirely different image of the Big Three. In 2020, Toyota positioned at the first spot on the list, capturing 8.5% of the global automotive market share by brand. Volkswagen came in second with a 7.8% market share, trailed by Hyundai at 5.4%, Ford at 5.1%, Honda at 4.8%, and Nissan at 4.2%. Obviously, the Big Three — which once ruled the global markets — have faced strong competition, losing their market share to automakers from Japan, South Korea, and Europe.

## Special Considerations

Proceeding, hybrid gas electric and all-electric vehicles are expected to account for a rising number of vehicle sales.

This is especially true as additional legislatures institute orders that require the switch to a higher percentage of electric vehicles (EV) on the streets. The Big Three have all invested vigorously in electric vehicle development and production. The future progress of the Big Three could depend on their ability to influence consumers to purchase their cars over EV manufacturer Tesla Motor Inc., their biggest rival in the EV marketplace.
