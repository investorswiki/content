# Qualified Personal Residence Trust (QPRT)
## What Is a Qualified Personal Residence Trust (QPRT)?

A qualified personal residence trust (QPRT) is a specific type of [irrevocable trust](/irrevocabletrust) that permits its maker to eliminate a personal home from their estate to reduce the amount of gift tax that is incurred while transferring assets to a beneficiary.

Qualified personal residence trusts permit the owner of the residence to stay residing on the property for a while with "retained interest" in the house; when that period is finished, the interest remaining is moved to the beneficiaries as "remainder interest."

Contingent upon the length of the trust, the value of the property during the retained interest period is calculated in light of [applicable federal rates (AFR)](/applicablefederalrate) that the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) gives. Since the owner holds a small portion of the value, the gift value of the property is lower than its [fair market value (FMV)](/fairmarketvalue), subsequently bringing down its incurred gift tax. This tax can likewise be brought down with a [unified credit](/unified-tax-credit).

On the off chance that the grantor passes on before the term, the property is remembered for the estate and is subject to tax. The risk lies in determining the length of the trust agreement, combined with the probability that the grantor will die before the expiration date. Hypothetically, longer-term trusts benefit from more modest remainder interest given to the beneficiaries, which thusly reduces the gift tax; nonetheless, this is simply profitable to more youthful trust holders who have a lower possibility of dying prior to the trust end date.

## QPRT and Other Trust Forms

In a bare trust, the beneficiary has the absolute right to the trust's assets (both financial and non-financial, like real estate and collectibles), as well as the income created from these assets, (for example, rental income from properties or bond interest).

In a charitable remainder trust, a benefactor might turn out a revenue interest to a non-charitable beneficiary with the remainder of the trust going to a charitable organization. The [charitable remainder annuity trust (CRAT)](/charitable-remainder-annuity-trust) and charitable remainder uni-trust (CRUT) are two types of charitable remainder trusts.
