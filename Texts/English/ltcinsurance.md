# Long-Term Care (LTC) Insurance
## What is long-term care insurance?
Long-term care insurance is a plan that helps pay for services to help you with regular activities like eating, dressing, washing or getting in and up. You select the coverage you might want to receive when you purchase the policy.
The median annual cost of long-term care insurance goes from $44,000 to $91,250, contingent upon the level of care required. Given that the average stay in a nursing home is 892 days, or 2.44 years, the cost can without much of a stretch outperform $200,000.
## More profound definition
The more youthful and better you are at the hour of application, the more probable you are to meet all requirements for long-term care insurance. Those in poor wellbeing or who are now getting long-term care services are probably not going to traverse the underwriting system, or at times, will be quoted a "non-standard" rate.
The best opportunity to apply is in your mid-50s, if you are sound. Your wellbeing never improves once you arrive at your 50s. Even assuming you diet, exercise and acquire great qualities, the vast majority in their 50s face no less than a couple of wellbeing challenges.
A couple of things to keep as a primary concern:
- Discounts are frequently offered to candidates healthy.
- Each insurer lays out its own requirements, so assuming one insurer rejects you, check another.
- Albeit all policies go through an underwriting cycle, don't expect that existing ailments will prevent acceptance.
- The cost of long-term care insurance increments on your birthday: 2 percent to 4 percent every year in your 50s and 6 percent to 8 percent in your 60s.
