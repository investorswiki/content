# Exercise
## What Is Exercise?

Exercise means to put into effect the right to buy or sell the underlying financial instrument determined in a [options contract](/optionscontract). In options trading, the holder of an option has the right, yet not the obligation, to buy or sell the option's [underlying security](/underlying-security) at a predetermined price at the latest a predefined date from now on.

## Grasping Exercise

Assuming the owner of an option chooses to buy or sell the underlying instrument — rather than permitting the contract to [expire](/expirationdate) worthless or [closing out the position](/closeposition) — they will be "practicing the option," or utilizing the right or privilege that is accessible in the contract.

An options holder might exercise their right to buy or sell the contract's underlying shares at a predefined price — likewise called the [strike price](/strikeprice).

- Practicing a [put option](/putoption) permits you to **sell** the underlying security at a stated price inside a specific time span.
- Practicing a [call option](/calloption) permits you to **buy** the underlying security at a stated price inside a specific time span.

To exercise an option, you just prompt your broker that you wish to exercise the option in your contract. Your broker will start an exercise notice, which illuminates the seller or [writer](/writer) of the contract that you are practicing the option. The notice is sent to the option seller by means of the Options Clearing Corporation (OCC). The seller is committed to satisfy the terms of an options contract in the event that the holder exercises the contract.

> The decision to exercise an option isn't generally an obvious one. There are several factors that should be thought of and, generally, it's more secure to hold or sell the option all things being equal.

The majority of options contracts are not exercised yet, all things being equal, are permitted to lapse worthless or are closed by restricting positions. For instance, the holder of an option can close out a [long](/long) call or put prior to expiration by selling it, expecting the contract has market value.

On the off chance that an option terminates unexercised, the holder no longer has any of the rights allowed in the contract. Moreover, the holder loses the [premium](/premium) they paid for the option, along with any commissions and fees connected with its purchase.

## Interesting points When Exercising an Option
- **What sort of option do you have?** This is vital, as contracts have various rules. American-style contracts permit you to exercise them before their expiration date. European options might be exercised solely after the contract has expired.
- **Might you at any point exercise your options?** at times, for example, with [employee stock ownership plans ](/esop)(ESOPs), your shares might be [vested](/vested-benefit), implying that you should stand by a set amount of time before you exercise the option.
- **Will the cost offset the benefits?** Exercising a contract costs you commission money, so ensure that the [exercise price](/exerciseprice) will make you money; any other way, you'll wind up paying more in fees and will miss out on any possible profit.
- **Are there taxes involved?** You will need to consider any tax suggestions associated with the type of contract you are working out. An employee cashing out an ESOP, for instance, should pay extra tax.
