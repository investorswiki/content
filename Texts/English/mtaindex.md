# Month to month Treasury Average (MTA) Index
## What Is the Monthly Treasury Average (MTA) Index?

The Monthly Treasury Average (MTA) is an interest rate index derived from the year [moving average](/movingaverage) (MA) of [one-year consistent maturity Treasury bonds](/cmtindex) (one-year CMT).

The MTA acts as the basis to set interest rates for some [adjustable-rate mortgages](/arm) (ARMs). The MTA Index, otherwise called the 12-MAT, is a lagging indicator that changes after the economy has started to follow a particular pattern or trend.

## Understanding the Monthly Treasury Average Index

The calculation for the index comes from adding the twelve latest month to month [CMT](/cmtindex) interest or yield values and partitioning by twelve. The one-year consistent maturity Treasury (one-year CMT) is the implied, one-year yield of the most recently auctioned U.S. Treasury bills, notes, and bonds.

At the point when the twelve-month to month CMT values are consecutively expanding, the current MTA value will be lower than the current CMT value. On the other hand, when the CMT values fall many months, the MTA will seem higher than the current CMT. This converse relationship makes the MTA Index smoother, or less unpredictable, than other interest indexes, for example, the [one-month LIBOR](/libor) or the CMT itself.

In times of extreme interest rate [volatility](/volatility), the difference between the MTA, CMT, and different indexes can be substantial. For instance, during the late 1970s and mid 1980s, when interest rates were in the double digits and fluctuating widely, the MTA Index frequently contrasted from the CMT rate by however much four percentage points.

Note, notwithstanding, that the difference could be either up or down, contingent upon the heading rates were flowing at the hour of average calculation. In January 2021, the MTA Index was pegged at 0.26%; the CMT was at 0.1%; and the one-month LIBOR index was at 0.13%.

## Picking an Index for a Mortgage

A few mortgages, like [payment option ARMs](/paymentoptionarm), offer the borrower a selection of indexes. Picking the index ought to accompany some analysis of the accessible options. While the MTA index is regularly lower than the one-month LIBOR by around 0.1% to 0.5%, the lower rate of a MTA, combined with a payment cap, can possibly cause a negative amortization situation. In negative amortization, the regularly scheduled payment is not exactly the interest owed on the loan. In that case, unpaid interest adds to the principal, which is subject to more interest before very long. Likewise, in periods of falling interest rates, the MTA will cost more due to its lagging effect.

> Due to recent embarrassments and inquiries around its legitimacy as a benchmark rate, LIBOR is being phased out. As per the Federal Reserve and regulators in the UK, LIBOR will be phased out by June 30, 2023, and will be supplanted by the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR). As part of this stage out, LIBOR one-week and two-month USD LIBOR rates will presently not be distributed after December 31, 2021.

The interest rate on an adjustable-rate mortgage is known as the [fully indexed interest rate](/fullyindexedinterestrate). This rate rises to the index value, plus a margin. While the index is variable, the margin is a fixed value for the life of the mortgage.

While thinking about which index is generally prudent, remember to include the margin amount. The lower an index relative to another index, the higher the margin is probably going to be. A mortgage pegged to the MTA Index commonly incorporates a margin of 2.5%.

## Features
- The MTA is utilized to set interest rates for some adjustable-rate loans, like ARMs.
- Since it depends on an annualized lagged moving average, the MTA will regularly contrast from the current one-year CMT or one-year LIBOR.
- The Monthly Treasury Average (MTA) is a rates index in view of one-year consistent maturity Treasuries' year moving average.
