## What Is an Overheated Economy?

An overheated economy is one that has encountered a drawn out period of good [economic growth](/economicgrowth) and activity that has prompted high levels of [inflation](/inflation), set off by increased consumer wealth.

## Figuring out an Overheated Economy

A sharp rise in prices causes inefficient supply allocations as producers overproduce and make excess production capacity trying to [capitalize](/capitalize) on the high levels of wealth. Sadly, these failures and inflation will eventually impede the economy's growth and can frequently be a forerunner to a [recession](/recession).

Basically, an overheated economy is one that is growing at a rate that is unreasonable. There are two fundamental indications of an overheating economy â€” rising rates of inflation and an unemployment rate that is below the normal rate for an economy.

### Rising Rates of Inflation

Rising inflation is typically perhaps the earliest sign that an economy I overheating. Subsequently, states and [central banks](/centralbank) will usually bring interest rates up in an endeavor to bring down the amount of spending and borrowing. While central banks can combat rising inflation through interest rate increases, they can frequently come too late. Since inflation is a lagging indicator, it can take some time for changes in policy to reduce the rate.

Between June 2004 and June 2006, the [Federal Reserve Board](/frb) (FRB) increased the interest rate 17 times as a continuous means of easing back America's overheated economy. In any case, two years later, U.S. inflation hit 5.6 percent, a cycle high. This quick rise in prices was trailed by a devastating recession, which saw inflation plunged below zero in six months or less.

### Abnormally High Employment Rates

The second indication of an overheating economy is an unemployment rate that is below the normal rate for a country. [Full employment](/fullemployment) ought to be something to be thankful for. Yet, full employment likewise means higher inflation since everybody has a job (meaning productivity is at an all-time high) and money to spend.

Since World War II, the unemployment rate generally fell below 5% in the years promptly going before recessions. That incorporates the years leading up to the [Great Recession](/great-recession).

## Reasons for an Overheating Economy

The two principal signs illustrated above are likewise reasons for an overheating economy. Different reasons for an overheating economy incorporate asset bubbles and outside economic shocks. An illustration of the last option are the oil shocks that happened during a significant part of the 1970s and 1980s. They brought about recessions of fluctuating periods and intensity as America's oil [import](/import) bill developed to satisfy increased need for gas.

Asset bubbles are an impractical increase in prices for certain assets. This is an indication of overheating. The bursting of the [dotcom bubble](/dotcom-bubble) in 2001 brought about a recession. All the more as of late, the 2008 financial crisis was the consequence of a bubble in real estate mortgages. The bubble had wide-arriving at suggestions across geologies and brought about a delayed recession that spread over various topographies.

## Illustration of an Overheating Economy

The Great Recession during the late 2000s was gone before by an overheating economy. The unemployment rate constantly fell until 2007, finishing at a rate of 4.6% (below the normal rate) in that year. In the mean time, the inflation rate, which had been consistently rising, topped at 5.25% in 2006, when [Ben Bernanke](/benbernanke) turned into the Fed Chair and right before the crisis.

One more indication of a U.S. economy that was overheating was the real estate asset bubble that burst in 2007 and sent shock waves through the whole U.S. financial ecosystem. Compounding these issues was the public authority's spending. During President Clinton's years, the federal budget had a surplus. In any case, President Bush's tax cuts changed over that surplus into a deficit.

In 2005, the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimated that there would be a budget deficit of $368 billion that year and it would be trailed by a deficit of $295 billion the next year. In short, the U.S. economy demonstrated the hallmarks of an overheating economy in the years leading up to the recession.
