## What Is a Chip-And-PIN Card?

A chip-and-PIN card is a type of credit card in which the cardholder must approve the transaction by entering their [personal identification number](/personal-identification-number) (PIN).

Not at all like previous cards which used a magnetic stripe containing data about the cardholder, chip-and-PIN cards contain a square-molded microchip that creates and stores unique data for every transaction. Thusly, chip-and-pin cards are less helpless to [fraud](/fraud) than previous ages of credit cards.

## How Chip-And-PIN Cards Work

According to a customer's point of view, utilizing a chip-and-PIN card is basically the same as utilizing the more established magnetic stripe cards. While making a purchase, chip-and-PIN cardholders essentially embed the card into the trader's [point of sale (POS) terminal](/point-of-sale), with the goal that the microchip can be perused by the machine. The POS terminal then, at that point, prompts them to enter their PIN, to approve the transaction.

On the other hand, magnetic stripe cardholders must swipe their cards through the POS terminal and then, at that point, sign a printed receipt. While this more established system was likewise moderately fast, it had a few key disservices. For a certain something, magnetic stripe cards expect vendors to hold on to large measures of paper records, which can undoubtedly get derailed or faded over the long haul. Besides, employees frequently fail to confirm that the signature given by the customer matches the signature displayed on the rear of their card, making it simple for an untrustworthy cardholder to create a fake signature while utilizing another person's credit card.

Regardless of being a similar size and shape as magnetic stripe cards, they beat the requirement for physical records in light of the fact that the POS system can distinguish electronically whether a right PIN was given by the customer. The utilization of a PIN likewise sidesteps the requirement for employees to check that the signature matches the one displayed on the card, while the integrated microchip reduces the risk of duplicating by generating unique transaction codes each time the card is utilized.

Through these measures, chip-and-PIN cards reduce the risk of credit card theft. All things considered, would-be hoodlums can't just approve transactions utilizing false signatures. All things considered, they would have to know the true client's PIN, which is troublesome thinking about that the true client can essentially change their PIN once they discover that their credit card has been taken.
