# Backpricing
## What Is Backpricing?

In finance, the term "backpricing" alludes to the practice of going into a [commodities futures contract](/commodityfuturescontract) without initially determining the price at which the commodity will be purchased.

All things being equal, the gatherings to a backpriced futures contract will hold on until a predetermined date before settling on a fair price at which to buy or sell the commodity.

## Figuring out Backpricing

Commonly, [traders](/merchant) use [futures contracts](/futurescontract) to buy commodities at a known price determined to sell the futures contract or taking delivery of its underlying commodity at a predetermined future date.

At times, notwithstanding, a buyer may just wish to focus on the purchase of a given quantity of the underlying commodity, while deferring the decision of what price to pay until a future date. In those situations, the buyer and seller will initially conclude how they will set a price from now on, for example, by consenting to utilize the predominant [spot price](/spotprice) for the commodity sometime not too far off. When that date is reached, the buyer and seller will carry out the transaction at the agreed-upon price.

The essential avocation for backpricing is that it guarantees that the price paid for the commodity will closely mirror its [fair market value](/fairmarketvalue) at the hour of exchange. Paradoxically, in ordinary futures contracts it is feasible at the cost paid for a commodity to contrast uniquely from its market price. This makes traditional futures contracts undeniably more valuable for traders who wish to [speculate](/hypothesis) on commodity prices, as the opportunity for speculative profits would be to a great extent, while possibly not totally, dispensed with by backpricing.

## Real World Example of Backpricing

Assume you are the owner of a commercial bread shop that desires to secure its supply of wheat for the impending year. Your fundamental priority is guaranteeing that you will actually want to keep an adequate supply of wheat to keep up with your production volumes, and to achieve this you set out to purchase futures contracts that have wheat as their [underlying asset](/underlying-asset).

Simultaneously, you might want to keep away from a situation where you purchase wheat futures just to see the spot price of wheat decline essentially a while later. All things considered, you would favor just resolving to buy a specific quantity of wheat at set dates and afterward arrange the price for those purchases in no time before their delivery dates.

To settle on those prices, you propose utilizing the overarching spot market price existing seven days before every delivery date. Along these lines, both the buyer and the seller of the futures contract can be guaranteed that they are executing at or close to the best available market price, dispensing with the possibility for huge speculative profits on one or the other side.
