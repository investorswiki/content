# Assignment
## What Is an Assignment?

Assignment most frequently alludes to one of two definitions in the financial world:

1. The transfer of a singular's rights or property to someone else or business. This concept exists in an assortment of business transactions and is frequently explained contractually.
1. In trading, assignment happens when a [option contract](/optionscontract) is exercised. The owner of the contract exercises the contract and allocates the option writer to an obligation to complete the requirements of the contract.

## Property Rights Assignment

Assignment alludes to the transfer of some or all [property rights](/property_rights) and obligations associated with an asset, property, contract, and so forth to one more entity through a written agreement. For instance, a payee doles out rights for gathering note payments to a bank. A [trademark](/trademark) owner transfers, sells, or gives someone else interest in the trademark. A homeowner who sells their home doles out the deed to the new buyer.

To be effective, an assignment must include parties with legal capacity, consideration, consent, and legality of article.

### Models

A [wage assignment](/wage-assignment) is a forced payment of an obligation via automatic [withholding](/withholding) from a worker's pay. Courts issue wage assignments for individuals late with child or spousal support, taxes, loans, or different obligations. Money is automatically deducted from a laborer's paycheck without consent in the event that they have a history of nonpayment. For instance, a person delinquent on $100 month to month loan payments has a wage assignment deducting the money from their paycheck and shipped off the lender. Wage assignments are useful in paying back long-term obligations.

One more example can be found in a mortgage assignment. This is where a mortgage [deed](/deed) offers a lender interest in a mortgaged property as a trade off for payments received. Lenders frequently sell mortgages to outsiders, like different lenders. A mortgage assignment document explains the assignment of contract and teaches the borrower in making future mortgage payments, and possibly changes the [mortgage](/mortgage) terms.

A last model includes a lease assignment. This benefits a moving tenant needing to end a lease early or a landlord searching for rent payments to pay creditors. When the new tenant signs the lease, assuming control over responsibility for rent payments and different obligations, the previous tenant is released from those obligations. In a separate lease assignment, a landlord consents to pay a creditor through an assignment of rent due under rental property leases. The agreement is utilized to pay a mortgage lender if the landlord [defaults](/default2) on the loan or records for [bankruptcy](/bankruptcy). Any rental income would then be paid straightforwardly to the lender.

## Options Assignment

[Options](/option) can be assigned when a buyer chooses to exercise their right to buy (or sell) stock at a specific [strike price](/strikeprice). The relating seller of the option isn't determined when a buyer opens an option trade, yet just at the time that an option holder chooses to exercise their right to buy stock. So an option seller with open positions is matched with the practicing buyer through automated lottery. The arbitrarily chosen seller is then assigned to satisfy the buyer's rights. This is known as an option assignment.

When assigned, the writer (seller) of the option will have the obligation to sell (if a [call option](/calloption)) or buy (if a [put option](/putoption)) the designated number of shares of stock at the settled upon price (the strike price). For example, in the event that the writer sold calls they would be committed to sell the stock, and the cycle is frequently alluded to as having the stock [called away](/calledaway). For puts, the buyer of the option sells stock (puts stock shares) to the writer as a [short-sold](/shortselling) position.

### Model

Assume a trader claims 100 call options on company ABC's stock with a strike price of $10 per share. The stock is currently trading at $30 and ABC is due to shortly pay a dividend. Subsequently, the trader [exercises the options early](/earlyexercise) and gets 10,000 shares of ABC paid at $10. Simultaneously, the opposite side of the long call (the short call) is assigned the contract and must deliver the shares to the long.
