## What is a commercial bank?
A commercial bank is a for-benefit financial institution that acknowledges deposits, offers loans and offers other financial types of assistance to its customers. Commercial banks assist with satisfying the medium-and short-term financial requirements of businesses. They don't give long-term credit since they need to keep up with the liquidity of their assets.
## More profound definition
A commercial bank's funds belong to the public, which can pull out funds on short notice. Thus, commercial banks broaden credit for shorter terms with the support of securities that are substantial and effectively marketable.
Before it concedes a loan to a business, a commercial bank evaluates the business' ability to repay by taking a gander at factors, for example, the type of business it is, and its profitability and size.
Commercial banks fall into three principal types: public sector banks, private sector banks and foreign banks.

- **Foreign banks** are banks with headquarters in a foreign country and branches in various parts of the world. Foreign banks play a great job in aiding support the economic standing of that country, apart from serving the financial necessities of its kin.

One of the essential elements of a commercial bank is to acknowledge deposits. Deposits fall into different categories relying upon their terms and requirements. For example, there are demand deposits, or current account deposits, normally repayable by the bank on demand. Businesses keep up with these accounts for making transactions. These accounts don't accrue interest and are subject to service charges by the bank.
Fixed deposits, then again, are deposited in a bank for a specific amount of time. These deposits accrue interest, yet are not utilized for composing checks or making other normal withdrawal transactions.
At last, savings deposits join the highlights of a fixed deposit and a current account. Depositors can pull out cash from these accounts, yet banks might impose limitations on the amount and number of withdrawals. Moreover, they accrue less interest than fixed deposits.
## Commercial bank model
Commercial banks don't let deposits stay idle. They utilize their cash reserves to give loans. They offer various types of loans in light of the requirements and capacities of their customers to repay. One of these is a cash credit loan, which a bank provides for a borrower against his stocks, bonds or different assets. The bank sets a credit limit on the loan, and the borrower can make withdrawals inside the credit limit. The bank charges interest on the amount removed.
