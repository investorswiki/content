## A few Biases Revealed by Behavioral Finance

Breaking down biases further, numerous individual biases and inclinations have been distinguished for behavioral finance analysis. A portion of these include:

### Confirmation Bias

[Confirmation bias](/confirmation-bias) is when investors have a bias toward accepting data that affirms their generally held confidence in an investment. Assuming data surfaces, investors acknowledge it promptly to affirm that they're right about their investment choice â€” even on the off chance that the data is flawed.

### Experiential Bias

An experiential bias happens when investors' memory of recent events makes them biased or persuades them to think that the event is undeniably bound to happen again. Hence, it is otherwise called recency bias or availability bias.

For instance, the financial crisis in 2008 and 2009 drove numerous investors to exit the stock market. Many had a dismal perspective on the markets and reasonable expected more economic hardship before long. The experience of having gone through such a negative event increased their bias or probability that the event could repeat. In reality, the economy recuperated, and the market bounced back in the years to follow.

### Loss Aversion

[Loss aversion](/loss-brain science) happens when investors place a greater weighting on the concern for losses than the joy from market gains. As such, they're undeniably bound to try to assign a higher priority to staying away from losses than making investment gains.

Thus, a few investors could need a higher payout to make up for losses. On the off chance that the high payout isn't logical, they could try to stay away from losses through and through even in the event that the investment's risk is acceptable from a rational stance.

Applying loss aversion to investing, the supposed disposition effect happens when investors sell their champs and hang onto their washouts. Investors' reasoning is that they need to rapidly acknowledge gains. In any case, when an investment is losing money, they'll hold onto it since they need to return to even or their initial price. Investors will generally concede they are right about an investment rapidly (when there's a gain).

In any case, investors are hesitant to concede when they committed an investment error (when there's a loss). The flaw in disposition bias is that the performance of the investment is frequently tied to the entry price for the investor. At the end of the day, investors check the performance of their investment based on their individual entry price ignoring fundamentals or traits of the investment that might have changed.

### Commonality Bias

The commonality bias is when investors will generally invest in what they know, like domestic companies or privately owned investments. Subsequently, investors are not diversified across various sectors and types of investments, which can reduce risk. Investors will quite often go with investments that they have a history or have knowledge of.

> Commonality bias can happen in such countless ways. You might oppose investing in a specific company due to what industry it is in, where it works, what products it sells, who regulates the management of the company, who its clientele base is, the manner by which it plays out its marketing, and the way that complex its accounting is.
