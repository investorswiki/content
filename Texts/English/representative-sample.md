# Representative Sample
## What Is a Representative Sample?

A representative sample is a subset of a population that tries to mirror the qualities of the larger group precisely. For instance, a homeroom of 30 understudies with 15 guys and 15 females could produce a representative sample that could incorporate six understudies: three guys and three females. [Samples](/sample) are helpful in statistical analysis when population sizes are large since they contain smaller, manageable adaptations of the larger group.

## Figuring out Representative Sample

Sampling is utilized in [statistical analysis](/measurements) methodologies to gain bits of knowledge and perceptions about a population group. Analysts can utilize an assortment of sampling methods to build samples that try to meet the objectives of their research studies. Representative samples are one type of sampling method. This method utilizes stratified random sampling to assist with recognizing its parts. Different methods can incorporate random sampling and systematic sampling.

Analysts can pick the representative attributes that they feel best meet their research objectives. Ordinarily, representative sample attributes are centered around [demographic categories](/demographics). A few instances of key qualities can incorporate sex, age, education level, financial status, and marital status. Generally, the larger the population being analyzed, the more attributes that might emerge for consideration.

## Types of Sampling Methods

Picking a sampling method can rely upon different factors. Representative samples are normally an ideal decision for sampling analysis since they are expected to yield experiences and perceptions that closely line up with the whole [population group](/population).

At the point when a sample isn't representative, it very well may be known as a [random sample](/basic random-sample). While random sampling is a simplified sampling approach, it accompanies a higher risk of sampling blunder which might possibly lead to inaccurate outcomes or strategies that can be exorbitant. Random sampling can pick its parts totally at random, for example, picking names randomly from a rundown. Utilizing the homeroom model again, a random sample could incorporate six male understudies.

[Systematic sampling](/systematic-sampling) is one more type of sampling method that looks to systemize its parts. This type of sampling might incorporate selecting each fifth person from a population rundown to gather a sample. While this method adopts a systematic strategy, bringing about a random sample is still possible.

## Stratified Random Sampling

[Stratified random sampling](/stratified_random_sampling) can be an important part of the cycle in making a representative sample. Stratified random sampling inspects the qualities of a population group and breaks down the population into what is known as layers. Separating out the population by layers assists an analyst with effectively picking the fitting number of people from every layer in view of extents of the population. While this method is additional tedious — and frequently more expensive as it requires more upfront data — the data yielded is commonly of higher quality.

## Special Considerations

A representative sample is generally expected to yield the best collection of results. Representative samples are known for collecting results, experiences, and perceptions that can be unhesitatingly depended on as a representation of the larger population being contemplated. Thusly, representative sampling is normally the best method for [marketing](/marketing-plan) or psychology studies.

While representative samples are much of the time the sampling method of decision, they in all actuality do have a few barriers. Frequently, it is unreasonable in terms of time, budget, and work to collect the data expected to build a representative sample. Utilizing stratified random sampling, researchers must recognize qualities, partition the population into layers, and relatively pick people for the representative sample.

As a rule, the larger the population target to be concentrated on the more troublesome representative sampling can be. This method can be especially challenging for a very large population like a whole country or race. While dealing with large populations it can likewise be hard to get the ideal individuals for participation. For instance, people who are too occupied to participate will be under-addressed in the representative sample. Understanding the upsides and downsides of both representative sampling and random sampling can assist researchers with choosing the best approach for their specific study.

## Features
- A representative sample is a small subset group that tries to relatively reflect determined qualities exemplified in a target population.
- Representative samples frequently yield the best outcomes however they can be the most troublesome type of sample to acquire.
- A representative sample is one technique that can be utilized for getting bits of knowledge and perceptions about a targeted population group.
