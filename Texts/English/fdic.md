# Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC)
## What is FDIC insurance?
The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. (FDIC) is the agency that protects deposits at member banks in case of a bank failure. FDIC insurance is backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. government.
The FDIC guarantees up to $250,000 per depositor, per FDIC-insured bank, per ownership category. This guarantees consumers that their money is safe, for however long it's inside the limits and rules.
## Why the FDIC was made
The FDIC was made in 1933 to safeguard consumers when financial institutions fail and are forced to close their entryways.
During the Great Depression, insurance for banks was not available. So when banks failed, Americans lost their savings. Presently when banks fail, the FDIC steps in to safeguard depositors.
## Which institutions are covered by FDIC insurance?
By far most of banks, including online banks, offer deposit customers FDIC insurance.
An online bank that is FDIC-insured has a similar FDIC coverage as a brick-and-mortar bank.
Confirm that your bank is FDIC insured by utilizing the FDIC's BankFind Suite.
It is rare for a bank not to have FDIC insurance, but rather there are exemptions. Bank of North Dakota, for instance, isn't FDIC-insured. All things considered, it is backed by the full faith and credit of the State of North Dakota.
Credit unions are regulated uniquely in contrast to banks and have their own federal deposit insurance through the National Credit Union Share Insurance Fund (NCUSIF). The fund was made by Congress in 1970 to guarantee deposits in member credit unions.
It's administered by the National Credit Union Administration (NCUA), which contracts, directs and screens federal credit unions. The insurance is like what the FDIC gives, with a $250,000 cap for each account and owner.
## FDIC insurance: What's covered and what isn't
### What FDIC insurance covers
FDIC insurance covers traditional bank deposit products, including checking accounts, savings accounts, certificates of deposit, Negotiable Order of Withdrawal (NOW) accounts and money market deposit accounts.
The insurance covers up to $250,000 in deposits, per depositor, per FDIC-insured bank, per account ownership category. In the event that an account holder has more than $250,000 on deposit across several accounts at a single bank, in their name alone, anything more than $250,000 isn't insured.
An individual account is insured separately from a joint account. In this way, a $500,000 CD owned by two joint account holders would be fully insured on the grounds that each account holder is insured for up to $250,000.
FDIC insurance additionally safeguards interest earnings, as long as the principal and interest combined don't surpass the $250,000 cap. Assuming that you have $248,000 in a CD account that has earned $2,000 in interest, you are totally covered in light of the fact that your account doesn't surpass the insurance limit. Notwithstanding, in the event that you have $175,000 in a high-yield savings account and $200,000 in a CD at a similar bank, in your name alone, $125,000 is uninsured.
### What the FDIC doesn't cover
The FDIC doesn't guarantee investments. Even on the off chance that you buy stocks, bonds, mutual funds, annuities or life insurance policies through a bank, your money isn't protected. The FDIC additionally doesn't cover the items in your safe-deposit box by the same token.
Payment suppliers, like PayPal and Venmo, additionally don't fit the bill for FDIC insurance since they are not banks. However, there are a few exemptions. PayPal states on its website that one of its products, PayPal Cash Plus, deposits funds in FDIC-insured institutions. However, the funds are possibly insured on the off chance that you successfully mentioned the PayPal Cash Card.
PayPal-owned Venmo isn't a bank and wouldn't qualify.
On the off chance that you're uncertain about whether every one of your deposits are FDIC-insured, get with your bank representative or utilize the FDIC's Electronic Deposit Insurance Estimator (EDIE) and enter data about your accounts.
## Step by step instructions to guarantee your deposits are all insured
Contingent upon your conditions you could possibly keep your bank deposits insured by keeping your cash in various ownership categories.
For instance, joint account ownership offers more protection than single account ownership on the grounds that each account owner is insured up to $250,000. In this way, in the event that a couple had $500,000 in joint savings at a similar bank, their money would be insured by the FDIC.
Trusts additionally manage the cost of more protection. On the off chance that you have a revocable trust, upwards of five beneficiaries are insurable for up to $250,000 each.

## How the FDIC repays you after a bank fails
Depositors don't have to file insurance claims to recover their deposits. Nor do they need to apply for deposit insurance when they open up a bank account at a FDIC-insured institution.
At the point when a bank fails, the FDIC pays depositors by giving them an account at one more insured bank in the amount equivalent to what they had at the failed bank, up to the insurance limits. Or on the other hand, it just issues the depositor a check.
This normally happens the next business day or inside a couple of days. At times, the FDIC needs to audit an account to decide how much is covered before it repays the account holder.
It can require a couple of years to recover deposits that surpass the insurance limit. As the FDIC auctions a failed bank's assets, it issues periodic payments to depositors. Funds that surpass insurance limits are reimbursed on a pennies on-the-dollar basis.
