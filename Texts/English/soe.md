# State-Owned Enterprise (SOE)
## What Is a State-Owned Enterprise?

A state-owned enterprise (SOE) is a legal entity that is made by a government to partake in commercial activities for the government's benefit. It very well may be either wholly or partially owned by a government and is regularly reserved to participate in specific commercial activities.

SOEs are common across the globe, remembering for the United States, where mortgage companies [Freddie Mac](/freddiemac) and Fannie Mae are viewed as [government-sponsored enterprises (GSEs)](/gse).

## Understanding State-Owned Enterprises (SOE)

Otherwise called government-owned corporations (GOC), state-owned substances ought not be mistaken for [listed](/listedsecurity) companies with [stocks](/stock) that are owned in part by a government body, as these companies are genuinely [public](/publiccompany) corporations that end up having a government entity as one of their shareholders.

The state-owned enterprise (SOE) is a global phenomenon, and such organizations exist in the United States, China, South Africa, [Norway](/nok), and New Zealand.

## State-Owned Enterprise Example

Inside the United States, mortgage companies Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae are probably the most recognized SOEs by its residents, yet SOEs are not limited to lending. In China, several companies have state backing, for example, the Jin Jiang Hotel, which is owned and controlled by the government of Shanghai. The South Africa-based power utility Eskom is the eleventh biggest company in the world in terms of electric-generating capacity, and it is a SOE of the South African government. Numerous public transportation systems and utilities are SOEs, as are postal services and some mining operations.

## SOEs and Corporatization

On occasion, a SOE is made out of a government agency through a cycle called [corporatization](/coporatization). This permits the agency to change over itself into a for-profit business. Frequently, the recently framed SOE actually operates in light of government objectives, yet formally it operates as a commercial enterprise. Sometimes, governments of [developing countries](/ldc) will make a state-run business in a sector that it wishes to create or take advantage of to support their economic standing on the global stage, like the oil industry in Brazil, or the telecom industry in Argentina.

## SOEs and Profit

While some SOEs might be permitted to fail, those of significance to the operation of the state might receive government funding to proceed with its operations â€” particularly those considered as critical to a nation's infrastructure. In these cases, the SOEs really cost the government money as opposed to generating revenue. On account of China, this has driven some to blame the government for falsely setting up alleged [zombie](/zombies) corporations that would somehow leave business.
