## What Is Novation?

Novation is the replacement of one of the gatherings in an agreement between two gatherings, with the agreement of every one of the three gatherings included. To novate is to replace an old obligation with another one.

For instance, a provider who needs to surrender a business customer could track down one more source for the customer. Assuming each of the three concur, the contract can be destroyed and replaced with another contract that varies just for the sake of the provider.

For instance, a sub-lease is an assignment. The original rental contract stays in place. The landlord can hold the primary leaseholder responsible for damage or non-payment by the sub-letter.

In a novation, the original party to the contract hands over both the rights and the obligations and leaves. The original contract has been invalidated.

In property law, novation happens when a tenant signs a [lease](/lease) over to another party, who takes care of the rent and the liability for any subsequent damages to the property, as indicated in the original lease.

Generally, both an assignment and a novation require the endorsement of every one of the three gatherings included.
