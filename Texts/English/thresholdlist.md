# Threshold List
## What Is a Threshold List?

A threshold list, otherwise called a [Regulation SHO](/regsho) Threshold Security List, is a list of securities whose transactions failed to clear for five consecutive settlement days at a registered clearing agency.

Threshold lists are distributed as per regulations set by the [Securities and Exchange Commission](/sec) (SEC). Regulators survey this information as part of their efforts to detect [market manipulation](/manipulation).

## Understanding Threshold Lists

In January 2005, the SEC implemented Regulation SHO to reduce the abuse of naked short selling, where the seller doesn't borrow or orchestrate to borrow the securities in time to make delivery to the buyer within the standard two-day settlement period. As a result, the seller fails to deliver securities to the buyer when delivery is due, known as a "failure to deliver" or "fail."

At the point when naked short selling is utilized and the affected securities aren't delivered, the associated transactions will fail to clear. These failed transactions are reported consistently on a threshold list, and the SEC and other regulators can identify hints that ill-advised naked short selling might have happened.

The failed settlements must likewise include a transaction size totaling 10,000 shares or more, or possibly 0.5% of the security's [shares outstanding](/outstandingshares). Securities that meet these criteria and are remembered for the list are known as threshold securities.

The securities on the threshold list should not automatically be considered to be suspicious.
