# Back-End Plan
## What Is a Back-End Plan?

A back-end plan is an enemy of acquisition strategy wherein the target company furnishes existing shareholders — with the exception of the company endeavoring the takeover — with the ability to exchange existing securities for cash or different securities valued at not entirely settled by the company's board of directors.

A back-end plan, otherwise called a note purchase rights plan, is a type of [poison pill](/poisonpill) defense. Poison pill defenses are utilized by companies to forestall a [hostile takeover](/hostiletakeover) by an outside company. The key characteristic of a hostile takeover is that the target company's management doesn't believe the deal should go through.

## How a Back-End Plan Works

Back-end plans were developed during the 1980s as a defense against two-layered takeover bids. In a two-layered takeover bid, the getting company would pay a high price for shares until it held a majority of shares. The company would then utilize the [voting rights](/votingright) associated with those shares to force the excess shareholders to acknowledge a lower price to complete the [merger](/merger).

Companies fending off a [takeover bid](/takeoverbid) may use several unique procedures intended to make the [acquisition](/acquisition) so expensive and troublesome that the gaining company either surrenders — or is forced to haggle with the company board instead of purchasing shares from existing shareholders. These enemy of acquisition strategies are frequently alluded to as poison pills, and incorporate back-end plans.

A back-end plan is put into movement when a company endeavoring a takeover bid gets in excess of a specific percentage of outstanding shares of a takeover target. It is a type of [put](/put) plan, as shareholders reserve the option to exchange common stock for cash, debt securities, or [preferred stock](/preferredstock) — preferred stock is the most normal security issued regarding a back-end plan. In the event that an outside company gets a large block of shares —, for example, 20% — shareholders who hold the preferred stock would have the option to secure super voting rights.

The back-end price is normally set [above the market](/abovethemarket) price, however must be set at a price that is considered to have been made sincerely. By giving shareholders the right to get shares with a higher value on the off chance that the gaining company arrived at a majority stake, the procuring company wouldn't have the option to force a lower share price to complete the acquisition. On the off chance that the gaining company offers a price greater than the price determined in the back-end plan, the poison pill will fail.
