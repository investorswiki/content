The Bush tax cuts included two separate measures that were passed to give [tax relief](/tax-relief) to families in 2001 and to businesses in 2003.

The measures brought down federal income tax rates for everybody, diminished the marriage penalty, brought down the capital gains tax and the tax rate on dividend income, and increased the child tax credit.

A portion of the benefits of the EGTRRA tax cuts included:

- Bringing down the maximum estate, gift, and [generation-skipping transfer tax](/generation-skipping-transfer-tax) rate to half in 2002 from 55% in 2001, with an extra 1% reduction every year until 2007.
- Eliminating the time limit on [student loan interest deductions](/slid) for tax purposes.
- Permitting non-qualified 401(a), tax-sheltered 403(b), and deferred compensation 457(b) plans to be turned over to other non-qualified plans, [qualified plans](/qrp), or IRAs.
- Expanding the age for [required least distributions](/requiredminimumdistribution) (RMDs) and permitting employees beyond 50 years old to make extra contributions over the normal limits to their retirement plans.
- Introducing a new [tax bracket](/taxbracket) of 10%. The 15% tax bracket was indexed to the new 10% bracket. Existing tax brackets of 28%, 31%, 36%, and 39.6% were reduced to 25%, 28%, 33%, and 35%, separately.

- Disposing of the [marriage penalty](/marriage-penalty) by doubling the standard deduction for a married couple filing jointly, consequently taking out the tax liability for married couples.

The tax cuts were initiated to furnish families with more disposable income in the expectations that the extra funds would prod spending and pump money into the economy. Notwithstanding, numerous taxpayers saved or invested their refunds all things being equal.

- Reduced tax on [long-term capital gains](/long-term_capital_gain_loss) from 8% and 10% to 5%, and from 20% to 15%. Taxpayers in the 10% to 15% tax brackets had their capital gains tax reduced to zero out of 2008.
- Brought down taxes on [qualified dividends](/qualifieddividend) — including bank dividends, [real estate investment trusts](/reit) (REITs), and income from non-unfamiliar organizations — to the long-term capital gains levels from the ordinary income tax levels.
- Accelerated a significant number of the tax provisions in EGTRRA, which had been scheduled to be deliberately worked in slowly. For instance, with EGTRRA, the new 10% marginal tax bracket was to grow to $7,000 and $14,000 in 2008 for [single filers](/single) and married people filing jointly, separately. With JGTRRA, the expansion amounts produced results in 2003 rather than 2008.

However the recession had technically ended, numerous Americans were all the while faltering from its effects.

With a fiscal cliff actually approaching over the economy, the cuts were saved from elimination when President Barack Obama marked the [American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012](/american-taxpayer-relief-act-2012) in which the Bush tax cuts for single taxpayers with under $400,000 in income and married couples with under $450,000 were retained.
