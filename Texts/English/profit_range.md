The breakeven point is reached when the two prices are equivalent.

In this case, the investor will break even on the off chance that the stock price falls below $99, and any further drop will increase their profits. Notwithstanding, the maximum conceivable profit is $99 per share, on the grounds that the share price can't fall below zero. Since a put option incorporates 100 contracts, the profit range for this trade is somewhere in the range of $0 and $9,900.

The calculation might be more confounded for additional sophisticated investors, who might utilize both call and put options to collar trades and hedge against downside risk.
