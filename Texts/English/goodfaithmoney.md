# Honest intentions Money
## What Is Good Faith Money?

Completely pure intentions money is a deposit of money into an account by a buyer to show that they have the expectation of completing a deal. Completely honest intentions money is frequently later applied to the purchase yet might be non-refundable in the event that the deal doesn't go through.

## Seeing Good Faith Money

Completely honest intentions money can likewise be known as earnest money and acts like a [security deposit](/security-deposit) on a rental property. Where a security deposit for a rental home, vehicle, or equipment might be taken as [insurance](/insurance) against damages, honest intentions money is normally taken as insurance against a lost opportunity should the buyer not proceed with completing a purchase.

Much of the time, the deposit amount will be a percentage of the total amount owed â€” a small percentage for something large like a house or lease contract, and a larger percentage for smaller purchases of consumable things. A common illustration of honest intentions money is the supposed "earnest money" [escrow](/escrow) deposit required by most home sellers to go into a sales contract with a buyer.

## Pure intentions Money Amounts

The amount of pure intentions money used to start a contract with a seller will fluctuate impressively contingent upon the asset, the neighborhood market, and the credibility of the buyer. For instance, while the housing market in a given district is extremely hot and numerous buyers make offers on similar properties, the expected earnest money deposit, in certain areas, can rise higher than the standard 1% to 3% of the potential purchase price of the home.

In costly areas, this can be such a substantial amount that the buyer has significantly more incentive to only make the purchase, as opposed to defer while working out [financing](/contract). Those buyers who don't have financing accessible as of now are hence removed for buyers with stronger financial balance.

## Completely honest intentions Money as Motivation

This phenomenon mirrors the way that albeit the money is apparently for the seller to offset the opportunity cost of working with an alternate buyer, the higher demand permits the seller to command more earnest money, pushing the buyer to rapidly settle on a choice right away.

This likewise makes a [sunk-cost](/sunkcost) bias in the buyers that might be useful to them move beyond their buyer's regret on the off chance that they bid up the property too high. One way or the other, a large earnest money requirement works for the seller and ought to be a bit of a warning sign that they are going to pay an extra premium for the property. For somebody who is hoping to make a wise purchase, this would be a warning sign to let the property go.

Most pure intentions money deposits are part of an agreement that illuminates the conditions under which a buyer might lose their deposit assuming they can't or reluctant to complete the contract. The written agreement is important for the buyer to guarantee that the deposit will really go towards the purchase.

The potential buyer can in some cases get their honest intentions money back contingent upon the terms of the agreement. For instance, in the event that the home bombs a home inspection by a professional, it is typically a fair and legitimate motivation to get the pure intentions money back.

An honest intentions deposit might appear to be similar to a [call option](/calloption) on the grounds that the buyer has the privilege to complete the ultimate purchase. In any case, not at all like an option, honest intentions money is generally applied to the last purchase price, while a call option premium isn't.
