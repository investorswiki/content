## Commercial Paper (CP) versus Asset-Backed Commercial Paper (ABCP)

The primary difference between commercial paper (CP) and asset-backed commercial paper (ABCP) is that commercial paper isn't backed by assets. [Commercial paper](/commercialpaper) (CP) is a money market security issued by large corporations to fund-raise to meet short-term obligations. With a fixed maturity of short of what one year, the commercial paper acts as a [promissory note](/promissorynote) that is backed exclusively by the high credit rating of the responsible company.

A type of commercial paper that is backed by other financial assets is called an asset-backed commercial paper.

A company or bank hoping to upgrade [liquidity](/liquidity) may sell receivables to a SPV or different conduits, which, thusly, will issue them to its investors as asset-backed commercial paper. The ABCP is backed by the expected cash inflows from the receivables. As the receivables are collected, the originators are expected to pass the funds to the conduit, which is responsible for dispensing the funds created by the receivables to the ABCP noteholders.

## ABCP Interest Payments

During the life of the investment, the sponsoring financial institution that set up the conduit is responsible for monitoring improvements that could influence the performance and [credit quality](/creditquality) of the assets in the SPV. The sponsor guarantees that ABCP investors receive their interest payments and principal repayments when the security develops.

The interest payments made to ABCP investors start from the pool of assets backing the security, e.g., month to month vehicle loan payments. At the point when the collateralized paper develops, the investor receives a [principal payment](/principal) that is funded either from the collection of the credit's assets, from the issuance of new ABCP, or by getting to the credit's liquidity facility.

The failure in certain conditions for investors to sell their investments rapidly to limit losses is just one of the risks associated with asset-backed commercial paper.
