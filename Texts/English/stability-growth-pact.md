# Stability and Growth Pact (SGP)
## What Is the Stability and Growth Pact (SGP)?

The Stability and Growth Pact (SGP) is a binding discretionary agreement among [European Union (EU)](/europeanunion) member states. Economic policies and activities are composed strongly to defend the stability of the [economic](/economic-joining) and [monetary union](/currency-union).

## How the SGP Works

The SGP expects to guarantee that countries in the EU don't spend too far in the red. To accomplish this goal, a set of [fiscal](/fiscalpolicy) rules are implemented to limit [budget deficits](/budget-deficit) and debt relative to [gross domestic product (GDP)](/gdp).

The European Commission and the Council of Ministers issue an annual recommendation on policy measures and watch member states to keep every nation agreeable with [budget](/budget) regulations. As per the agreement, countries that break the rules for three successive years are fined a maximum of 0.5% of their GDP.

### Stability and Growth Pact (SGP) Requirements

The SGP sets two hard limits on EU member states: a state's budget deficit can't surpass 3% of GDP and national debt can't outperform 60% of GDP. In situations where a national debt surpasses 60% of the member state's GDP, it must decay at a reasonable pace to inside acceptable limits to try not to cause punishments.

To guarantee that all EU member states are assessed and examined for compliance, each is required to present a SGP compliance report to the European Commission and Council of Ministers. The report likewise educates the previously mentioned substances regarding the expected economic development of the member state for the current and subsequent three years. These are called "stability programs" for [eurozone](/eurozone) member states and "union projects" for non-eurozone member states.

In 2005, the SGP was changed, requiring economic reports to contain a "Medium-Term Budget Objective," or MTO. This extra measure was acquainted with empower member states to show the European Commission and Council of Ministers how they expect to bring their [balance sheets](/balancesheet) inside acceptable regulatory standards.

On the off chance that a member state is outside of acceptable limits and considered not to do what was necessary to redress the situation, the EU starts a purported "Inordinate Deficit Procedure," by which the blameworthy party is issued a cutoff time to consent and a nitty gritty economic plan to bring it back under acceptable limits.

## History of the SGP

The SGP legislative foundation is the language of Articles 121 and 126 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the EU, which became effective January 1, 1958. In any case, the pact itself was just formalized by means of council resolution in July 1997 and completely happened January 1, 1999.

When the eurozone and [euro](/euro) currency were made, national state run administrations stayed in charge of their own fiscal policies, while the [European Central Bank (ECB)](/europeancentralbank) assumed responsibility for overseeing [interest rates](/interestrate) and controlling [inflation](/inflation). Having a monetary union yet no fiscal union among member states made an incentive for legislatures to participate in extreme [deficit spending](/deficit-spending) on the expectation that all the more fiscally responsible states would unavoidably face a dilemma between rescuing their free-spending partners or, in all likelihood risk undermining the currency.

Since all member states face this incentive, this situation sets up a sort of [prisoner's dilemma game](/detainees dilemma), where all member legislatures have an incentive to desert by running high deficits to satisfy domestic citizens while risking the collapse of the common currency. Expecting the risks of this moral hazard, Germany campaigned for the SGP rules to be presented, stressed that a few nations would trigger high inflation by cutting [taxes](/taxes) and spending sumptuously.

## Reactions of the SGP

The SGP is frequently reprimanded for its severe fiscal rules. Some gripe that it disregards national power and effectively rebuffs the least fortunate member states.

The agreement has additionally gone under attack for its lack of compliance and perceived preference toward certain nations. The Council of Ministers reportedly never considered imposing punishments against France or Germany, even however both penetrated the 3% deficit limit in 2003. Conversely, different countries, like Portugal and Greece, have been undermined with big fines in the past.

Pundits say France and Germany are protected on account of their heavy and unbalanced representation on the Council of Ministers. The SGP was a major idea during the political crusading leading up to the British [referendum on Brexit](/brexit) in 2016.

## Unwinding of SGP Rules

In March 2020, the European Commission enacted a general escape clause in the SGP, permitting member legislatures to surpass the normal deficit and debt limits due to the sudden economic shock made by states' responses the COVID-19 pandemic. In 2021 the Commission announced that these rules would stay suspended until 2023.
