# Split Adjusted
## What is Split Adjusted?

Split adjusted refers to how historical stock prices are portrayed if a company has issued a [stock split](/stocksplit) for its shares in the past. When reviewing price data, whether in tables or on charts, split adjusted data will reflect the increase in price as though there had been no split in the shares. It does this by anchoring the current price and working in reverse. This gives the false impression that historical prices might appear lower than they really were at that point. However, it gives a more correct representation of the amount of growth those shares have experienced from past until the present day.

## Understanding Split Adjusted Stock Prices

Stock splits reduce the price of shares by a given fraction to accommodate the creation of new shares. For example a 2-for-1 split means the price is halved while shares are doubled, a 3-for-1 split implies the price is reduced to one-third while the share count is tripled, etc.

Companies can split their shares because of various factors, however the primary reason is to keep their share price affordable to a great many people. The reasoning is that it will have higher investment interest, wider ownership, and a stronger [secondary market](/secondarymarket). These components contribute to make it easier and cheaper to raise extra capital with a [primary market](/primarymarket) offering of extra shares.

Some companies see this action as a trick and refuse to split their shares. Along these lines Alphabet, Berkshire Hathaway, and Amazon, have very high share prices, while companies who have offered share splits, like Apple and Microsoft, have comparatively lower share prices. Regardless of how a corporations officer sees the matter, stock splits affect historical prices in manners that make it challenging for researchers to follow the amount of growth an investor will experience.

Stocks can reverse-split, creating fewer shares at a higher price, again with [valuation](/valuation) remaining the same. [Reverse stock splits](/reversesplit), otherwise called a stock consolidation or share rollback, create higher priced shares. There are a number of reasons why a company might decide to reduce its number of outstanding shares in the market, which, unfortunately for the company, might be the result of poor stock performance. In by far most of cases, a reverse split is undertaken to satisfy exchange [listing requirements](/listingrequirements).

## Other Considerations for Split Adjusted Stocks

Investors claiming stocks that undergo splits see little effects in terms of the value of their holdings overall. The number of shares in their account changes, however not the balance. One hundred shares of a stock at $50 per share has the same value as 200 shares of the same stock trading at the split price of $25 per share.

Per share data, like earnings, revenues, sales, etc., will indeed change. However, the math says that ratios, for example, the[ price-earnings (p/e) ratio](/price-earningsratio), will remain the same. Price per share and [earnings per share](/eps) both split the same way.

Investors seeing charts will likewise notice that historical [volume](/volume) will change as per the split ratio, albeit in reverse. In other words, a stock that traded 1,000 shares on a given day in the past later undergoes a two-for-one split. Taking a gander at a split-adjusted chart after the split happens will show 2,000 shares at half the price for that same day. Once more, the dollar value of the shares traded that day will remain the same. A slight drawback to this is that the new data might make some stocks appear to have been highly liquid for a longer period of time than they really were.

While split change generally refers to stock prices, [options](/option) on underlying split stocks are likewise split-adjusted by increasing the number of shares covered by the terms of the option. This conversion is done by the same split ratio as the underlying shares, and the [strike price](/strikeprice) is divided by the split ratio. This is additionally the reason option quotes show fractional options strike prices, or non-standard contract sizes, following stock splits.
