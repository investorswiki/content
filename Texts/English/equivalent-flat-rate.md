# Equivalent Flat Rate
## What Is an Equivalent Flat Rate?

The term "equivalent flat rate" is utilized with regards to the insurance industry inside the [European Union (EU)](/europeanunion). In particular, it connects with the methods utilized by the EU to direct the insurance industry to guarantee that insurance policyholders will have their claims regarded even assuming their insurers become wiped out and are unable to meet their obligations.

## How Equivalent Flat Rates Work

While purchasing insurance, the two principal needs that all consumers share is to pay as little as feasible for their coverage and to be certain that, in the event that they really do have to file a claim, their insurance company will actually want to respect its commitments. To assist with guaranteeing this, legislatures all through the world make regulatory systems intended to shield consumers from the risk that insurers could become [insolvent](/insolvency) and be unable to respect their customers' claims.

Keeping that in mind, countries in the EU have made insurance guarantee schemes (IGS) to act as government-upheld "insurers of last hotel" to safeguard consumers. The two primary ways to deal with funding these organizations are through a flat-rate method, in which insurers are charged a set percentage of their [premiums](/insurance-premium) paying little heed to how much risk is assumed by the insurer; and a risk-based method, in which the insurer is charged an amount that changes relying upon the risk of their policies. An equivalent flat rate, thusly, is a flat rate that is planned to average the amount that would be charged to the insurer under a risk-based method.

To accomplish an equivalent flat rate, the IGS changes the flat rate it charges an insurer to mirror an amount equivalent to what it would charge that insurer under a risk-based scheme. This adjustment permits the insurer to pay what they see to be a flat rate, while the IGS stays protected by charging a rate based on the actual risk assumed by the insurer. Assuming that an IGS utilizes a flat-rate scheme, an insurer that faces greater risk challenges not need to pay expanding rates. In this manner, the insurer won't be required to raise the premiums they charge to their policyholders.

## Real World Example of an Equivalent Flat Rate

Safe Choice Insurance is a speculative insurance company operating in the EU. Under their country's IGS program, Safe Choice is required to pay a set percentage of their insurance premiums to their insurance regulator. The regulator then holds these funds in a contingency fund to cover any potential future claims that Safe Choice is unable to pay for due to insolvency. For Safe Choice's customers, this gives an additional level of assurance that they will actually want to count on the protections they purchase.

Albeit Safe Choice pays a similar percentage rate over time, the actual percentage picked by the IGS was based on an equivalent flat rate methodology. This means, in choosing the rate, the regulator considered the risk level of Safe Choice's policies and picked a flat rate that they felt would rough, on an average basis, the level of premiums that the regulator would collect assuming they assessed premiums on a risk-based basis for every one of Safe Choice's individual policies.
