# Digital Gold Currency (DGC)
## What is a Digital Gold Currency (DGC)?

A digital gold currency (DGC) is an electronic form of money which is backed by gold reserves held in vaults by private agencies. The holders of a specific DGC can pay each other in gold, or currency units representative of gold held in physical form by the responsible company. Every one of these companies, or exchanges, keep a physical reserve reflecting 100 percent of client accounts. The principal DGCs appeared during the 1990s, drove by E-Gold. A series of different currencies have arisen in the years since, with generally falling flat for various reasons.

## How a Digital Gold Currency (DGC) Works

Since a digital gold currency (DGC) is electronic money, offered and kept up with by private entities, there is risk implied. The entity backs the funds by holding a physical reserve of [bullion](/bullion). As a loose network of electronic currencies operated by independent private entities, DGCs present an extra layer of risk to the buyer. [Management risk](/managementrisk), particularly in an unregulated creating market, has represented a specific threat to people holding DGCs. Management risk is from an inadequate, destructive or underperforming administration. Lack of transparency, poor oversight, slack security rehearses, or outright theft all threaten the digital holdings.

It is difficult to utilize digital currencies in light of the fact that its acceptance isn't universal. Exchange rate risk additionally threatened the holders of DGCs. The value of gold varies in its relationship to worldwide, national currencies. Not all countries will permit the transfer of a digital holding into cold, hard cash. In the event that a DGC client recovers their holdings, the currency they convert into might not have the buying power of different currencies.

Allies of the investment in gold and gold currencies have long promoted gold's universality and immunity to the risks of a single national economy. By its direct connection to a physical asset, they contend, DGC is best fit to endure economic disturbance. Additionally, since the currency doesn't tie itself to the monetary policy or economic system of any one country, it maintains a strategic distance from the risk of political commotion.

Pundits fight that any gold-backed currency is too independent of a national financial system, and hence can't be managed by states in response to [financial crisis](/financial-crisis).

## Digital Gold Currencies and Bitcoin

E-Gold, the principal DGC, at last succumbed to its originators' newness to the risks of online fraud and the response it would incite from the U.S. regulatory system. At last, the U.S. Department of Justice classified e-Gold as a money transmitter instead of a platform for payments. The business was unable to get a license to operate under this classification. Different firms have failed due to embezzlement or [money laundering](/moneylaundering) by executives, or their appeal of online identity hoodlums and other digital lawbreakers.

In the wake of many failed DGC exchanges, [Bitcoin](/bitcoin) has ascended in conspicuousness, and its users have gained from the errors and weaknesses of its ancestors. Rather than seeking to keep away from regulation, Bitcoin users are forced to follow a regulatory structure.

Businesses operating in the Bitcoin marketplace have discovered that it is to their greatest advantage to carefully follow transactions. Bitcoin regulators won't approve of administrators unable to recognize where their currency has come from and is going. Bitcoin has not had the option to snuff out its more obscure side totally, yet the closure of the [Silk Road](/silk-road) marketplace in 2013 addresses a critical step in Bitcoin's path to authenticity.
