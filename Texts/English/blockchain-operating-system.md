# Blockchain Operating System
## What Is a Blockchain Operating System?

A blockchain operating system utilizes blockchain as a support system that runs behind the scenes of a computer system or platform. For example, your Android mobile or Windows PC needs a nearby establishment of the individual operating system (OS) on the smartphone's memory or on the PC's hard circle, and all transactions and orders are executed locally. A blockchain-based OS catches all orders and transactions from a client's gadget where validating, executing, and recording them happens on the blockchain.

## Figuring out Blockchain Operating Systems

Past the standard payment processing system of the well known [Bitcoin](/bitcoin) [cryptocurrency](/cryptocurrency), [blockchain](/blockchain) is finding broad utilize all over the technology stack. The emerging fad among the technical development on [distributed ledger technology](/distributed-ledger-technology-dlt) is the blockchain operating system.

A blockchain basically functions as a ledger turned transaction processing engine. Whether you want a payment handled, or you want to arm your cryptokitty with the most recent contraption on the [Ethereum](/ethereum) platform, or on the other hand if you need to follow your high-cost wine shipment right from the grape plantation to your doorstep on the VeChain blockchain, all such applications of blockchain depend on confirming, recording, and processing transactions.

Any standard operating system, be it Microsoft Windows, Apple Mac, or mobile systems like [Android](/android-operating-system) or [iOS](/apple-ios), additionally executes transactions in view of client orders issued through mouse-snaps or screen-taps where every one of the tasks get completed locally on the gadget. A similar concept is extended to the utilization of a blockchain for gadget OS, where its utilization for working as an operating system is viewed as a more efficient OS.

## Instances of Blockhain OS Efforts

Early endeavors to build blockchain-based OS previously arose for mobile and smartphone use, and it was a cloud-based virtual system. All the vital transaction processing happens on the cloud-facilitated blockchain-based data center, with the client just giving essential orders through the taps on the gadget touchscreen.

For example, Hong Kong-based NYNJA Group Ltd. has a strategic coordinated effort with Amgoo smartphone producers for its blockchain-based NYNJA virtual operating system (vOS). The two companies will work with telecom administrators in Latin America to give NYNJA vOS users an initial block of data upon actuation. The vOS supports a communication layer offering text, voice, video conferencing, and project management tools, a secure payments layer for commercial transactions, and a multi-currency wallet that supports Bitcoin, Ethereum, and all ERC-20 viable tokens.

The OS platform additionally supports a marketplace for commercial activities â€” like distributing the skilled '[gig economy](/gig-economy) workers to specific job requests from the users, and a market for users to buy and sell goods. The vOS is supported by its native cryptocurrency called NYNJAcoin or NYN.

## Special Considerations

All benefits and benefits of blockchain are expected to be accessible to blockchain OS users.

Anything a client does on their Android or iOS mobiles, or Windows or Mac PCs is inclined to be caught by the particular applications, ISPs, as well as OS manufacturers who might record all client activities in the OS logs. Blockchain-based OS offers benefits of security and privacy, and the de-directed, decentralized utilization of OS.

The concept is as yet advancing, and true use is limited. Be that as it may, in the event that it prevails with regards to offering a smooth and mess free working of the gadget OS, it may not be too far to see an ever increasing number of gadgets running on such blockchain OS.

## Highlights
- Initially pointed as OS for mobile telephones or other associated smart gadgets, blockchain operating systems promote a high level of data security and client namelessness.
- To function as an OS, blockchain conventions must consider the execution of computer code and orders from users.
- A blockchain operating system leverage blockchain ledger technology to run computer systems or organizations in whole or in part.
