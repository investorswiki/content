## What Is a Prediction Market?

A prediction market is a market where individuals can trade contracts that pay based on the outcomes of obscure future events.

## Understanding a Prediction Market

Prediction markets are like futures markets for commodities or other financial asset prices. In futures markets, traders bid up or down the price of a future contract based on their expectation of what the future price of the underlying asset will be. Prediction markets are just futures markets where the future event being traded upon is some different option from the price of an asset sooner or later. Prediction markets include a collection of individuals conjecturing on different events — trade averages, election results, quarterly sales results, or even gross film receipts.

Robin Hanson, a teacher at George Mason University, is an advocate of prediction markets. He presents the defense for prediction markets by underscoring the removal of dependence on self-interested punditry by purported experts. "All things considered, let us make betting markets on most disputable inquiries, and treat the current market chances as our best expert consensus. The real experts (perhaps **you**), would then be compensated for their contributions, while dumbfounded savants would figure out how to remain away," Hanson says on his web page.

The price in a prediction market is a wagered that a specific event will happen. It likewise addresses an estimated value that the person putting down the bet allots to the boundaries being viewed as in the bet. In contrast to public markets, where wagers are put by implication on intangibles, like government policy or the potential outcomes of an election (through the effects these things are expected to have on asset prices), prediction markets enable users to wager straightforwardly on a snippet of data that they accept is valuable.

For instance, it is beyond the realm of possibilities for a speculator to wager straightforwardly on an election in the U.S. All things considered, the trader should find stocks that could increase in value on the off chance that a certain candidate is chosen. Nonetheless, prediction markets permit traders to wager straightforwardly on the possibility of genuine candidates being chosen for office.
