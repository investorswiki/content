# Unfair Claims Practice
## What Is Unfair Claims Practice?

Unfair claims practice is the ill-advised avoidance of a [claim by an insurer](/insurance_claim) or an endeavor to reduce the size of the claim. By participating in unfair claims practices, an insurer attempts to reduce its costs. In any case, this is unlawful in numerous locales.

## Understanding Unfair Claims Practice

The [National Association of Insurance Commissioners](/nainsurancec) (NAIC) has made model unfair claims practice regulation that commands claims be dealt with decently and that there be clear communication between the insurer and the insured. States, not the federal government, manage insurance; numerous wards have carried out unfair claims practices laws modeled after the NAIC's model act.

Likewise, most states have enacted a variant of this model law. Called the Unfair Claims Settlement Practices Act, it shields insurance purchasers from uncalled for behavior by insurers in the claims settlement process. Particulars of the law change from one state to another. Unfair Claims Settlement Practices Acts (UCSPA) are not federal law; all things considered, they are authorized by individual state insurance departments.

## Illustration of Unfair Claims Practice

Consider a small business owner that guarantees his company's building and business personal property under a commercial property policy. Tragically, a fire broke out in the building, causing $100,000 in property damage. The insurance company defers payment, delivering the business owner incapable to repair any of the damage. The insurance company keeps utilizing postpone tactics to try not to make a payment. For instance, the claims representative keeps "neglecting" to send the claim forms. Likewise, the [adjuster](/adjuster) says he really wants one more proof of loss, however the small business owner has previously submitted proof of loss two times. These are the types of circumstances that unfair claims practice laws are intended to forestall.

## Different Examples of Unfair Claims Practice
- **Distorting pertinent facts or policy provisions.** For example, your commercial property policy states that Building Ordinance coverage is incorporated, however your insurer demands the coverage is excluded.
- **Making a critical modification in an application without your consent and afterward settling a claim in view of the alteration.** For example, in your application, you mentioned a $50,000 limit for Utility Interruption coverage, yet your insurer reduced the limit to $10,000 without telling you. The insurer then will not pay more than $10,000 for a loss.
- **Settling claims for not as much as what you would sensibly expect** in light of a written promotion you received. For example, a promotion declares a $50,000 limit for damage brought about by flooding. Nonetheless, the promotion doesn't specify anyplace that this coverage is given provided that the insured pays an extra premium past the premium stated in the advertisement.
