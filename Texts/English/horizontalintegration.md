# Horizontal Integration
## What is Horizontal Integration?

Horizontal integration is the acquisition of a business operating at a similar level of the [value chain](/valuechain) in a similar industry — that is, they make or offer comparable goods or services. This is rather than [vertical integration](/verticalintegration), where firms venture into upstream or downstream activities, which are at various stages of production.

## Figuring out Horizontal Integration

Horizontal integration is a competitive strategy that can make economies of scale, increase [market power](/market-power) over merchants and providers, improve [product differentiation](/product_differentiation) and assist businesses with growing their market or enter new markets. By blending, two businesses might have the option to deliver more revenue than they would have had the option to autonomously do.

Notwithstanding, when [horizontal mergers](/horizontalmerger) succeed, it is frequently to the detriment of consumers, particularly in the event that the merger reduces competition. Therefore, horizontal mergers are intensely investigated by regulators, to check whether they abuse antitrust laws.

## Benefits and Disadvantages of Horizontal Integration

Companies participate in horizontal integration to benefit from [synergies](/cooperative energy). There might be economies of scale or [cost synergies](/costsynergy) in marketing; research and development (R&D); production; and distribution. Or on the other hand there might be economies of scale, which make the simultaneous manufacturing of various products more cost-compelling than manufacturing them all alone.

Procter and Gamble's 2005 acquisition of Gillette is a genuine illustration of a horizontal merger that realized economies of scope. Since the two companies delivered many cleanliness related products from razors to toothpaste, the merger reduced the marketing and product development costs per product.

Collaborations can likewise be realized by consolidating products or markets. Horizontal integration is frequently driven by marketing goals. Broadening product offerings might give [cross-selling](/strategically pitch) opportunities and increase every business' market. A retail business that sells garments might choose to likewise offer embellishments. Or on the other hand it could converge with a comparative business in one more country to gain a traction there and try not to need to build a distribution network without any preparation.

### Disadvantages of Horizontal Integration

Like any merger, horizontal integration doesn't necessarily yield the collaborations and added value that was expected. It might bring about negative collaborations which reduce the overall value of the business, assuming the bigger firm turns out to be too cumbersome and inflexible to make due, or on the other hand in the event that the merged firms experience issues brought about by unfathomably different leadership styles and company societies.

Then, at that point, there are regulatory issues. In the event that horizontal mergers inside a similar industry concentrate market share among a small number of companies, it makes a [oligopoly](/oligopoly). On the off chance that one company winds up with a prevailing market share, it has a [monopoly](/monopoly). What's more, in the event that a merger undermines contenders, or appears to radically confine the market and reduce consumer decisions, it could draw in the consideration of the [Federal Trade Commission](/ftc).
