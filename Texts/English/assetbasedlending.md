# Asset-Based Lending
## What Is Asset-Based Lending?

Asset-based lending is the business of loaning money in an agreement that is secured by collateral. A [asset-based loan](/assetbasedfinance) or credit extension might be secured by inventory, accounts receivable, equipment, or other property owned by the borrower.

The asset-based lending industry serves business, not consumers. It is otherwise called asset-based financing.

## How Asset-Based Lending Works

Numerous businesses need to take out loans or get lines of credit to meet routine [cash flow](/cashflow) demands. For instance, a business could get a credit extension to ensure it can cover its payroll expenses even on the off chance that there's a short pause in payments it hopes to receive.

In the event that the company seeking the loan can't show sufficient cash flow or cash assets to cover a loan, the lender might offer to endorse the loan with its physical assets as collateral. For instance, another restaurant could possibly get a loan simply by involving its equipment as collateral.

The terms and conditions of an asset-based loan rely upon the type and value of the assets offered as security. Lenders favor highly liquid collateral, for example, securities that can promptly be changed over completely to cash assuming the borrower defaults on the payments. Loans utilizing physical assets are viewed as less secure, so the maximum loan will be extensively not exactly the book value of the assets. Interest rates charged fluctuate widely, contingent upon the candidate's credit history, cash flow, and time allotment carrying on with work.

> All interest rates on asset-based loans are lower than rates on unsecured loans since the lender can recover most or its losses if the borrower defaults.

## Model

For instance, say a company looks for a $200,000 loan to extend its operations. On the off chance that the company pledges the highly liquid [marketable securities](/marketablesecurities) on its balance sheet as collateral, the lender might grant a loan equalling 85% of the face value of the securities. Assuming the company's securities are valued at $200,000, the lender will actually want to loan $170,000. In the event that the company decides to pledge less liquid assets, for example, real estate or equipment, it might just be offered half of its required financing, or $100,000.

In the two cases, the discount addresses the costs of changing the collateral over completely to cash and its expected loss in [market value](/marketvalue).

## Special Considerations

Small and average sized companies that are stable and that have physical assets of value are the most common asset-based borrowers.

Be that as it may, even large corporations may sporadically look for asset-based loans to cover short-term needs. The cost and long lead season of giving extra shares or bonds in the [capital markets](/capitalmarkets) might be too high. The cash demand might be very time-delicate, for example, on account of a major acquisition or a surprising equipment purchase.

## Highlights
- Liquid collateral is preferred rather than illiquid or physical assets like equipment.
- Asset-based lending is much of the time involved by small to medium sized businesses to cover short-term cash flow demands.
- Asset-based lending includes loaning money involving the borrower's assets as collateral.
