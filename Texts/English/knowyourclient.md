# Know Your Client (KYC)
KYC alludes to a cycle that banks and other financial institutions use to gather identifying data and contact data from current and likely customers. Its purpose is to forestall fraud, money laundering, and other unlawful activity, as well as the abuse of financial accounts.
In the US, Banks are legally commanded to involve KYC in compliance with the 2001 USA Patriot Act. In 1989, the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) was laid out to fight money laundering on an international scale. FAFT sets standards and provides proposals to achieve this goal through Anti-Money Laundering (AML) practices. Member countries and purviews enforce different laws, rules, and regulations to work with the AML guidelines. KYC and AML remain closely connected in assisting with forestalling deceptive and criminal financial activity.

KYC practices ordinarily start before an individual turns into a customer. Financial institutions must initially confirm the stated identity of an expected customer before opening an account. Since there are no legal verification standards, this interaction might appear to be unique for each bank.

KYC practices aren't limited to banking institutions. The financial investment industry utilizes KYC processes in compliance with the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) KYC Rule 2090. Yet rather than an AML exertion, these KYC practices help investment companies better comprehend client needs.

While it makes things more complex and time broad - particularly for the banking industry and its customers - the benefits probably offset the bother. However standardized practices would probably assist with streamlining the interaction.
