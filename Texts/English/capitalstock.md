# Capital Stock
## What Is Capital Stock?
Capital stock addresses the total number of [shares](/equity) issued by a company. For a publicly traded company, that is the number of [common stock](/commonstock) and [preferred stock](/preferredstock) shares issued. Capital stock is alluded to as paid-in capital when investors put their money into a company and receive shares in return.
The number of common and preferred shares can be found in the [shareholders' equity](/shareholdersequity) section of a company's [balance sheet](/balancesheet). For listed companies, the balance sheet is part of the quarterly or annual report recorded with the [Securities and Exchange Commission](/sec). A few companies, however, only have common shares. All things considered, each company has its own method of recording capital stock and its own utilization of terms.
## How Does Capital Stock Differ From Authorized Stock?
While capital stock will be stock that a company sells, authorized stock, as the name infers, is the number of shares legally authorized by a company. At the point when a corporation is legally incorporated or a company sets its charter in a state, it outlines the total number of shares its executive management has authorized it to issue. In this way, capital stock can't surpass authorized stock, which is the broadest category of shares.

## How Is Capital Stock Valued?
The value of capital stock is normally a combination of its paid-in capital in light of [par value](/parvalue) and its [additional paid-in capital](/additionalpaidincapital).
A company ordinarily sets its common stock's par value at a minimum, regularly well below the offering price at the time they open up to the world, for the purpose of accounting. The par value is a nominal figure, to show that the shares are accounted for in shareholders' equity, and furthermore to meet a state government's requirement that shares can't be sold at below their par value. The par value for preferred stock, on the other hand, can be not quite the same as that for common stock on the grounds that [dividends](/dividend) paid to preferred shareholders are calculated in light of the par value. In any case, for certain companies, the par value for common and preferred stock are something similar. In different cases preferred shares have no par value.
Additional paid-in capital is the difference between what is paid by investors for a company's stock at market value and its par value at the hour of its [initial public offering](/ipo), or what's known as paid-in capital in excess of par value. Additional paid-in capital is commonly used to offset the stock at par value. A few companies, however, only rundown stock at par value and don't list additional paid-in capital since they haven't issued new shares or [repurchased stock](/buyback). A few companies have separate passages for contributed capital (paid-in capital) and additional paid-in capital, while some could combine the two into one.
At the point when a company chooses to sell new shares (by means of a follow-on offering or secondary offering) or repurchase stock, the amount of capital stock changes and is recorded for that period.
**Note**: Whenever a company sells new shares to raise capital, that weakens the value and voting rights of shares held by existing common shareholders.
Common shares that are bought back can be set to the side by the company as treasury shares, which can be listed as a separate, negative line thing since it is considered a contra equity account (against paid-in stock) within shareholders' equity.
## Is Treasury Stock Included in Capital Stock?
Treasury stock will be stock that was issued by a company and in this manner repurchased. That stock is never again part of [shares outstanding](/outstandingshares), and a company can involve it for employee compensation (stock options, awards, and so on.). Treasury stock remains part of issued shares however conveys restrictions like lack of voting rights and no entitlement to dividend payments. At the point when a company repurchases shares from the open market, treasury shares are registered as a contra equity account in shareholders' equity section of the balance sheet.
## Capital Stock Examples: Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) and Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX)
Below is Apple's recording of its common stock and additional paid-in capital as a single thing on its balance sheet. The par value for its common stock is set at 1/1000 of a penny, and that means that legally, Apple's listed stock price can't go below that par value. An expanded entry shows beginning and ending balances for its share capital to reflect shares that were granted to employees as compensation.
