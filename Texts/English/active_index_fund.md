# Active Index Fund
## What Is an Active Index Fund?

An active index fund is a basket of assets wherein the fund manager builds the initial investment with holdings from a benchmark index and afterward adds securities unrelated to the underlying index or eliminates existing index parts determined to drive portfolio performance higher. This extra layer of non-benchmark securities expects to support returns over a traditional [buy and hold](/buyandhold) [passive strategy](/passiveinvesting) by considering some active management.

By adding individual stocks detached from the more extensive index, the fund manager can open extra alpha. Active index funds might utilize a [tilt](/tiltfund) or utilize a [smart beta](/smart-beta) strategy.

## Understanding Active Index Funds

An active index fund endeavors to take a rendition of an index fund like the [Standard and Poor's 500 Index](/sp) (S&P 500) and occasionally rebalance every one of the stocks to match the extents found in the genuine S&P 500. The manager will add stocks to the fund they accept will yield unexpected returns to the passive index fund. For instance, in the event that the manager accepts [semiconductors](/semiconductor) will deliver strong outcomes for future quarters, more semiconductor stocks would be added to the portfolio.

While it is feasible for some fund managers to essentially beat the underlying benchmark index by utilizing strategies like market timing, this is nowhere near guaranteed. Passive funds can be depended on to follow an index steadfastly, which permits investors to know the true holdings and risk profile of the fund. This assists investors with keeping a diversified portfolio and managed expectations.

Adding an active layer to the [index fund](/indexfund) makes it challenging for the investing community to expect the future cosmetics of the fund. This can work for investors when the market encounters heavy volatility and the fund requires a prepared professional to limit [drawdowns](/drawdown). A fund manager can shift portions from underperforming positions to additional proper sectors or asset classes. In any case, most empirical research finds a simple passive strategy will in general outperform a confounded active management approach.

## Tilt Funds

A tilt fund is a type of mutual fund or exchange-traded fund that incorporates a core holding of stocks that emulate a [benchmark](/benchmark)- type index, to which extra securities are added to assist with tilting the fund toward outperforming the market. In some cases called [enhanced index funds](/enhanced_index_fund), these are active index funds involved by major investors with an end goal to further develop overall investment returns.

A fund that uses a tilting strategy could have by far most of capital invested in those 500 companies, however it could likewise permit the manager the flexibility to incorporate different stocks too. Then again, value tilts in a fund may likewise lean toward one type of stock over another, for example, leaning toward small-cap stocks that generally have given higher-than-normal returns.

## Smart Beta

Smart beta strategies try to passively follow indices, while likewise considering alternative weighting schemes, for example, [volatility](/volatility), liquidity, quality, value, size, and momentum. That is on the grounds that smart beta strategies are executed like normal index strategies in that the index rules are set and transparent. These funds don't follow standard indices, like the S&P 500 or the [Nasdaq 100 Index](/nasdaq100), yet all things being equal, center around areas of the market that offer an opportunity for abuse.

There is no single approach to smart beta, as the goals for investors can be different in view of their requirements, however a few managers are prescriptive in distinguishing smart beta thoughts that are value-making and financially natural. Equity smart beta tries to address shortcomings made by market-capitalization-weighted benchmarks. Funds might adopt a topical strategy to deal with this risk by zeroing in on mispricing made by investors seeking short-term gains, for instance.

## Limitations of Active Index Funds

Albeit an active index fund holds large numbers of similar securities of a traditional index fund, they will generally come at a premium. Taking an active management style means the fund must charge higher fees to cover the cost of the manager, research materials, and some other data required to pursue smart investment choices.

These higher [expense ratios](/expenseratio) put squeeze on fund managers to outperform or beat the underlying index reliably. Likewise with a mutual fund, the possibility to outperform boils down to the manager. Some have a talent for finding hidden diamonds, however most will pick losing assets that limit likely performance of the fund.

- Instances of active index strategies incorporate utilizing a tilt or smart beta approach, which looks to take advantage of relative mispricings while sticking basically to an index.
