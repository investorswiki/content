# Amortizing Swap
## What Is an Amortizing Swap?

An amortizing swap is a [interest rate swap](/interestrateswap) where the [notional principal amount](/notionalprincipalamount) is reduced at the underlying [fixed](/fixedinterestrate) and [floating](/floatinginterestrate) rates.

## Understanding Amortizing Swaps

An amortizing swap, likewise called an amortizing interest rate swap, is a [derivative](/derivative) instrument in which one party pays a fixed rate of interest while the other party pays a floating rate of interest on a notional principal amount that reductions over time. The notional principal is tied to an underlying financial instrument with a declining (amortizing) principal balance, like a mortgage. An amortizing swap is an exchange of cash flows in particular, not principal amounts.

As with [plain vanilla swaps](/plain-vanilla-swap), an amortizing swap is an agreement between two [counterparties](/counterparty). The counterparties consent to exchange one stream of future interest payments for another, in view of a predetermined principal amount. Amortizing swaps are utilized to reduce or increase exposure to variances in [interest rates](/interestrate). They can likewise help get an imperceptibly lower interest rate than would have been conceivable without the [swap](/swap). The primary difference with amortizing swaps is the principal amount of the swap declines over time, typically on a fixed schedule. For instance, an amortizing swap could be tied to a real estate [mortgage](/mortgage) that is being paid down over time.

Interest rate swaps are a famous type of derivative agreement between two gatherings to exchange future interest payments for each other. These swaps trade [over-the-counter](/otc) (OTC) and are contracts that can be altered to the individual gatherings' ideal details. There are numerous ways of tweaking the swaps.

The notional principal in an amortizing swap might diminish at a similar rate as the underlying financial instrument. The interest rates may likewise be founded on a [benchmark](/benchmark, for example, a mortgage interest rate or the [London Inter-bank Offered Rate](/libor) (LIBOR).

An amortizing swap typically comprises of fixed and floating legs and its value is derived from the [present values](/presentvalue) of these legs. It is important (particularly to the fixed-rate receiver) that the amortization schedules of the swap and the underlying are set at indistinguishable levels.

OTC transactions, similar to swaps, have [counterparty risk](/counterpartyrisk). The transactions are not backed by an exchange, and therefore there is a risk that one party will most likely be unable to deliver on their side of the contract.

Something contrary to an amortizing swap is a [accreting principal swap](/accretingprincipalswap). With an accreting swap, the notional principal amount will increase over the life of the swap. One of the key parts of both an amortizing swap and an accreting swap is that the notional principal amount is impacted over the life of the swap agreement. This differences with other types of swaps, where the notional principal amount stays unaffected over the life of the swap.

## Illustration of an Amortizing Swap

In real estate, an investment property owner could finance a large multi-unit property with a mortgage tied to a fluctuating LIBOR or short-term Treasury interest rate. Be that as it may, they rent the property units and receive a fixed payment. To safeguard against rising interest rates on the property's mortgage, the owner could go into a swap agreement where they will swap fixed for floating rates. This guarantees that assuming rates change, they will actually want to cover the floating mortgage payments.

The downside of the swap is that assuming interest rates fall, the owner of the property would have been better off not entering the swap. As interest rates fall, they are as yet paying the fixed amount for the swap. On the off chance that they hadn't entered the swap, they would basically be profiting from lower interest rates on the mortgage.

However, swaps aren't typically placed for speculative purposes. All things being equal, they are utilized to [hedge](/hedge) or limit the downside, which is important to most organizations and organizations.

The hedge may not match entirely due to the number of day counts, [maturities](/development), call highlights, and other differences, however it would relieve a large portion of the risk of rising interest rates for the property owner.
