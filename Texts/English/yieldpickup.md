# Yield Pickup
## What Is Yield Pickup?

[Yield pickup](/pickup) alludes to the extra interest rate an investor gets by selling a lower-yielding bond and buying a higher-yielding bond. The yield pickup is finished to further develop the risk-adjusted performance of a portfolio.

## Grasping a Yield Pickup Strategy

A yield pickup is an investment strategy which includes trading bonds with lower yields for bonds with higher yields. While picking up unexpected yield empowers greater returns, the strategy likewise comes at a greater risk. A bond with a lower yield generally has a more limited maturity, while a bond with a higher yield will ordinarily have a more drawn out maturity. Bonds with longer term maturities are more [sensitive to interest rate](/interest-rate-awareness) movements in the markets. Subsequently, an investor is presented to [interest rate risk](/interestraterisk) with the more drawn out maturity bond.

Moreover, there is a positive relationship among yield and risk. The higher the risk perceived of the bond, the higher the yield required by investors to boost them to purchase the bond. Bonds with a higher risk have a lower [credit quality](/creditquality) than bonds with lower risk. With a yield pickup, then, at that point, a certain amount of risk is implied since the bond with a higher yield is frequently of a lower credit quality.

For instance, an investor claims a bond issued by Company ABC that has a 4% yield. The investor can sell this bond in exchange for a bond issued by Company XYZ that has a yield of 6%. The investor's yield pickup is 2% (6% - 4% = 2%). This strategy can profit from either a higher [coupon](/coupon) or higher [yield to maturity](/yieldtomaturity) (YTM) or both. Bonds that have a higher [default risk](/defaultrisk) frequently have higher yields, making a yield pickup play risky. In a perfect world, a yield pickup would include bonds that have a similar rating or [credit risk](/creditrisk), however this isn't generally the case.

## Pickup and Swaps

The yield pickup strategy depends on the [pure yield pickup swap](/pureyieldswap), which exploits bonds that have been briefly mispriced, buying bonds that are undervalued relative to similar types of bonds held in the portfolio, in this manner paying a higher yield, and selling those in the portfolio that are overrated, which, subsequently, pay a lower yield. The swap includes trading lower-coupon bonds for higher coupon bonds, expanding the [reinvestment risk](/reinvestmentrisk) looked by the investor when interest rates decline since almost certainly, the high-coupon [bond will be "called"](/callablebond) by the issuer. There is additionally some risk confronted on the off chance that interest rates go up. For example in the event that common rates in the economy go up while the transaction is in progress or over the holding period of the bond, the investor might cause a loss.

The yield pickup strategy is placed into just to generate higher yields. An investor doesn't have to hypothesize or foresee the movement of interest rates. This strategy brings about advantageous gains whenever carried out appropriately and with perfect timing.
