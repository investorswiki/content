## What Is Cash Available for Debt Service (CADS)?

In the financial world, cash accessible for debt service (CADS) is a ratio that measures the amount of cash a company has close by comparative with its [debt service](/debtservice) obligations due inside one calendar year.

## Understanding Cash Available for Debt Service (CADS)

Cash accessible for debt service (CADS) is communicated as a straight numeral. A CADS ratio under 1 shows a company can't pay its debts, while a ratio at 1 means it can meet its obligations — yet just barely: Doing so will leave it with no immediate funds close by. A ratio over 1 demonstrates the company can service its debt and have money left finished. Many sound companies or projects have three-figure CADS.

CADS is frequently utilized in [project finance](/projectfinance), a cost-benefit analysis of the complete life-cycle of a long-term project or investment to determine on the off chance that it is plausible, and will create sufficient cash to cover its costs — to pay for itself, as it were.

CADS is calculated by netting out revenue, operating expenditure, capital expenditure, tax, and working capital adjustments. It helps measure and determine different other debt repayment estimations and ratios, including [debt service coverage ratio](/dscr) (DSCR), [loan life coverage ratio](/llcr) (LLCR), and project life coverage ratio (PLCR).

Cash flows accessible for debt service frequently supplant [EBITDA](/ebitda) (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization) in these estimations. CADS is viewed as a better indicator of a project's ability to repay debt since it considers the timing of cash flows and the effects of taxes.

> CADS ought not be mistaken for its soundalike CAD. In the investment world, [CAD](/cash-accessible for-distribution) means "cash accessible for distribution," and it alludes to a real estate investment trust's ([REIT](/reit)) cash close by that is accessible to be distributed as shareholder dividends.

## Ascertaining Cash Available for Debt Service (CADS)

Cash accessible for debt service (CADS) can be calculated in maybe one or two ways. Two are especially common. Both set up a cash flow [waterfall](/waterfallpayment) model, a kind of balance sheet-cum-plan that portrays approaching revenues, active expenditures, and the timing of payments to various creditors or to service various debts.

### CADS Using Revenue
- Begin with EBITDA
- Adjust for changes in net working capital
- Take away spending on capital expenditures
- Adjust for value and debt financing
- Deduct taxes

### CADS Using Receipts from Customers
- Begin with receivables from clients
- Take away payments to providers and workers
- Take away [royalties](/sovereignty)
- Take away spending on capital expenditures
- Take away taxes

## Special Considerations

Lenders favor loaning money to companies that brag high CADS ratios. The explanation is simple: The higher the ratio is, the greater the cash cushion a company needs to service its debts, and the more uncertain it is to default on its outstanding loans. In short, the higher the CADS ratio, the safer the loan.

Then again, shareholders generally favor companies they invest in to introduce optimal CADS ratios — which are essentially the highest ratios. Too high a ratio could demonstrate a company is perched on too much money, and not spending in an intelligent way — it proposes the firm is static, and not extending. An optimal CADS means the firm is on a secure financial balance and has strong management that figures out the effective sending of cash for capital expenditures, dividend payments, and share repurchases — everything that keep a business robust.

Rather than showing up on a company's balance sheet, CADS ratios might show up as [covenants](/contract) in debt agreements with lenders, as do DSCRs and different obligations.
