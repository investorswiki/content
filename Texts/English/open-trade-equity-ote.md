# Open Trade Equity (OTE)
## What Is Open Trade Equity (OTE)?

Open Trade Equity (OTE) is the net of unrealized gain or loss on open derivatives positions. Put in an unexpected way, OTE is the paper gains and losses addressed by the current market value and the price paid (or received) for a position. When the position is closed, the gain or loss will become [realized](/realizedprofit).

## Figuring out Open Trade Equity

OTE is particularly important for [margin](/margin) investors as changes impact the accessible equity in their account. On the off chance that the unrealized losses make the accessible equity drop below their contracted [maintenance margin](/maintenancemargin) then a [margin call](/margincall) is issued where the investor is forced to deposit extra funds to bring the accessible equity back over the contracted maintenance margin or liquidate all or a portion of their open positions.

Since maintenance margins are contracted with a broker, investors legally will undoubtedly keep up with their margins. In the event an investor can't or reluctant to deposit cash or sell holdings at the hour of a margin call, their brokerage is enabled to close open positions from their client's portfolio at their caution to reestablish the account to its base value.

Open Trade Equity (OTE) measures the difference between the initial trade price of all [open positions](/vacant position) and the last traded price of every one of those positions. The term is derived from the way that the laid out positions have not yet been offset. It is helpful in furnishing the trader with an accurate snapshot of the genuine value of an account as all open positions are [marked-to-market](/marktomarket). At the end of the day, how much equity (money) is in the account assuming every one of the positions were closed at the overall market rates.

## Illustration of OTE

For example, say a trader has $10,000 in an account and uses it to purchase 50 shares of XYZ at $200 per share. The total investment is $10,000 and the OTE at the occurrence of the trade being executed is zero. The next day the value of each share increments to $250. Presently the trader has $2,500 in [unrealized gains](/unrealizedgain) in that trade, and that means that the OTE for that holding is additionally up $2,500 and the total equity in the account really depends on $12,500. If they somehow managed to liquidate this position then the gains are said to have been realized; the account balance would have increased by $2,500 to $12,500, and the OTE would be zero.

In the event that one doesn't liquidate the position and the price drops to $100, they would cause a $5,000 [unrealized loss](/unrealizedloss) on that holding. Except if the position is sold or closed, this loss stays unrealized yet the OTE is negative $5,000 and the total account equity is down to $5,000. A negative OTE demonstrates a [paper loss](/paperprofitorloss); a positive OTE shows a paper gain.

## Open Trade Equity at Margin Call

The [Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA)](/finra) expects that any investor wishing to open a margin account must start with something like $2,000 in cash or securities. FINRA expects that the investor consent to a maintenance margin of no less than 25%, implying that the investor must keep an account balance of something like 25% of the total market value of the securities held in the account consistently. Typically this maintenance margin is contracted at a higher percentage, and it is common practice for maintenance margins to be 30% or more.

For example, an investor needs to buy 500 shares of a stock trading at $20/share. They don't have the $10,000 expected to do this so they open a $5,000 account with a half initial broker margin and a 35% maintenance margin requirement. Investor purchases $10,000 worth of shares which means that they have borrowed $5,000 from the broker. At the case of execution, the OTE is zero, total value of investment is $10,000, initial margin is $5,000 (half x $10,000) and the maintenance margin is $3,500 (35% x $10,000).

The price starts to decline to where the total value of 500 shares tumbles to $6,000, and that means that the OTE is negative $4,000. The $5,000 that the investor put up as margin is currently worth $3,000 ($5,000 - half x $4,000). This is below the $3,500 maintenance margin requirement so the investor gets a margin call.

Right now, the investor will be required to put aside an installment into the margin account to fulfill the half requirement, in this case $2,000. This can appear as a cash deposit or marginable securities. They may likewise decide to write off the investment by liquidating all or a portion of their open positions in this way lessening their margin requirements. This generally brings about understanding a loss on their trade.

## Features
- A positive OTE works on the chances of understanding a profit while a negative OTE raises the chances of understanding a loss.
- Open Trade Equity (OTE) addresses the amount of an unrealized gain or loss on a vacant position before it has been closed out.
- OTE is helpful in giving traders a better picture of their real p&l, particularly when trades are margined.
