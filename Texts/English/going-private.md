# Going Private
## What Is Going Private?

The term going private alludes to a transaction or series of transactions that convert a [publicly traded](/publiccompany) company into a private entity. When a company goes private, its shareholders are as of now not able to trade their shares in the open market.

There are several types of going private transactions, including private equity buyouts, management buyouts, and tender offers.

## How Going Private Works

A company typically goes private when its shareholders conclude that presently not critical benefits to are being a public company.

One way for this change to happen is for the company to be acquired through a private equity buyout. In this transaction, a private equity firm will buy a controlling share in the company, frequently utilizing huge measures of debt. In doing as such, the private equity firm gets these debts against the assets of the company being acquired. The interest and principal payments on the debt are then paid for utilizing the cashflows from the business.

Another common method is the [management buyout](/mbo) transaction, in which the company is taken private by its own management team. The structure of a management buyout is like that of a private equity buyout, in that both depend on large measures of debt. Nonetheless, not at all like a private equity buyout, a management buyout is embraced by "insiders" who are now personally acquainted with the business.

Now and again, going private transactions will likewise include seller financing, in which the owners of the company (in this case, the shareholders of the publicly traded corporation) assist the new buyers with financing the purchase. In practice, this generally comprises of allowing the buyer to defer payment of a portion of the purchase price for some period of time, like five years.

One more common instance of going private transactions is a [tender offer](/tenderoffer). This happens when a company or individual makes a public offer to buy most or all of a company's shares. Now and again, tender offers are made (and accepted) even when the current management team of the target company doesn't maintain that the company should be sold. In this situation, the tender offer is alluded to as a [hostile takeover](/hostiletakeover).

Since the entity advancing the tender offer can be a public corporation, tender offers are many times financed utilizing a combination of cash and shares. For instance, Company A could make a tender offer to Company B in which the shareholders of Company B would receive 80% of the offer in cash and 20% in shares of Company A.

## Real World Example of a Going Private Transaction

In December 2015, the private-equity group JAB Holding Company announced its plans to gain Keurig Green Mountain. Not at all like numerous private-equity buyouts, this was a [all-cash offer](/all-cash-bargain).

The offer priced the shares at $92, an almost 80% premium over their market value prior to the announcement. Obviously, share prices rose dramatically following the announcement and the company accepted the offer presently.

The transaction was completed in March of the next year. As needs be, the company's shares stopped trading on the stock market and Keurig Green Mountain turned into a private company.
