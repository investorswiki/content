# Shotgun Clause
## What Is a Shotgun Clause?

A shotgun clause is a special provision that might be utilized in a [partnership](/partnership) to force a partner to sell their stake or buy out an offering partner. In effect, it is both a form of dispute resolution and a pricing mechanism.

Most frequently, a shotgun clause is utilized to force a partner (or partners) into one or the other buying out an offering partner or selling their shares to the offering partner. A shotgun clause might be written into a partnership's shareholder agreement and is here and there alluded to as a "buy-sell agreement."

## Grasping Shotgun Clause

A shotgun clause might occur with a shareholder offering to buy the shares of different partners at a specific price. The target shareholders then, at that point, have the option either accepting the offer and selling their shares or buying out the starting shareholder at the predetermined price.

The shotgun clause may likewise work in reverse when a shareholder offers to sell their shares to different shareholders at a specific price. The target shareholders may then pick either buying out the starting shareholder or selling their shares to them. After a shotgun clause is enacted, the timetable for the completion can be under a month to just a couple of months long.

Since the investor initially offering the shares can't be certain if the shares will be purchased or dismissed, the predetermined price must be thought about carefully. All things considered, a dismissal of the offering makes an obligation for the offering party to buy the partner's portion at similar price at which they were initially ready to sell.
