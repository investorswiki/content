# Helicopter Drop (Helicopter Money)
## What Is a Helicopter Drop (Helicopter Money)?

A helicopter drop alludes to a term originally begat by [Milton Friedman](/milton-friedman) as a logical gadget intended to abstract away the effects of any [monetary policy](/monetarypolicy) transmission components in a psychological study with respect to the expansion of cash to the bank accounts of all residents — as though dropped from a helicopter overnight.

In recent many years this term has come to allude to a non-literal application of Friedman's similitude, as a type of monetary stimulus strategy that increases the quantity of the money supply and directly conveys cash to the public to prod [inflation](/inflation) — or rising prices — and economic growth. Helicopter drop policies have turned into a common feature of the response from policymakers to large scale [economic shocks](/economic-shock) beginning around 2000.

## Understanding a Helicopter Drop (Helicopter Money)

A helicopter drop is an expansionary fiscal or monetary policy that is financed by an increase in an economy's [money supply](/moneysupply). It very well may be an increase in spending or a tax cut, yet it includes printing large amounts of money and distributing it to the public to invigorate the economy. Generally, the term "helicopter drop" is largely a representation for unconventional measures to kick off the economy during [deflationary](/deflation) periods, which comprise of falling prices.

While "helicopter drop" was first referenced by noted economist Milton Friedman, it acquired fame after former [Federal Reserve](/federalreservebank) (Fed) Chair [Ben Bernanke](/benbernanke) made a passing reference to it in a November 2002 discourse, when he was another Fed lead representative. That single reference earned Bernanke the sobriquet of "Helicopter Ben" — the moniker that remained with him during quite a bit of his tenure as a Fed member and chair.

Bernanke's reference to a "helicopter drop" happened in a discourse that he made to the National Economists Club about measures that could be utilized to combat deflation. In that discourse, Bernanke defined deflation as a result of a collapse in [aggregate demand](/aggregatedemand), or such an extreme curtailment in [consumer spending](/consumer-spending) that producers would need to cut prices on a continuous basis to track down purchasers. He likewise said the effectiveness of hostile to deflation policy could be enhanced by cooperation among monetary and fiscal specialists and alluded to a broad-based tax cut as "basically equivalent to Milton Friedman's renowned 'helicopter drop' of money."

Bernanke's faultfinders hence utilized this reference to stigmatize his economic policies, however others contend that his treatment of the U.S. economy during and after the [Great Recession](/great-recession) of 2008-09 was effective. Confronted with the greatest recession since the 1930s, and with the U.S. economy near the precarious edge of catastrophe, Bernanke utilized a portion of exactly the same methods illustrated in his 2002 discourse to combat the stoppage, for example, growing the scale and scope of the Fed's asset purchases — a policy known as [quantitative easing](/quantitative-easing) (QE).

## Instances of a Helicopter Drop

Japan, which confronted stale growth all through the 21st century, played with the possibility of helicopter money in 2016. Indeed, Bernanke was at the very front of the discussion when he met with Japanese prime clergyman Shinzo Abe and Bank of Japan's Haruhiko Kuroda to talk about additional monetary policy options, one of which was giving large scale, long-dated [perpetual bonds](/perpetualbond). In the resulting months, Japan didn't officially carry out a helicopter drop yet rather settled on additional large scale asset purchases.

A remarkable recent illustration of a helicopter drop policy is the direct-to-taxpayers stimulus payments made by the Trump administration, combined with simultaneous QE by the Fed, in response to the economic crisis induced by different government lockdowns of the economy during the COVID-19 pandemic. Initial payments of $1,200 per taxpayer were authorized under the CARES Act in March 2020. One more round of stimulus containing $600 payments was then passed in December of 2020.

## The Fed and the COVID-19 Pandemic

Some could contend that the Fed's stimulus measures in response to the COVID-19 pandemic and the subsequent recession could be viewed as helicopter drop money. In response to the economic hardship facing the United States, the Fed found a way extraordinary ways to settle the [financial markets](/financial-market) and the banking system as well as offer direct help to small organizations. The outcome was an injection of trillions of dollars into the U.S. economy.

The Fed's stimulus actions were carried out through different facilities, including the accompanying:

### Paycheck Protection Program

The Paycheck Protection Program Liquidity Facility (PPPLF) was laid out to assist small organizations with keeping workers on their payroll. The Fed supplied money or liquidity to participating financial institutions with the goal that the banks would be able, thus, loan the money to small organizations. Since the money must be reimbursed, it probably won't be the most perfect illustration of helicopter money, however repayment presently can't seem to be completed.

### Central avenue Lending Program

The Main Street Lending Program, which included five credit facilities, was laid out to support and give loans to both small and medium sized companies that were financially solid before the COVID-19 pandemic. The program ended on January 8, 2021.

### Corporate Bond Purchases

One of the Fed's programs, in a joint effort with the U.S. Department of the Treasury, made a facility to directly purchase existing [investment-grade](/investmentgrade) corporate bonds of U.S. companies. The facility was called the Secondary Market Corporate Credit Facility (SMCCF) and addressed the initial time in the Fed's history that the central bank bought corporate bonds and exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that contained bonds.

The Fed's purchases decreased the outstanding supply of [bonds](/bond), empowering companies to issue new bonds to raise capital or funds. Stimulative actions of infusing money into the economy by buying bonds and the issuance of loans expanded the Fed's [balance sheet](/balancesheet) from $4.7 trillion on March 17, 2020, to more than $7.3 trillion by January 5, 2021.
