## What Are Cleared Funds?

Cleared funds are the cash balances in an account that are able to be immediately removed or utilized in financial transactions. Until funds are viewed as cleared funds they are viewed as pending, and investors or customers will be unable to conduct [transactions](/transaction) with them.

A check goes through when funds are moved from the check writer's bank to the bank of the person depositing the check that was written. Assuming the check writer and depositor utilize a similar bank, this might possibly occur around the same time.

At the point when a person receives a check and deposits it, the bank getting the deposit makes a request to the bank that houses the account the check was written from. [Intermediary banks](/financialintermediary), clearinghouses, or the [Federal Reserve](/federalreservebank) may aid the transaction. This can require some investment. Frequently, bigger deposits might require a more extended period of time to clear than more modest ones, particularly in the event that the size of the deposit requires a financial institution to consent to government regulations.
