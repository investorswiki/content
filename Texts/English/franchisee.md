## Franchisee Example: McDonald's

A company that has a global presence due to its franchises is the inexpensive food behemoth, Mcdonald's. McDonald's was established in 1940 by the McDonald brothers in San Bernardino, California.

(MCD) — in 1955 in Des Plaines, Illinois (a suburb of Chicago).

At fiscal year-end 2020, there were 39,198 McDonald's eateries in 119 countries around the world, 93.17% of which were franchised. In this way, the company has 36,521 franchisees. The company's long-term goal is for 95% of McDonald's caf\u00e9s to be owned by franchisees.

As part of the contractual agreement with the company the franchisee provides a portion of the capital required by making an initial investment in the equipment, seating, stylistic layout, and signs in the location that the company will give. For would-be franchisees, McDonald's requires an initial down payment of 25% (of the total cost) for the purchase of an existing eatery; and something like 25% of the down payment must be in cash.
