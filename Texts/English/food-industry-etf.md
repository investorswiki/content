# Food Industry ETF
## What Is a Food Industry ETF?

A food-industry [ETF](/etf) is an exchange-traded fund investing in food and refreshment companies. This broad industry covers household consumer staples, restaurants, socially conscious food-related companies, supermarkets, and food distribution companies.

A few specialists accept that investing in food and refreshment companies is resistant to downturn, as regardless of what the state of the economy, these sectors will continue to profit. While that might be true with essential consumer staples, that is not really been true with restaurants, as the COVID-19 pandemic has clarified. Nonetheless, as the economy recovers over the course of the next couple of years, some food and drink companies, and thusly by extension, ETFs that track them, ought to benefit.

## Grasping a Food Industry ETF

As with other indexed[ ETFs](/index-etf), a food industry ETF expects to match the investment performance of its underlying index. A couple of ETFs invest exclusively in this sector. In any case, food and drink companies account for a large extent of the holdings of [consumer staples](/consumerstaples) ETFs, which dwarf food and refreshment ETFs.

The sector encompasses companies that production and convey a great many food and refreshments, alcohol, and cigarettes. Subsectors can run the range, including wheat and grains, sugar, [coffee](/csce), and domesticated animals. Additionally remembered for the food industry sector are U.S. inexpensive food chains with a global presence, similar to Mcdonald's, Pizza Hut, and Starbucks. What's more, companies selling alcoholic beverages like wine and beer may be remembered for a food and drink ETF, such s the First Trust Nasdaq Food and Beverage ETF.

ETFs that might benefit from higher food prices incorporate the Invesco DB Agricultural Fund, the Teucrium Agricultural Fund, and the Invesco Dynamic Food and Beverage ETF, according to a recent **Zacks** article.

## The Pandemic Impact on the Food Industry

Before the Covid-19 pandemic, the restaurant industry had been a developing sector, offering new ETFs for investors hoping to capitalize on a changing industry molded by an upsurge in consumer adoption of new technology, similar to food delivery service DoorDash, and Instacart. In summer 2021, restaurant holdings are rising as the restaurant market bounce back behind additional immunized Americans restless to return to eating outside of their homes.

As countries get out from underneath the financial avalanche brought about by the pandemic, global food prices are on the rise. The Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) Food Price Index, which measures month to month changes for a basket of dairy, meat, cereal, and sugar, hit almost 10-year highs in May 2021, before easing somewhat off those highs in June 2021. A slight decline in June 2021 in the prices of vegetable oils, grains, and dairy was countered by a rise in sugar and meat prices. Regardless, the June 2021 Index was almost 34% higher than the June 2020 Index, showing that pricing pressure remains.

## Special Considerations

Consumer staples by and large perform well in periods of vulnerability, as demand for food doesn't decrease. For instance, in 2018, the Trump administration gave an extreme talk on trade, which started fears of a global [trade war](/trade-war). Those fears prodded investors to shift around portfolios and focus on the consumer staples sector for a safe bet. That shift in the market came after the declining performance among household food industry names like Kellogg Co, Sysco, and McCormick and Co in mid 2018, which hence bounced back.

Quick forward two years to 2020, when the COVID-19 pandemic hit, and these equivalent stocks held consistent as consumers sheltered in place and ate their dinners, including pre-bundled foods, at home. Those stocks are probably going to continue to benefit as the economy recovers in 2021 and then some.
