# Benefits Received Rule
## What is the Benefits Received Rule

The Benefits Received Rule, or benefits received principle, may take one of two related definitions: one as a tax theory; and one as a tax provision. The two definitions are:

1. The Benefits Received Principle, which is a theory of income [tax fairness](/tax_fairness) that says individuals ought to pay taxes in light of the benefits they receive from the government.
1. A tax provision that says a benefactor who receives an unmistakable benefit from making a charitable contribution must deduct the value of that benefit from the amount claimed as an income [tax deduction](/tax-deduction).

## Understanding the Benefits Received Rule

The Benefits Received Rule is believed to be engaging for its apparent fairness in that the people who benefit from a service ought to be the ones who pay for it. In any case, this isn't the manner by which the tax system works in the United States. The U.S. tax system is a "progressive" or "capacity to-pay" system, implying that the people who get more cash-flow will quite often pay taxes at a higher rate and the individuals who get less cash-flow will quite often pay taxes at a lower rate or even receive taxpayer-subsidized benefits while paying no taxes by any means.

An alternative taxation system is a [flat tax](/flattax) system in which everybody pays a similar tax regardless of income, which once more, isn't the way the US tax system works, as the US system is income-based, meaning not every person pays similar amount of taxes.

## Instances of the Benefits Received Rule

Under the main definition of the Benefits Received Principle, allies accept that taxpayers that utilization certain services in lopsided amounts ought to pay higher taxes on those goods or services than taxpayers who don't use them. For instance, taxpayers who own or drive cars ought to pay a bigger number of taxes that go towards road maintenance than taxpayers who don't claim or utilize cars. Be that as it may, it is challenging to separate what goods and services are for a long term benefit and maintenance of the whole nation and in addition to an individual.

Under the second definition of the benefits received rule, an individual must take away their contribution towards a tax deduction to mirror the true value of the contribution. In this way, for instance, on the off chance that Jane bought a $500 ticket to a nonprofit gathering pledges function and received a supper worth $100, she could claim $400 as a [tax deduction](/tax-deduction). This rule, in theory, could assist with curbing endeavors to abstain from paying taxes by giving money for tax deduction motivations.

## Features
