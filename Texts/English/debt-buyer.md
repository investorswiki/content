# Debt Buyer
## What Is a Debt Buyer?

A debt buyer is a company that purchases debt from creditors at a discount. Debt buyers, for example, [collection agencies](/collectionagency) or a private [debt collector](/debt-collector), buy delinquent or charged-off debt for a portion of the debt's face value. The debt buyer then collects on the debt either all alone or through the hiring or a collection agency or resells bits of the debt, or any combination of these alternatives.

## Grasping Debt Buyers

Debt buyers generally pay an extremely low percentage of the face value of the debt â€” in some cases just pennies on the dollar. Debt buyers exist as small, private businesses or large public corporations. They are classified as active on the off chance that they try to collect on the actual debt, or passive assuming they hire an outside collection agency or collection law firm to recuperate the debt. The debt buyer business is an extravagant industry.

Debt buyers fundamentally purchase delinquent debt emerging from credit cards, automobile loans, medical bills, mortgages, retail accounts, and utilities.

## Why Debt Buyers Are Used

In the event that a lender, for example, a mortgage company or financial institution can't collect payment on outstanding debt as per the terms of their funding, they might try to recover a portion of the loss. There are occasions in which a lender sees limited or no opportunity to recuperate the funds inside the time span originally framed when the loan or credit was taken out.

As opposed to keep on trusting that the debtor will pay off the delinquent debt in full, the lender could go to a debt buyer and transfer ownership of that account for a smaller return. Such an option may be taken as an alternative to the debt slipping by into a complete loss for the original lender.

The debt buyer, subsequent to taking ownership of the delinquent accounts, may then seek after various strategies to recover some value. This can incorporate organizing another set of terms for repayment with the debtor or applying new strategies through a collection agency to propel repayment.

The overall approach of the debt buyer is to [leverage](/leverage) the value of the outstanding, delinquent debt to see a return on their investment. The debt buyer might have more flexibility than the original lender in terms of how they approach recuperating funds from the debtor. Moreover, on the grounds that the debtor buyer acquired the debt at discounts that might be basically as low as pennies on the dollar, even small repayments on the accounts can convert into profit for the company.
