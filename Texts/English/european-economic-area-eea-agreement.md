## The EEA versus the EU

The EEA agreement is connected with the [single market](/single-market) and the laws pertinent to it, while the EU is both an economic and political union. Throughout the long term several EFTA members have changed to become EU members, including Austria, Finland, and Sweden.

Switzerland is a member of the EFTA, yet not a member of the EEA, and on second thought has a series of comparative bilateral agreements with the EU. In 2021, Switzerland dismissed a complete treaty with the EU — which would have supplanted these various bilateral agreements — over hesitations in regards to what the treaty would mean for Swiss power and the country's ability to set its own movement policies.

All regulations that EEA countries need to consent to are made by the EU, which really means that the EEA/EFTA countries don't have anything to do with framing the laws they are required to execute. The EEA countries additionally need to make monetary contributions to the EU, however they are more modest than the contributions of EU members.
