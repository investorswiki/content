A few bonds are issued with the attachment of a sinking fund feature. The prospectus for a bond of this type will distinguish the dates that the issuer has the option to recover the bond early utilizing the sinking fund. While the sinking fund assists companies with guaranteeing they have an adequate number of funds set to the side to pay off their debt, at times, they may likewise utilize the funds to repurchase preferred shares or outstanding bonds.

### Lower Default Risk

As such, the amount owed at maturity is substantially less on the off chance that a sinking fund is laid out. Subsequently, a sinking fund assists investors with having some protection in the event of the company's bankruptcy or default.

Accordingly, the company is generally viewed as creditworthy, which can lead to positive [credit ratings](/creditrating) for its debt. Great credit ratings increase the demand for a company's bonds from investors, which is particularly useful in the event that a company needs to issue extra debt or bonds from now on.

On the off chance that the company is performing great, investors are bound to invest in their bonds leading to increased demand and the probability the company could raise extra capital if necessary.

## Callable Bonds

In the event that the bonds issued are [callable](/callablebond), it means the company can retire or pay off a portion of the bonds early utilizing the sinking fund when it seems OK. The bonds are embedded with a call option giving the issuer the right to "call" or buy back the bonds. The prospectus of the bond issue can give subtleties of the callable feature remembering the timing for which the bonds can be called, specific price levels, as well as the number of bonds that are callable. Typically, just a portion of the bonds issued are callable, and the callable bonds are picked by random utilizing their serial numbers.

A callable is typically called at an amount somewhat better than expected value and those called before have a higher call value. For instance, a bond callable at a price of 102 pays the investor $1,020 for each $1,000 in face value, yet expectations could state that the price goes down to 101 following a year.

On the off chance that interest rates decline after the bond's issue, the company can issue new debt at a lower interest rate than the callable bond. The company utilizes the proceeds from the second issue to pay off the callable bonds by practicing the call feature. Subsequently, the company has renegotiated its debt by paying off the higher-yielding callable bonds with the recently issued debt at a lower interest rate.

Likewise, in the event that interest rates decline, which would bring about higher bond prices, the face value of the bonds would be lower than current market prices. In this case, the bonds could be called by the company who recovers the bonds from investors at face value. The investors would lose a portion of their interest payments, bringing about less long-term income.

Companies that are [capital intensive](/capitalintensive) typically issue long-term bonds to fund purchases of new plant and equipment. Oil and gas companies are capital intensive since they require a lot of capital or money to fund long-term operations, for example, oil apparatuses and drilling equipment.

## Real World Example of a Sinking Fund

Suppose for instance that ExxonMobil Corp. (XOM) issued US$20 billion in long-term debt as bonds. Interest payments were to be paid semiannually to bondholders. The company laid out a sinking fund by which $4 billion must be paid to the fund every year to be utilized to pay down debt. By year three, ExxonMobil had paid off $12 billion of the $20 billion in long-term debt.

The company might have selected not to lay out a sinking fund, yet it would have needed to pay out $20 billion from profit, cash, or [retained earnings](/retainedearnings) in year five to pay off the debt. The company would have likewise needed to pay five years of interest payments on the entirety of the debt. In the event that economic conditions had deteriorated or the price of oil fell, Exxon could have had a cash shortfall due to bring down revenues and not had the option to meet its debt payment.

Paying the debt early through a sinking fund saves a company interest expense and prevents the company from being put in financial challenges in the long-term in the event that economic or financial conditions deteriorate. Additionally, the sinking fund permits ExxonMobil the option to borrow more money if necessary. In our model over, suppose by year three, the company expected to issue one more bond for extra capital.
