# Standalone Risk
## What Is Standalone Risk?

Standalone risk is the risk associated with a single operating unit of a company, a company division, or [asset](/asset), rather than a bigger, very much broadened portfolio.

## Grasping Standalone Risk

All financial assets can be analyzed with regards to a more extensive [portfolio](/portfolio) or on an independent basis, when the asset being referred to is believed to be isolated. While a portfolio setting considers the investments as a whole and evaluations while computing [risk](/risk), standalone risk is calculated expecting that the asset being referred to is the main investment that the investor needs to lose or gain.

Standalone risk implies the liabilities made by a specific asset, division, or project. It [risk measures](/riskmeasures) the perils associated with a single feature of a company's operations, or the risks from holding a specific asset, for example, a [closely held corporation](/closely-held-corporation).

For a company, computing standalone risk can assist with deciding a project's risk as though it were operating as an independent entity. The risk wouldn't exist in the event that those operations quit existing. In [portfolio management](/portfoliomanagement), standalone risk measures the risk of an individual asset that can't be decreased through [diversification](/diversification).

Investors might inspect the risk of a standalone asset to foresee the expected return of an investment. Standalone risks must be painstakingly considered on the grounds that as a limited asset, an investor either stands to see a high [return](/return) assuming its value increments or an overwhelming loss in the event that things don't work out as expected.

## Measuring Standalone Risk

Standalone risk can be measured with a total [beta](/beta) calculation or through the [coefficient of variation](/coefficientofvariation) (CV).

### Total Beta

Beta reflects how much [volatility](/volatility) a specific asset will experience relative to the overall market. In the mean time, total beta, which is achieved by eliminating the [correlation coefficient](/correlationcoefficient) from beta, measures the standalone risk of the specific asset without it being part of a very much broadened portfolio.

### The Coefficient of Variation (CV)

The CV is a measure utilized in likelihood theory and statistics that makes a normalized measure of dispersion of a [probability distribution](/probabilitydistribution). In the wake of working out the CV, its value can be utilized to examine an expected return alongside an expected risk value on a standalone basis.

A low CV would demonstrate a higher expected return with lower risk, while a higher value CV would imply a [higher risk and lower expected return](/riskreturntradeoff). The CV is believed to be particularly useful in light of the fact that it is a dimensionless number, intending that, in terms of financial analysis, it doesn't need the inclusion of other risk factors, like market volatility.

## Highlights
- The coefficient of variation (CV), in the interim, shows how much risk is associated with an investment relative to the amount of expected return.
- Total beta checks the volatility of a specific asset on a standalone basis.
- Standalone risk is the risk associated with a single part of a company or a specific asset.
- Standalone risk can't be moderated through diversification.
