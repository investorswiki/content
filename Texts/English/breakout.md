# Breakout
## What Is a Breakout?
A breakout is part of technical analysis that allows investors and analysts to determine whether a security's price will move higher or lower subsequent to penetrating what are known as resistance and support levels. Dissecting a breakout is great for intraday trading and during times of volatility — in which there are large unpredictable swings over a period — in futures and spot price markets on assets and [securities](/security) including stocks, [bonds](/security), foreign exchange, commodities, and cryptocurrency. This article centers around stocks.
Breakout analysis will in general work better during times of short-term [volatility](/volatility) and without news that could somehow cause a sudden change in stock price. Breakouts can be found in the utilization of technical indicators, for example, [relative strength index](/rsi) and moving midpoints.
## The most effective method to Spot a Breakout
Before determining whether a stock will move higher or lower, it's important to comprehend [resistance](/resistance) and support levels. Think of resistance and support as a series of tops and bottoms, or highs and lows, which make roofs and floors on prices.
At the point when a stock has arrived at several comparable highs over a short period of time, those price levels form a resistance level, and when the price approaches that level, it very well may be an indication to sell the stock. In like manner, when a stock arrives at several comparable lows, a [support level](/support) is laid out. As the price approaches that level, it very well may be an indication to buy.
Over a shorter period of time, stocks frequently bounce in a reach between their support and resistance levels (this narrow reach is called a consolidation) before a breakout happens.
On the off chance that a stock's price moves over a laid out resistance level, however, there could be a breakout to more current highs, and the equivalent with fresher lows assuming that it moves below a laid out support level. It's comparative in the approach to understanding the head and shoulders pattern, in which the stock has arrived at a series of pinnacles and makes new lows leading to the possibility of a breakout.
**Note:** When a stock breaks through the support level, it's known as a breakdown. Yet, a few investors and analysts will more often than not use breakout interchangeably with breakdown.
One factor to monitor during a breakout is the volume of trading. A high volume could show that the stock is ready to move past a resistance or support level. Another is money flow — an indicator of the amount of money in buy and sell orders close to the furthest limit of a day's trading — and that could show whether a breakout is probably going to happen. A series of large trades at higher prices might recommend that a stock is breaking through its resistance level.

## Breakout Example: Apple (AAPL)
Above is a [candlestick chart](/candlestick-chart) of Apple's stock from late November 2021 to mid-February 2022. Apple's stock formed resistance and support levels from early December 2021 to mid-January 2022 (this period likewise saw the formation of a head and shoulders pattern). The stock then got through in mid-January to the downside, just as the 14-day RSI indicated it was close to being oversold. A short time later, the stock arrived at a new low, preparing for the creation of new support and resistance levels.
## Are There Different Patterns for a Breakout?
Resistance and support levels don't necessarily in all cases must be parallel to the x-pivot. They can be rakish and have patterns with names like triangle, rectangle, wedge, flag, and pennant. Precisely how resistance and support levels are utilized to forecast breakouts relies upon a financial backer's way of trading.
## What Are the Limitations of Breakout Analysis?
Breakout analysis will in general sort out better during times of volatility without any major news that could influence a stock's price. An earnings report or a macro event, for instance, could influence the heading of stock price.
Furthermore, not all qualities of prices breaking through resistance or support point to a breakout. There could be signals that lead to a false breakout, which would mean a return to the resistance or support level.
