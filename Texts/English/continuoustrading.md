# Continuous Trading
## What Is Continuous Trading?

Continuous trading is a method for executing [security](/security) orders and includes the immediate execution of orders upon receipt by market makers and specialists.

## Figuring out Continuous Trading

Continuous trading forms the basis for a wide range of trades across secondary [exchanges](/trade) in the United States. It very well may be compared to [batch trading](/batchtrading), which is something contrary to continuous trading and happens just at the market open.

Continuous trading happens continuously all through the trading day with immediate execution by [market makers](/marketmaker). Batch trading, then again, includes executing a batch order of trades that have been delayed by unexecuted orders arranged and anticipating execution. Market makers can see the supply and demand from batch orders prior to the market's [open.](/open) Thus, a batch order of trades is executed every day at the market's unguarded with orders that have been set for market maker processing during the market's off hours.

Continuous trading is worked with by the market making process that forms the basis for [secondary market](/secondarymarket) exchanges. Market makers execute trades continuously all through the trading day by matching buyers and sellers. Market makers execute trades that have been submitted for order at a common market price.

The market making process requires a market maker to buy securities from a seller and sell securities to a buyer, matching intrigued buyers and sellers with regards to the open market. This interaction is known as the [bid-ask](/bid-and-ask) process and makes a profit for the market maker. The market maker has the effect in value between the bid and ask price, otherwise called the spread.

## Special Considerations

Investors can submit different types of trade orders. [Market orders](/marketorder) are submitted for continuous trading execution in a split second since the investor will consent to the market price.

Different types of orders are viewed as [conditional orders](/conditionalorder), which are just to be executed after at least one indicated criteria are reached. An investor can set a wide range of types of conditional orders. These orders have a predefined price that is wanted by the investor for execution in the open market.

Consequently, for these orders to be accepted in the market for continuous trading, the price for execution must arrive at the overall market price to be viewed as by a market maker. Hence, while the market is offering continuous trading, a conditional order from an investor may be executed in the continuous trading market when the price is free.

In certain circumstances, an investor may likewise determine whether they wish for their order to be executed in full or somewhat at their ideal price. Certain orders may just execute somewhat due to the availability in continuous trading, while different orders might expect that the whole order be filled.
