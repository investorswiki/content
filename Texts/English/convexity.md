# Convexity
Convexity portrays the relationship among price and yield for a standard, noncallable bond.

Bond prices and yields move in inverse bearings: A bond's yield rises when its price endlessly falls when its price rises.

At the point when the relationship among price and yield is graphed, it creates a line that is bended, or curved, as this graph shows. For more point by point data on convexity, click here.

## Highlights
- On the off chance that a bond's duration increases as yields increase, the bond is said to have negative convexity.
- In the event that a bond's duration rises and yields fall, the bond is said to have positive convexity.
- Convexity is a measure of the shape in the relationship between bond prices and bond yields.
- Convexity demonstrates how the duration of a bond changes as the interest rate changes.
- Convexity is a risk-the board instrument, used to measure and deal with a portfolio's exposure to market risk.
## FAQ
### For what reason Do Interest Rates and Bond Prices Move in Opposite Directions?
As interest rates fall, bond prices rise and vice versa. For instance, assuming market rates rise, or are expected to rise, new bond issues must likewise have higher rates to fulfill investor demand for lending the issuer their money. In any case, the price of bonds returning not exactly that rate will fall as there would be almost no demand for them as bondholders will hope to sell their existing bonds and opt for bonds, undoubtedly more up to date issues, paying higher yields. Ultimately, the price of these bonds with the lower coupon rates will drop to a level where the rate of return is equivalent to the predominant market interest rates.
### What Is Negative and Positive Convexity?
In the event that a bond's duration increases as yields increase, the bond is said to have negative convexity. As such, the bond price will decline by a greater rate with a rise in yields than if yields had fallen. In this manner, on the off chance that a bond has negative convexity, its duration would increase as the price diminished and vice versa.If a bond's duration rises and yields fall, the bond is said to have positive convexity. At the end of the day, as yields fall, bond prices rise by a greater rate — or duration — than if yields rose. Positive convexity prompts greater increases in bond prices. In the event that a bond has positive convexity, it would ordinarily experience bigger price increases as yields fall, compared to price diminishes when yields increase.
### What Is Bond Duration?
Bond duration measures the change in a bond's price when interest rates vary. In the event that the duration is high, it means the bond's price will move the other way to a greater degree than the change in interest rates. On the other hand, when this figure is low the debt instrument will show less movement to the change in interest rates.Essentially, the higher a bond's duration, the bigger the change in its price when interest rates change. At the end of the day, the greater its interest rate risk. Thus, in the event that an investor accepts that a sizable change in interest rates could adversely affect their bond portfolio, they ought to think about bonds with a lower duration.
