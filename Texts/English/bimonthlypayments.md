## What Is a Bimonthly Mortgage?

A bimonthly mortgage payment is a [mortgage](/mortgage) plan in which half of the scheduled regularly scheduled payment is made two times every month. This plan isn't to be mistaken for a biweekly plan, where half of the scheduled regularly scheduled payment is made like clockwork.

Now and again spelled as "every other month" mortgage payments, these plans are commonly set up for the customer to pay on the first and the fifteenth of every month. Under a few bimonthly plans, making extra payments on top of the bimonthly ones is even conceivable.

## Bimonthly Mortgage versus Biweekly Mortgage

The difference between a bimonthly plan and a [biweekly plan](/biweeklymortgage) is inconspicuous. In a biweekly plan, payments are made like clockwork — not exactly equivalent to two payments every month, on the grounds that most months are somewhat longer than about a month.

In particular, a biweekly plan brings about two additional payments being made yearly than on a bimonthly plan. At the end of the day, 24 payments are made yearly on a bimonthly plan, while 26 payments are made yearly on a biweekly plan.

That could seem like a small difference, yet it can truly accumulate throughout the span of a mortgage. Just as a bimonthly mortgage can build equity in your property more rapidly than a month to month plan, a biweekly mortgage can build equity even more rapidly than that. Accordingly, these plans are great for individuals hoping to pay off their mortgage as fast as could be expected.

## Advantages and disadvantages of Bimonthly Mortgages

A bimonthly plan could abbreviate the overall term of the mortgage partially. A few bimonthly mortgages could accompany a higher payment to additionally reduce the interest and principal balance compared with making standard regularly scheduled payments. It could be feasible to switch over completely to a bimonthly mortgage while refinancing under another mortgage, which may be lower to speed up the payment interaction.

A bimonthly mortgage plan will bring about interest savings over the life of the mortgage. It does this by lessening the [principal](/principal) of the mortgage as every payment is received, instead of the primary payment of the month being held by the lender until the second payment of the month is received (at which point the full regularly scheduled payment is made).

Under a bimonthly mortgage, breaking up the payments can cut down the [interest](/interest) that would need to be paid. In any case, the lender might make such a payment option accessible. Besides, a lender could require extra fees to take part in a bimonthly mortgage plan, which could kill any potential savings that could have been acquired.

For certain bimonthly mortgages, the lender could in any case hold the principal payment — another scenario that would kill any savings that could have been acquired. While such a plan would give the borrower greater flexibility by they way they pay off a mortgage, it wouldn't bring about any fiscal benefit. The terms of any bimonthly mortgage ought to characterize when and how the payments will be applied toward the principal balance.

There is banter over how effective bimonthly mortgage plans can be, particularly in light of the fact that most mortgage lenders compute interest as a month to month cost, not a bimonthly cost. In this way, while it is feasible to reduce overall interest due, the final product could amount to the elimination of one payment or a couple.
