# Alternative Documentation
## What Is Alternative Documentation?

Alternative documentation is a documentation interaction intended to speed up loan approval where the lender accepts certain records from the borrower as verification of income made on the loan application.

## Understanding Alternative Documentation

Typical documentation for loans comprises of tax returns or the submission of documentation that is verifiable with a third-party service. Alternative documentation includes the borrower giving an assortment of financial reports that may incorporate W-2s, paycheck stubs, and bank statements. This type of loan is here and there alluded to as an Alt-A loan, although a few lenders may also have their own names for these loans.

Alternative documentation loans are frequently offered exclusively to those with awesome credit. The decision is heavily dependent on the applicant's credit score. These loans frequently offer more flexibility than conventional, traditional loans.

Alternative documentation loans may be a decent option for borrowers with special situations, for example, the self-employed or recently separated. The lender accepts the documentation the borrower gives, without necessarily expecting to go through a tedious course of confirming all of the information. Affirming a borrower's information in this manner is considerably faster than the traditional method of confirming such information with third parties.

Alternative documentation loans became popular in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis. There are a number of reasons for this. They offer a lot easier closing cycle as compared to traditional loans. Alternative documentation loans also appeal to freelancers, an income group whose share of the economy has increased since the crisis. The passage of the ability-to-repay rule, which allows lenders to make completely pure intentions loans based on their assessment of the borrower, also facilitated the rise of alternative documentation loans.

## Alternative Documentation versus SISA Loans

Alternative documentation is a full documentation loan. As such, income, assets, employment, and other financial information is recorded utilizing some form of official paperwork. The documentation required will vary contingent upon the requirements of the lender and perhaps the underwriter.

This is in contrast to a [stated income stated asset](/sisa) (SISA) loan. SISA loans are also known as no income-no asset (NINA) loans or no-documentation loans. In the recent past, SISA loans were also named "liar loans," as they were popular with the people who wanted to obtain loans and other financing by giving false or misleading information. Many specialists blamed the volume of what are referred to as liar loans as a major factor adding to the mortgage crisis of the last 2000s. In wake of the mortgage crisis, lenders and regulators executed stricter rules regarding SISA loans, so borrowers may find it more challenging to obtain a loan via this cycle now.

In spite of their rough history and their part in the mortgage meltdown, SISA loans in all actuality do have a few legitimate purposes and make sense for borrowers in certain situations. They are popular with self-employed individuals or business owners, who frequently discount as many expenses and other allowed deductions as conceivable, which can make their income appear beguilingly low.

There is generally no increase in the interest rate associated with alternative documentation as there typically is with "stated" loans.
