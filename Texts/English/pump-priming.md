## What is Pump Priming?

Pump priming is the action taken to invigorate an economy, ordinarily during a recessionary period, through government spending and interest rate and tax reductions. The term pump priming is derived from the operation of more established pumps - a pull valve must be primed with water so the pump would function appropriately.

## Understanding Pump Priming

Pump priming accepts that the economy must be primed to function appropriately indeed. In such manner, government spending is assumed to animate private spending, which thusly ought to lead to [economic expansion](/expansionary_policy).

## Small Amounts of Government Funds

Pump priming includes introducing moderately small measures of government funds into a depressed economy to prod growth. This is achieved through the increase in purchasing power experienced by those impacted by the injection of funds, fully intent on provoking higher demand for goods and services. The increase in demand experienced through pump priming can lead to increased profitability in the [private sector](/private-sector), which helps with overall economic recovery.

## The Use of Pump Priming in the United States

The phrase "pump priming" originated from President Herbert Hoover's creation of the [Reconstruction Finance Corporation](/rfc) (RFC) in 1932, which was intended to make loans to banks and industry.

Through the RFC and other public works organizations, billions of dollars were spent priming the pump to empower economic growth.

The phrase was seldom utilized in economic policy conversations after World War II, even however programs developed and utilized from that point forward, for example, [unemployment insurance](/unemployment-insurance) and tax cuts, might be viewed as forms of automatic pump primers. Notwithstanding, during the [financial crisis of 2007](/credit-crisis), the term returned into utilization, as interest rate reduction and infrastructure spending were viewed as the best path to economic recovery, alongside tax rebates issued as part of the Economic Stimulus Act of 2008.
