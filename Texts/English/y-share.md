# Y-Share
## What Is a Y-Share?

Y-shares are a [institutional share](/institutionalshares) class offered in open-end mutual funds. Targeting institutional investors, the share class frequently has a high least investment, beginning at approximately $25,000. This share class also offers the benefit of waived or limited load charges and lower comparative total annual fees.

## How Y-Shares Work

Y-shares are an alternative to [I-shares](/institutionalshares) which are in the most commonly offered mutual fund share class for [institutional investors](/institutionalinvestor). Y-shares have features and characteristics that are tailored to institutions.

High least investments are one of the most distinguishable characteristics of Y-shares and other institutional shares classes. Least investments typically begin at $25,000 and can be as high as $5 million. Sales loads are usually not required for Y-shares, which allows institutional investors to buy and sell shares with no added commission charges.

Since Y-shares are not associated with intermediary sales charges, they also usually pay no distribution fees or [12b-1 fees](/12b-1fees) from the fund's expenses. Without 12b-1 fees, the total expense ratios are lower overall than other share classes in the fund, which is another benefit for institutional investors.

## Special Considerations

While Y-shares are typically held for institutional investors, they may allow investment from retirement plan investors now and again. Most [mutual funds](/mutualfund) will have designated retirement share classes with similar benefits to institutional shares.

Funds without retirement share classes may allow pooled fund investments in Y-shares from retirement plans that collectively look for investment in the fund. This can give a significant benefit to retirement shareholders, who might take part in the savings from the share class' lower fees.

## Example of Y-Shares

Putnam Investments is one investment manager that offers Y-shares across many of its funds as the primary share class for institutional investors. The Putnam Global Equity Fund gives one example. The Fund offers [A-shares](/a-shares), B-shares, C-shares, M-shares, R-shares, R6-shares, T-shares, and Y-shares.

The Putnam Global Equity Fund's Y-share class charges no front-end or back-end sales commissions. The share class also charges no 12b-1 fees, which assists it with having one of the least annual expense ratios in the Fund at 0.90%. This compares to total annual fund operating expenses of 1.9% for the B-shares and C-shares.

Performance for the Y-shares as of March 30, 2020, was also one of the highest in the Fund throughout the previous five years at 5.81%.
