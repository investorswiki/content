# Article 50
## What Is Article 50?

Article 50 is a clause in the [European Union's](/europeanunion) (EU) Lisbon Treaty that frames the moves toward be taken by a country seeking to deliberately leave the coalition. Conjuring Article 50 launches the proper exit process and permits countries to formally proclaim their goal to leave the EU. The United Kingdom was the principal country to conjure Article 50 after a majority of British electors chose for leave the union in 2016.

## How Article 50 Works

Article 50 is part of the [Lisbon Treaty](/lisbon-treaty), which was marked and endorsed by every one of the 27 member states of the European Union in 2007 and happened in 2009. The article frames how a member nation might leave the EU intentionally. As verified over, the article states: "Any member state might choose to pull out from the union as per its own constitutional requirements."

As indicated by the article's text:

1. Any Member State might choose to pull out from the Union as per its own constitutional requirements.
1. A Member State which chooses to pull out will inform the European Council of its goal. In the illumination of the rules given by the European Council, the Union will arrange and finish up an agreement with that State, setting out the arrangements for its withdrawal, assessing the system for its future relationship with the Union. That agreement will be negotiated as per Article 218(3) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. It will be finished up in the interest of the Union by the Council, acting by a qualified majority, in the wake of getting the consent of the European Parliament.
1. The Treaties will cease to apply to the State being referred to from the date of entry into force of the withdrawal agreement or, bombing that, two years after the warning alluded to in section 2, except if the European Council, in agreement with the Member State concerned, collectively chooses to expand this period.
1. For the reasons for sections 2 and 3, the member of the European Council or of the Council addressing the pulling out Member State will not participate in that frame of mind of the European Council or Council or in choices concerning it.

A qualified majority will be defined as per Article 238(3)(b) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union.
1. On the off chance that a State which has removed from the Union requests to rejoin, its request will be subject to the methodology alluded to in Article 49.

## Special Considerations

Article 50 turned into a subject of serious discussion during the [European sovereign debt crisis](/european-sovereign-debt-crisis) of 2010 to 2014 when Greece's economy had all the earmarks of being spiraling crazy. While trying to save the euro and maybe the EU from imploding, leaders considered [expelling Greece from the eurozone](/grexit).

The problem they experienced with Article 50 was that there was no reasonable guidance for pushing a member state out despite its desire to the contrary. Nor was it important to eliminate Greece from the EU — just from the eurozone. Greece was eventually able to agree with its EU [creditors](/bank).

## Starting points of Article 50

The European Union started in 1957 as the European Economic Community, which was made to foster economic relationship among its members in the outcome of World War II. The original alliance included six European countries: the Netherlands, France, Belgium, West Germany, Luxembourg, and Italy. They were joined by the U.K., Denmark, and Ireland in 1973. The EU was officially made by the [Maastricht Treaty](/maastricht-treaty) in 1992, and by 1995 the alliance expanded to 15 members covering the whole of Western Europe. From 2004 to 2007, the EU encountered its biggest ever expansion, taking on 12 new members that included former Communist states.

The Lisbon Treaty was drafted with the end goal of upgrading the proficiency and vote based authenticity of the Union and to working on the soundness of its action. The treaty was marked and sanctioned by each of the 27 member states in 2007 and happened in 2009. The treaty is partitioned into two parts — the Treaty on European Union (TEU) and the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). It has 358 articles altogether including Article 50.

The creator of the provision didn't originally view it as being important. "Assuming you stopped paying the bills and you stopped turning up at the gatherings, in due course your friends would notice that you appeared to have left," the Scottish peer Lord Kerr of Kinlochard told the BBC in November 2016. He viewed Article 50 as being possibly valuable in the event of an upset, which would lead the EU to suspend the impacted country's membership: "I felt that by then the despot being referred to may be cross to the point that he'd say 'right, I'm off' and it would be great to have a methodology under which he could leave."

## Illustration of Article 50

The main country to conjure Article 50 was the United Kingdom, which left the EU on Jan. 31, 2020. It came after a majority of British residents casted a ballot to leave the union and seek after [Brexit](/brexit) in a mandate on June 23, 2016, leading British Prime Minister Theresa May to summon the article on March 29, 2017.

The interaction was soiled by missed cutoff times, extensions, [negotiations](/discussion), and hindrances put forward by both British and EU leaders. May's endeavors for an agreement were dismissed by parliament. Dealings were reestablished by Boris Johnson, who became prime pastor after May surrendered.

The country started a 11-month progress period following its departure from the coalition. Subsequent to leaving the Union, there were no British authorities in the European Parliament, and the U.K. lost its denial right inside the EU. Be that as it may, the two parties actually needed to figure out another trade agreement. There were as yet many issues to determine during the change period, including:

- Issues connected with benefits
- How the two players would handle law enforcement and security cooperation
- Access to shared fisheries
- Customs and border controls between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland
- Tariffs and other trade obstructions

One big reason to worry was the issue of EU nationals moving to the U.K. or then again vice versa. Prior to Brexit, an estimated 3,000,000 EU nationals lived, worked, or concentrated in the U.K., while 1,000,000 U.K. nationals did likewise in the remainder of the EU. Nationals were permitted to cross borders during the change period yet were afterward subject to visa requirements.

Talks went on during the progress period, in spite of many stops and roadblocks. On Dec. 24, 2020, the different sides at last announced a trade deal that would supplant the EU's [single market](/single-market) and its customs union with respect to the United Kingdom. The EU-UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement was endorsed on Dec. 30 and provisionally entered force on Jan. 1. In any case, it was not completely sanctioned until the next April. The new trade agreement completely entered force on May 1, 2021.
