## What Are Surrender Rights?

Surrender rights allude to the ability to cancel a [annuity](/annuity) or life insurance contract in exchange for its cash value. Surrendering such a contract early can cause [surrender charges](/surrendercharge), which are fees charged by the company upon cancellation, as well as income tax liability.

## Understanding Surrender Rights

Surrender rights are the right of contract holders to cancel a policy in exchange for its cash value. Before practicing a contract's surrender rights, contract holders ought to decide the contract's cash value, what fees and taxes will be incurred upon surrender, and how much cash they will at last net from canceling the contract.

On account of life insurance, getting a [life settlement](/life_settlement) in exchange for the life insurance contract might be a more lucrative option than surrendering the policy. Contract holders ought to likewise keep as a primary concern that in the event that they decide to repurchase a comparative contract later on, the new contract might be more costly, and not all annuities and life insurance policies have surrender rights.

## Ramifications of Surrendering a Contract

On the off chance that a policyholder surrenders a life insurance contract, for instance, the life insurance company pays the surrender amount to the policy owner, notwithstanding, the sum might be taxable, in this manner influencing the policyholder's [taxable income](/taxableincome). As a rule, premiums invested in the policy are not taxable. Nonetheless, the policy's returns through cash value, or the amount invested in an investment account that generates returns, are taxable. Surrendering a policy will end the life insurance coverage and end all rights and [riders](/rider) in the contract.

Another element policyholders ought to consider before surrendering a contract is whether such an action would carry a [surrender fee](/surrenderfee). A surrender fee is a charge demanded against an investor for the early withdrawal of funds from an insurance or annuity contract, or for the cancellation of the agreement.

Surrender fees can apply for different time spans, going from 30 days to upwards of 15 years on a few annuity and insurance products. Surrender fees change among insurance companies and among annuity and insurance contracts. A 10% charge demanded upon the funds contributed to the contract for withdrawal in the primary year is a really normal surrender fee. For each successive year of the contract, the surrender fee could drop by one percentage point, for instance, successfully giving the [annuitant](/annuitant) the option of no-penalty withdrawal following 10 years in the contract.

Even however surrender fees commonly decline over the long run, a decreasing surrender fee may as yet bring about a bigger penalty on the off chance that the investment has developed over the long run. For instance, a 10% fee applied to $100 is just $10, yet in the event that that $100 develops to $1,000 and the fee tumbles to 5%, the surrender fee would rise to $50.

## Illustration of Surrender Rights
