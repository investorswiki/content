# Cap
## What Is a Cap?

A cap is an interest rate limit on a [variable rate](/variableinterestrate) credit product. It is the highest conceivable rate a borrower might need to pay and furthermore the highest rate a creditor can earn. Interest rate cap terms will be illustrated in a lending contract or investment prospectus. Common types of capped interest rate products incorporate adjustable-rate mortgages (ARMs) and floating-rate bonds.

## Grasping Caps

A cap is an important part of the terms of a variable credit product. Borrowers and investors pick variable-rate credit products to exploit changes in market interest rates. A cap puts down a boundary on the amount of interest a borrower possesses to pay and how much a creditor can earn.

### Variable-Rate Cap Products

Products with a capped [interest rate](/interestrate) have a variable rate structure that incorporates an indexed rate and a spread. An indexed rate is based on the most reduced rate creditors will offer. The spread or margin is based on a borrower's credit not entirely set in stone by the underwriter.

On the off chance that a product has a capped rate, the interest rate will rise with increases in the indexed rate until it arrives at a predefined cap. The cap is advantageous for borrowers since it limits the level of interest they need to pay in a rising rate environment.

Credit products frequently structured with capped interest rates incorporate floating-rate bonds. At times, creditors might wish to structure a variable rate [bond](/bond) offering with an interest rate cap. An interest rate cap benefits the bond issuer since it assists with limiting their cost of capital when interest rates rise. For investors, a rate cap limits the return on a bond to a specific level.

Generally, floating-rate bond products are not impacted by standard market pricing instruments when rates rise on the grounds that their interest rate levels are not fixed. In any case, in the event that a bond has an interest rate cap, the cap could adversely influence the secondary market price when the cap is reached, decreasing the trading value.

### Cap versus Floor

Variable interest rate products can have both a cap and a floor. A cap limits the interest a borrower or bond issuer pays in a rising rate environment and sets a maximum level of return for the lender or investor. A [floor](/floor) sets a base level of interest that a borrower must pay and furthermore sets a base level of interest that a lender or investor can hope to earn.

A floor benefits the lender or credit investor in a falling rate environment. Limiting the interest base level, in any case, requires a borrower to pay a predetermined floor interest rate even when the current market rate is lower.

## Illustration of Interest Rate Cap

A [adjustable-rate mortgage (or ARM)](/arm) is one of the most outstanding instances of an interest rate cap in a lending setting. In an adjustable-rate mortgage, borrowers pay a fixed rate of interest in the initial not many long periods of the loan and afterward a variable rate after that. This variable not entirely settled by an underlying benchmark rate; when the benchmark rate increases or diminishes, the interest rate on the loan can change as needs be.

Some adjustable-rate mortgages might have rates that can change whenever, while others have rates that reset at a specific time span. In the variable rate period of the ARM, a cap can be founded at a specific level.

For instance, say you buy a home with a 7/1 ARM that has a 5/2/5 cap structure. For the initial seven years of the loan, your interest rate will stay unchanged. In any case, in the eighth year, your mortgage rate can increase by up to five percentage points. In each subsequent year, your rate can increase by two percentage points yet your total rate increase can't surpass 5% for the life of the loan.

> ### Note
> No matter what the time span for reasonable increases, the rate can not be changed to a level that surpasses its cap on the off chance that one has been organized in the [credit agreement](/creditagreement) terms.

## How Is Interest Rate Cap Determined?

Rate cap pricing not set in stone by a number of factors, including:

- Interest rate assumptions
- Interest rate unpredictability
- Loan terms
- Borrower credit rating

There are additionally unique rate cap structures lenders can apply. With adjustable-rate mortgages, for example, lenders utilize any of the following:

- **Initial adjustment cap.** This cap structure decides how much the interest on an ARM can increase whenever it first changes after the fixed-rate period closes. It's frequently capped at 2% or 5%.
- **Subsequent adjustment cap.** This cap structure determines how much a loan's interest rate can increase following the initial adjustment period. Once more, 2% is a common threshold for this rate cap structure.
- **Lifetime adjustment cap.** Finally, this rate cap directs how much the interest rate can increase altogether, over the life of the loan. This frequently maximizes at 5%.

> In the event that you're buying a home utilizing an adjustable-rate mortgage, make certain to peruse your loan estimate and closing disclosure carefully to ensure you comprehend your loan costs and how your rate cap functions.

Adjustable-rate mortgages can utilize different benchmark rates to decide rate cap. The Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) endorses the utilization of these index options on FHA-safeguarded ARM loan transactions:

- Consistent Maturity Treasury (CMT) index (week by week average yield of U.S. Treasury securities, adjusted to a consistent maturity of one year)
- 1-year London Interbank Offered Rate [(LIBOR)](/libor)

Notwithstanding which index your lender utilizes, the main thing to recall is that as this rate changes, your mortgage rate can follow suit.
