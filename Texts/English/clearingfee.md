# Clearing Fee
## What Is a Clearing Fee?

A clearing fee is a charge assessed on securities transactions by a [clearing house](/clearinghouse) for finishing transactions utilizing its own facilities. It is most frequently associated with the trading of futures and incorporates all actions from the time a commitment is made to the time a transaction is settled.

[Transaction](/transaction) fees frequently incorporate both a [brokerage fee](/brokerage-fee) and a clearing fee, yet only from time to time incorporate a delivery fee, since the actual delivery of the underlying asset in a future contract is rare. The actual clearing fee cost can be variable, as it depends on the type and size of the transaction. The fees are given to the brokers by the exchange where the transaction was led.

## How a Clearing Fee Works

To earn a clearing fee, a clearing house acts as a third-party to a trade. From the buyer, the clearing house gets cash, and from the seller, it gets securities or futures contracts. It then, at that point, deals with the exchange, consequently gathering a clearing fee for doing as such. In the present automated, high-speed trading world, the requirement for clearing is many times underestimated, yet the presence of the clearing house and its job makes it feasible for traders and investors to refute the worry that the party on the opposite side of their trade will some way or another nullify the effects of their trade by acting in dishonesty.

A clearing fee is a [variable cost](/variablecost), as the total amount of the fee might rely upon the size of the transaction, the level of service required, or the type of instrument being traded. Investors who create several transactions in a day can produce huge fees. On account of futures contracts, clearing fees can stack up for investors who make many trades in a single day, since long positions spread the per-contract fee out over a longer period of time.

## Why Clearing Fees Are Necessary

Clearing houses act as mediators in trades to guarantee payment in case either party engaged with the trade defaults on the contractual obligations of the trade. The technology, accounting, recordkeeping, assumed [counterparty risk](/counterpartyrisk), and liquidity is what investors and traders are paying for with their clearing fees. This keeps markets efficient and energizes more participants in the securities markets. Counterparty and [pre-settlement](/presettlementrisk) risk are frequently underestimated due to the job the clearing house plays.

Clearing houses are subject to critical oversight from regulators, for example, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). Since the [Great Recession](/great-recession) in 2007-2009, new regulations have brought about undeniably more money going through clearing houses. In that capacity, their disappointment could lead to a huge market shock. As of the finish of 2017, the three major clearing houses breezed through liquidity stress assessments by demonstrating they could keep up with sufficient liquidity to settle obligations in an ideal fashion even if their two-biggest individuals (banks and representative vendors) defaulted.

## Who Charges Clearing Fees?

The three biggest clearing houses are CME Clearing (a unit of CME Group Inc.), ICE Clear U.S. (a unit of Intercontinental Exchange Inc.) and LCH Ltd. (a unit of London Stock Exchange Group Plc).

Clearing houses can trace their starting points to around 1636; the lender of Charles I of England, Philip Burlamachi, first proposed them, along with the possibility of a central bank.

- Clearing fees are charged by the party that guarantees the trade, the clearing house.
