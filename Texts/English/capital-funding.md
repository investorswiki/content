# Capital Funding
## What Is Capital Funding?

Capital funding is the money that lenders and equity holders give to a business to daily and long-term needs. A company's capital funding comprises of both debt (bonds) and equity (stock). The business involves this money for operating capital. The bond and equity holders hope to earn a return on their investment as interest, dividends, and stock appreciation.

## Figuring out Capital Funding

To get capital or fixed assets, like land, structures, and machinery, businesses normally raise funds through capital funding programs to purchase these assets. There are two primary highways a business can take to access funding: raising capital through [stock issuance](/issuedshares) and raising capital through debt.

### Stock Issuance

A company can issue common stock through an initial public offering (IPO) or by giving extra shares into the capital markets. One way or the other, the money that is given by investors that purchase the shares is utilized to fund capital drives. In return for giving capital, investors demand a return on their investment (ROI) which is a cost of equity to a business. The return on investment can as a rule be given to stock investors by paying dividends or by effectively dealing with the company's resources to increase the value of the shares held by these investors.

One drawback for this source of capital funding is that responsible extra funds in the markets weakens the holdings of existing shareholders as their proportional ownership and voting influence inside the company will be decreased.

### Debt Issuance

Capital funding can likewise be acquired by giving [corporate bonds](/corporatebond) to retail and institutional investors. At the point when companies issue bonds, they are in effect, borrowing from investors who are compensated with semi-annual coupon payments until the bond develops. The coupon rate on a bond addresses the cost of debt to the responsible company.

Likewise, bond investors might have the option to purchase a bond at a discount, and the face value of the bond will be repaid when it develops. For instance, an investor who purchases a bond for $910 will receive a payment of $1,000 when the bond develops.

## Special Considerations

Capital funding through debt can likewise be raised by taking out loans from banks or other commercial lending institutions. These loans are recorded as long-term liabilities on a company's balance sheet and decline as the loan is continuously paid off. The cost of borrowing the loan is the interest rate that the bank charges the company. The interest payments that the company makes to its lenders are viewed as an expense on the income statement, and that means [pre-charge profits](/profitbeforetax) will be lower.

While a company isn't committed to make payments to its shareholders, it must satisfy its interest and coupon payment obligations to its bondholders and lenders, making capital funding through debt a more costly alternative than through equity. In any case, if a company fails and has its assets liquidated, its creditors will be paid off first before shareholders are thought of.

### Cost of Capital Funding

Companies normally run a broad analysis of the cost of getting capital through equity, bonds, bank loans, venture capitalist, the sale of assets, and retained earnings. A business might survey its weighted average cost of capital (WACC), which loads each cost of capital funding, to work out a company's average cost of capital.

The WACC can measure up to the [return on invested capital](/returnoninvestmentcapital) (ROIC) â€” that is, the return that a company generates when it changes over its capital into capital expenditures. In the event that the ROIC is higher than the WACC, the company will push ahead with its capital funding plan. On the off chance that it's lower, the business should reexamine its strategy and yet again balance the extent of required funds from the different capital sources to diminish its WACC.

## Instances of Capital Funding

There are companies that exist for the sole purpose of giving capital funding to businesses. Such a company could specialize in funding a specific category of companies, for example, healthcare companies, or a specific type of company, like assisted living facilities. The capital funding company could likewise operate to give just short-term financing as well as long-term financing to a business. These companies, for example, [venture capitalists](/venturecapitalist), could likewise decide to zero in on funding a certain stage of the business, for example, a business that is just starting up.
