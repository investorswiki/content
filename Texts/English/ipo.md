## What Is an Initial Public Offering (IPO)?
As a business evolves, a privately held company could choose to transition into a publicly owned entity. This transition can happen to a business at any stage of its life cycle, whether a pristine startup or a company has been around for generations. The process it undertakes is known as the **initial public offering (IPO)**, where shares of company stock become available for purchase by the public. That is the reason a business that issues an IPO is known as "opening up to the world."
## For what reason Do Companies Go Public?
Everything boils down to capital. Companies issue IPOs to develop and extend. Opening up to the world gives them access to **a lot** of money, which can be used to work with acquisitions, fund research projects, pay off debts, or embrace other financial endeavors. It also allows private shareholders, such as angel investors or the company's founders, to make [liquidity](/liquidity) by adapting their investments. IPOs give a big boost to a company in terms of visibility, transparency, and even credibility to the public — and they could also assist the company with securing better terms from its lenders.
## How Does an IPO Work?
There are two phases to the IPO process, which takes about a year to complete from start to finish.
### 1. Getting ready to Go Public
The first phase is the point at which the company begins advertising its intentions to the public. All companies considering IPOs should have sound financials and a history of profitability.
Startups with $1 billion in assets are known as having unicorn status because finding one is as rare as revealing the amazing beast. Examples of unicorn IPOs incorporate Google, Airbnb, SpaceX, and Robinhood.
Companies that issue IPOs must also register with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The SEC approves the IPO by delivering its S-1 registration as "effective," which should not the slightest bit be considered an endorsement of the company, nor does it guarantee future solvency. Investing in IPOs involves many risks, which we'll get into further below.
### 2. Opening up to the world
The next phase of the IPO process involves an investment bank, which underwrites the contract to offer company shares to the public and performs due diligence to reasonably price shares. It then sets the issue price, or offering price. This data is packaged into a prospectus, which is distributed to prospective shareholders. (The first draft of the prospectus is known as the red herring, because it has red warning letters printed along its side, telling everybody the data has yet to be finished.) The investment bank also lists the shares on the stock market and assembles a group of institutional investors, known as a syndicate, which facilitates the sale of IPO shares. The company then, at that point, forms a board of directors, which pledges to give financial updates on a quarterly basis.
When these requirements are met and the SEC has rendered the IPO registration effective, the company's stock can start trading on a stock exchange, similar to the New York Stock Exchange or the Nasdaq. The process of opening up to the world is also known as floating.
The 10-day period following an IPO's first trading day is known as the quiet period. During this time period, all parties included are restricted from issuing earnings forecasts or other analysis to limit insider trading.
While investors can technically sell their IPO shares inside the first couple of days of trading, the practice is strongly discouraged because the whole point of a company opening up to the world is to produce long-term investment, not short-term volatility. Truth be told, there's even a term for it: **flipping**. Doing so could prevent an investor from participating in future public offerings.

## How Might I Participate In an IPO?
Investors who are interested in investing in an IPO usually must have somewhere in the range of $100,000 and $500,000 in household assets, which excludes 401k or annuity assets. What's more, since investors can participate through a brokerage firm, such as Charles Schwab, Fidelity, or TD Ameritrade, they must also be a client. Demand usually outpaces supply of IPO shares, thus most brokerages use a formula to determine qualification comprised of factors like assets, trading activity, and other customer history.
To express interest in the IPO, investors usually need to have somewhere around $2,000 in their specified account. The base investment is regularly 100 shares. An email to investors is sent on the morning of the effective date with the expected pricing, and investors must confirm the transaction.
## How Might I Get the Offer Price?
Even on the off chance that an investor is eligible to participate in an IPO through their brokerage, they probably won't have the option to get the IPO at its offer price because brokerages just get a certain number of shares once the company goes public. Usually the institutional or accredited investors have the first opportunity for IPO shares; be that as it may, trading platforms like Robinhood enable individual investors to approach certain IPOs.
## Are IPOs a Good Investment?
There's certainly a great deal of publicity surrounding IPOs — who would have no desire to be a from the get-go in investor on the next Tesla or Google?
Notwithstanding, there are just as many risks to investing in IPOs as there are advantages, simply because there isn't much of data available yet about the company, as its very reasonability has yet to be determined. Numerous IPOs have shaken things up on Wall Street just to fail in the wake of posting dismal earnings just a couple of years down the street; this happened regularly during the website bubble of the late 1990s.
Considering investing in an IPO the day it goes public? There are risks here as well, as early initial trading could over-inflate prices, causing investors to pay more than the stock is worth. Likewise, the first trading day of an IPO ordinarily sees a great deal of volatility, which could stretch out for a longer period, as well.
As always, it pays for an investor to get their work done and carefully research any company they are considering investing in — especially IPOs. One method for moderating risk may be to consider a [ETF](/indexfund) that invests in IPOs, for a more balanced approach.

## FAQ
### Could Anybody at any point Invest in an IPO?
Oftentimes, there will be more demand than supply for another IPO. Hence, there is no guarantee that all investors interested in an IPO will actually want to purchase shares. Those interested in participating in an IPO might have the option to do as such through their brokerage firm, in spite of the fact that access to an IPO can sometimes be limited to a firm's larger clients. Another option is to invest through a mutual fund or another investment vehicle that focuses on IPOs.
### What Is the Purpose of an Initial Public Offering?
An IPO is essentially a fundraising method used by large companies, in which the company sells its shares to the public interestingly. Following an IPO, the company's shares are traded on a stock exchange. Some of the fundamental motivations for undertaking an IPO include: raising capital from the sale of the shares, giving liquidity to company founders and early investors, and exploiting a higher valuation.
### How Is an IPO Priced?
At the point when a company goes IPO, it needs to list an initial value for its new shares. This is finished by the underwriting banks that will market the deal. To a great extent, the value of the company is established by the company's fundamentals and growth prospects. Because IPOs might be from somewhat more up to date companies, they may not yet have a proven history of profitability. Instead, comparables might be used. Notwithstanding, supply and demand for the IPO shares will also play a job on the days leading up to the IPO.
### Is an IPO a Good Investment?
IPOs will generally gather a ton of media consideration, some of which is purposely developed by the company opening up to the world. Generally speaking, IPOs are famous among investors because they will generally deliver unstable price movements upon the arrival of the IPO and shortly from that point. This can occasionally create large gains, despite the fact that it can also deliver large losses. At last, investors should judge every IPO as per the prospectus of the company opening up to the world as well as their financial circumstances and risk tolerance.
