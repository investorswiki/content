# Natural Gas Liquids (NGL)
## What Are Natural Gas Liquids?

Natural gas liquids (NGL) are parts of natural gas that are separated from the gas state as liquids. This separation happens in a field facility or a gas processing plant through absorption, buildup, or different methods. There are several types of natural gas liquids and various applications for NGL products.

## Grasping Natural Gas Liquids

Natural gas liquids are important as separate products, and eliminating NGL from the natural gas is beneficial. The liquids are first extricated from the natural gas and later separated into various parts. Natural gas liquids are hydrocarbons. A [hydrocarbon](/hydrocarbon) is a particle made solely out of carbon and hydrogen. As hydrocarbons, NGLs have a place in similar family of particles as do natural gas and [crude oil](/crude-oil).

## Types of NGLs and Their Applications

Natural gas liquids are classified in view of their fume pressure:

- Low = condensate
- Intermediate = natural gas
- High = liquefied [petroleum](/petroleum) gas

Furthermore, compound pieces of NGLs are comparable, yet their applications change widely. In particular, the many purposes of natural gas liquids incorporate cooking, space heating, and mixing NGLs into fuels for vehicles.

### Ethane

Applications of ethane incorporate plastics production and petrochemical feedstock â€” natural substances fed into an industrial production cycle to yield an alternate finished result. End-use products incorporate plastics, plastic bags, radiator fluid, and cleanser.

### Propane

Applications and utilizations of propane incorporate residential and commercial heating, cooking fuel, small ovens, and petrochemical feedstock. A few vehicles likewise use propane as fuel.

### Butanes

Butanes can be blended with gasoline and propane. Products incorporate synthetic rubber for tires and lighter fuel. In its most flawless form, butane is valuable as a refrigerant. Combined with propane, butane becomes liquified petroleum gas (LPG).

### Isobutanes

Industrial utilization of isobutanes can incorporate refinery feedstock and petrochemical feedstock. End-use products incorporate sprayers and refrigerants.

### Pentanes

Pentanes are utilized in natural gasoline and as a blowing agent for polystyrene froth. Pentanes plus, a special category (otherwise called natural gasoline), is blended with vehicle fuel and exported for [bitumen](/bitumen) production in [oil sands](/oilsand).

## Difficulties and Opportunities

The U.S. shale boom increased extraction rates of natural gas liquids and NGL extraction is emphatically connected with the price of [crude oil](/crude-oil). That is on the grounds that, as the market price of crude abatements, oil, gas, and compound companies extend their offerings to incorporate NGLs and offset lost revenue.

There have been critical headways in advances, for example, horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing procedures, which include utilizing high-pressured water or liquids to separate gas. Accordingly, natural gas liquid production has increased consistently. As a matter of fact, NGLs furnish numerous natural gas producers with an extra income stream, which can assist with broadening their revenue.

A test with natural gas liquids is that they're costly to handle, store, and [transport ](/transportationexpenses)compared to refined products in light of the fact that NGLs require high pressure or low temperature to be kept up with in their liquid state for shipment and taking care of. NGLs are likewise highly combustible and require the utilization of special trucks, boats, and storage tanks.

The [volatility](/volatility) of the natural gas liquids to some degree limits the number of markets accessible for their utilization. Additionally, as production increments, so too does the requirement for processing plants that separate NGLs from natural gas.

## Instances of NGLs

Suppose that another production facility opened in Texas, by which drilling for natural gas has come about in a lot of the fuel. The gas is separated from the well and shipped off a production facility to be warmed at different temperatures to create the NGLs ethane and propane.

The ethane is eliminated from the natural gas stream after it arrives at the important boiling point, followed by propane, which is a heavier gas bringing about a lengthier boiling process. When the propane and ethane have been eliminated from the natural gas stream, in a cycle called fractionation, the NGLs travel through a [pipeline](/pipeline).

Ultimately, natural gas liquids are delivered by specialized trucks to commercial businesses, industrial plants, and the nearby gas company. The propane can be utilized for residential and commercial heating as well as cooking. Finally, ethane is utilized to make plastics, for example, water containers and plastic bags.

## Highlights
- Applications for NGLs can fluctuate widely and incorporate cooking, heating, plastics, and fuels.
- A weakness of NGLs is that they can be costly to handle, store, and transport.
- The U.S. has a developing export production of natural gas liquids.
- Natural gas liquids are parts of natural gas that are separated from the gas state as liquids.
