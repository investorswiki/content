# Facebook Credits
## What Were Facebook Credits?

Facebook credits were virtual and could be utilized to buy goods in online games through the social networking platform, Facebook. Facebook credits were accessible for purchase online using a credit card, [PayPal](/paypal) account, mobile telephone, or different other payment methods, as well as offline at different retailer areas. The credits were then intended to be utilized to purchase games or programming applications, additionally alluded to as apps, found on the Facebook platform. Credits were active from around 2011 to 2013 before being shutdown.

## Understanding Facebook Credits

Instead of users buying things on Facebook's ecosystem using their neighborhood currency, Facebook (presently Meta) sent off Credits, an intermediary proprietary virtual currency that cost USD $0.10 each, and which could then be spent on virtual goods or game-explicit currency.

Facebook credits were intended to be utilized to buy intangible goods, for example, in-game or in-app virtual gifts, packages of virtual real estate, virtual weapons, devices, and "creatures" in platform-based video games or applications. Facebook earned 30% of all purchases made using Credits.

The platform's beta stage ended around January 2011, at which point Facebook announced that it was requiring all Facebook game designers to handle transactions solely with Facebook credits. Toward the finish of 2011 this virtual money was backed by the officially sanctioned currencies of north of 50 distinct countries. Nonetheless, Facebook announced in 2012 that it was shutting down Facebook credits and converting any funds accrued by users to their neighborhood [fiat currencies](/fiatmoney).

Additionally, Libra is intended to be backed by several large financial and payments companies like PayPal, Visa, and MasterCard - albeit a considerable lot of these corporate coalitions have previously floundered. The Libra project has additionally gone through scrutiny by regulators and policymakers as well as pushback from the larger cryptocurrency community who claim that it isn't as secure or technology sound as the company describes it.
