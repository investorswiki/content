# Holding Period
## What is a holding period?
A holding period is the duration of time between the acquisition of a [asset](/assets) and its sale. It is the time span during which a specific asset is "held" by an individual investor or entity. Holding periods determine how to tax an asset's [capital gain](/capitalgain) or loss.
## More profound definition
There are two broad categories of holding periods: short-term and long-term periods. Normally, long-term [investments ](/investing)have a lower tax rate than short-term investments. For an asset to gain the advantage of lower tax rates, it must be held for something like one year and at some point. An asset with a short-term holding period is typically in the investor's possession for one year or less.
Counting the length of a holding period starts on the day after the purchase of the asset until the day of its sale. For example, the holding period of an asset bought on Feb. 3 starts on Feb. 4. An asset bought on July 1 and sold on Sept. 30 would have a short-term holding period of 90 days. A majority of companies with strong cash positions incline toward short-term capital investments like bonds and stocks, as they earn higher interest than traditional savings accounts.
## Holding period model
Gabby buys 200 shares of stock on Jan. 11, 2017. Her holding period starts the next day, Jan. 12, 2017. She sells her stock on Dec. 12, 2017, giving her a holding period of 11 months. Since her holding period is under a year, she will understand a short-term capital gain or loss, as opposed to a long-term capital gain or loss.
