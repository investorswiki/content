# Tax Season
## What Is Tax Season?

Tax season is the time span, generally between Jan. 1 and April 15 of every year, when individual taxpayers customarily prepare financial statements and reports for the previous year and present their [tax returns](/taxreturn). In the U.S., individuals regularly must file their annual tax return by April 15 of the year following any reportable earnings. Tax returns submitted after the finish of tax season are subject to late penalty fees and interest charges.

The [Internal Revenue Service (IRS)](/irs) has announced that the U.S. tax season starts on Monday, January 24, 2022, which is the point at which the IRS starts accepting and processing 2021 tax year returns.

## Understanding Tax Season

Tax season is the period inside which all income taxes must be filed up until the cutoff time. The cutoff time every year is commonly April 15. In any case, on the off chance that this date falls on an end of the week or holiday, it is moved to the next business day. For example, in 2022, Emancipation Day in Washington, D.C., falls on April 16, which is a Saturday. In this way, it will be authoritatively seen in the Capital on the closest work day, April 15. That holiday perception will close the city and federal offices in D.C., including the IRS.

Accordingly, taxpayers have until Monday, April 18, 2022, to file their 2021 tax returns and pay any taxes due. Tax returns submitted after this date are subject to late penalty fees except if you are a resident of Maine or Massachusetts. In those two states, taxpayers have until Tuesday, April 19, 2022, on the grounds that April 18 is Patriots' Day.

During tax season, businesses must outfit employees, contract workers, and others, for example, [royalty](/royalty) earners, with tax records indicating data required to complete an individual's tax returns. Individuals who are required to file a tax return generally must do as such before April 15 or request an extension.

Tax season is a bustling period for the overwhelming majority tax preparers and accounting experts. The three-and-a-half-month period toward the beginning of the year is the point at which the vital desk work, including wage and earnings statements, (for example, [1099s](/form-1099-b) or [W-2s](/w2form)), is collected to gather [tax returns](/taxreturn).

While certain individuals calculate their own tax returns, many depend on the ability of tax preparers and accounting experts to be certain the administrative work is filed accurately and to work on the financial outcome of the tax return. An individual who earned $73,000 or less (in 2021) can file taxes for free through the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) Free File program. Individuals must file federal, state, and, now and again, neighborhood tax returns.

> The IRS informs that all taxpayers keep duplicates with respect to their earlier year tax returns for somewhere around three years. In the event of an IRS audit, a taxpayer will be required to introduce the last three years of their reports. In extreme cases, for example, doubt of fraud, they will be expected to show seven years of archives.

For the tax year 2022. as per the IRS, a taxpayer with [gross income](/grossincome) (all income from all wellsprings) of more than $12,950 should pay [federal tax](/federal_income_tax). Independent contractors, or what the IRS alludes to as "non-representative compensation," must file a return and pay self-employment taxes on any net earnings from self-employment of $400 or more.

The cutoff time for employers to file and send W-2s to employees is Jan. 31. Businesses that hire independent contractors must send these nonemployees Form 1099-NEC as of the 2021 tax year. This form supplanted [1099-MISC](/form1099-misc), which actually stays in effect for payments made for things like rent, prizes, medical services, among others.

## Special Considerations

Albeit the cutoff time to file your taxes is almost consistently April 15, there are cases when the IRS might need to expand it. That was the case with the just like the 2020 federal tax year. The agency extended the filing date for individuals until May 17, 2021, due to the coronavirus pandemic.

A further extension was granted to those living in Texas, Oklahoma, and Louisiana in light of the colder time of year storms that hit those states in February 2021. The cutoff time for individuals and corporations to file their 2020 tax returns was pushed to June 15, 2021. Then the accompanying spring storms made sufficient damage Tennessee as well as parts of Alabama and Kentucky to grant further extensions.

## Why Filing Early Can Make Sense

Even however numerous taxpayers file their tax returns on or by about April 15 each year, there is compelling reason need to put it off as late as possible. Without a doubt, filing an early tax return can seem OK for different reasons.

The IRS starts accepting and processing 2021 tax year returns on Monday, January 24, 2022. Even on the off chance that you don't file ahead of schedule, there are motivations to start arrangement in a hurry.

Starting your filing interaction early gives you the time you really want to collect the evidence expected to claim your deductions as a whole. You will keep away from the cerebral pain of the middle of the night stress over figures and receipts. Your accountant will have a more flexible schedule and can presumably begin working on your accounts right away. Likewise, by filing early, you will short circuit would-be identity cheats.
