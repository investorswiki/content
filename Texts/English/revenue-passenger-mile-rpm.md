# Revenue Passenger Mile (RPM)
## What Is Revenue Passenger Mile?

A revenue passenger mile (RPM) is a transportation industry metric that shows the number of miles went by paying passengers and is normally an airline traffic statistic. Revenue passenger miles are calculated by increasing the number of paying passengers by the distance voyaged. For instance, an airplane with 100 passengers that flies 250 miles has produced 25,000 RPM.

## Grasping Revenue Passenger Mile

Revenue passenger miles are the foundation of most transportation metrics. RPM is frequently compared to [available seat miles (ASM),](/availableseatmiles) a measure of an airplane's total carrying capacity accessible to create income. By separating RPM by ASM, an airline can work out load factors. The load factor is a percentage demonstrating how effective the airline is at selling seats and earning revenue. Higher load factors, clearly, are wanted on the grounds that vacant seats are a [opportunity cost](/opportunitycost) for an airline.

The Department of Transportation's (DOT) Bureau of Transportation Statistics keeps up with datasets of aggregate RPM as well as ASM for domestic and international flights. For February 2021, domestic and international U.S. air carrier RPM was 26.5 billion against 49.5 billion ASM, which converted into a load factor of 0.53%. RPM shows traffic volume, yet it remains closely connected with ASM to give airline management critical data about the number of seats it that must fill to accomplish greater profitability.

## Airline RPM Reporting

Airlines report RPM statistics on a month to month and year-to-date basis. Three of the biggest U.S. carriers each had north of 55 billion RPM in 2020. American Airlines recorded 71.2 billion RPM, Delta Airlines registered 61.2 billion RPM, and United Airlines had 57.1 billion RPM. Related to the ASM data, it was shown that American was the most efficient in loading its fleet during the year. American's load factor was 0.64%, somewhat higher than United's 0.60% and Delta's 0.56%.

## RPM Around the World

As additional individuals take to the skies to go inside their own countries and to foreign grounds, RPM (or RPK for countries on the decimal standard for measuring) will just develop. This is particularly true for agricultural nations that are just beginning monstrous form outs of their airport infrastructure to keep pace with their economic growth rates. This airline traffic statistic will assist legislatures with planning airport capacity and openings for individual airlines. Aircraft creators, drove by the duopoly of Boeing and Airbus, keep an eye on the more drawn out term trends in RPM to plan their future production of planes. Whether situated in Asia, Europe, or Latin America, airline companies need to arrange this key traffic volume statistic to aid their forward business strategies to draw in passengers in the seriously competitive market.

## Highlights
- Revenue passenger mile (RPM) is a transportation industry metric essentially utilized by the airline industry to show the number of miles went by paying passengers.
- To ascertain an airline's load factor, partition the airline's revenue passenger mile by its accessible seat miles.
- A high load factor demonstrates an airline is efficient at selling seats and generating income.
- The load factor is a percentage that reflects how effective an airline is at earning revenue.
- Accessible seat miles (ASM) measures an airplane's carrying capacity accessible to create revenue.
