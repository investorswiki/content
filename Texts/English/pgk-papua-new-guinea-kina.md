## What Is the PGK (Papua New Guinea Kina)?

The Papua New Guinea **kina** is the [national currency](/national-currency) of Papua New Guinea. Users of the currency fasten monetary values with the symbol "K", as in 1,000K. It is alluded to with the code PGK on foreign exchange markets.

## Grasping the PGK

The kina became effective in April 1975, when it supplanted the previous currency, the [Australian dollar](/aud-australian-dollar) (AUD) as official money of the land. 1 kina is contained 100 subunits, called "toea." The name "kina" is derived from a type of shell, which had generally been utilized to work with nearby commerce.

Six coins were created upon the kina's commencement in 1975. Five of them were smaller coins, for 1, 2, 5, 10, and 20 toea, while one coin was larger, indicating one kina. Of these, two of the smaller coins — explicitly, the 1 and 2 toea coins — were discontinued in 2007.

At first, the just [banknotes](/banknote) accessible were for small sections of two, five, and 10 kina. It was exclusively in 1977 that a 20 kina note was presented, with the 50 and 100 kina notes continuing in 1990 and 2005, separately.

The kina highlights symbols of Papua New Guinea's unique fauna and social ancient rarities, like the well known Bird of Paradise. The 50-kina bill includes the country's Parliament building, as well as a picture of Prime Minister Michael Somare.

Today, a large part of the population depends on resource agriculture.
