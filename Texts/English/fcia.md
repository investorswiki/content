## What Is the Foreign Credit Insurance Association (FCIA)?

The Foreign Credit Insurance Association (FCIA) is an association of insurance companies that offers insurance to U.S. exporters against nonpayment by foreign customers due to commercial and political risks.

## Grasping the Foreign Credit Insurance Association

The Foreign Credit Insurance Association offers insurance to reduce the risks export companies take when they participate in trade with foreign countries. Since exporters commonly don't receive advance payment for orders they ship, they run the risk that buyers will [default](/default2) on payments.

Normal explanations behind default incorporate commercial issues, for example, issues with a buyer's cash flow, bankruptcy, or other market-based issues. International markets likewise present political risks like war, political upheavals, or difficulty in changing over a foreign currency. Further convoluting matters, the presence of buyers in foreign countries puts them past the span of the common laws a seller could use to recover their losses in a domestic market.

The FCIA has existed starting around 1961 to offer insurance for circumstances in which foreign buyers won't make opportune payments. Various types of policies cover various degrees of risk, ordinarily relying upon the amount of experience exporters have with specific buyers in specific wards and the length of the term in question. Short-term contracts ordinarily run for quite some time, for instance, while medium-term contracts can cover periods of one to seven years.

For instance, exporters with a long history of effective transactions can generally purchase multi-buyer policies covering short-and medium-term contracts. Single-buyer policies cover exporters with long-term experience with a single foreign buyer. Other policy types incorporate new-to-export policies, issued for inexperienced exporters, and umbrella policies which normally cover short-term contracts and require the contribution of a third party to help with processing desk work.

## Export Credit versus Letters of Credit

The export credit insurance offered by means of the FCIA covers direct contracts among buyers and sellers. Exporters seeking to reduce the risk of a given transaction can require a [letter of credit](/letterofcredit), which includes a third-party issuer. A foreign bank regularly endorses a letter of credit based upon collateral put up by the buyer. These instruments perform like a guarantee, with the responsible bank giving a backstop against default by the buyer.

Letters of credit don't dispense with risk without help from anyone else, be that as it may. Merchants participating in transactions that utilization letters of credit can purchase an alternate type of insurance called a [bank letter of credit policy](/bankletterofcreditpolicy). These policies give coverage like that gave by the FCIA to export credit transactions.
