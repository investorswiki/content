# Non-Equity Option
## What Is a Non-Equity Option?

A non-equity option is a [derivative](/derivative) contract with an underlying asset of instruments other than equities. Typically, that means a stock index, physical [commodity](/commodity), or [futures contract](/futurescontract), however practically any asset is optionable in the over-the-counter (OTC) market. These underlying assets can incorporate fixed income securities, real estate, or currencies.

## Figuring out a Non-Equity Option

Options, like all derivatives, permit investors to estimate on or [hedge](/hedge) against developments of the [underlying assets](/underlying-asset). Non-equity options will empower them to do as such on instruments that are not exchange-traded equities. As with other [options](/option), non-equity options give the holder the right, however not the obligation, to execute the underlying asset at a predefined price at the very latest a predetermined date.

All strategies accessible to exchange-traded options are likewise accessible for non-equity options. These incorporate simple puts and calls, as well as [combinations](/blend) and spreads, which are strategies utilizing at least two options. Instances of blends and spreads incorporate [vertical spreads](/verticalspread), [strangles](/choke), and [iron butterflies](/ironbutterfly).

For exchange-traded non-equity options, for example, [gold options](/gold-option) or [currency options](/currencyoption), the actual exchange sets strike prices, expiration dates, and contract sizes. For OTC variants, the buyer and seller set all terms and become counterparties to the trade.

## Options Contracts

The terms of an option contract indicate the underlying security, the price at which the underlying security can be executed, called the [strike price](/strikeprice), and the expiration date of the contract. An exchange-traded equity option covers 100 shares for each option contract, yet a non-equity option could incorporate 10 ounces of palladium, $100,000 [par value](/parvalue) in a corporate bond or on the other hand, if the [counterparties](/counterparty) so concur, $17,000 par value in bonds. The sky is the limit in the OTC market, up to two parties will trade.

In a call option transaction, opening a position happens when a contract or contracts are bought from the seller, or the [writer](/writer) as they are likewise known.

This infers that assuming the seller is called away, they will have the underlying shares to deliver to the owner of the long call.

## Special Considerations

The major problem with OTC non-equity options is that [liquidity](/liquidity) is limited since there is no guaranteed method for shutting the option position before expiration. To offset a position, one of the parties must track down another party with whom to make the contrary option contract. In the event that that is unimaginable, the investor could buy or sell another option in a connected area to offset the developments of the original underlying asset partially.

For exchange-traded options, the interaction is considerably more direct as need might arise to do is offset the position on the exchange.
