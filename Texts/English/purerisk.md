# Pure Risk
## What Is Pure Risk?

Pure risk is a category of [risk](/risk) that can't be controlled and has two results: complete loss or no loss by any means. There are no opportunities for gain or profit when pure risk is implied.

Pure risk is generally pervasive in circumstances like natural fiascos, fires, or death. These circumstances can't be anticipated and are outside of anybody's reach. Pure risk is likewise alluded to as absolute risk.

## Figuring out Pure Risk

There are no measurable benefits with regards to pure risk. All things considered, there are two prospects. From one perspective, quite possibly nothing will occur or no loss by any means. On the other, there might be the probability of total loss.

Pure risks can be separated into three distinct categories: personal, property, and liability. There are four methods for moderating pure risk: reduction, avoidance, acceptance, and transference. The most common method of dealing with pure risk is to transfer it to an insurance company by purchasing an insurance policy.

Many occurrences of pure risk are insurable. For instance, an insurance company guarantees a policyholder's automobile against theft. On the off chance that the vehicle is taken, the insurance company needs to bear a loss. Be that as it may, on the off chance that it isn't taken, the company makes no gain. Pure risk remains in direct difference to [speculative risk](/speculativerisk), which investors pursue a conscious decision to participate in and can bring about a loss or gain.

> Pure risks can be insured since insurers are able to anticipate what their losses might be.

## Types of Pure Risk

Personal risks directly influence an individual and may include the loss of earnings and resources or an increase in expenses. For instance, [unemployment](/unemployment) may make financial weights from the loss of income and employment benefits. Identity theft might bring about damaged credit, and poor wellbeing might bring about substantial medical bills, as well as the loss of earning power and the depletion of savings.

Property risks imply property damaged due to uncontrollable powers like fire, lightning, typhoons, cyclones, or hail.

Liability risks might imply litigation due to real or perceived shamefulness. For instance, a person harmed in the wake of slipping on another person's frosty carport might sue for medical expenses, lost income, and other associated damages.

### Safeguarding Against Pure Risk

Not at all like most speculative risks, pure risks are regularly insurable through commercial, personal, or [liability insurance](/liability_insurance) policies. Individuals transfer part of a pure risk to an insurer. For instance, homeowners purchase home insurance to safeguard against perils that cause damage or loss. The insurer currently shares the possible risk with the homeowner.

Pure risks are insurable partly in light of the fact that the [law of large numbers](/lawoflargenumbers) applies more promptly than to speculative risks. Insurers are more capable of foreseeing loss considers in advance and won't broaden themselves along with a market in the event that they see it as unprofitable.

### Speculative Risk

Not at all like pure risk, speculative risk has opportunities for loss or gain and requires the consideration of all possible risks before picking an action. For instance, investors purchase [securities](/security) accepting they will increase in value.

Be that as it may, the opportunity for loss is consistently present. Organizations venture into new markets, purchase new equipment, and enhance existing product lines since they perceive the potential gain outperforms the possible loss.
