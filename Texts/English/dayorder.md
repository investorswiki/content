# Day Order
## What is a Day Order?

A day order is a limitation placed on an order to a broker to execute a trade at a specific price that lapses toward the finish of the trading day in the event that it isn't completed. A day order can be a [limit order](/limitorder) to buy or sell a security, yet its duration is limited to the remainder of that trading day.

## Understanding Day Orders

A day order is one of several different order [duration types](/duration) that decide how long the order is in the market before it is canceled. On account of a day order, that duration is one trading session. All in all, in the event that the trader's order isn't executed or [triggered](/trade-trigger) the order on the day it was placed, the order gets canceled. Two instances of other duration-based orders are the [good until canceled](/gtc) (GTC) order which stays active until it is physically canceled, and the [immediate or cancel](/immediateorcancel) (IOC) order, which fills all or part of an order immediately and cancels the leftover part of the order in the event that it can't be fulfilled.

Day order frequently fills in as the default order duration on [trading platforms](/trading-stage). Consequently, the trader must indicate an alternate time period for the expiration of the order, or it will naturally be a day order. All things considered, informal investors can utilize various types of orders while putting trades. By being the default, notwithstanding, most [market orders](/marketorder) are as a matter of fact day orders.

## Utilizing Day Orders

Day orders can be particularly helpful when used to order a security at a specific price point, so the trader doesn't have to monitor the security until the end of the day waiting for the right opportunity to execute the order. This helps [intraday](/intraday) traders monitor and trade different securities all at once, which is common practice. Before the market opens, traders break down every individual security they trade and afterward place orders as indicated by their strategies. The trader makes a further move throughout the span of the trading day as the individual orders are executed.

Intraday traders frequently use strategies that direct leaving positions before the market closes. Hence, on the off chance that an order isn't filled before the day's over, the trader will cancel it. Since this happens naturally for day orders, intraday traders will more often than not favor them.

## Watching Day Orders

Day orders can be a source of stress for investors who are not professional traders. In the event that an investor isn't monitoring the price of the security during the trading day, a day limit order might happen without their insight. On the off chance that an investor makes a day order to sell a certain security and the security encounters an unanticipated price drop, the order might be executed before the investor becomes aware of the situation, leaving the investor with greater loss than was expected. In this scenario, of course, the loss would have been realized one way or the other, yet the investors might have decided to hold as opposed to sell at a loss contingent upon what was behind the drop. As a rule, it is smart to pay consideration regarding the market while actively setting orders.
