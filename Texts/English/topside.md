# Topside
## What Is Topside?

Topside (or topsides) alludes to the above-water segments of an offshore oil rig, or any parts which are over the waterline. The structures that make up the topsides are commonly measured, introduced onto either a fixed or floating underwater structure.

## Figuring out Topside

       Parts of the topside incorporate the drilling rig, worker accommodations, and now and again an installed processing facility. During the [exploratory phase](/exploratory-well) of an offshore oil rig's life, the topside is in many cases a bare structure sitting on a lowered pinnacle known as a coat. A drill is fed to the ocean bottom through the coat to decide whether the drilling site will create adequate oil or gas to push ahead with additional drilling operations.

In the event that the oil company chooses to proceed drilling, the rig enters the [production stage](/investigation production-company). A drilling contractor is employed, and the topside will be moved toward house drilling, processing, and storage facilities alongside worker accommodations and communications facilities. Most offshore rigs house 40 to 60 workers, who work in 12-hours shifts for a very long time. Toward the finish of their assigned plan for getting work done, the company transports them off the rig and replaces them with another group of workers.

### The Jack-Up

One of the most common types of the offshore rig is known as a lift. It is a platform supported by three legs, coming to the ocean bottom below. At the point when the opportunity arrives to move the contraption, the pinnacles are lifted, raising the topside components. This method considers the relocation of the rig by a team of towing boats.

On the topside of a raise rig, the worker accommodations and helipad are at the forward finish of the platform. The accommodation block regularly comprises of four or five decks. Shared spaces, similar to kitchen and clothing facilities, are on the main deck, while the upper levels oblige private quarters and office space.

## Parts of the Topside

Drilling equipment, overwhelmed by a latticed steel derrick, is on the toward the back finish of the topside on raise rigs. At the highest point of the derrick, a top drive will turn the drill string, which is a series of lines extending hundreds or thousands of feet down to the ocean bottom. At the tip of the drill string, the boring apparatus drills a [vertical shaft](/verticalwell) into rock and substrate below the seabed.

Different structures found on the topside support both drilling operations and worker facilities. These different structures incorporate a series of cranes for moving large things around the platform, industrial HVAC frameworks to give climate control, and generators to deliver power for the whole rig. Cranes additionally permit the exchange of equipment and supplies from the topside to surface vessels.

Worker safety is central on an offshore oil or gas rig. Emergency and safety equipment is in place to support all faculty on the rig and permit them to manage a climate emergency, spills, or fire.
