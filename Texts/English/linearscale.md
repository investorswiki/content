# Linear Price Scale
## What Is a Linear Price Scale?

A linear (arithmetic) price scale is a charting scale utilized by traders that is plotted with real values dispersed equidistant from each other on the vertical y-pivot. Every unit change is addressed by a similar vertical distance on the chart, paying little mind to what price level the [asset](/asset) is at when the change happens.

A linear scale can measure up to a logarithmic scale. The interpretation of a stock chart can shift among various traders relying upon the type of price scale utilized while review the data.

## How Linear Price Scales Work

Linear price scales and [logarithmic (log) price scales](/logarithmicscale) are two common types of charts utilized in the financial industry. The two types of charts can be utilized by [technical analysts](/technical-expert). Every one of the charts is normally produced from software automation. Linear price scale charts can all the more effectively be drawn physically since they depend on static units representative of absolute values.

Logarithmic charts ordinarily require the utilization of advanced chart programming since their unit value movements are not steady yet rather communicated in percentages. Both linear and logarithmic charts will utilize a similar x-pivot dates for their charting.

A linear price scale can likewise be known as an arithmetic chart. The linear price scale chart doesn't portray or scale movements in that frame of mind to their percent change. The linear price scale plots price level changes with every unit change relating to a consistent unit value. Since each value change on the grid is steady, linear price scales can all the more effectively be drawn physically.

## Logarithmic Price Scales and Charting

A logarithmic price scale chart is plotted to show the [percentage change](/percentage-change) that happens when a price moves starting with one quote then onto the next. They chart the price's percentage move by numerically depicting it in the vertical movement.

In this manner, in the event that a price increases by 1%, its higher vertical movement will be significantly less than a vertical movement portraying the price change of a half increase. To allow for numerically scaled price movements per unit change, advanced charting software makes a non-static y-pivot. In a logarithmic price scale, the y-pivot changes its scale with each price movement.

> While the difference among linear and logarithmic price scales is important to comprehend while understanding charts, there are different forms of technical analysis that you can use to distinguish and capitalize on price trends.

A linear and logarithmic price scale chart will have a similar visual appearance in the body of the chart. Notwithstanding, a logarithmic chart will have an adjustable y-pivot that can all the more plainly show breakout levels at which a price has made large percentage moves. On the off chance that price changes are happening in low percentages, a logarithmic price chart will likewise portray that with focused price levels on the y-hub as opposed to large spaces displayed between prices.

## Illustration of a Linear Price Scale

A linear price scale is not difficult to distinguish in light of the fact that the y-hub will continuously be charted with values equidistant separated.

For instance, a linear scale dismisses the way that a $5 move is more substantial when the [price](/market-price) of an asset is $10 than when the price of the asset is $50. The price movement that is plotted on the chart is addressed similar to a similar distance on the scale, even however a $5 increase from $10 is equivalent to a half increase, while a $5 increase from $50 is a 10% increase.

## Features
- Linear price scales — additionally alluded to as arithmetic — address an asset's price on the y-hub utilizing equidistant dividing between price marks.
- A linear price scale chart shows changes in absolute terms and doesn't portray price movements corresponding to their percent change.
- A logarithmic price scale chart, then again, is plotted to show the percentage change that happens when a price moves starting with one quote then onto the next so that each price mark is larger by a factor of ten.
