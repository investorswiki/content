## What Is an Acquisition Premium?

An acquisition premium is a figure that is the difference between the estimated [real value](/real-value) of a company and the genuine price paid to get it. An acquisition premium addresses the increased cost of buying a target company during a [merger and acquisition (M&A)](/mergersandacquisitions) transaction.

There is no requirement that a company pay a [premium](/premium) for obtaining another company; as a matter of fact, contingent upon the situation, it might even get a discount.

## Figuring out Acquisition Premiums

In a M&A scenario, the company that pays to gain one more company is known as the [acquirer](/acquirer), and the company to be purchased or acquired is alluded to as the [target firm](/targetfirm).

### Purposes behind Paying An Acquisition Premium

Ordinarily, a securing company will pay an acquisition premium to close a deal and avoid competition. An acquisition premium may be paid, too, assuming the acquirer accepts that the [synergy](/synergy) made from the acquisition will be greater than the total cost of getting the target company. The size of the premium frequently relies upon different factors like competition inside the industry, the presence of different bidders, and the inspirations of the buyer and seller.

### How Does An Acquisition Premium Work?

At the point when a company concludes that it needs to get another firm, it will initially endeavor to estimate the real value of the target company. For instance, the [enterprise value](/enterprisevalue) of Macy's, utilizing data from its 2017 [10-K report](/10-k), is estimated at $11.81 billion. After the procuring company decides the real value of its target, it concludes the amount it will pay on top of the real value to introduce an alluring deal to the target firm, particularly assuming there are different firms that are thinking about an acquisition.

In the model over an acquirer might choose to pay a 20% premium to buy Macy's. Accordingly, the total cost it will propose would be $11.81 billion x 1.2 = $14.17 billion. In the event that this premium offer is accepted, the acquisition premium value will be $14.17 billion - $11.81 billion = $2.36 billion, or in percentage form, 20%.

### Showing up at the Acquisition Premium

You likewise may utilize a target company's share price to show up at the acquisition premium. For example, in the event that Macy's is presently trading at $26 per share, and an acquirer will pay $33 per share for the target company's [outstanding shares](/outstandingshares), then, at that point, you might work out the acquisition premium as ($33 - $26)/$26 = 27%.

> In any case, few out of every odd company pays a premium for an acquisition **intentionally**.
>

Utilizing our price-per-share model, how about we assume that there was no premium offer on the table and the settled upon acquisition cost was $26 per share. In the event that the value of the company drops to $16 before the acquisition becomes last, the acquirer will end up paying a premium of ($26 - $16)/$16 = 62.5%.

## Acquisition Premiums in Financial Accounting

In financial accounting, the acquisition premium is known as [goodwill](/goodwill) â€” the portion of the purchase price that is higher than the sum of the net [fair value](/fairvalue) of every one of the assets purchased in the acquisition and the [liabilities](/responsibility) assumed simultaneously. The gaining company records goodwill as a separate account on its [balance sheet](/balancesheet).

Goodwill factors in [intangible assets](/intangibleasset) like the value of a target company's brand, strong customer base, great customer relations, sound employee relations, and any licenses or proprietary technology acquired from the target company. An adverse event, for example, declining cash flows, economic depression, increased competitive environment and such can lead to a [impairment of goodwill](/goodwill-impairment), which happens when the market value of the target company's immaterial assets dips under its acquisition cost. Any impairment brings about a decline in goodwill on the balance sheet and shows as a loss on the [income statement](/incomestatement).

An acquirer can purchase a target company for a discount, or at least, for not exactly its fair value. At the point when this happens, [negative goodwill](/negativegoodwill) is recognized.
