# Recapture Clause
## What Is a Recapture Clause?

A recapture clause alludes to a lease provision common in commercial properties that permits the landlord to end a lease and hold possession of a property.

## How a Recapture Clause Works

A recapture clause alludes to an expectation in a contract that permits the seller of an asset to take the asset back under certain conditions. It is a common part of commercial real estate [leases](/lease), rather than residential property leases. In such a lease, the clause gives a landlord the right to reclaim possession of a property prior to the expiration of a lease. The subtleties of the clause are negotiated by the lessor and the resident and remembered for the lease agreement. The main detail of a recapture clause is the supposed trigger — the event that permits a landlord to start recapture.

## Assignment and Recapture Clauses

A common trigger is a tenant's intention to assign the property to an outsider by means of a [sublease](/sublease). Hence, the recapture clause is closely connected with the lease's [assignment](/assignment) clause, and the two are normally negotiated together. Landlords like to leave the phrasing of a recapture clause obscure to permit themselves flexibility when a tenant solicitations permission for assignment.

On the off chance that a tenant business is performing ineffectively and means to close, it might look to rent the rented property to another business as opposed to [default](/default2) on its lease with the landlord. The landlord, notwithstanding, would regularly really like to straightforwardly start another lease with the new business. At the point when the main tenant educates the landlord regarding its intent to assign the property to the new business, the landlord could decide to conjure the lease's recapture clause.

## Recapture Clauses in Percentage Leases

A subsequent common trigger emerges from a landlord's interest in the tenant keeping a certain level of revenue. In a [percentage lease](/percentage-lease), the landlord and tenant consent to a base rent plus an extra percentage of revenue to be paid to the landlord. This can be favorable to the tenant since the base rent is ordinarily below market rate and the marginal rent is just due on the off chance that sales perform well.

A percentage lease permits the landlord to conjure a recapture clause when the tenant business' revenues dip below a certain level. This is the trigger event. On account of a shared property, for example, a shopping center, a landlord will recapture a property in the hope that they can get one more tenant with higher revenues. This helps the landlord's primary concern and may likewise get extra business for the landlord's different tenants.
