# Expiration Cycle (Stocks)
The third Friday of each and every month is the date when index and equity options terminate. The genuine expiration is Saturday, yet all trading must be finished up by the close on Friday. Most index options close on Friday morning, while the S&P 100 index and all equity options lapse at the close.
