# Harmless Warrant
## What Is Harmless Warrant?

The term harmless warrant alludes to a provision that expects bondholders to surrender an existing bond to purchase a similar type of [bond](/bond) from the issuer. Put basically, bond issuers put harmless [warrants](/warrant) on their bonds, expecting investors to swap their existing bond to purchase another one with comparable highlights from a similar issuer. Harmless warrants are a safety net for bond issuers as they help keep their [debt](/debt) levels in check.

## Grasping Harmless Warrants

Warrants are derivative securities that permit the holder the right — not the obligation — to purchase or sell a specific security at a specific price before the [expiration date](/expirationdate). They come in several distinct forms, including harmless warrants.

A harmless warrant is connected to bonds and offered by bondholders. An investor who buys a bond with a harmless warrant can't purchase another bond from similar issuer with similar terms until the investor surrenders the main bond they purchased. This incorporates any bonds that have the equivalent [maturity](/maturity) date, [yield](/yield), and principal amount. Thusly, Mr. Investor can't purchase a $1,000 10-year bond from Company A without surrendering the first they own with similar terms.

Bonds are a form of debt for the issuer. The investor loans the entity a specific sum of money for a while in exchange for the [principal](/principal) balance plus interest at maturity. Thusly, these instruments add to the issuer's total amount of debt. Giving bonds with harmless warrants permits these elements to control their debt levels. Along these lines, an investor can't get too much [leverage](/leverage) on the issuer while keeping the issuer from getting into a dangerous situation wherein an investor calls different bonds that the issuer can't cover.

One important point to note is that not all responsible substances join harmless warrants on their bond offerings.

## Special Considerations

Assuming that harmless warrants keep investors from purchasing numerous bonds with comparable terms from a similar issuer, what occurs if somebody has any desire to buy various bonds from the issuer?

These warrants don't keep bondholders from purchasing bonds with various terms from a similar issuer. This means they might purchase other bonds with various maturity terms, yield rates, and principal amounts.

Keep at the top of the priority list, however, that most investors generally need to repeat certain investments in light of the great terms they carry, so a harmless warrant forces an investor to conclude which of the terms are the most critical. That is except if they will surrender the original bond to purchase another one with similar terms.

> Harmless warrants are not detachable, and that means they can't be separated from the underlying security. Accordingly, you can't sell the bond or warrant separately on the secondary market.

## Harmless Warrant versus Warrant

Recollect that a harmless warrant gives the holder the right to purchase another bond at similar terms as the bond to which the harmless warrant applies.

All things considered, it requires the holder to surrender the principal bond to be permitted to buy the second bond with similar terms.

A warrant, then again, is a type of [derivative](/derivative) security since it gives the holder the right to act somehow or another with another security. A warrant gives the holder the right to buy or sell another [security](/security) at a specific time, albeit the warrant holder doesn't have the obligation to exercise this warrant. The holder of the original security purchases the warrant to reserve the privilege to do anything that the warrant outlines.
