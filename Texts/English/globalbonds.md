## What Is a Global Bond?

A global bond, some of the time alluded to as an Eurobond, is a type of bond issued and traded outside the country where the currency of the bond is named.

## Figuring out Global Bonds

At the point when multinational corporations and sovereign substances choose to raise large capital, they might decide to issue global bonds. Global bonds are [international bonds](/internationalbond) that are offered all the while in different capital markets including Europe, Asia, and America. These bonds might have a fixed or [floating rate](/floatinginterestrate) with maturities going from one to 30 years.

A few global bonds are named in the currency of the company's country base, like the yen for Japanese companies and the euro for a German corporation. Other global bonds are named in the currency of the country where the bond is issued. Getting back to the prior model the U.S. corporation could sell a bond on a Japanese marketplace and name it in yen.

Due to the change of exchange rates, investors normally invest in foreign fixed income that acquires unassuming returns and vacillates marginally. Global bonds are viewed as a method for enhancing a portfolio that is limited to a specific denomination or one specific country's bond, like a U.S. bond since this bond will have less correlation to the foreign fixed income bond.

Global bonds are gathered into developed country bonds and [emerging market bonds](/emerging-markets-bond-record). Bonds issued by corporations and governments from developed countries are issued with varying maturities and credit characteristics. A portion of these bonds are U.S. dollar-named. Notwithstanding, most are designated in the currencies of their nations of origin.

Emerging market bonds are regularly issued by a [sovereign government](/sovereignbond), not corporations. These bonds are dollar-designated and offer exorbitant loan fees due to the perceived higher level of risk of a bond investment issued by a financially shaky country.

## Global Bond versus Eurobond

Global bonds are some of the time likewise called [Eurobonds](/eurobond) yet they have extra elements. An Eurobond is an international bond that is issued and traded in countries other than the country in which the bond's currency or value is designated. These bonds are issued in a currency that isn't the domestic currency of the issuer.

A French company that issues bonds in Japan named in U.S. dollars has issued an Eurobond, all the more specifically, an Eurodollar bond. Different types of Eurobonds are the Euroyen and Euroswiss bonds.

A global bond is like the Eurobond yet can likewise be traded and issued at the same time in the country whose currency is utilized to value the bond. Drawing from our Eurobond model over, an illustration of a global bond will be one in which the French company issues bonds named in the U.S. dollar yet offers the bonds in both Japan and U.S. markets.
