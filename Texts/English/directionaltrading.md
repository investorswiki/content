Directional trading alludes to strategies in light of the investor's perspective on the future course of something: either the overall financial market or a specific [security](/security). Their assessment of the heading will be the sole deciding factor in whether the investor chooses to sell or buy.

## Figuring out Directional Trading

Directional trading basically is a wagered on the up or down movement of the market or a security. It is widely associated with options trading since several strategies can be utilized to capitalize on a move higher, or lower, in the more extensive market, or a specific stock. Investors can carry out an essential directional trading strategy by taking a [long position](/long) if the market, or security, is rising (or they think it will), or a [short position](/short) on the off chance that the security's price is falling.

Typically, directional trading in stocks needs a moderately sizeable move to empower the trader to cover [commissions](/commission) and trading costs, nevertheless create a gain.

## Illustration of Directional Trading

Assume an investor is bullish on stock XYZ, which is trading at $50, and anticipates that it should rise to $55 inside the next 90 days. The investor, in this manner, buys 200 shares at $50, with a stop-loss at $48 in case the stock switches heading. On the off chance that the stock reaches the $55 target, it very well may be sold at that price for a [gross profit](/grossprofit), before commissions, of $1,000. (i.e., $5 profit x 200 shares). Assuming XYZ just trades up to $52 inside the next 90 days, the expected advance of 4% may be too small to legitimize buying the stock outright.

Options might offer the investor a better alternative to profiting from XYZ's unobtrusive move. The investor anticipates XYZ (which is trading at $50) to move sideways throughout the next 90 days, with an upside target of $52 and a downside target of $49. They could sell at-the-cash (ATM) put options with a [strike price](/strikeprice) of $50 terminating in 90 days and receive a premium of $1.50.

The investor, hence, composes two put option contracts (of 100 shares each) and receives a gross premium of $300 (i.e., $1.50 x 200). On the off chance that XYZ ascends to $52 when the options terminate in 90 days, they will lapse unexercised, and the investor holds the [premium](/option-premium) of $300, less commissions. Be that as it may, assuming XYZ trades below $50 when the options lapse, the investor would be committed to buy the shares at $50.

On the off chance that the investor was incredibly bullish on XYZ's share price and wanted to leverage their trading capital, they could likewise buy [call options](/calloption) as an alternative to buying the stock outright.
