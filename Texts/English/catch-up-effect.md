# Catch-Up Effect
## What Is the Catch-Up Effect?

The catch-up effect is a theory that all economies will eventually unite in terms of [per capita](/percapita) income, due to the perception that underdeveloped economies will quite often develop more quickly than richer economies. As such, the less rich economies will in a real sense "catch-up" to the more robust economies. The catch-up effect is likewise alluded to as the theory of [convergence](/convergence).

## Figuring out the Catch-Up Effect

The catch-up effect, or theory of convergence, is predicated on a couple of key thoughts.

One is the [law of diminishing marginal returns](/lawofdiminishingmarginalreturn) â€” the possibility that as a country contributes and profits, the amount acquired from the investment will eventually decline as the level of investment rises. Each time a country contributes, they benefit somewhat less from that investment. Along these lines, [returns on capital investments](/returnoninvestmentcapital) in capital-rich countries are not generally so large as they would be in emerging nations.

This is backed up by the empirical perception that more [developed economies](/developed-economy) will quite often develop at a slower, however more stable, rate than less developed countries. As per the World Bank, big time salary countries averaged 1.6% [gross domestic product](/gdp) (GDP) growth in 2019, versus 3.6% for middle-income countries and 4.0% GDP growth in low-income countries.

Underdeveloped countries may likewise have the option to experience more fast growth since they can recreate the production methods, innovations, and institutions of developed countries. This is otherwise called a second-mover advantage. Since creating markets approach the innovative ability of the advanced nations, they frequently experienced quick rates of growth.

## Limitations to the Catch-Up Effect

Albeit emerging nations can see quicker [economic growth](/economicgrowth) than additional economically advanced countries, the limitations presented by a lack of capital can incredibly reduce a non-industrial nation's ability to catch up. By and large, a few emerging nations have been exceptionally effective in overseeing resources and tying down capital to productively increase economic [productivity](/productivity); nonetheless, this has not turned into the standard on a global scale.

Economist Moses Abramowitz expounded on the limitations to the catch-up effect. He expressed that for countries to benefit from the catch-up effect, they would have to create and leverage what he called "social capacities." These incorporate the ability to assimilate new technology, draw in capital, and take part in global markets. This means that in the event that technology isn't freely traded, or is restrictively costly, then, at that point, the catch-up effect will not happen.

The adoption of great institutions, particularly with respect to international trade, likewise assumes a part. As indicated by a longitudinal study by economists Jeffrey Sachs and Andrew Warner, national economic policies on [free trade](/free-trade) and transparency are associated with more fast growth. Studying 111 countries from 1970 to 1989, the specialists found that industrialized nations had a growth rate of 2.3% each year per capita, while non-industrial nations with open trade policies had a rate of 4.5%, and emerging nations with more [protectionist](/protectionism) and closed economy policies had a growth rate of just 2%.

One more major snag to the catch-up effect is that per capita income isn't just a function of GDP, yet in addition of a country's population growth. Less developed countries will generally have higher population growth than developed economies. As per the World Bank figures for 2019, more developed countries ([OECD](/oecd) individuals) experienced 0.5% average population growth, while the UN-arranged least developed countries had an average 2.3% population growth rate.

## Illustration of the Catch-Up Effect

During the period between 1911 to 1940, Japan was the quickest developing [economy](/economy) in the world. It colonized and invested vigorously in its neighbors South Korea and Taiwan, adding to their economic growth too. After the Second World War, notwithstanding, Japan's economy lay shredded.

The country modified a sustainable environment for economic growth during the 1950s and started bringing in machinery and technology from the United States. It timed mind blowing growth rates in the period between 1960 to the mid 1980s.

Even as Japan's economy fueled forward, the United States' economy, which was a source for quite a bit of Japan's infrastructural and industrial underpinnings, murmured along. Then by the late 1970s, when the Japanese economy positioned among the world's main five, its growth rate had slowed down.

The economies of the [Asian Tigers](/four-asian-tigers), a moniker used to depict the quick growth of economies in Southeast Asia, have followed a comparable direction, showing fast economic growth during the initial long periods of their development, followed by a more moderate (and declining) growth rate as the economy changes from a creating stage to that of being developed.

## Features
- Agricultural countries can improve their catch-up effect by opening up their economy to free trade and creating "social capacities," or the ability to retain new technology, draw in capital, and take part in global markets.
- It depends on the law of diminishing marginal returns, applied to investment at the national level, and the empirical perception that growth rates will generally slow as an economy matures.
- The catch-up effect is a theory that creating economies will catch up to additional developed economies in terms of per capita income.
