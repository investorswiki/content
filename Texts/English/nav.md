# Net Asset Value - NAV
NAV represents Net Asset Value, and alludes to the price per share of a mutual fund, which is registered toward the end of each trading day in light of the closing prices of the securities inside the mutual fund's portfolio. To get the NAV of a mutual fund, add the total values of a fund's securities, deduct any liabilities, and gap by the number of mutual fund shares outstanding.

## Features
- A company's or alternately fund's shares might trade in the market at levels that digress from its NAV.
- For an investment fund, NAV is calculated toward the end of each trading day in light of the closing market prices of the portfolio's securities. For firms, NAV can be interpreted as close to its book value.
- NAV, is normally utilized as a per-share value calculated for a mutual fund, ETF, or closed-end fund.
- Net asset value, or NAV, is equivalent to a fund's or alternately organization's total assets less its liabilities.
