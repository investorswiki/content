# Yield To Call
## What Is Yield From Call's point of view?

Yield to call (YTC) is a financial term that alludes to the return a bondholder receives assuming the bond is held until the call date, which happens at some point before it arrives at maturity. This number can be mathematically calculated as the compound interest rate at which the current value of a bond's future coupon payments and call price is equivalent to the current market price of the bond.

Yield to call applies to [callable bonds](/callablebond), which are debt instruments that let bond investors reclaim the bonds — or the bond issuer to repurchase them — on what is known as the call date, at a price known as the call price. By definition, the call date of a bond chronologically happens before the [maturity date](/maturitydate).

Generally talking, bonds are callable north of several years. They are ordinarily called at a slight premium over their face value, however the specific [call price ](/callprice)is in view of winning market rates.

## Figuring out Yield To Call

Many bonds are callable, particularly municipal endlessly bonds issued by corporations. Assuming interest rates fall, the company or municipality that issued the bond could opt to pay off the outstanding debt and get new financing at a lower cost.

Ascertaining the yield to call on such bonds is important on the grounds that it uncovers rate of return the investor will receive, expecting:

1. The bond is called on the earliest conceivable date
1. The bond is purchased at the current market price
1. The bond is held until the call date

> The yield to call is widely considered to be a more accurate estimate of expected return on a bond than the [yield to maturity](/yieldtomaturity).

## Ascertaining Yield-To-Call

Albeit the formula used to ascertain the yield to call looks marginally confounded from the beginning, it is very clear.

The complete formula to work out yield to call is:

**P = (C/2) x {(1 - (1 + YTC/2) ^ - 2t)/(YTC/2)} + (CP/(1 + YTC/2) ^ 2t)**

Where:

P = the current market price

C = the annual [coupon](/coupon) payment

CP = the call price

t = the number of years staying until the call date

YTC = the yield to call

In light of this formula, the yield to call can't be addressed for straightforwardly. An iterative cycle must be utilized to track down the yield to call, assuming the calculation is being finished manually. Luckily, numerous computer software programs have a "settle for" function that is fit for working out such values, with a click of the mouse.

## Yield-To-Call Example

For instance, consider a callable bond that has a [face value](/facevalue) of $1,000 and pays a semiannual coupon of 10%. The bond is currently priced at $1,175 and has the option to be called at $1,100 a long time from now. Note that the excess years until maturity doesn't make any difference for this calculation.

Utilizing the above formula, the calculation would be set up as:

$1,175 = ($100/2) x {(1-(1 + YTC/2) ^ - 2(5))/(YTC/2)} + ($1,100/(1 + YTC/2) ^ 2(5))

Through an iterative cycle, it tends to be determined that the yield to call on this bond is 7.43%.

## Features
- The term "yield to call" alludes to the return a bondholder receives in the event that the security is held until the call date, prior to its date of maturity.
- Yield to call can be mathematically calculated, utilizing computer programs.
- Yield to call is applied to callable bonds, which are securities that let bond investors recover the bonds (or the bond issuer to repurchase them) right on time, at the call price.
