# Held Order
## What Is Held Order?

A held order is a market order that requires brief execution for an immediate [fill](/fill). This can be diverged from a [not-held order](/notheldorder), which furnishes brokers with both time and price prudence to try and get a better fill for a customer.

## Grasping Held Order

Much of the time, a trade is expected to be executed at the best offer for buy orders or at the best bid for sell orders. [Market orders](/marketorder) are a common illustration of held orders. While taking care of a held request, traders have next to no watchfulness in finding a price since time is scant. Regularly, they will be required to match the highest bid or most minimal offer to work with an immediate transaction.

For instance, if the [bid-ask market spread](/bid-askspread) in Apple Inc. (AAPL) is $156.90/$157.00 and a trader receives a held order to purchase 100 shares, they would place a buy order at the offer price of $157.00, which would be executed immediately under normal market conditions.

Held orders are utilized by investors who need to change their exposure to a specific stock and need their order(s) executed immediately.

There are times while a submitting held request isn't prudent. One such case is the point at which you are dealing in [illiquid](/illiquid) stocks. Assume a small-cap stock has a wide bid-ask market spread of $1.50/$2.25. A trader who utilizes a held order is forced to pay the 33.3% spread ($0.75/$2.25) to get expeditious execution. In this occasion, the trader might get a better price in the event that they use circumspection and sit at the highest point of the bid and steadily increase the order price to captivate a seller from everywhere. Of course, the 33.3% spread might be a reasonable price to pay assuming the trader is playing a breakout or closing a position that was a [fat finger error](/fat-finger-blunder) in the first place.

## Held Order Uses

Most investors need to get the best price conceivable, however there are three situations that held orders are great for:

1. Trading Breakouts — A held order could be utilized to enter the market on a [breakout](/breakout) on the off chance that the trader needs an immediate entry into a stock and isn't worried about slippage costs. Slippage happens if a [market maker](/marketmaker) changes the spread to their advantage in the wake of getting a market order. In a fast-moving stock, traders are frequently prepared to pay slippage to guarantee they receive an instant fill.
1. Closing an Error Position — Traders might place a held order to unwind a blunder position they need to close immediately to reduce [downside risk](/downsiderisk). For instance, an investor might understand they had purchased some unacceptable stock and would place a held order to rapidly reverse the position before they buy the right security.
1. Hedging — If a trader is taking part in a [hedged](/hedge) order, the hedge ought to be filled at the earliest opportunity after the initial position is laid out so the price of the hedging instrument doesn't change with the end goal that it is at this point not an effective hedge. A held order would be helpful in facilitating this.

## Features
- The benefit of a held order is that the customer will make certain to have executed the whole size of their order, whether a buy or a sale, immediately.
- A held order is given to a broker for brief execution and an immediate fill, for example, with a market order.
- A not-held order, then again, gives a tact to the broker to work the order to try to track down a better price.
