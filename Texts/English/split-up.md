# Split-Up
## What Is a Split-Up?

A split-up is a financial term portraying a [corporate action](/corporateaction) in which a single company splits into at least two independent, separately-run companies. Upon the completion of such occasions, shares of the original company might be traded for shares in one of the new elements at the circumspection of shareholders.

## Understanding Split-Ups

Companies most frequently go through split-ups for two chief reasons:

### Strategic Advantage

A few companies go through split-ups in light of the fact that they are endeavoring to patch up their operations strategically. Such companies might have a broad scope of discrete business lines- - each requiring its own resources, capital financing, and management staff. For such companies, split-ups may enormously benefit [shareholders](/shareholder), in light of the fact that separately dealing with each segment frequently amplifies the profits of every entity. In a perfect world, the combined profits of the isolated substances surpass those of the single entity from which they sprang from.

### Governmental Mandate

Companies frequently split-up due to the intervention of the government, which powers such action trying to limit [monopolistic](/monopoly) rehearses. Be that as it may, it has been a long time since the market has seen a pure monopoly separation, fundamentally on the grounds that [antitrust laws](/antitrust) sanctioned many years prior have largely crushed imposing business models from shaping in any case. Case in point: in the late 1990s, the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) sued Microsoft for supposed monopolistic practices. Curiously, the case ended in a settlement, not a split-up. A few examiners trust that Meta (formerly Facebook), and Google are basically imposing business models that the government must split-up to safeguard consumers.

## Hewlett-Packard: a Case Study

In October 2015, the Hewlett-Packard Company completed a split-up that brought about the official formation of two new substances: HP Inc. what's more, Hewlett-Packard Enterprises. The split-up was executed to strategically silo these two groups, on the grounds that every one zeroed in on various business models. Pointedly: Hewlett-Packard Enterprises markets hardware and software services to large businesses seeking big data storage and cloud computing technology. Then again, HP Inc. focusses on manufacturing personal PCs, printers, and different gadgets geared toward small and medium-sized business owners. This split-up at last permitted every business entity to all the more productively run its own organizational structure, management team, salesforce, [capital allocation strategy](/capital_allocation), and research and development drives.

After the split-up, existing shareholders of the original company and new investors the same were given the opportunity to pick which of the two new substances they wished to acquire shares in. Investors who leaned toward exposure to an insightfully more stable, more slow developing company probably decided on shares in HP Inc., while the people who preferred a more quickly developing entity that could better contend in the crowded IT space probably inclined toward shares in Hewlett-Packard Enterprises.

- After split-ups are complete, shares of the original companies might be traded for shares in any of the new coming about substances, at the financial backer's carefulness.
