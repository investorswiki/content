Construction bonds might come in two parts on bigger projects: One to safeguard against overall job deficiency, and the other to shield against nonpayment of materials from providers and labor from subcontractors.

There are generally three gatherings engaged with a construction bond:

- The investor/project owners, otherwise called the obligee.
- The party or gatherings building the project.

In situations where the contractor defaults or declares [bankruptcy](/bankruptcy), the surety is held responsible for compensating the project owner for any financial loss.
