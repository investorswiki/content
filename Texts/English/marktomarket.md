## What Is Mark to Market (MTM)?

Mark to market (MTM) is a method of measuring the [fair value](/fairvalue) of accounts that can vacillate after some time, like assets and liabilities. Mark to market intends to give a sensible appraisal of a foundation's or alternately company's current financial situation based on current market conditions.

In trading and investing, certain securities, like futures and mutual funds, are additionally marked to market to show the current market value of these investments.

## Understanding Mark to Market (MTM)
### Mark to Market in Accounting

Mark to market is an accounting practice that includes adjusting the value of an asset to mirror its value as determined by current market conditions. The market value is determined based on what a company would get for the asset assuming it was sold by then.

Toward the finish of the [fiscal year](/fiscalyear), a company's [balance sheet](/balancesheet) must mirror the [current market value](/cmv) of certain accounts. Different accounts will keep up with their historical cost, which is the original purchase price of an asset.

### Mark to Market in Financial Services

Organizations in the financial services industry might have to make acclimations to their asset accounts if a few borrowers default on their loans during the year. At the point when these loans have been recognized as [bad debt](/baddebt), the lending company should mark down its assets to fair value using a [contra asset](/contraaccount) account, for example, the "allowance for terrible debts."

A company that offers discounts to its customers to collect rapidly on its [accounts receivables](/accountsreceivable) (AR) should mark its AR to a lower value using a contra asset account.

In this situation, the company would record a debit to accounts receivable and a credit to sales revenue for the full sales price. Then, utilizing an estimate of the percentage of customers expected to take the discount, the company would record a debit to sales discount, a contra revenue account, and a credit to "allowance for sales discount," a contra asset account.

### Mark to Market in Personal Accounting

In personal accounting, the market value is equivalent to the [replacement cost](/replacementcost) of an asset.

For instance, mortgage holder's insurance will list a replacement cost for the value of your home on the off chance that there were ever a need to revamp your home without any preparation. This typically contrasts from the price you originally paid for your home, which is its historical cost to you.

### Mark to Market in Investing

In securities trading, mark to market includes recording the price or value of a security, portfolio, or account to mirror the current market value as opposed to [book value](/bookvalue).

This is done most frequently in [futures](/futures) accounts to guarantee that margin requirements are being met. In the event that the current market value causes the [margin account](/marginaccount) to fall below its required level, the trader will be confronted with a [margin call](/margincall).

[Mutual funds](/mutualfund) are likewise marked to market consistently at the market close with the goal that investors have a better thought of the asset's [net asset value](/nav) (NAV).

## Instances of Mark to Market

An exchange marks traders' accounts to their market values daily by settling the gains and losses that outcome due to changes in the value of the security. There are two counterparties on one or the other side of a futures contract — a [long trader](/long) and a [short trader](/shortselling). The trader who stands firm on the long foothold in the futures contract is generally [bullish](/bull), while the trader shorting the contract is considered [bearish](/bear).

In the event that by the day's end, the futures contract went into goes down in value, the long margin account will be diminished and the short margin account increased to mirror the change in the value of the derivative.

An increase in value brings about an increase in the margin account holding the long position and a decline in the short futures account.

For instance, to [hedge](/hedge) against falling commodity prices, a wheat farmer takes a short position in 10 wheat futures contracts on November 21st. Since each contract addresses 5,000 bushels, the farmer is hedging against a price decline on 50,000 bushels of wheat. Assuming the price of one contract is $4.50 on Nov. 21st. the wheat farmer's account will be recorded as $4.50 x 50,000 bushels = $225,000.

<tr>
<td>5</td><td>$4.39</td><td>-0.07</td><td>+3,500</td><td>+5,500</td><td>230,500</td></tr>
</tbody>
</table>
Since the farmer has a short position in wheat futures, a fall in the value of the contract will bring about an increase in their account. Similarly, an increase in value will bring about a diminishing in account value. For instance, on Day 2, wheat futures increased by $4.55 - $4.50 = $0.05, bringing about a loss for the day of $0.05 x 50,000 bushels = $2,500. While this amount is deducted from the farmer's account balance, the specific amount will be added to the account of the trader on the opposite finish of the transaction holding a long position on wheat futures.

The daily mark to market settlements will go on until the expiration date of the futures contract or until the farmer closes out his position by going long on a contract with a similar maturity.

> Note that the Account Balance is marked daily utilizing the Gain/Loss column. The Cumulative Gain/Loss column shows the net change in the account since day 1.
