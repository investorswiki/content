# Constructive Sale Rule, Section 1259
## What Is Constructive Sale Rule, Section 1259?

The Constructive Sale Rule, Section 1259, is a section of the [Internal Revenue Code](/internal-revenue-code) that extends the types of transactions that are viewed as sales and are subject to [capital gains](/capitalgain) tax. As per this rule, transactions that effectively take an offsetting position to a generally owned position are viewed as constructive sales. The purpose of the constructive sale rule is to keep investors from securing in investment gains without paying capital gains and to limit their ability to transfer gains starting with one tax period then onto the next.

This rule is Section 1259 of the tax code. It is likewise alluded to as "Constructive Sales Treatment for Appreciated Financial Positions."

## Understanding Constructive Sale Rule, Section 1259

This rule was presented by Congress in 1997. Transactions viewed as constructive sales incorporate making [short sales](/shortsale) against comparative or indistinguishable positions (known as "short sales against the case") and going into futures or [forward contracts](/forwardcontract) that call for the delivery of a generally held asset.

There are a few exceptions to the rule that eliminate the need to pay capital gains. For instance, there is an exception for any transaction which would somehow cause a constructive sale during the taxable year in the event that such transaction is closed at the latest the 30th day after the close of such taxable year, and assuming the taxpayer stands firm on the valued financial footing all through the 60-day period beginning on the date such transaction is closed. In the event that these conditions are met, no capital gains tax will be incurred.

It is feasible for constructive sales to have a type of cascade effect where the closure of the position sets off a subsequent constructive sale. Under particular conditions, for example, while the crossing position stays open when a constructive sale happens, yet one more sale can be set off. That would require yet one more valued position to be in place.

## Why the Constructive Sale Rule Was Established

Before this rule, there were widespread constructive sales, especially by hedge funds, as a method for eliminating tax liabilities by slowing down the realization of gains on sales. This was to keep away from the higher tax rates on short-term capital gains.

For instance, without the rule, conspicuous shareholders in a family-controlled company going to open up to the world could borrow shares from their family members to be sold in a constructive sale while keeping up with their own shares. That would permit them to keep up with short and long positions at the same time. Such a practice was employed by individuals from the Lauder family when Est\u00e9e Lauder Companies opened up to the world in 1995 to try not to pay taxes. With the Constructive Sale Rule in place, this practice was put to an end.
