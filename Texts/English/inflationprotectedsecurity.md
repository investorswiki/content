# Inflation-Protected Security (IPS)
## What Is an Inflation-Protected Security (IPS)?

An inflation-protected security (IPS) is a type of fixed-income investment that guarantees a [real rate of return](/realrateofreturn). This implies the annual percentage return realized is adjusted at changes in costs due to [inflation](/inflation) or other outer effects. Communicating rates of return in real values as opposed to in non-inflation-adjusted terms, particularly during periods of high inflation, offers a clearer image of an investment's value.

## Understanding Inflation-Protected Securities (IPS)

Inflation-protected bonds essentially invest in debt securities whose bond principal fluctuates relying upon the rate of inflation. The purpose of inflation-indexed investments is to safeguard an investment's principal and income stream from the destructive power of inflation.

The U.S. federal government is at present the leading issuer of these types of securities, essentially as [Treasury inflation-protected securities](/tips) (TIPS) and Series I savings bonds. Nonetheless, private sector companies likewise offer these inflation-protected products. One model is [corporate inflation-protected securities](/cils) (CIPS), likewise alluded to as inflation-linked bonds. CIPS are the corporate cousin of TIPS. With the corporate rendition, the coupon can have a ceiling or not; it can go from a fixed coupon to a floating one, it very well may be 100% floating and any variation thereof.

All government inflation-indexed securities are benchmarked against the [Consumer Price Index](/consumerpriceindex) (CPI). The CPI measures the prices that consumers pay for much of the time purchased things in such industries as transportation, food, and medical care. A supported increase in the CPI generally shows that inflation is rising and a dollar's purchasing power is falling.

## Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS)

Treasury inflation-protected securities (TIPS) are U.S. Treasury securities that earn a fixed coupon rate and give protection against inflation by adjusting the principal by the rate of inflation. During times of inflation, the principal increases; during times of deflation, the principal diminishes.

Estimated by changes in the Consumer Price Index (CPI) and backed by the government, TIPS can be purchased from a bank, a securities broker, the U.S. Treasury, or a securities dealer. Terms issued are 5, 10, or 30 years, and they are sold in $100 increases.

Interest payments are generated semiannually, with interest applied to the adjusted principal. For instance, consider a TIP with a principal value of $2,000 and a coupon rate of 1% during when the inflation rate is 5%. The principal is adjusted to the rate of inflation, making it $2,100 ($2,000 x 5%). The interest rate is applied to the adjusted principal balance, bringing about a semiannual payment of $10.5 ($2,100 x .5%) or a total annual payment of $21 ($2,100 x 1%).

TIPS can be sold before maturity or held until their maturity date. At the point when TIPS mature, the greater of the original principal or adjusted principal is paid.

## Protecting Fixed Payouts from Inflation

Assuming a savings vehicle is delivering a fixed payout, for example, a pension or Social Security, inflation can reduce the value of that payout likewise. Another model is [certificates of deposit](/certificateofdeposit) (CDs), which investors frequently use to safely watch out for their money and stay away from the promising and less promising times of higher-risk assets, like stock and bonds. In any case, for long-term investors, CDs might introduce an alternate type of risk that can be just essentially as unsafe as market risk â€” the risk of inflation. On the off chance that the return on an investment doesn't essentially keep up with the rate of inflation, it will bring about the loss of purchasing power over the long term.

To illustrate, assuming a 5-year CD yielded 2%, yet inflation became by an average of 2.5% during that time span, an investor's real rate of return would have been - 0.5%. All in all, the investor would have lost money on the grounds that the investment didn't keep up with the rate of inflation.

There are strategies an investor can utilize to shield their money from inflation. To keep pace with inflation, investors can invest in Treasury-inflation-protected securities (TIPS), whose principal is adjusted for inflation and deflation. For instance, during times of inflation, the principal is increased by the rate of inflation, and its fixed coupon rate is applied to the adjusted principal.

Stocks have generally outpaced inflation and could be a decent vehicle for investors with higher risk resistances. For the risk-unwilling, mutual funds, precious metals, and exchange-traded funds (ETF) may be a practical option since they are not as sensitive to market changes likewise with stocks.

For the individuals who need to expect no risk, high-yield fixed accounts might be a positive option. Albeit these accounts may not keep pace with inflation, they actually offer higher yields than traditional savings accounts.
