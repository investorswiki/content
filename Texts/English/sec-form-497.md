## What Is SEC Form 497?

SEC Form 497 is a regulatory document that investment companies, for example, [mutual funds](/mutualfund) use to file their definitive materials in the Securities and Exchange Commission's ([SEC's](/sec)) Electronic Data Gathering, Analysis, and Retrieval ([EDGAR](/edgar)) filing system.

Definitive materials incorporate such documents as proxy statements, prospectus publications, annual and semiannual mutual fund shareholder reports, [Statements of Additional Information (SAI)](/sai), just to give some examples common models.

In the U.S., all companies that file with the SEC must give and transfer their documentation to the EDGAR website. This electronic depository permits investors to access every one of the filings of a specific company. Documents that can be recovered on EDGAR incorporate quarterly and annual corporate reports and financial statements. [Form 10-K](/10-k) and [Form 10-Q](/10q) can likewise be accessed utilizing EDGAR.

Form 10-K gives an itemized company history, examined financial statements, and a description of products and services, alongside an annual survey of the organization, its operations, and the markets where the company works. Form 10-Q is a quarterly report that incorporates unaudited financial statements and information about a company's operations during the previous three months.

## Exemptions to Filing SEC Form 497

The Securities Act of 1933, commonly known as "reality in securities" law, satisfies two primary missions. One is to guarantee that investors approach thorough financial statements and other important information about securities that are publicly accessible for purchase. The other is to disallow the distribution of underhanded and fraudulent information by the companies that sell the securities.

To assist with upholding these pronouncements, the SEC requires that securities accessible for public sale in the U.S. generally must be registered with the Commission. Notwithstanding, the SEC takes into account a few special cases for this rule.

As per the SEC, specific exemptions from the registration requirement include:

- Private offerings that are made accessible just to a small number of people or foundations
- Offerings of limited size
- Intrastate offerings
- Securities of municipal, state, and federal legislatures

By exempting scores of smaller offerings from the registration requirement, the SEC assists with bringing down the cost of security offerings to the public.
