# 52-Week High/Low
## What Is 52-Week High/Low?

The 52-week high/low is the highest and lowest price at which a security, like a stock, has traded during the time span that compares to one year.

## Grasping the 52-Week High/Low

A 52-week high/low is a [technical indicator](/technicalindicator) utilized by some [traders](/merchant) and investors who view these figures as an important factor in the analysis of a stock's current value and as a predictor of its future price movement. An investor might show increased interest in a specific stock as its price approaches either the high or the low finish of its 52-week price range (the reach that exists between the 52-week low and the 52-week high).

The 52-week high/low depends on the daily [closing price](/closingprice) for the security. Frequently, a stock may really breach a 52-week high intraday, yet wind up closing below the previous 52-week high, in this way going unnoticed. Similar applies when a stock makes another 52-week low during a trading session yet neglects to close at another 52-week low. In these cases, the inability to register as having made another closing 52-week high/low can be extremely critical.

One way that the 52-week high/low figure is utilized is to assist with determining an entry or exit point for a given stock. For instance, [stock traders](/stock-merchant) may buy a stock when the price surpasses its 52-week high, or sell when the price falls below its 52-week low. That's what the reasoning behind this strategy is on the off chance that a price breaks out from its [52-week range](/52-week-range) (either above or below that reach), there must be a factor that created sufficient momentum to proceed with the price movement in a similar course. While utilizing this strategy, an investor might use [stop-orders](/stoporder) to start new positions or extra to existing positions.

It is entirely expected for the volume of trading of a given stock to spike once it crosses a 52-week barrier. Research has exhibited this, as a matter of fact. As per a study called "Volume and Price Patterns Around a Stock's 52-Week Highs and Lows: Theory and Evidence," led by financial specialists at Pennsylvania State University, the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, and the University of California, Davis in 2008, small stocks crossing their 52-week highs delivered 0.6275% excess gains in the following week. Correspondingly, large stocks created gains of 0.1795% in the following week. Over the long haul, in any case, the effect of 52-week highs (and lows) turned out to be more articulated for large stocks. On an overall basis, be that as it may, these trading ranges affected small stocks instead of large stocks.

## 52-Week High/Low Reversals

A stock that arrives at a 52-week high intraday, however closes negative around the same time, may have finished out. This means that its price may not go a lot higher in the close to term. This can be determined on the off chance that it forms a daily [shooting star](/shootingstar), which happens when a security trades essentially higher than its opening, however declines later in the day to close either below or close to its opening price. Frequently, experts, and institutions, utilize 52-week highs as an approach to setting [take-profit](/take-profitorder) orders as an approach to locking in gains. They may likewise utilize 52-week lows to determine [stop-loss](/stop-lossorder) levels as a method for limiting their losses.

Given the vertical bias inherent in the stock markets, a 52-week high addresses [bullish sentiment](/bull) in the market. There are normally a lot of investors prepared to surrender a further price appreciation to lock in some or their gains in general. Stocks making new 52-week highs are frequently the most vulnerable to profit taking, bringing about pullbacks and trend inversions.

Likewise, when a stock makes another 52-week low intra-day yet neglects to register another closing 52-week low, it could be an indication of a base. This can be determined on the off chance that it forms a daily [hammer candlestick](/hammer), which happens when a security trades fundamentally lower than its opening, however energizes later in the day to close either above or close to its opening price. This can trigger [short-sellers](/shortsale) to start buying to cover their positions, and can likewise urge bargain trackers to start taking actions. Stocks that make five successive daily 52-week lows are generally defenseless to seeing strong bobs when a daily hammer forms.

## 52-Week High/Low Example

Assume that stock ABC trades at a pinnacle of $100 and a low of $75 in a year. Then its 52-week high/low price is $100 and $75. Regularly, $100 is viewed as a resistance level while $75 is viewed as a support level. This means that traders will start selling the stock once it arrives at that level and they will start purchasing it once it comes to $75. On the off chance that it breaks either end of the reach definitively, traders will start new long or short positions, contingent upon whether the 52-week high or 52-week low was breached.
