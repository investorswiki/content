# Man-Year
## What Is a Man-Year?

A man-year, or individual year, is a unit of measurement for the amount of work done by an individual all through the whole year, communicated in the number of hours. The man-year requires the number of hours worked by an individual during the week and increases it by 52.

## How Man-Years Work

Determined, the man-year might be different for different industries or organizations relying upon the average number of hours worked every week, the number of weeks worked each year, and deductions, if any, for official holidays. The U.S. Postal Service computes a man-year on a clear basis: 40 hours of the week x 52 weeks, or 2,080 hours. The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) of the executive branch sets 1,776 hours as an individual year, taking into consideration holiday time.

Computing the man-year will rely upon each company and their own purposes for the measurement. The pure definition of a man-year normally rejects holidays, yet additionally break time during the working day for lunch, 15-minute breaks, and different sorts of time off. Accordingly, the man-year ought to just reflect genuine hours worked or worked.

## Ascertaining the Man-Year

There are two primary justifications for why an organization might compute the man-year applicable to its employees. For one's purposes, that organization might utilize the man-year alongside sales or cost figures as a performance metric. For instance, a company might compute a sales each man-year metric and compare it to values from previous years. By knowing the man-year metric front and center, companies can then better ascertain their return each hour of work improved compute productivity or per-individual contribution towards sales or the ultimate revenue metric.

The second explanation a company would compute the man-year would be for budgetary reasons. For instance, a corporation might compute the total man-years for different offices that it works and designate [budgets](/budget) as per office size. Or on the other hand, to carry out cost correlations for a specific job or task, an organization or firm can estimate the number of work hours required and partition this number by a man-year to decide the number of full-time equivalent (FTE) positions required. Contractors bidding for the job would present their FTE estimates, and these estimates would be considered for the granting of the contract. In different cases, managers can utilize man-hours to compute the amount of staff expected to complete a project to make a contract timeline.
