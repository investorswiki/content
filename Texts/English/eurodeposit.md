## What Is an Euro Deposit?

An euro deposit is a deposit of foreign funds into a bank that operates inside the European banking system. These banks function on the consolidated European currency — the euro. At the point when an outside investor deposits foreign currency into one of these banks, they are really depositing in euros. By placing money into an European bank account, the account holder might hope to accrue interest at the [floating interest) not entirely settled by the [European Central Bank (ECB)](/europeancentralbank).

## How an Euro Deposit Works

An euro deposit can be a method for a foreign citizen, or company, to safeguard their money on the off chance that their home currency pointedly loses value. Banks can specify essentials for these foreign deposits. European banks have generally paid customers liberal interest rates for "[parking](/parking)" their money in these accounts. This practice energizes rich customers and large companies to keep a more significant amount of money in these European accounts.

Nonetheless, in 2014, the European Central Bank (ECB) lowered interest rates to below zero interestingly. The rate has consistently fallen from that point forward, presently at its lowest rate ever — a negative 0.5% as of November 27, 2020.

This lower interest rate implied overwhelming negative interest rates on deposits. Numerous international banks deposit their funds in the ECB. At the point when the ECB initiated [negative interest rates](/negative-interest-rate), those foreign banks, basically, started paying to park funds in the ECB. Since negative interest rates brought about a loss of revenue for the banks, many selected to give those costs to their customers.

## Special Considerations

Banks in the U.S, for example, JPMorgan Chase and Bank of New York Mellon, began charging customers for euro deposits recently. In mid 2017, the Swiss bank UBS started monumental a charge for deposits more than 1,000,000 euros.

UBS said the move mirrored "the rising costs seen across the industry of reinvesting cash from deposits in money and capital markets, the proceeded with exceptionally low (negative) interest rates in the euro area and increased liquidity regulations."

Numerous central banks around the world have lowered interest rates to below zero. Japan's central bank, the [Bank of Japan (BoJ)](/bankofjapan), chose in 2016 to lower its interest rate to negative 0.1%, which is where it remains as of October 2020. However Japanese banks were initially hesitant to pass the costs onto customers, many have forced fees for larger customers to compensate for contracting profit edges. As per the Japanese bank, customers wouldn't be charged without their consent, however the bank would decline to allow further deposits in the event that the customer would not pay the fee.

A few banks have selected not to pass the costs of negative interest rates onto customers. Some have said they feared a reaction from customers, which could bring about lost accounts.
