# Equity Accounting
## What Is Equity Accounting?

Equity accounting is an accounting cycle for recording investments in associated companies or substances. Companies in some cases have ownership interests in different companies. Normally, equity accounting-likewise called the [equity method](/equitymethod)- is applied when an investor or holding entity claims 20-half of the [voting stock](/votingshares) of the associate company. The equity method of accounting is utilized just when an investor or investing company can apply a huge influence over the investee or owned company.

## Understanding Equity Accounting

While utilizing the [equity method](/equitymethod), an investor perceives just its share of the profits and losses of the investee, meaning it records a proportion of the profits in view of the percentage of ownership interest. These profits and losses are additionally reflected in the financial accounts of the investee. Assuming the investing entity records any profit or loss, it is thought about its [income statement](/incomestatement).

Additionally, the initial investment amount in the company is recorded as a [asset](/asset) on the investing company's [balance sheet](/balancesheet). Be that as it may, changes in the investment value are additionally recorded and adjusted on the investor's balance sheet. At the end of the day, profit increases of the investee would increase the investment value, while losses would diminish the investment amount on the balance sheet.

At the point when there's a lot of money invested in a company by another company, the investor can apply influence over the financial and operating choices, which at last effects the financial consequences of the investee.

While no exact measure can check a precise level of influence, several common indicators of operational and financial policies include:

The cost method of accounting records the cost of the investment as an asset at its historical cost. Notwithstanding, the value of the asset doesn't change whether or not the investee reported profits or losses. Then again, the equity method makes periodic acclimations to the value of the asset on the investor's balance sheet since they have a 20%-half controlling investment interest in the investee.
