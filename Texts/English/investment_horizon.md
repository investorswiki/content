# Investment Horizon
## What Is an Investment Horizon?

Investment horizon is the term used to portray the total period of time that an investor hopes to hold a security or a portfolio.

## Fundamentals of Investment Horizon

Investment horizons can go from short-term, just a couple of days long, to significantly longer term, possibly spanning many years. For instance, a youthful professional with a [401(k) plan](/401kplan) would have an investment horizon that would span many years. In any case, an enterprise's treasury department could have an investment horizon that is a couple of days long.

As a matter of fact, some [trading strategies](/trading-system), particularly those in view of technical analysis, can utilize investment horizons of days, hours, or even minutes.

The length of an investment horizon will frequently determine how much risk an investor is presented to and what their income needs are. Generally, when portfolios have a shorter investment horizon, that means investors will face less risk. At the point when investors build an investment portfolio, laying out an investment horizon is one of the initial steps they need to take.

## Investment Horizons and Portfolio Construction

At the point when investors have a longer investment horizon, they can face more risk, challenges the market has numerous years to recuperate in the event of a pullback. For instance, an investor with an investment horizon of 30 years would normally have the majority of their assets allocated to equities.

Past that, an investor with a long time horizon might invest their assets in what are viewed as riskier types of equities, like mid-cap and little cap stocks. These types of stocks, or [sub-asset classes](/subasset_class), will generally display a lot bigger price swings throughout short time spans than do enormous cap stocks since they will more often than not be less deeply grounded and are more powerless to outside economic powers.

Consequently, while they might be risky for investors with shorter investment horizons, these short-term swings no affect investors hoping to hold on to those stocks for the next 30 years.

Investors adjust their portfolio as their investment horizon shortens, ordinarily toward lessening the portfolio's degree of risk. For instance, most retirement portfolios decline their exposure to equities and increase their holdings of fixed income assets as they close to retirement. Fixed-income investments normally give a lower possible return over an extended time relative to stocks, yet they add stability to a portfolio's value since they regularly experience less articulated short-term price swings.
