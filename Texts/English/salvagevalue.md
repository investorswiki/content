# Salvage Value
## What Is Salvage Value?

Salvage value is the estimated book value of a [asset](/asset) after [depreciation](/depreciation) is complete, in light of what a company hopes to receive in exchange for the asset toward the finish of its [useful life](/usefullife). Thusly, an asset's estimated salvage value is an important part in the calculation of a depreciation schedule.

## Understanding Salvage Value

An estimated salvage value still up in the air for any asset that a company will be deteriorating on its books over the long haul. Each company will have its own standards for assessing salvage value. A few companies might decide to constantly devalue an asset to $0 in light of the fact that its salvage value is so negligible. As a general rule, the salvage value is important in light of the fact that it will be the carrying value of the asset on a company's books after depreciation has been fully expensed. It depends on the value a company hopes to receive from the sale of the asset toward the finish of its helpful life. At times, salvage value may just be a value the company accepts it can get by selling a depreciated, inoperable asset for parts.

### Depreciation and Salvage Value Assumptions

Companies think about the matching principle while making assumptions for asset depreciation and salvage value. The matching principle is a [accrual accounting](/accrualaccounting) concept that requires a company to perceive expense in similar period as the connected revenues are earned. Assuming a company expects that an asset will add to revenue for a long period of time, it will have a long, valuable life.

On the off chance that a company isn't certain of an asset's helpful life, it might estimate a lower number of years and a higher salvage value to carry the asset on its books after full depreciation or sell the asset at its salvage value. If a company has any desire to front load depreciation expenses, it can utilize a [accelerated depreciation](/accelerateddepreciation) method that deducts more depreciation expenses upfront. Many companies utilize a salvage value of $0 in light of the fact that they accept that an asset's utilization has fully matched its expense recognition with revenues over its helpful life.

## Depreciation Methods

There are several assumptions required for creating depreciation schedules. There are five primary methods of depreciation financial accountants can browse: [straight-line](/straightlinebasis), [declining balance](/decliningbalancemethod), [double-declining balance](/double-declining-balance-depreciation-method), [sum-of-years digits](/sum-of-the-years-digits), and [units of production](/unit-of-production-method). The declining balance, double-declining balance, and sum of years digits methods are accelerated depreciation methods with higher depreciation expense upfront in prior years.

Every one of these methods requires consideration for salvage value. An asset's depreciable amount is its total [accumulated depreciation](/accumulated-depreciation) after all depreciation expense has been recorded, which is likewise the consequence of [historical cost](/historical-cost) minus salvage value. The carrying value of an asset as it is being depreciated is its historical cost minus accumulated depreciation to date.

### Straight-Line Depreciation

Straight line depreciation is generally the most essential depreciation method. It incorporates equivalent depreciation expenses every year all through the whole helpful life until the whole asset is depreciated to its salvage value.

Assume, for instance, that a company purchases a machine at a cost of $5,000. The company settles on a salvage value of $1,000 and a helpful life of five years. In view of these assumptions, the annual depreciation utilizing the straight-line method is: ($5,000 cost - $1,000 salvage value)/5 years, or $800 each year. This outcomes in a depreciation percentage of 20% ($800/$4,000).

### Declining Balance

The declining balance method is an accelerated depreciation method. This method devalues the machine at its straight line depreciation percentage times its excess depreciable amount every year. Since an asset's carrying value is higher in prior years, a similar percentage causes a bigger depreciation expense amount in prior years, declining every year.

Utilizing the model over, the machine costs $5,000, has a salvage value of $1,000, a 5-year life, and is depreciated at 20% every year, so the expense is $800 in the primary year ($4,000 depreciable amount * 20%), $640 in the subsequent year (($4,000 - $800) * 20%, etc.

### Double-Declining Balance

The double-declining balance (DDB) method utilizes a depreciation rate that is two times the rate of straight-line depreciation. In the machine model, the depreciation percentage is 20%. In this manner, the DDB method would record depreciation expenses at (20% x 2) or 40% of the excess depreciable amount each year.

Both declining balance and DDB require a company to set an initial salvage value to decide the depreciable amount.

### Sum-of-Years Digits

This method makes a portion for depreciation calculations. Utilizing the model above, assuming the valuable life is five years the denominator is 5+4+3+2+1=15. The numerator is the number of years left in the asset's helpful life. The depreciation expense division for every one of the five years is then 5/15, 4/15, 3/15, 2/15, and 1/15. Each division is duplicated times the total depreciable amount.

### Units of Production

This method requires an estimate for the total units an asset will create over its helpful life. Depreciation expense is then calculated each year founded on the number of units created. This method additionally ascertains depreciation expenses in light of the depreciable amount.

## Features
- Salvage value is the book value of an asset after all depreciation has been fully expensed.
- Salvage value will influence the total depreciable amount a company involves in its depreciation schedule.
- The salvage value of an asset depends on what a company hopes to receive in exchange for selling or separating out the asset toward the finish of its helpful life.
- Companies might deteriorate their assets fully to $0 on the grounds that the salvage value is so negligible.
