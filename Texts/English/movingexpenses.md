# Moving Expenses
## What are moving expenses?
Moving expenses are costs incurred when you move on account of your job. The expenses are deductible in the event that they are reasonable costs for moving yourself, your family and your assets. In any case, you can never again deduct the cost of dinners while moving.
## More profound definition
Moving is costly, however not all moving expenses are tax deductible. The IRS has a three-section test to tell whether moving expenses can be deducted.
- Your move must be associated with a new position or relocation for work.
- Your new working environment must be somewhere around 50 miles farther from your old home than your old job location was from your old home.
- You must work full time for a very long time in the 12 months following the move. Self-employed taxpayers must labor for a very long time in the 12 months and 78 weeks in the next 24 months.

Common moving expenses:
- A moving van.
- Movers/work.
- Airfare or travel to your new city.
- Boxes and pressing supplies.

Expenses that are not deductible:
- Punishments for breaking a lease.
- Mortgage punishments.
- House hunting expenses.
- Real estate representative's fees.
- Rent for transitory housing.

A more exhaustive rundown of tax-deductible moving expenses can be found in IRS Publication 521.
## Moving expense model
You acknowledge another full-time job that requires moving from Georgia to California. You sell your home through a real estate agent and hire movers. After your furniture is all pressed, you and your family fly to California and move into a condo that you will rent until you find another home to purchase.
In this model, the move meets the IRS criteria. The move is business related, it is a full-time position and it is in excess of 50 miles away. The movers and the family's airfare are tax deductible. The real estate fees and condo rent are not, even however they are expenses the family incurred due to the move.
