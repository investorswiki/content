The predefined price the put option buyer can sell at is called the [strike price](/strikeprice).

For instance, in the event that an investor has a sizable long position in XYZ stock, they can purchase a [protective put](/protective-put).

To swap the risk of default, the lender purchases a CDS from another investor who consents to repay the lender in the case the borrower defaults. Most CDS contracts are kept up with by means of a progressing [premium](/premium) payment like the standard premiums due on an insurance policy.

An EDS is to some degree comparable to a credit default swap (CDS). Just they don't make preparations for credit risk, as equities don't have the very type of exposure that bonds, mortgages, and different forms of debt do. All things considered, equities are presented to [market risk](/marketrisk), and an equity default swap is intended to safeguard against a specific amount of decline in the value of the reference equity.

Reference equities are utilized related to a specific equity event while characterizing the terms of an equity default swap contract, with the terms likewise including the length of the contract. The reference equity is utilized by the equity default swap buyer while purchasing a contract from the [swap dealer](/swap-dealer). The option buyer pays a fee or premium to the seller, and the seller consents to pay the buyer on the off chance that the value of the reference equity falls.

The amount of money that an EDS buyer gets from the EDS seller is dependent based on the conditions of the agreement. At times, the seller will be required to make a payment proportional to the value of the reference equity after the equity event happens, while in different cases, the EDS seller will be required to pay a fixed amount. The fixed amount is generally equivalent to the [notional principal amount](/notionalprincipalamount) of the EDS increased by a [recovery rate](/recovery-rate).
