# Quantum Computing
Quantum computing works utilizing particles that can be in superposition. These particles address qubits rather than bits and can take the value of 1, 0 or both all the while.

## Features
- This is not normal for classical computers, where adding more semiconductors just adds power linearly.
- Quantum computing is comprised of qubits.
- The power of quantum computers develops dramatically with more qubits.
- Dissimilar to a normal computer bit, which can be 0 or 1, a qubit can be both of those, or a superposition of both 0 and 1.
- Quantum computing is the study of how to involve peculiarities in quantum physical science to make better approaches for computing.
