## How the Total Expense Ratio (TER) Works

The size of the TER is important to investors as the costs are removed from the fund, influencing investors' [returns](/return). For instance, on the off chance that a fund creates a return of 7% for the year however has a TER of 4%, the 7% gain is incredibly reduced to generally 3%.

The TER gives a way to the annual costs of running a specific fund to be covered. It takes the realized costs associated with the fund's all's operation and communicates them as a single number, generally as a percentage, drawing its basis from the assets associated with the fund. This means that the amount gave as the TER is dependent on the progress of the specific fund.

The more [actively managed](/activemanagement) the fund, the higher the associated TER. This is due to increased work force costs, as well as increased exchange based fees â€” the fund manager pays a brokerage fee each time a buy and sell trade is executed. By comparison, an automated or [passive](/passiveinvesting) fund has essentially lower costs of operation, bringing about a lower TER.

An investment company and its fund managers might consent to defer certain fees following the send off of another fund to keep the expense ratio lower for investors.

The TER addresses the fees charged to the fund after any waivers, reimbursements, and recoupments have been made. These fee reductions are regularly for a predefined time frame outline, after which the fund might cause every single full cost.
