## What Is Subjective Probability?

Subjective likelihood is a type of likelihood derived from an individual's personal judgment or own experience about whether a specific outcome is probably going to happen. It contains no conventional estimations and just mirrors the subject's viewpoints and past experience. An illustration of subjective likelihood is a "intuition" while making a trade.

## How Subjective Probability Works

Subjective probabilities vary from one person to another and contain a high degree of personal bias. Subjective likelihood can be stood out from [objective probability](/objective-likelihood), which is the processed likelihood that an event will happen in light of an analysis in which each measure depends on a recorded perception or a long history of collected data.

The [probability of an event](/probabilitydistribution) depends on the probability of that event happening. In many forms of likelihood, quantitative data is accumulated and deciphered to assist with deciding this probability through a mathematical mechanism, ordinarily connecting with the mathematical field of statistics. The percentage chance of a flipped coin landing on heads or tails can be deciphered as a likelihood, communicated as a half chance that it will land heads up, and a half chance it will land tails up.

Subjective likelihood, then again, is highly flexible, even in terms of one individual's conviction. While an individual might accept the chance of a predetermined event happening is 25%, they could have an alternate conviction when given a specific reach from which to pick, for example, 25% to 30%. This can happen even assuming that no extra hard data is behind the change.

Subjective likelihood can be impacted by different personal convictions held by an individual. These could relate back to childhood as well as different events the person has seen all through his life. Even on the off chance that the individual's conviction can be normally made sense of, it doesn't make the prediction an undeniable reality. It is in many cases in light of how every individual deciphers the data introduced to him.

## Illustration of Subjective Probability

An illustration of subjective likelihood is asking New York Yankees fans, before the baseball season begins, about the chances of New York winning the World Series. While there is no absolute mathematical proof behind the response to the model, fans could in any case reply in genuine percentage terms, for example, the Yankees having a 25% chance of winning the World Series.

In another scenario, consider a person who is requested to foresee the percentage chance from whether a flipped coin will land with heads or tails up, his initial response might be the mathematically true half. In the event that 10 coin flips happen, all subsequent in the coin landing tails up, the person might change his percentage chance to a number other than half, for example, saying its chance landing tails up is 75%. Even realizing that the new prediction is mathematically off base, the individual's personal experience of the previous 10 coin flips has caused a situation in which he decides to utilize subjective likelihood.

## Highlights
- Subjective likelihood is a type of likelihood derived from an individual's personal judgment or own experience about whether a specific outcome is probably going to happen.
- Subjective probabilities contrast from one person to another and contain a high degree of personal bias.
- It contains no conventional estimations and just mirrors the subject's viewpoints and past experience as opposed to on data or calculation.
