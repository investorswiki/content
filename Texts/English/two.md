## History of the TPEx

Over-the-counter (OTC) trading of securities in Taiwan started in Feb. 1988 under the management of the Taipei Securities Dealers Association (the ancestor of the present Taiwan Securities Association). In 1993, the Ministry of Finance (MOF) wanted a more robust capital market with better OTC trading capabilities and set up an OTC center as a non-benefit institution to advance the development of the OTC market in Taiwan. The TPEx was officially settled by the Securities and Exchange Act on Nov. 1, 1994, and took over OTC trading.
