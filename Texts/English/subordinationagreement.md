# Subordination Clause

A subordination clause is a clause in an agreement which states that the current claim on any debts will take priority over some other claims framed in different agreements made from here on out. Subordination is the act of yielding priority.

## Breaking Down Subordination Clause

At the point when a house is dispossessed and liquidated for cash, the [first mortgage](/first_mortgage) lender gets first dibs on the sale proceeds. Any money that remains is utilized to pay down a [second mortgage](/secondmortgage, etc. The further down the mortgage tier a [claimant](/subordinateddebt) sits, the less chance it has of recuperating its loan amount. To change the priority of a loan in the event of default, a lender might demand a subordination clause, without which loans take sequential priority.

A subordination clause effectively settles on the current claim in the agreement senior to whatever other agreements that show up after the original agreement. These clauses are most usually found in mortgage contracts and [bond issue](/bond) agreements. For instance, on the off chance that a company issues bonds in the market with a subordination clause, that's what it guarantees assuming more bonds are issued from now on, the original bondholders will receive payment before the company pays any remaining debt issued after it. This is added protection for the original bondholders as the probability of them getting their investment back is higher with a subordination clause.

Subordination clauses are most ordinarily found in mortgage refinancing agreements. Think about a homeowner with a primary mortgage and a subsequent mortgage. In the event that the homeowner refinances his primary mortgage, this in effect means dropping the main mortgage and reissuing another one. At the point when this occurs, the subsequent mortgage climbs the tier to primary status, and the new mortgage becomes subordinate to the subsequent mortgage. Due to this change in priority, most first lenders expect that the subsequent lender give and consent to a subordination arrangement, consenting to stay in its original secondary position. Ordinarily, this interaction is a standard strategy of a refinance. Yet, assuming the borrower's financial situation has deteriorated, or on the other hand in the event that the value of the property has fundamentally declined, the second mortgage creditor might be reluctant to execute the subordination clause.

In the event that the second lien holder gives a subordination clause, it permits the primary mortgages on a similar property to have a higher claim. Should repayment become an issue, for example, in bankruptcy, the subordinate loans would fall behind the original mortgage, and may not be paid by any means.
