# Gini Index
## What Is the Gini Index?

The Gini index, or Gini coefficient, measures [income](/income) distribution across a population. Developed by the Italian statistician Corrado Gini in 1912, it frequently fills in as a check of [economic inequality](/income-inequality), measuring income distribution or, less commonly, wealth distribution among a population.

The coefficient goes from 0 (or 0%) to 1 (or 100%), with 0 addressing perfect uniformity and 1 addressing perfect inequality. Values more than 1 are hypothetically conceivable due to negative income or wealth.

## Understanding the Gini Index

A country wherein each resident has a similar income would have an income Gini coefficient of 0. Conversely, a country in which one resident earned all the income, while every other person didn't earn anything, would have an income Gini coefficient of 1.

A similar analysis can apply to [wealth](/wealth) distribution (the "wealth Gini coefficient"), but since wealth is more hard to measure than income, Gini coefficients normally allude to income and show up basically as the "Gini coefficient" or "Gini index," without indicating that they allude to income. Wealth Gini coefficients will quite often be a lot higher than those for income.

The Gini coefficient is an important instrument for investigating income or wealth distribution inside a country or region, yet it ought not be confused with an absolute measurement of income or wealth. A high-income country and a low-income one can have a similar Gini coefficient, for however long incomes are distributed much the same way inside each: For example, Turkey and the United States both have income Gini coefficients of around 0.39-0.40, according to the [Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD)](/oecd), notwithstanding Turkey's boundlessly lower [gross domestic product (GDP) per person](/per-capita-gdp).

## Graphical Representation of the Gini Index

The Gini index is frequently addressed graphically through the [Lorenz curve](/lorenz-curve), which shows income (or wealth) distribution by plotting the population percentile by income on the horizontal pivot and cumulative income on the vertical hub. The Gini coefficient is equivalent to the area below the line of perfect correspondence (0.5 by definition) minus the area below the Lorenz curve, partitioned by the area below the line of perfect equity. All in all, it is double the area between the Lorenz curve and the line of perfect correspondence.

In the graph below, the 47th percentile corresponds to 10.46% in Haiti and 17.42% in Bolivia, meaning that the base 47% of Haitians take in 10.46% of their country's total income and the base 47% of Bolivians take in 17.42% of theirs. The straight line addresses a speculatively equivalent society: The base 47% take in 47% of national income.

To estimate the income Gini coefficient for Haiti in 2012, we would find the area below its Lorenz curve: around 0.2. Taking away that figure from 0.5 (the area under the line of balance), we get 0.3, which we then partition by 0.5. This yields a rough Gini of 0.6 or 60%.

One more perspective about the Gini coefficient is as a measure of deviation from perfect uniformity. The further a Lorenz curve strays from the perfectly equivalent straight line (which addresses a Gini coefficient of 0), the higher the Gini coefficient and the less equivalent the society. In the model above, Haiti is more inconsistent than Bolivia.

## The Gini Index Around the World
### Global Gini

The Gini coefficient experienced supported growth during the nineteenth and twentieth hundreds of years. In 1820, the global Gini coefficient remained at 0.50, while in 1980 and 1992, the figure was 0.657.

COVID-19 is probably going to adversely affect income fairness. According to the [World Bank](/worldbank), the Gini coefficient has generally increased around 1.5 points in the five years following major scourges, like Ebola and Zika. Economists accept COVID-19 set off an annual 1.2 to 1.9 percentage points increase in the Gini coefficient for 2020 and 2021.

### Gini inside countries

Below are the income Gini coefficients of each and every country for which the CIA World Factbook gives data:

A portion of the world's most unfortunate countries have a portion of the world's highest Gini coefficients, while a considerable lot of the lowest Gini coefficients are found in wealthier European countries. Nonetheless, the relationship between income inequality and GDP per capita isn't one of perfect negative correlation, and the relationship has shifted over the long run.

Michail Moatsos of Utrecht University and Joery Baten of Tuebingen University show that from 1820 to 1929, inequality rose somewhat — then, at that point, eased off — as GDP per capita increased. From 1950 to 1970, inequality would in general fall off as GDP per capita transcended a certain threshold. From 1980 to 2000, inequality fell with higher GDP per capita then curved back up strongly.

## Limitations of the Gini Index

However helpful for investigating economic inequality, the Gini coefficient has a few shortcomings.

The metric's precision is dependent on solid GDP and income data. Shadow economies and casual economic activity are available in each country. Casual economic activity will in general address a bigger portion of true economic production in emerging nations and at the lower end of the income distribution inside countries. In the two cases, this means that the Gini index of measured incomes will exaggerate true income inequality. Accurate wealth data is even more hard to come by due to the notoriety of tax shelters.

Another flaw is that altogether different income distributions can result in indistinguishable Gini coefficients. Since the Gini endeavors to distil a two-layered area (the gap between the Lorenz curve and the uniformity line) down to a single number, it clouds data about the "shape" of inequality. In regular terms, this would be like depicting the contents of a photograph exclusively by its length along one edge, or the simple average splendor value of the pixels.

However utilizing the Lorenz curve as a supplement can give more data in this respect, it likewise doesn't show demographic varieties among subgroups inside the distribution, like the distribution of incomes across age, race, or social gatherings. Along those lines, understanding demographics can be important for understanding what a given Gini coefficient addresses. For instance, a huge resigned population pushes the Gini higher.

## What Country Has the Highest Gini Index?

South Africa, with a Gini coefficient of 63.0, is presently recognized as the country with the highest income inequality. The World Population Review credits this monstrous inequality to racial, orientation, and geographic discrimination, with white guys and urban workers in South Africa earning much better salaries than every other person.

## What Does a Gini Index of 50 Mean?

The Gini index goes from 0% to 100%, with 0 addressing perfect balance and 100 addressing perfect inequality. A Gini of 50 denotes the midpoint and can generally be perceived as a place where income isn't genuinely distributed — just 15 countries in the world have a Gini of at least 50.

## Is the U.S. Gini Coefficient High or Low?

The U.S. has a Gini Coefficient of 41.1, which is a high perusing for such a developed economy. Economists fault rising income inequality in the U.S. on factors, for example, innovative change, globalization, the decline of [unions](/worker's guild), and the eroding value of the [minimum wage](/minimum_wage).

## Highlights
- The Gini index is a measure of the distribution of income across a population.
- Due to data and different limitations, the Gini index might exaggerate income inequality and can darken important data about income distribution.
- Global inequality, as measured by the Gini index, has consistently increased throughout the course of recent hundreds of years and spiked during the COVID-19 pandemic.
- A higher Gini index shows greater inequality, with high-income people getting a lot bigger percentages of the total income of the population.
