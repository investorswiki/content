## What Is Curb Trading?

The practice is likewise spelled once in a while as "kerb trading," and is suggestive of the beginning of open-clamor stock trading prior to the foundation of licensed stock exchanges where brokers and traders would gather outside by the curb of a street corner in midtown Manhattan.

## How Curb Trading Works

In the past, stocks that were thought of as unsuitable to trade on the New York Stock Exchange were bought and sold on the street curb. This prompted the formation of the new [American Stock Exchange](/amex) (AMEX), so curb trading alluded to any trades outside of NYSE exchange regulations. The American Stock Exchange was subsequently known as the **Curb Exchange** until 1921, when it officially organized into a real exchange. The exchange went on pioneer listed index options and options on 25 broad-based and sector indices.

The expansion of digital communications and electronic organizations presently offers traders the ability to track down other counterparties in dark pools and [over-the-counter](/otc) (OTC) markets almost every minute of every day.

[After-hours trading](/afterhourstrading) is one contemporary model, where after the market closes investors can in any case buy and sell securities outside ordinary trading hours. Both the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) and the [Nasdaq](/nasdaq) ordinarily operate between 9:30 a.m. what's more, 4:00 p.m. Eastern Time. Trades during the after-hours session can be completed whenever between 4:00 p.m. what's more, 8:00 p.m. Eastern Standard Time.

In these extended trading sessions, [electronic communication organizations (ECNs)](/ecn) match likely buyers and sellers without utilizing a traditional stock exchange. The trading volume during the after-hours trading session will in general be genuinely thin. That is on the grounds that there are less active traders during this time span.
