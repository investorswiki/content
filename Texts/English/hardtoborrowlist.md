# Hard-To-Borrow List
## What Is a Hard-To-Borrow List?

A hard-to-borrow list is an inventory record utilized by brokerages to show what stocks are challenging to borrow for [short sale](/shortsale) transactions. A brokerage firm's hard-to-borrow list gives an exceptional catalog of stocks that can only with significant effort be borrowed for use as a short sale.

The hard-to-borrow rundown can measure up to a brokerage's [easy-to-borrow list](/easytoborrowlist).

## Grasping the Hard-To-Borrow List

Short selling of stocks is based on the thought that an individual trader or investor, needing to profit from a reduction in a stock's price, can borrow shares of that stock from the broker.

[Brokerages](/brokerage-organization) have various ways of giving access to shares that can be sold short. Be that as it may, no matter what their methods, there is a finite number of shares available for shorting. When the number of shares available has verged on running out, the broker will distribute a documentation or the like on their platform. This alarms account holders that assuming they endeavor to sell that security short, their trade order might be rejected.

> Short supply isn't the main justification for why a security might be on the hard-to-borrow list. It might likewise be incorporated due to high [volatility](/volatility) or something different.

To enter a short sale, a brokerage client must initially borrow the shares from their broker. To give the shares, the broker can utilize its own inventory or borrow from the [margin account](/marginaccount) of another client or another brokerage firm. The borrower (i.e., the short seller) must pay interest and fees on the borrowed shares. Those on the hard-to-borrow rundown can have higher [stock loan fees](/stock-loan-expense) because of being in shorter supply.

Investors who enter short sale transactions endeavor to capture profits in a declining market. For instance, a [investor](/investor) may think that shares in Apple are probably going to drop in price. The investor can short sell the stock and, on the off chance that the price falls as they expect, repurchase it back for a profit. If the stock ascents, be that as it may, the investor loses money.

## Hard-to-Borrow List Requirements

Brokerage firms update their hard-to-borrow records daily. A broker must have the option to give or find the shares to loan to their client before executing the client's short sale transaction.

[Regulation SHO](/regsho), which was executed on Jan. 3, 2005, has a "find" condition that expects brokers to have a reasonable conviction that the equity to be shorted can be borrowed and delivered to the short seller. The regulation is expected to forestall naked short selling, a practice where the investor puts a short sale without holding the shares.

## Hard-to-Borrow List versus Easy-to-Borrow List

The hard-to-borrow list is something contrary to the easy-to-borrow list, which is an inventory record of securities that are available for short sale transactions. As a rule, an investor can expect that securities excluded from the hard-to-borrow rundown will be available for short selling. While a brokerage firm's hard-to-borrow list is normally an internal rundown that isn't made available to clients, the firm's clients for the most part approach the easy-to-borrow list.

Brokerage clients might need to pay hard-to-borrow fees on certain short sales. Normally, the cost of borrowing stocks on the challenging to-borrow list is higher than for stocks that are on the easy-to-borrow list. Large brokerage firms typically have a [securities lending](/securitieslending) desk that helps source stocks that are challenging to borrow. A brokerage's securities lending desk likewise loans securities to different firms.

## Features

- On the off chance that the broker has not many shares of a stock available, that stock is put on the hard-to-borrow list.
- Stocks on the hard-to-borrow rundown may not be short-sellable or have higher stock loan fees.
