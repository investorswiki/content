# Qualified Trust
## What Is a Qualified Trust?

A qualified trust is a tax-advantaged [fiduciary](/fiduciary) relationship between an employer and an employee as a stock bonus, pension, or [profit-sharing plan](/profitsharingplan). In a qualified trust, the underlying beneficiary might utilize their life expectancy to decide required least distribution (RMD) sums, yet different contemplations like orientation, race, or salary can't be utilized.

## Figuring out Qualified Trusts

A trust might be "qualified" or "non-qualified," as per the IRS. A qualified plan conveys certain tax benefits. To be qualified, a trust must be legitimate under state law and must have identifiable beneficiaries. Furthermore, the IRA trustee, custodian, or plan administrator must receive a copy of the trust instrument. In the event that a qualified trust isn't structured accurately, distributions are taxable by the IRS. Section 401(a) of the Internal Revenue Code approves and sets forward the requirements for what is viewed as a qualified trust.

Limitations exist to be certain that an employer doesn't segregate among employees while adding to a qualified trust. For instance, an employer may not separate for employees that are all the more profoundly compensated. Contributions must be uniform across an organization.

## Different Types of Trusts

Notwithstanding qualified trusts, there is a horde of other trust types.

### Charitable Lead Trust

In a [charitable lead trust](/charitableleadtrust), for instance, beneficiaries are able to reduce their taxable income by giving a portion of the trust's income to charity. After a predefined period of time, the remainder of the trust is moved to the beneficiaries.

### Bare Trust

In a [bare trust](/bare-trust), a beneficiary has the absolute right to the capital and assets inside the trust, as well as the income these assets create, like dividends. While a trustee will frequently bear responsibility for dealing with the trust assets in a prudent way, the trustee doesn't decide how or when the trust's capital or income is distributed.

### Personal Trust

A [personal trust](/personal-trust) is a type of trust that a person sets up for oneself as the beneficiary. As separate legal elements, personal trusts that have the authority to buy, sell, hold, and deal with the property for the benefit of their [trustor](/trustor) and can achieve various important objectives. For instance, a youthful grown-up may set up a personal trust to pay for a graduate school program or professional education down the line.

While setting up any trust, it is important to look for the support of a trust or estate lawyer, possibly a [custodian](/custodian) to hold the assets, and perhaps a [investment advisor](/investmentadvisor) to deal with your trust(s) until it's the ideal opportunity for withdrawal.
