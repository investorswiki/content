# Devaluation
  A currency devalues when its value declines corresponding to at least one different currencies. Let's express that on Monday $1 bought five rubles and that today, after the devaluation, it purchases 10 rubles (not genuine figures). Under this scenario, the ruble has devalued by half.
For what reason do countries let their currency fall in value? Indeed, some do it on purpose, generally to try to support their exports and reduction their imports.
How does that function? Let's envision I'm a Russian vodka exporter and I charge 100 rubles for every jug. On Monday, one jug cost foreigners $20 (100 partitioned by five). Today, at the new exchange rate, one jug costs $10 (100 partitioned by 10). In theory, Russia sells much more vodka and different goods since they are less expensive in dollar terms - - and exports go up.
Simultaneously, foreign goods become more costly to local people with rubles, so imports go down.
In any case, now and then devaluations are forced on a country when it can never again protect its exchange rate. Russia, before its devaluation, was spending dollars and buying rubles to try to keep the ruble at the rate it wanted. Be that as it may, the market continued to sell rubles, and the government was at risk for running out of dollars. In this manner, it surrendered and let the ruble-selling proceed unabated, and, of course, its exchange rate to the dollar diminished.
Devaluations can have a ton of negative effects. Inflation can go up. Foreign obligations become more challenging to service, and they reduce confidence among individuals in their currency.

## Features
- The government giving the currency chooses to devalue a currency.
- Debasing a currency reduces the cost of a country's exports and can assist with shrinking trade deficits.
- Devaluation is the deliberate downward adjustment of a country's currency value.
