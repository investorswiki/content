# Product Life Cycle
## What Is a Product Life Cycle?

The term product life cycle alludes to the time span a product is acquainted with consumers into the market until it's taken out from the racks. The life cycle of a product is broken into four stages — presentation, growth, [maturity](/maturity), and decline. This concept is utilized by management and by marketing experts as a factor in choosing when it is fitting to increase advertising, reduce prices, grow to new markets, or redesign bundling. The most common way of planning approaches to consistently support and keep a product is called [product life cycle management](/product-life-cycle-management).

## How Product Life Cycles Work

Products, similar to individuals, have life cycles. A product starts with a thought, and inside the bounds of modern business, it isn't probably going to go further until it goes through [research and development](/randd) (R&D) and is found to be [feasible](/plausibility study) and possibly profitable. By then, the product is created, marketed, and carried out.

As referenced above, there are four generally accepted stages in the life cycle of a product — presentation, growth, maturity, and decline.

- Presentation: This phase generally remembers a substantial investment for advertising and a [marketing campaign](/marketing-campaign) zeroed in on making consumers aware of the product and its benefits.
- Growth: If the product is effective, it then, at that point, moves to the growth stage. This is portrayed by developing [demand](/demand), an increase in production, and expansion in its availability.
- Maturity: This is the most profitable stage, while the costs of creating and marketing decline.
- Decline: A product takes on increased competition as different companies copy its prosperity — some of the time with upgrades or lower prices. The product might lose [market share](/marketshare) and start its decline.

At the point when a product is effectively brought into the [market](/market), demand increases, thusly expanding its fame. These more up to date products wind up pushing more established ones out of the market, successfully supplanting them. Companies will generally curb their marketing efforts as another product develops. That is on the grounds that the [cost to produce](/production-cost) and market the product drop. At the point when demand for the product disappears, it very well might be removed the market totally.

The stage of a product's life cycle influences the manner by which it is marketed to consumers. Another product should be made sense of, while a mature product should be separated from its rivals.

## Special Considerations

Companies that have a decent handle on every one of the four stages can increase profitability and boost their [returns](/return). Those that aren't able to may experience an increase in their marketing and production costs, eventually leading to the limited shelf life for their product(s).

Back in 1965, Theodore Levitt, a [marketing](/marketing) teacher, wrote in the Harvard Business Review that the pioneer is the one with the most to lose in light of the fact that such countless genuinely new products fail at the main phase of their life cycle — the basic stage. The failure comes solely after the investment of substantial money and time into research, development, and production. Also, that reality, he composed, prevents many companies from even taking a stab at anything truly new. All things considered, he said, they hang tight for another person to succeed and afterward clone the achievement.

## Instances of Product Life Cycles

Numerous [brands](/brand) that were American symbols have dwindled and passed on. Better management of product life cycles could have saved some of them, or maybe their opportunity had just arrived. A few models:

- Oldsmobile started delivering cars in 1897 yet the brand was killed off in 2004. Its inefficient muscle-vehicle image lost its appeal, General Motors chose.
- Woolworth's had a store in just about each small town and city in America until it covered its stores in 1997. It was the time of [Walmart](/walmart-impact) and other big-box stores.
- Boundary's bookstore chain closed down in 2011. It couldn't endure the internet age.

To refer to a laid out yet flourishing industry, TV program distribution has related products in all stages of the product life cycle. Starting around 2019, level screen TVs are in the mature phase, programming-on-demand is in the growth stage, DVDs are in decline, and the videocassette is terminated.

A considerable lot of the best products on earth are suspended in the mature stage as far as might be feasible, going through minor updates and redesigns to keep them separated. Models incorporate Apple PCs and iPhones, Ford's smash hit trucks, and Starbucks' espresso — all of which go through minor changes joined by marketing efforts — are intended to keep them feeling unique and special according to consumers.
