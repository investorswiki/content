# Indexed Earnings
## What Are Indexed Earnings?

Indexed earnings is a calculation the [Social Security Administration](/ssa) (SSA) uses to decide Social Security benefits by taking [inflation](/inflation) into consideration. Inflation is the rate at which prices increase inside an economy throughout some stretch of time. The amount somebody gathers from Social Security after retirement or disability after an injury depends on the wages made over a lifetime.

## How Indexed Earnings Work

For [Social Security](/socialsecurity) purposes, wage indexing relies upon the year in which a person is first eligible to receive benefits, and a singular's earnings are indexed to the average wage two years prior to the extended period of first qualification. For retirement, qualification is at age 62. So on the off chance that a person arrives at age 62 out of 2022, 2022 is the person's time of qualification.

Following a similar model, this person's earnings would be indexed to the average wage index for 2020, which is 55,628.60. Earnings years before 2020 would be duplicated by the ratio of 55,628.60 to the average wage index for that year; earnings in 2020 or later would be fully trusted.

The amount in [disability](/total-super durable disability-tpd) payments (SSDI) a person is eligible for is likewise founded on average indexed month to month earnings. Not entirely set in stone by requiring the 35 highest years (prior to age 60) of indexed earnings and separating that figure by the total number of months worked during those years.

Subsequently, on the off chance that you worked consistently, as a matter of course, your average indexed month to month earnings would rise to the sum of 35 years of work isolated by 144 months.

## Special Considerations

Ensuring amounts are resolved decently and fairly for beneficiaries of Social Security or disability is huge. Not figuring in inflation would bring down the wages that the benefits depend on and would absolutely impact somebody's quality of life. Assuming inflation rises 2% each year, the price increases can accumulate over numerous years, which can ultimately disintegrate the value of Social Security benefits. A person may be forced to scale back from a bigger home, cancel an arranged vacation, or stop adding to their grandkids' education.

On the off chance that earnings were not indexed as such, then retired people would receive a lot of lower benefits that would be messed up with regards to the true buying power of their earnings in prior years.
