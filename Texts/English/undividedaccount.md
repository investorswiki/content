# Undivided Account
## What Is an Undivided Account?

An undivided account is a [initial public offering](/ipo) (IPO) for which there are different [underwriters](/underwriter), each getting a sense of ownership with setting any shares that stay unsold. That is, each firm consents to get a move on assuming different underwriters fail to sell the portion of the total number of shares that they have been allocated.

This type of account is now and again called an eastern account. Normally, there is a variation called a western account.
