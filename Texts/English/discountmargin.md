# Discount Margin — DM
## What Is a Discount Margin — DM?

A discount margin (DM) is the average expected return of a floating-rate security (normally a bond) that is earned notwithstanding the index underlying, or [reference rate](/referencerate) of, the security. The size of the discount margin relies upon the price of the floating-or variable-rate security. The return of floating-rate securities changes over the long run, so the discount margin is an estimate in view of the security's expected pattern among issue and maturity.

One more method for review the discount margin is to think of it as the [spread](/spread) that, when added to the bond's current reference rate, will compare the bond's cash flows to its current price.

## Grasping a Discount Margin — DM

Bonds and different securities with [variable interest rates](/variableinterestrate) are generally priced close to their [par value](/parvalue). This is on the grounds that the interest rate (coupon) on a variable rate bond acclimates to current interest rates in light of changes in the bond's reference rate. A security's yield relative to the yield of its benchmark is called a spread, and various types of yield-spread calculations exist for the different pricing benchmarks.

The discount margin is quite possibly of the most common calculation: It estimates the security's spread over the reference index that compares the [present value](/presentvalue) of all expected future cash flows to the current market price of the [floating rate note. ](/frn)

There are three fundamental circumstances including a discount margin:

1. If the price of floating rate security, or [floater](/floater), is equivalent to par, the investor's discount margin would be equivalent to the [reset margin](/reset-margin).
1. Due to the inclination at bond costs to join to [par](/parvalue) as the bond arrives at maturity, the investor can make an unexpected return over the reset margin on the off chance that the floating rate bond was priced [at a discount](/at-a-discount). The unexpected return plus the reset margin equals the discount margin.
1. Should the floating rate bond be priced [above par](/abovepar), the discount margin would approach the [reference rate](/referencerate) less the diminished earnings.

## Working out the Discount Margin — DM

The discount margin formula is a convoluted equation that considers the [time value of money](/timevalueofmoney) and commonly needs a financial spreadsheet or calculator to accurately compute. There are seven variables engaged with the formula. They are:

1. P = the floating rate note's price plus any [accrued interest](/accruedinterest)
1. c(i) = the cash flow received toward the finish of time span I (for conclusive period n, the principal amount must be incorporated)
1. I(i) = the assumed index level at time span I
1. I(1) = the current index level
1. d(i) = number of genuine days in period I, expecting to be the real/360-[day count convention](/daycount)
1. d(s) = number of days from the beginning of the time span until settlement date
1. DM = the discount margin, the variable to settle for

All [coupon payments](/coupon) are obscure, with the exception of the first, and must be estimated to compute the discount margin. The formula, which must be addressed by emphasis to track down DM, is as per the following:

The current price, P, equals the summation of the accompanying division forever periods from the start time span to maturity:

numerator = c(i)

denominator = (1 + (I(1) + DM)/100 x (d(1) - d(s))/360) x Product (I, j=2)( 1 + (I(j) + DM)/100 x d(j)/360)

## Features
- A discount margin is the spread (a security's yield relative to the yield of its benchmark) that likens the security's future cash flow to its current market price.
- Discount margin is a type of yield-spread calculation intended to estimate the average expected return of a variable-rate security, generally a bond.
