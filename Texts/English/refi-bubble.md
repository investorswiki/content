# Refi Bubble
## What Is a Refi Bubble?

A refi bubble alludes to a period during which borrowers refinance old debt obligations **en masse**, supplanting them with new debt that has unique, better terms. ("Refi" is short for "[refinance](/refinance)." The common motivation for refinancing is to exploit better — lower — interest rates.) This makes a bubble in the total volume of debt since there is a net expansion of loan credit, an increase in borrower leverage, or a lessening in borrower equity.

Refi bubbles can likewise happen if assets, for example, homes, rise substantially in price and borrowers need to access the [equity in their homes](/home_equity) by taking out new loans in higher amounts.

## Understanding a Refi Bubble

Both business loans and personal loans can be refinanced, however refi bubbles are normally made due to an increase in the refinancing of mortgage loans. There are two primary methods. of refinancing: rate-and-term refinances and cash-out refinances. With a traditional rate-and-term refinance, the amount of the new loan just covers the pay-off of the old loan (plus the fees, taxes, and different costs of the transaction). This permits the borrower to benefit from lower interest rates. With a cash-out refinance, the new borrowed amount incorporates extra funds; cash-out refinancing has a greater potential to make a refi bubble.

For the individual mortgage borrower, a cash-out refinance means assuming extra debt to liquidate a portion of the equity they have accumulated in their home. This outcomes in an all the more profoundly leveraged position. At the point when a large number of borrowers assume cash-out refinance loans, the outcome is a general increase in the volume of debt, a reduction in homeowner's equity, and an increase in debt-to-equity ratios. Eventually, this development of debt and leverage can comprise a credit bubble.

Rising home prices, falling interest rates, and lower costs or requirements for refinancing can all be factors in proliferating a refi bubble. These are normally considered positive conditions for an economy. Be that as it may, the increased leverage in the market can likewise mean an increase in systemic risk and an overextension of credit to less creditworthy borrowers. At the point when rates later rise (particularly when underlying asset prices fall), this bubble can burst and bring about far and wide defaults and writedowns on overleveraged loans, general stress in the financial sector, credit markets, and derivatives in view of the distressed loans, and even an overall economic downturn on the off chance that the problem is sufficiently extreme.

Refi bubbles in markets for fixed, somewhat illiquid assets, like homes, are particularly dangerous on the grounds that profoundly leveraged homeowners are generally unable to gradually deleverage their positions. At the point when home prices were rising throughout the mid-2000s, homeowners had the option to consistently turn out to be more leveraged by refinancing. Nonetheless, they were unable to deleverage (by some other means than defaulting once housing prices started to fall). This ratchet effect in accumulated housing debt through cash-out refinances during the housing boom, with no reciprocal ability to deleverage when prices fall, assisted with amplifying the seriousness of the bust.

Researchers at the National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER) have estimated the economic damage from the refi bubble that happened during the 2000s housing boom (and the subsequent financial crisis) to be close to $1.2 trillion. Federal Reserve economist Steven Laufer found that in the L.A. housing market, 30% of home mortgage defaults during the housing bust could be credited straightforwardly to homeowner overleveraging and equity extraction through the cash-out refi bubble in home mortgages.

## Interest Rates and Refi Bubbles

The continuous cost of borrowed funds is the [interest rate](/interestrate) charged by the lender and paid by the borrower. Assuming interest rates have been declining in an economy as a general rule, borrowers might observe that current rates are a lot of lower than they were at the time their loan was taken out. In this case, borrowers can bring down the interest rate on their loan by working with a lender to [refinance](/refinance) their debt. In a normal refinance, the borrower finds a lender that is offering better loan terms (generally a lower interest rate). The borrower then takes out another loan with the lender that is utilized to pay off the old loan and then repays the new loan as indicated by its terms.

For instance, expect Tom took out a speculative 30-year mortgage loan 10 years prior that charged an interest rate of 7.5%. The economy has since entered [recession](/recession), and the [central bank](/centralbank) took moves toward spike spending and economic growth. This brought about lower interest rates. The interest rate on a speculative 20-year mortgage is presently 3.5%. Tom could refinance his loan, paying off what is left of his original mortgage with the new mortgage for a similar amount at the lower 3.5% interest rate.

Refi bubbles track the general trend of interest rates in an economy, which are impacted by a huge number of factors. At the point when interest rates are rising, refinancing is ugly, as borrowers would be taking out new loans with higher interest rates than their original loan, which would cost them more.

As interest rates fall, be that as it may, refinancing turns into an appealing option for borrowers, and refi bubbles happen. This scenario worked out in late 1998 and mid 1999, as interest rates in the U.S. dropped and many mortgage borrowers refinanced. In any case, as rates climbed in mid-to late 1999, refinancing came around more than 80%.

## Features
- Refi bubbles can increase the systemic risk to the financial sector and the overall economy.
- A refi bubble is an overexpansion of credit through refinancing loans, particularly cash-out refis.
- Low-interest rates, financial and regulatory innovations that support refis, and rising asset values can all add to a creating refi bubble.
