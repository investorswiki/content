# Stock Float
## What Is "The Float" When It Comes to a Company's Stock?
With regards to a company's stock, "the float" alludes to all outstanding shares that are accessible for public trading. This incorporates all shares held by public investors however does exclude "restricted" shares held by company insiders or treasury shares that remain locked away in a company's treasury.
The more float (publicly tradable shares) a company has, the less [volatile](/unpredictability) its stock price will in general be without a trace of different factors, and vice versa. This is on the grounds that when a company has less public shares, the purchase or sale of many shares immediately on the open market causes a more critical lift or decline in market price. All in all, more float means more [liquidity](/liquidity), and greater liquidity makes for smoother trading.
The number of float shares can change after some time for various reasons. For example, many companies offer stock options to their employees as an incentive. When these options vest, employees can exercise them for real shares. When exercised, these shares are normally still viewed as restricted. After a certain amount of time, in any case, employees might be permitted to sell these shares on the open market, at which point they stop being restricted shares and begin being part of the float.
## The Float versus Different Types of Shares: An Overview

Authorized shares incorporate all un-issued shares held in a company's treasury, including any that are scheduled to vest as employee options, as well as all shares outstanding, including both those held by company insiders and those held by the public.

Any shares that are at this point not in a company's treasury — whether they are held by company insiders, institutional investors, or the public — are thought of as outstanding. Outstanding shares are increased by the current share price to decide a company's [market capitalization](/capitalization).

Since floating shares are profoundly liquid, they are once in a while utilized in an alternative calculation of a company's market capitalization as opposed to outstanding shares.
## What Is Float-Adjusted Market Cap?
Float-adjusted market capitalization is a measure of a company's size or still up in the air by the market, yet not at all like traditional market cap, it is calculated utilizing just floating shares rather than every single outstanding share.
