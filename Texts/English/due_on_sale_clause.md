# Due-on-Sale Clause
## What Is a Due-on-Sale Clause?

A due-on-sale clause is a [mortgage](/mortgage) contract provision that requires the borrower to repay the lender in full upon the sale or conveyance of a partial or full interest in the property that secures the mortgage. Mortgages with a due-on-sale clause are not [assumable](/assumablemortgage) by the property's new buyer.

## How a Due-on-Sale Clause Works

A due-on-sale clause allows a lender to demand full repayment of a loan assuming the borrower sells the collateral that is utilized to secure their loan. This type of clause is utilized in home mortgages and prevents the homeowner from selling their home before paying off their debt. Assuming the borrower endeavors to sell the property without the lender's consent, the lender may [foreclose](/foreclosure) upon the property.

Most mortgages issued in the U.S. incorporate due-on-sale clauses. Prior to due-on-sale clauses, most home purchases were funded with assumable mortgages: in the event of a sale, the loan obligations would fall to the new owner. This worked to the disadvantage of the mortgage lender, particularly if [interest rates](/interestrate) had increased starting from the origination of the loan.

## Due-on-Sale Mortgage versus Assumable Mortgage

With a due-on-sale clause, homeowners can't transfer the mortgage to the buyer while selling their property as they could with an assumable mortgage. They must rather utilize the sale proceeds to pay off the mortgage, and the buyer must get another mortgage on their own.

In like that, a due-on-sale clause safeguards the lender (or owner of the mortgage) from the risk that the mortgage will transfer to the new owner while prevailing interest rates are higher than the rate on that mortgage. The new buyer would rather need to get another mortgage at current interest rates.

Lenders as well as the holders of pools of mortgages, for example, [mortgage-backed securities](/mbs), [asset-backed securities](/asset-backedsecurity), or [collateralized debt obligations](/cdo) generally favor the exit from the workforce of mortgages with low interest rates.

In the event that a seller endeavors to dodge the due-on-sale clause and transfer the property to another owner without quickly repaying the mortgage, the lender can [foreclose](/foreclosure) on the property and claim it.

## Due-on-Sale Clause Exceptions

Under the 1982 [Garn-St. Germain Act](/garn-st-germain-safe institutions-act)**,** lenders can't uphold the due-on-sale clause in certain situations, even when the ownership of the mortgaged property has changed.

In the event that there is a divorce or [legal separation](/legal-separation), and ownership between spouses changes (for instance, the property was jointly owned and becomes owned by a single spouse), the lender can't uphold the due-on-sale clause. The equivalent is true if the owner transfers the property to their children, in the event that a borrower bites the dust and the property is transferred to a relative, or on the other hand assuming that the property is transferred to a [living trust](/living-trust) and the borrower is the [trust's beneficiary](/beneficiary-of-trust).

> A due-on-sale clause can't prevent property from changing hands in the event of a divorce or death. Property can likewise be deeded to a trust, insofar as the beneficiary continues to reside in the house.

## How could a Lender Not Invoke a Due-on-Sale Clause?

Even on the off chance that the lender is legally qualified for summon a due-on-sale clause, there can be situations in which it might choose not to. For instance, in a weak housing market, it very well may be advantageous for the lender to allow another buyer to expect the old mortgage as opposed to risk the possibility that the original borrower will [default](/default2) on it.

Or on the other hand, in the event that the home has declined essentially in value, and its sale doesn't get sufficient money to cover the debt, the lender could acknowledge not exactly the full payment to recover basically a portion of what it is owed.

Following several years, Alan and Beth divorce, and Beth turns into the sole owner of the home. Since they were spouses, the transfer doesn't trigger the due-on-sale clause: Beth can expect full ownership of the home, and continue paying the original mortgage.

The next year, housing prices increase, and Beth chooses to sell the home to Charlie. Since Charlie isn't covered by any exception, Beth must have the option to repay the excess balance on the mortgage upon closure of the sale. Contingent upon the housing market at the hour of the sale, the lender might possibly decide to authorize the due-on-sale provision.
