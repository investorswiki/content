# Silent Automatic Lien
## What Is a Silent Automatic Lien

Silent automatic lien is a term that alludes to a lien that shows up in no public record.

The Internal Revenue Service utilizes silent automatic liens to collect unpaid taxes when less extraordinary measures, like sending letters to the delinquent taxpayer, have failed.

## How a Silent Automatic Lien Works

A silent automatic [tax lien](/taxlien) is one of two types of tax liens. Otherwise called an automatic tax lien, this contrasts from a federal tax lien, which is public.

A federally authorized lien against all possible assets of an unpaid back taxpayer taxes, the public federal tax lien permits the IRS to secure or if not requisition the taxpayer's property to secure payment.

Federal tax liens can be assessed for unpaid taxes of any sort, including income, self-employment, gift or estate taxes. It is important to note that federal tax liens vary from tax demands in that they just denote the government's right to hold onto property, rather than its genuine seizure.

Since it is part of public record, having a federal tax lien will substantially downgrade one's credit score, and generally speaking this lien must be paid off in full before the taxpayer can work on their credit.

## Step by step instructions to Get Rid of a Silent Automatic Lien

There are four methods for disposing of a silent automatic lien:

- paying the taxes owed
- proclaiming [bankruptcy](/bankruptcy)
- waiting out the time limit for collections
- arranging an agreement with the IRS (called an offer in compromise)

The offer in compromise is a program offered by the IRS to [taxpayers](/taxpayer) who are unable to pay their tax debt. It can help an individual pay not exactly the amount that they owe to the IRS and is planned to permit taxpayers with substantial back taxes to settle their tax debt and begin once again with a clean record so they can stay current on their taxes moving forward.

On the off chance that the delinquent taxpayer's taxes stay unpaid, the IRS can utilize a tax levy to hold onto the taxpayer's assets legally. The IRS can levy any of the taxpayers' [assets](/resource, for example, bank accounts, investment accounts, cars, and real property to collect the money owed.

While a lien secures the government's interest or claim in an individual's or alternately business' property when the tax debt stays unpaid, a levy really permits the government to seize and sell the property to pay the tax debt.

A levy varies from a lien on the grounds that a levy takes the property to fulfill the tax debt, while a lien is a claim utilized as security for the tax debt. A levy is the legal seizure of the property or assets.

In the U.S., the Internal Revenue Service has the authority to [levy](/levy) an individual's property, for example, a vehicle, boat, house, wages, retirement accounts, dividends, bank accounts, licenses, rental income, accounts receivables, commissions or the cash loan value of a life insurance policy.
