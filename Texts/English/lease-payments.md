# Lease Payments
## What Are Lease Payments?

A lease payment is the equivalent of the monthly rent, that is formally dictated under a contract between two parties, granting one participant the legal right to utilize the other individual's real estate holdings, manufacturing equipment, computers, software, or other fixed assets, for a predefined amount of time. A lease gives the [lessee](/lessee) with limited right-to-involve without transferring ownership in return for payment to the [lessor](/lessor).

The timeframe in which lease payments will be made can range from a month-to-month timetable, as is traditionally the case with [software-as-a-service](/software-as-a-service-saas) (SaaS) business models, or it may contrarily reach out through very long timeframes, for example, 100 years or more, which is many times the case in [land-lease](/land_lease_option) scenarios.

## Understanding Lease Payments

Lease payments can be made by individuals as well as companies. Individuals traditionally use leases to finance cars, yet they may also utilize them to obtain the utilization of computer equipment, tracts of land, and other physical assets. A lease payment still up in the air by a variety of different considerations, for example, an asset's value, local residual values in a given area, discount rates, and a lessee's credit score.

A company's lease payments are utilized in the calculation of the fixed-charge coverage ratio, which assists investors with deciding whether a company can cover its fixed expenses, like leases and interest. The fixed charge coverage ratio is essentially an amplified rendition of the [times interest earned ratio](/tie), or the times interest coverage ratio. It's profoundly adaptable for practical usage, with nearly all fixed costs, since these fixed costs are so similar to lease payments.

## Common Types of Leases

The most common types of lease agreements are as per the following:

- [Operating leases](/operatinglease)
- Financial leases (also called [capital leases](/capitallease))
- [Sale-and-leaseback](/leaseback) arrangements
- Combination leases (those which marry at least two of the aforementioned models)

The main characteristic of an operating lease is that it allows for both financing and maintenance, in which lease payments incorporate an element for financing charges as well as maintenance parts. Operating leases expect lessors to regularly service the leased equipment being referred to. For example, it isn't uncommon for aircraft owners to lease out their fly motors.

By and large, the owners don't have the technical information required to maintain the parts for themselves, because the parts are exceptionally specialized. In such cases, common sense would suggest that owners should incorporate maintenance charges straightforwardly with lease payments.

Financial leases vary from operating leases in that they don't implant maintenance fees in the lease payments. Fresher leases types, which frequently offer more customized service levels and lease payment structures, incorporate synthetic endlessly leases tied to mileage, hours, or usage levels. For example, General Electric frequently leases costly train parts with lease payments that are tied to mileage. In theory, a lessee is just paying for what they need.
