## What Is Full Retirement Age (FRA)?

Full retirement age (FRA), otherwise called normal retirement age, is the age at which you can receive full retirement benefits from Social Security. Full retirement age fluctuates depending on the year you were conceived. FRA is 66 years and two months for individuals brought into the world in 1955, and it step by step ascends to 67 for those brought into the world in 1960 or later.

Claiming benefits before your arrive at full retirement age diminishes them permanently.

## Understanding Full Retirement Age (FRA)

In the U.S., the FRA for getting [Social Security benefits](/social-security-benefits) is 67 for individuals brought into the world in 1960 or a while later. It is 66 for individuals brought into the world from 1943 to 1954, and 66 and two, four, six, eight, or 10 months for individuals brought into the world from 1955 to 1959 (the age increases by two months each successive year).

You can choose to receive Social Security benefits starting at age 62, however claiming benefits at an age that is sooner than your FRA will reduce your benefit permanently. For instance, on the off chance that your FRA is 67 and you start claiming benefits at age 62, the benefits will diminish to 70% of what you would have received at full retirement age. You will get 86.7% of the full retirement benefit in the event that you begin claiming at 65.

On the off chance that you were brought into the world in 1943 or later, claiming after your FRA will increase benefits by 8% yearly. Waiting until you arrive at 70 will yield the maximum benefit. There's not an obvious explanation to stand by longer than 70 on the grounds that your benefits won't increase further.

FRA likewise applies to pension plans, for example, [employer-sponsored plans](/employer_sponsored_plan). Public workers, cops, and military individuals, for instance, normally receive full benefits after a certain number of service years, as opposed to at a specific age.

## History of Full Retirement Age (FRA)

The FRA was 65 when Social Security started. Amendments to Social Security in 1983 incorporated a provision that permitted raising the FRA beginning with individuals brought into the world in 1938 or later. Improvements in the overall soundness of older individuals and increased future provoked the change.

That's what social Security's trustees project, starting in 2021, the [Social Security Trust Fund](/social-security-trust-fund) will run a deficit and should dip into reserves to cover benefit payments. By the latest gauges, that means the combined reserves of Social Security's [Old-Age and Survivors Insurance (OASI)](/old-age-and-survivors-insurance-trust-fund) trust fund and the [Disability Insurance (DI) Trust Fund](/disability-insurance-trust-fund) will be exhausted by 2034.

Given worries about the solvency of the Social Security Trust Fund, combined with demographic changes and increases in longevity, there has been talk in conservative circles of making the FRA higher. Other potential arrangements incorporate expanding charges, cutting benefits, or a combination of some or these changes.
