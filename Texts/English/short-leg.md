# Short Leg
## What Is a Short Leg?

A short leg is any [contract](/optionscontract) in an options spread or combination in which an individual stands firm on a short situation. In the event that a trader has made an option combination by purchasing a put option and selling a call option, the trader's short position on the call would be viewed as the short [leg](/leg), while the put option would be the [long leg](/long-leg). Multi-legged spreading and combination strategies can have more than one short leg.

## How a Short Leg Works

Option spreads and combinations are positions made by options traders by all the while buying and selling option contracts, with varying strikes or various lapses, yet on the equivalent [underlying](/underlying-security) security. Option spreads are utilized to limit overall risk or tweak payoff structures by guaranteeing that gains and losses are restricted to a specific reach. Furthermore, option spreads can bring the costs of options positions down, since traders will collect premiums from contracts in which they short.

Options spreads can be made in a wide range of designs, albeit certain standard spreads, for example, [vertical](/verticalspread) spreads and [butterflies](/butterflyspread) are generally usually put to utilize. Each spread is made out of short and long legs of the trade. Assuming the aggregate premium collected from the short legs surpasses that of the long legs, the spread is supposed to be sold and the trader collects the [net premium](/net-premium). Then again, in the event that the premium collected from the short legs is not exactly the premium paid for the long legs, the trader is buying the spread and must pay the net premium.

## Instances of Short Legs

A spread, rather than an options combination (like a straddle or strangle), will continuously include at least one short legs and long legs. The short leg(s) is/are those that are made by selling options contracts. In a [bull call spread](/bullcallspread), for instance, a trader will buy one call and simultaneously sell one more call at a higher [strike](/strikeprice) price. The higher strike call is the short leg in this case.

There can likewise be more than one short leg. A trader might buy a [call condor](/condorspread), where they purchase an in-the-cash call spread, and selling an out-of-the-cash call spread. As a rule, every one of the four options' strike prices are equidistant. For instance, the trader might buy the 20 - 25 - 30 - 35 call condor where they will buy the 20 and 35 strike calls and sell the 25 and 30 strike calls. The two calls in the middle (at the 25 and 30 strikes) would be the short legs.
