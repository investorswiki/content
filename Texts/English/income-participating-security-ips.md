# Income Participating Security
## What Is an Income Participating Security (IPS)?

An income participating security (IPS) is a type of investment that consolidates common stock shares and income-yielding bonds. It is intended to turn out ordinary revenue payments as dividends paid on the stock and interest paid on the bonds.

An income participating security may likewise be called an income deposit security (IDS) or enhanced income security (EIS).

## Understanding Income Participating Security (IPS)

These securities were made to give a consistent, high level of cash flow to investors through holdings in companies. A company that issues an IPS has a stable cash flow, limited capital expenditures requests, and low growth possibilities. The company needs a method for empowering investment on the grounds that its stock is probably not going to decisively move.

Hence, the bond portion of an IPS will offer a higher yield than most bonds.

The dividends paid on an IPS emerge from the company's free cash flow. Typically, the company commits to distributing a specific percentage of free cash flow to IPS holders. Consequently, the amount paid may shift from one month to another or from one quarter to another, similarly as with any stock dividend.

An income participating security generally trades on an exchange, and its two parts can be separated and traded independently. Typically, the buyer must possess the IPS for a specific timeframe before it is sold.
