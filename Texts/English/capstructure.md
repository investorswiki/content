# Interest Rate Cap Structure
## What Is an Interest Rate Cap Structure?

An interest rate cap structure alludes to the provisions administering interest rate increases on [variable-rate](/variableinterestrate) credit products. An interest rate cap is a limit on how high an interest rate can rise on variable-rate debt. Interest rate caps can be initiated across a wide range of variable rate products.

In any case, interest rate caps are commonly utilized in variable-rate mortgages and explicitly adjustable-rate mortgage (ARM) loans.

## How Interest Rate Caps Work

Interest rate cap structures benefit the borrower in a rising interest rate environment. The caps can likewise make variable rate interest products more appealing and monetarily viable for customers.

### Variable Rate Interest

Lenders can offer an extensive variety of variable rate interest products. These products are generally profitable for lenders when rates are rising and generally appealing for borrowers when rates are falling.

Variable-rate interest products are intended to vacillate with the changing market environment. Investors in a variable rate interest product will pay an interest rate that depends on an underlying indexed rate plus a margin added to the index rate.

The combination of these two parts brings about the borrower's completely indexed rate. Lenders can index the underlying indexed rate to different benchmarks with the most common being their prime rate or a U.S. Treasury rate.

Lenders likewise set a margin in the underwriting system in light of the borrower's credit profile. A borrower's [fully indexed interest rate](/fullyindexedinterestrate) will change as the underlying indexed rate vacillates.

## How Interest Rate Caps Can Be Structured

Interest rate caps can take different forms. Lenders have some flexibility in tweaking how a [interest rate](/interestrate) cap may be structured. There can be an overall limit on the interest for the loan. The limit is an interest rate that your loan can never surpass implying that regardless of how much interest rates rise over the life of the loan, the loan rate won't ever surpass the foreordained rate limit.

Interest rate caps can likewise be structured to limit incremental increases in the rate of a loan. An adjustable-rate mortgage or ARM has a period wherein the rate can readjust and increase on the off chance that mortgage rates rise.

The ARM rate may be set to an index rate plus a couple of percentage points added by the lender. The interest rate cap structure limits how much a borrower's rate can readjust or move higher during the adjustment period. At the end of the day, the product limits the number of interest rate percentage points the ARM can move higher.

Interest rate caps can give borrowers protection against emotional rate increases and furthermore give a ceiling to maximum interest rate costs.

## Illustration of an Interest Rate Cap Structure

Adjustable-rate mortgages have numerous varieties of interest rate cap structures. For instance, suppose a borrower is thinking about a 5-1 ARM, which requires a fixed interest rate for a very long time followed by a variable interest rate thereafter, which resets like clockwork.

With this mortgage product, the borrower is offered a 2-2-5 interest rate cap structure. The interest rate cap structure is broken down as follows:

- The principal number alludes to the initial incremental increase cap after the fixed-rate period lapses. As such, 2% is the maximum the rate can increase after the fixed-rate period closes in five years. Assuming the fixed-rate was set at 3.5%, the cap on the rate would be 5.5% after the finish of the five-year period.
- The subsequent number is a periodic year incremental increase cap truly intending that after the long term period has expired, the rate will adjust to current market rates one time each year. In this model, the ARM would have a 2% limit for that adjustment. It's very considered normal that the periodic cap can be indistinguishable from the initial cap.
- The third number is the lifetime cap, setting the maximum [interest rate ceiling](/interestrateceiling). In this model, the five addresses the maximum interest rate increases on the mortgage.

So suppose the fixed rate was 3.5% and the rate was adjusted higher by 2% during the initial incremental increase to a rate of 5.5%. Following 12 months, mortgage rates increased to 8%; the loan rate would be adjusted to 7.5% on account of the 2% cap for the annual adjustment. In the event that rates increased by another 2%, the loan would just increase by 1% to 8.5%, on the grounds that the lifetime cap is five percentage points over the original fixed rate.

## Periodic Interest Rate Cap versus Interest Rate Cap

A [periodic interest rate cap](/periodiccap) alludes to the maximum interest rate adjustment permitted during a specific period of an adjustable-rate loan or mortgage. The periodic rate cap safeguards the borrower by limiting how much an adjustable-rate mortgage (ARM) product might change or adjust during any single interval. The periodic interest rate cap is just one part of the overall interest rate cap structure.

## Limitations of an Interest Rate Cap

The limitations of an interest rate cap structure can rely upon the product that a borrower picks while going into a mortgage or loan. On the off chance that interest rates are rising, the rate will adjust higher, and the borrower could have been better off originally going into a fixed-rate loan.

Albeit the cap limits the percentage increase, the rates on the loan actually increase in a rising rate environment. At the end of the day, borrowers must have the option to bear the cost of the most dire outcome imaginable rate on the loan assuming that rates rise fundamentally.

## Highlights
- An interest rate cap is a limit on how high an interest rate can rise on variable rate debt. Interest rate caps are commonly utilized in variable-rate mortgages and explicitly adjustable-rate mortgage (ARM) loans.
- Interest rate caps can have an overall limit on the interest for the loan and furthermore be structured to limit incremental increases in the rate of a loan.
- Interest rate caps can give borrowers protection against sensational rate increases and furthermore give a ceiling to maximum interest rate costs.
