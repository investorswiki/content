For instance, if an officer [buys](/buy) 100 shares at $5 in January and [sells](/sell) these equivalent shares in February for $6, they would have created a gain of $100. Since the shares were bought and sold inside a six-month period, the officer would need to return the $100 to the company under the short-swing profit rule.

> Section 16 of the Securities Exchange Act likewise precludes company insiders from [short selling](/shortselling) any class of a company's securities.

## Analysis of the Short-Swing Profit Rule

There are a few conflicts with respect to this rule. Some accept it changes the idea of shared risk between company insiders and other [shareholders](/shareholder). In short, since this rule bars insiders from participating in a type of trading activity that different investors might partake in, they are not inclined to similar risks as different shareholders who participate in transactions as the value of securities rises and falls.

For instance, on the off chance that a non-insider investor submits buy and sell requests in quick succession, they face the standard [risks associated with the market](/marketrisk). An insider, then again, is constrained to stagger their investment choices with respect to the company they approach data on. While this can keep them from exploiting that data, it additionally can keep them from the immediate risks of the market alongside different investors.

In particular, this alluded to securities that were separately traded, nonconvertible stocks. These various securities would likewise have different [voting rights](/votingright) associated with them.

In the Gibbons v. Malone case, a director for Discovery Communications around the same time sold series C shares and afterward bought series A stock with the company. A shareholder disagreed with the transaction, however that's what the courts ruled, along with different reasons, the shares were separately registered and traded, making the transactions exempt from the short-swing profit rule.
