# Quasi-Reorganization
## What Is a Quasi-Reorganization?

A quasi-reorganization is a moderately dark provision under [generally accepted accounting principles](/gaap) (GAAP), which states that in specific situations, a firm might eliminate a deficit in its [retained earnings](/retainedearnings) account by restating assets, liabilities, and equity in a way like a bankruptcy. A firm's stockholders must consent to permit the accounting change, which basically resets the firm's books like another company had incurred the assets and liabilities of the old firm.

## Understanding a Quasi-Reorganization

Albeit the possibility of a quasi-reorganization has seen some reestablished interest, the provision is still rarely applied in practice. The possibility of a quasi-reorganization holds appeal for some as it is a thought of a "new beginning" and is more exciting to investors than gradually digging out from a large deficit of retained earnings.

Some likewise contend that quasi-reorganizations could be an effective method of all the more accurately resetting the accounting balances of a firm when a serious drop in asset value isn't satisfactorily reflected. A quasi-reorganization remains profoundly disputable, be that as it may, since it isn't genuinely a change of economic reality, but instead a method to cause books to show up better.

Quasi-reorganizations can carry risks to lenders or providers that stretch out credit to firms that have gone through a quasi-reorganization. Since a quasi-reorganization makes a company's balance sheet look more grounded, this brings comfort to lenders in extending credit. On the off chance that the lenders knew about the genuine financial situation of the company, they maybe wouldn't loan money or would loan at a higher rate to make up for the real risk taken. Quasi-reorganizations as a rule require disclosure in the [financial statements](/financial-statements), so lenders ought to make a point to pay special attention to such things.

## Benefits of a Quasi-Reorganization

Numerous new businesses operate at a loss for quite some time after inception. During this period, the sales team makes contacts, workers are trained, processes are enhanced and streamlined, and [brand recognition](/brand-character) is developed. When the company turns its most memorable profit, a huge retained earnings deficit might have developed. Furthermore, a drawn out [recession](/recession) could transform a profitable company into a company with a retained earnings deficit.

It is frequently unlawful or disallowed by debt pledges to pay a [dividend](/dividend) from retained earnings while operating with a retained earnings deficit. In this instance, the equity [cost of capital](/costofcapital) can increase really as investors demand more return for perceived risk. Here, a quasi-reorganization could seem OK.

At the point when a company goes through a quasi-reorganization, it is permitted to continue paying dividends, maintains a strategic distance from the costs and time associated with a [Chapter 11](/chapter11) bankruptcy, and perhaps acknowledges tax benefits. As a quasi-reorganization never really works on the genuine operational part of a business, they are typically joined by different changes, like unions, eliminating excess, and improving proficiency.

## Goals of a Quasi-Reorganization

The main goal of a quasi-reorganization is to bring the retained earnings balance to zero. In the first place, overvalued assets ought to be written down to [fair value](/fairvalue) with a direct reduction in retained earnings. Albeit this increases the deficit quickly, it will reduce future [depreciation](/depreciation) expenses. Liabilities are additionally repeated to their fair values with any resulting balances going to the retained earnings deficit.

Whenever assets have been reduced to fair value, either extra [paid-in capital](/paidincapital) or the par value of common stock is reduced to balance out the elimination of the retained earnings deficit. Companies have some flexibility while deciding how to continue with the quasi-reorganization; it is feasible to reduce par value, increase extra paid-in capital, and zero out retained earnings simultaneously.
