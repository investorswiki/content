# Applicable Cost
## What Is Relevant Cost?

Pertinent cost is a [managerial accounting](/managerialaccounting) term that depicts avoidable costs that are incurred just while making specific business decisions. The concept of applicable cost is utilized to eliminate pointless data that could muddle the decision-making process. For instance, significant cost is utilized to determine whether to sell or keep a business unit.

Something contrary to a pertinent cost is a [sunk cost](/sunkcost), which has proactively been incurred no matter what the outcome of the current decision.

## Illustration of Relevant Cost

Expect, for instance, a passenger surges up to the ticket counter to purchase a ticket for a flight that is leaving in 25 minutes. The airline needs to consider the important costs to come to a conclusion about the ticket price. Practically each of the costs connected with adding the extra passenger have proactively been incurred, including the plane fuel, airport gate fee, and the salary and benefits for the whole plane's team. Since these costs have previously been incurred, they are "sunk costs" or [irrelevant costs](/irrelevantcost).

The main extra cost is the labor to load the passenger's baggage and any food that is served mid-flight, so the airline bases the latest possible moment ticket pricing decision on just a couple of small costs.

## Types of Relevant Cost Decisions
### Continue Operating versus Closing Business Units

A big decision for a manager is whether to close a business unit or continue to operate it, and important costs are the basis for the decision. Expect, for instance, a chain of retail sporting goods stores is considering closing a group of stores catering to the outside sports market. The important costs are the costs that can be eliminated due to the closure, as well as the revenue lost when the stores are closed. If the costs to be eliminated are greater than the revenue lost, the outside stores ought to be closed.

### Make versus Buy

[Make versus buy decisions](/go with or-buy-choice) are many times an issue for a company that requires part parts to make a finished product. For instance, a furniture manufacturer is considering an outside vendor to collect and stain wood cabinets, which would then be finished in-house by adding handles and different subtleties. The significant costs in this decision are the [variable costs](/variablecost) incurred by the manufacturer to make the wood cabinets and the price paid to the outside vendor. On the off chance that the vendor can give the part at a lower cost, the furniture manufacturer reevaluates the work.

### Factoring in a Special Order

A special order happens when a customer puts in a request close to the furthest limit of the month, and prior sales take care of currently the [fixed cost](/fixedcost) of production for the month. On the off chance that a client needs a price quote for a special order, management just considers the variable costs to create the goods, specifically material and [labor costs](/cost-of-labor). Fixed costs, for example, a factory lease or manager salaries, are irrelevant on the grounds that the firm has previously paid for those costs with prior sales.
