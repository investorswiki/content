## What Is a Test?

In technical analysis and trading, a test is the point at which a stock's price moves toward an established support or resistance level set by the market. Assuming the stock stays within the support and resistance levels, the test passes. Notwithstanding, on the off chance that the stock price arrives at new lows or potentially new highs, the test fails. In other words, for technical analysis, price levels are tested to check whether patterns or signals are accurate.

A test may likewise allude to at least one [statistical](/statistics) techniques used to evaluate differences or similarities between estimated values from models or factors found in data. Models incorporate the [t-test](/t-test) and [z-test](/z-test).

## Understanding Tests

Well known technical indicators that traders and investors use to test support and resistance levels incorporate trend lines, moving averages, and round numbers.

For instance, numerous investors pay close attention to the price action of major stock indexes, like the Standard and Poor's 500 Index (S&P 500), Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA), and Nasdaq Composite when they test their 200-day moving average or a long-term trendline. Further developed techniques used to test support and resistance levels incorporate utilizing pivot points, [Fibonacci retracement](/fibonacciretracement) levels, and Gann angles.

The historical price chart below shows the S&P 500 testing its 200-day moving average:

Traders ought to monitor [volume](/volume) closely when a stock's price approaches key support and resistance areas. Assuming the volume is expanding, there is a higher probability that the price will fail when it tests these levels due to increased interest in the issue. Declining volume, then again, suggests the test might pass as the stock might not have sufficient participation to [break out](/breakout) to another level.

### Range-Bound Market Test

At the point when a stock is [range-bound](/rangeboundtrading), price frequently tests the trading range's upper and lower boundaries. On the off chance that traders are utilizing a strategy that purchases support and sells resistance, they ought to wait for several tests of these boundaries to confirm price respects them before entering a trade.

Once in a position, traders ought to place a stop-loss order in case the next test of support or resistance fails.

### Trending Market Test

In an up-trending market, previous resistance becomes support, while in a down-trending market, past support becomes resistance. When price breaks out to another high or low, it often [retraces](/retracement) to test these levels before resuming in the direction of the trend. Momentum traders can utilize the test of a previous swing high or swing low to enter a position at a more ideal price than if they would have pursued the initial breakout.

A [stop-loss order](/stop-lossorder) ought to be placed directly below the test area to close the trade on the off chance that the trend unexpectedly inverts.

## Statistical Tests

Inferential statistics utilizes the properties of data to test hypotheses and draw ends. [Hypothesis testing](/hypothesistesting) allows one to test a thought utilizing a data [sample](/sample) concerning a population parameter. The methodology employed by the analyst relies upon the nature of the data utilized and the justification behind the analysis. In particular, one looks to reject the [null hypothesis](/null_hypothesis), or the notion that at least one [random variables](/random-variable) affect another. In the event that this can be rejected, the factors are probably going to be associated with each other.

There are several tools used to conduct hypothesis testing, some of which include:

- A t-test is a type of inferential statistic used to determine assuming that there is a significant difference between the means of two gatherings, which might be related in certain features. It is mostly utilized when the data sets, similar to the data set recorded as the outcome from flipping a coin 100 times, would follow a normal distribution and may have obscure variances. A t-test is utilized as a hypothesis testing tool, which allows testing of an assumption material to a population. Z-tests are closely related to t-tests, but t-tests are best performed when an experiment has a more modest sample size.
- The [Wilcoxon test](/wilcoxon-test), which can allude to either the Rank Sum test or the Signed Rank test variant, is a nonparametric statistical test that compares two paired gatherings.
- [Chi-square](/chi-square-statistic) (**\u03c7**^2^) is a test that measures how a model compares to actual noticed data. The data utilized in calculating a chi-square [statistic](/statistics) must be random, raw, [mutually exclusive](/mutuallyexclusive), drawn from independent factors, and drawn from a sufficiently large sample. For instance, the results of tossing a fair coin meet these criteria.
- The [Bonferroni test](/bonferroni-test) is a statistical test used to reduce the instance of a [false positive](/type_1_error).
- A [Scheff\u00e9 test](/scheffes-test) is a sort of post-hoc, statistical analysis test that is utilized to make impromptu correlations.

## Highlights
- Several technical tests exist, including those explicitly intended for range-bound versus trending markets.
- Such tests are often used to confirm resistance or support levels in a stock or other asset.
- Tests may likewise allude to statistical methods to evaluate hypotheses or associations between factors.
- A test, in technical analysis, alludes to the ability of a signal, pattern, or other indicator to hold firm in subsequent price action.
