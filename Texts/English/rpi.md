# Retail Price Index (RPI)
## What Is the Retail Price Index (RPI)?

The Retail Price Index (RPI) is one of the two primary measures of consumer [inflation](/inflation) created by the United Kingdom's Office for National Statistics (ONS). It isn't viewed as an official statistic by the U.K., however it is utilized for certain types of cost acceleration. The RPI was presented in the U.K. in 1947, and it was made official in 1956.

## Understanding the Retail Price Index (RPI)

The Retail Price Index (RPI) is a more established measurement of inflation that is as yet distributed on the grounds that it is utilized to compute cost of living and wage heightening; in any case, it isn't viewed as an official inflation rate by the government. RPI was first calculated for June 1947, to a great extent supplanting the previous Cost of Living Index. It was once the principal official measure of inflation. Nonetheless, the consumer prices index (CPI) presently to a great extent fills that need in practice.

The U.K. government actually involves RPI for certain purposes, for example, calculating the sums payable on index-linked securities, including index-linked gilts and social housing rent increases. British employers likewise use it as a starting point in wage negotiation. In any case, starting around 2003, it has never again been utilized to set the inflation target for the Bank of England's Monetary Policy Committee, and since April 2011, it has never again been utilized as the basis for the indexation of the pensions of former public sector employees. Beginning around 2016, the U.K. state pension has been indexed by the highest of the increase in average earnings, CPI, or a rate of 2.5%.

In 2013, following a discussion on opportunities for working on the RPI, the U.K. national statistician said the formula used to create the RPI didn't satisfy international guidelines and suggested that another index known as RPIJ be distributed. In this way, ONS chose to never again group RPI as a "national statistic." However, ONS will keep on computing RPI, among several renditions of the inflation index, to give a steady historic inflation time series. The index factors keep on being utilized to adapt to inflation in capital gains for inclusion in the tax calculation for elements, subject to corporation tax in the U.K.

In Jan. 2018, Mark Carney, legislative head of the Bank of England, said that RPI ought to be abandoned.

## RPI versus CPI

Like the better-known CPI, the RPI tracks changes in the cost of a fixed [basket of goods](/basket_of_goods) after some time, and it is delivered by joining around 180,000 price statements for around 700 representative things. Notwithstanding, starting from the presentation of the CPI in 1996, year inflation in the U.K. has generally been around 0.9 percentage points higher when measured by the RPI, as compared to the CPI.

The difference of 0.9 percentage points between the RPI and CPI in the U.K. emerges for a number of reasons. First and foremost, the RPI incorporates a number of things that are excluded in the CPI, and vice versa. Also, the two indicators measure [price change](/price-change) for different target populaces. At last, the two measures utilize different formulas, leading to a difference known as the "formula effect."
