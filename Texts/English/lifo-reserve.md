# LIFO Reserve
## What Is LIFO Reserve?

LIFO reserve is an accounting term that measures the difference between the [first in, first out](/fifo) (FIFO) and [last in, first out](/lifo) (LIFO) cost of inventory for the end goal of bookkeeping. The LIFO reserve is an account used to bridge the gap among FIFO and LIFO costs when a company utilizes the FIFO method to follow its inventory however reports under the LIFO method in the readiness of its financial statements.

## Understanding LIFO Reserve

The FIFO method of assessing [inventory](/inventory) is where the goods or services created first are the goods or services sold first, or discarded first. The LIFO method of assessing inventory is the point at which the goods or services delivered last are the ones to be sold or discarded first.

The LIFO reserve comes about in light of the fact that most organizations utilize the FIFO, or standard cost method, for internal use and the LIFO method for outside reporting, similarly as with tax arrangement. This is worthwhile in periods of rising prices since it decreases a company's tax burden when it reports utilizing the LIFO method.

The LIFO reserve is known as a [contra inventory account](/contraaccount). A contra account's balance is something contrary to the account it is associated with.

## LIFO versus FIFO

For instance, while involving the LIFO method for inventory accounting in periods of rising prices, the cost of reported inventory is higher than the FIFO method, which, hence, builds a company's [cost of goods sold](/cogs) (COGS), decreasing its [pre-tax earnings](/pretax-earnings). When pre-tax earnings are lower, there is a lower amount to pay taxes on, subsequently, less taxes paid overall.

Then, at that point, for internal purposes, for example, on account of investor reporting, a similar company can utilize the FIFO method of inventory accounting, which reports lower costs and higher [margins](/profitmargin), which is appealing to investors. In periods of rising prices, consistent expansions in costs can make a credit balance in the LIFO reserve, which brings about discounted inventory costs when reported on the balance sheet.

Practically all analysts take a gander at a public corporation's LIFO reserve. Frequently earnings should be adjusted for changes in the LIFO reserve, as in [adjusted EBITDA](/adjusted-ebitda) and a few types of adjusted [earnings per share](/eps) (EPS).

## Computing LIFO Reserve

While getting ready company financials for the LIFO method, the difference in costs in inventory among LIFO and FIFO is the LIFO reserve. Hence, a company's LIFO reserve = (FIFO inventory) - (LIFO inventory). LIFO reserve is generally followed so that companies utilizing various methods of accounting can be precisely compared.

To guarantee exactness, a LIFO reserve is calculated at the time the LIFO method was adopted. The year-to-year changes yet to be determined inside the LIFO reserve can likewise give an unpleasant representation of that specific year's [inflation](/inflation), expecting the type of inventory has not changed.

Accounting experts have discouraged the utilization of "reserve," empowering accountants to utilize different terms like "revaluation to LIFO," "abundance of FIFO over LIFO cost," or "LIFO allowance."

## Benefits of LIFO Reserve

As stated, one of the benefits of the LIFO reserve is to permit investors and analysts to compare companies that utilization different accounting methods, similarly. The main benefit is that it permits a comparison among LIFO and FIFO and the ability to see any differences, including how [taxes](/taxes) may be influenced.

This permits companies to better change their financial statements and budget with respect to sales, costs, taxes, and profits.
