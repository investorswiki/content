# Benjamin Method
## What Is the Benjamin Method?

The Benjamin Method is a term used to describe the investment philosophy of [Benjamin Graham](/bengraham) (1894-1976), who is credited with inventing the strategy of [value investing](/valueinvesting) utilizing fundamental analysis, whereby investors analyze stock data to find assets that have been systematically undervalued.

## Understanding the Benjamin Method

The Benjamin Method of investing is the brainchild of Benjamin Graham, a British-American investor, economist, and creator. He came to prominence in 1934, with the publication of his textbook **Security Analysis**, which he co-wrote with David Dodd. **Security Analysis** is a fundamental book for the investment industry today, and the teachings of Benjamin Graham heavily influenced well known investors like [Warren Buffett](/oracleofomaha). Benjamin Graham showed Warren Buffett while Buffett was learning at Columbia University, and Buffett has written that Graham's books and teachings "became the bedrock upon which my investment and business decisions have been all constructed." His popular book, **The Intelligent Investor**, has gained recognition as the basic work in value investing.

Benjamin Graham's method of value investing stresses that there are two types of investors: long-term and short-term investors. Short term investors are speculators who bet on variances in the price of an asset, while long-term, value investors ought to think of themselves as the owner of a company. Assuming you are the owner of a company, you shouldn't care the market's opinion on its worth, the length of you have strong evidence that the business is or will be sufficiently profitable.

## Utilizing the Benjamin Method

The original Benjamin Method for finding the [intrinsic value](/intrinsicvalue) of a stock was:

**

V

=

E

P

S

\u00d7

(

8

.

5

+

2

g

)

where:

V

=

intrinsic value

E

P

S

=

following 12-mth

E

P

S

 of the company

8

.

5

=

P

/

E

 ratio of a zero-growth stock

\begin{aligned}&V \ =\ EPS \ 	imes\ (8.5\ +\ 2g)\\&	extbf{where:}\\& V\ =\ 	ext{intrinsic value}\\&EPS\ =\ 	ext{trailing 12-mth } EPS	ext{ of the company}\\&8.5\ =\ P/E	ext{ ratio of a zero-growth stock}\\&g\ =\ 	ext{long-term growth rate of the company}\end{aligned}

 V = EPS \u00d7 (8.5 + 2g)where:V = intrinsic valueEPS = following 12-mth EPS of the company8.5 = P/E ratio of a zero-growth stock **

In 1974, the formula was revised to include both a [risk-free rate](/risk-freerate) of 4.4%, which was the average yield of high-grade [corporate bonds](/corporatebond) in 1962 and the [current yield](/currentyield) on [AAA corporate bonds](/aaa) represented by the letter Y:

## Example Using the Benjamin Method

Let's say you are an investor who is considering purchasing shares in the hypothetical Philadelphia Widget Company. The company is well known and is the leading purveyor of widgets in America. Its stock is trading at $100 per share, while it earns $10 per year in profits. A competitor to the Philadelphia Widget Company is the Cleveland Widget Company, a younger upstart that isn't well known yet has gained market share in recent years. It earns undeniably less money, just $2 per year, however the stock is likewise significantly cheaper at $15 per share.

An investor following the Benjamin Method of investing would use these figures and other data to perform a [fundamental analysis](/fundamentalanalysis) of the company. For instance, we can see that the Cleveland Widget Company is cheaper for every dollar of earnings to buy than the Philadelphia Widget Company. The [price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio](/price-earningsratio) of the Philadelphia Widget Company is 10, whereas it is 7.5 for the Cleveland Widget Company. A follower of the Benjamin Method of investing would conclude that the Philadelphia company is overpriced simply because it is well known. This investor would choose the Cleveland company instead.
