On the off chance that an investor purchases this bond, they will receive $5 each year (5% of $100) in interest payments. In theory, the investor can receive their $5 interest payments and reinvest them in a comparable bond to earn 5% on their interest.

In that scenario, the yield to maturity of the bond would be 5%, since the investor hopes to earn 5% every year. The basis price of the bond would subsequently likewise be 5%. Assuming that equivalent bond had a basis price of 5% regardless of having a coupon rate of under 5%, then that would suggest that the bond being referred to was being offered at a discount to its par value.
