# Availability Schedule
## What Is an Availability Schedule?

In banking, the term availability schedule alludes to the period of time required for the funds from a deposited check to open up to the beneficiary. During the time in which the funds are inaccessible, they are alluded to as being [on hold](/check-hold).

## Understanding Availability Schedules

The maximum number of days that funds can be kept on hold by [banks](/bank) is directed by the [Expedited Funds Availability Act (EFAA)](/expedited-funds-availability-act). This law was enacted by Congress in 1987 and hence turned into a regulation of the [Federal Reserve](/federalreservebank).

The purpose of the EFAA is to control the utilization of holds by banks by giving different availability schedules to various types of [deposits](/deposit). Today, these rules are alluded to as Regulation CC, named after the Federal Reserve regulation that is responsible for trying the EFAA.

[Regulation CC](/regulation-cc) recognizes four types of deposit holds, each with their own availability schedules. Statutory holds are the most common type of hold, and can be put on any deposit. Large deposits, in the interim, can be put either on individual deposits of $5,000 or more or on a bundle of several deposits adding up to $5,000 or more in one day or less. In circumstances where an account has been open for 30 days or less, the bank can likewise carry out new account holds.

> ### Regulatory Changes
> Initially, the EFAA made a differentiation among nearby and non-neighborhood check deposits. Notwithstanding, with the section of the [Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act](/dodd-frank-monetary regulatory-reform-bill) in 2010, this differentiation was wiped out.

The regulations likewise take into consideration a broad category of exception holds, which can be made under different conditions. In particular, exception holds can be made when an account has been overdrawn for a certain number of days during the previous six months, when the depository bank has valid justification to think the check won't go through, when the instrument being deposited is a picture replacement document (IRD) of a previously returned instrument, or when a thing is accepted for deposit during a banking computer disappointment or power blackout.

## Real World Example of an Availability Schedule

For statutory holds, $200 of the deposit must be made accessible the principal business day after the deposit, $600 the second business day, and the lay on the third business day. The rules are no different for large deposits, then again, actually the bank must make $4,800 accessible on the third business day, with the rest accessible no later than the seventh business day.

For new account holds, funds must be accessible no later than the 10th business day after deposit; though for exception holds, they must be accessible inside seven business days.
