## What Is a Contingent Beneficiary

A contingent beneficiary is indicated by an insurance contract holder or retirement account owner as the person or entity getting proceeds if the [primary beneficiary](/primary-beneficiary) is deceased, unfit to be found, or denies the inheritance at the time the proceeds are to be paid. A contingent beneficiary is qualified for [insurance proceeds](/insurance-proceeds) or retirement assets provided that certain foreordained conditions are met at the hour of the protected's death, for example, data found in a will.

## How Contingent Beneficiary Assignment Works

For a contingent beneficiary of a will, practically any conditions might be set up; it relies completely upon the person drafting the will. A contingent beneficiary will not receive anything on the off chance that the primary beneficiary acknowledges an inheritance. For instance, let us say Cheryl records their spouse John as the primary beneficiary for Cheryl's [life insurance](/lifeinsurance) policy and their two children as contingent beneficiaries. At the point when Cheryl kicks the bucket, John receives the insurance [payout](/payout) and the children don't receive anything. Assuming John predeceases Cheryl, their children each receive half the proceeds.

## Characteristics of Contingent Beneficiaries

Contingent beneficiaries can be individuals, organizations, homes, good cause, or trusts. Minor children or pets don't qualify in light of the fact that they don't have the legal power to acknowledge assigned assets. On the off chance that a minor is listed as a contingent beneficiary, a legal guardian is selected to direct the money until the minor arrives at legal age. Despite the fact that it's more normal for contingent beneficiaries to be [immediate family](/immediate-family) individuals, close friends and different family members are frequently listed also.

Numerous contingent beneficiaries might be listed on a life insurance policy or retirement account. Every beneficiary is designated a specific percentage of the money, adding up to 100%. A contingent beneficiary receives assets in a similar way stated for the primary beneficiary. For instance, a primary beneficiary getting $1,000 each month for a very long time means a contingent beneficiary receives payments similarly.

Contingent beneficiaries should be looked into and refreshed after major life changes, like marriage, divorce, birth, or death. For instance, after Chris and Rain divorce, Chris refreshes their life insurance policy so Chris' child River is the primary beneficiary and Chris' other child Riley is the contingent beneficiary. Chris effectively blocks Rain from accepting Chris' life insurance proceeds.

## Benefits of Naming Contingent Beneficiaries

Naming a contingent beneficiary for a life insurance policy or retirement account assists one's family with staying away from pointless time and expenses connected with [probate](/probate). Probate is the legal course of distributing a deceased person's assets when there is no will.

For instance, Uni records their children's step-parent Alex as the primary beneficiary and Uni's number one charity as the contingent beneficiary for their life insurance proceeds. Even assuming that Alex kicks the bucket before Uni, Uni's children can't fight over their life insurance benefits in light of the fact that Uni listed the charity as the contingent beneficiary.

A life insurance policyholder or retirement account owner can make [contingencies](/possibility) preventing an inheritance without meeting certain capabilities. For instance, a [individual retirement account](/ira) (IRA) owner could lay out their child as the contingent beneficiary and connect a restriction that the child may just acquire the money after they complete college.

Something else to note is due to the passage of the SECURE Act in 2019, non-spousal beneficiaries must pull out 100% of the IRA funds toward the finish of the 10th year following the IRA owner's death.
