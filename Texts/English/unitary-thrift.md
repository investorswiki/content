# Unitary Thrift
## What Is a Unitary Thrift?

A unitary thrift is a chartered [holding company](/holdingcompany) that controls a single [thrift](/thrift) entity. By and large, unitary thrifts could take part in a more extensive scope of activities than bank holding companies, be that as it may, they have gone under expanding limitations since the 2008 financial crisis.

## Figuring out a Unitary Thrift

Unitary thrifts, otherwise called savings and loan holding companies, or SLHCs, are a type of holding company that for the most part holds assets in thrift investments. Thrift institutions, otherwise called savings and loan associations, offer a smaller scope of products than other financial institutions.

Unitary thrifts center around customer and community service, which ordinarily means they deal with traditional essential banking products, like savings and checking accounts, [home loans](/home-mortgage), personal loans, automobile loans, and credit cards.

These thrifts are more limited in these areas, for example, giving loans to single-family homes rather than larger real estate adventures. Also, they center around people and have just limited dealings with businesses. Thrifts are required by law to keep up with 65% of their portfolio in assets related to housing or other qualified assets while they are simply permitted to have 10% of assets in [commercial loans](/commercial-loan).

Thrifts have traditionally catered towards the center and common laborers and offer higher interest rates on savings than larger, national banks. The explanation they can offer better rates is on the grounds that that they can borrow at lower rates from the Federal Home Loan Banking System.

## Savings and Loan Ownership Structures

Unitary thrifts address one of the two ownership models for savings and loan companies. Unitary thrifts offer a small group of investors an approach to controlling a savings and loan through the purchase of stock in the holding company that possesses the thrift.

Due to the liberalization of lender tests, various financial institutions are able to claim depository institutions. These incorporate insurance companies and commercial companies. These elements can buy thrifts, turning into a holding company, and the owners of these companies gain exposure to the thrift.

The other ownership model is a [mutual ownership structure](/mutualcompany), where contributors and borrowers receive part ownership of the savings and loans when they participate in business with the company.

## Regulatory History of Unitary Thrifts

Since thrifts would in general serve customer needs as opposed to investor wants, they initially worked under less regulatory oversight, and prior regulatory systems permitted unitary thrifts to open [branches](/branch-office) anyplace in the United States.

### Savings and Loan Crisis

During the 1980s, the [savings and loan](/sl-crisis) industry went through a crisis after thrifts participated in hazardous financial activities trying to cover losses brought about by contributors who moved their cash from thrifts to money market funds as interest rates blast in the late 1970s.

By 1989, a significant part of the industry had collapsed after failed thrifts caused the insolvency of the [Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation](/federal-savings-and-loan-insurance-corporation-fslic) (FSLIC), which insured deposits.

The [Financial Services Modernization Act of 1999](/financial-services-act-of-1999), otherwise called the Gramm Leach Bliley Act, prohibited the [Office of Thrift Supervision](/ots) (OTS) from accepting any new applications for unitary thrifts. Since that time, the federal government has increased limitations on the leftover unitary thrifts.

### 2008 Financial Crisis

After the 2008 financial crisis, clearing regulation was made across the financial industry. The section of the milestone [Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act](/dodd-frank-financial-regulatory-reform-bill) in 2010 wiped out the OTS in 2011, which experienced ramifications of bad behavior in the collapse of IndyMac and the disappointment of AIG during the 2008 financial crisis.

Dodd-Frank passed supervision of legacy unitary thrifts to other federal agencies and the goal was that savings and loan holding companies (SLHCs) would be dealt with practically like bank holding companies (BHCs) with a couple of qualifications. This would take into consideration more oversight over thrifts.

A significant part of the legislation impacted controlling and non-controlling ownership of thrift holding companies, the piece of capital, a presentation of new capital ratios, as well as new liquidity ratios. There are likewise different criteria, for example, being "very much made due" and "all around capitalized."
