# Conduit Financing
## What Is Conduit Financing?

Conduit financing is a means for private companies, nonprofit organizations (NPO), and public substances to raise capital through [tax-exempt](/tax_exempt) [municipal bonds](/municipalbond) to fund large-scale projects that commonly benefit the overall population. Such projects can incorporate hospitals, air terminals, industrial and housing projects, public facilities, and schools.

Municipal bonds are a form of [revenue bonds](/revenuebond) known as conduit bonds and address a [public-private partnership](/public-private-partnerships).

## How Conduit Financing Works

At the point when a conduit bond is issued, the elements that receive the funds from the issue are known as the conduit borrowers and are responsible for the [interest](/interest) and [principal](/principal) payments to the bondholders. Generally speaking, the conduit issuer isn't responsible for repayment.

The debt of the [bond](/bond) is secured by the revenues from the project that the debt finances and the cash flow from the revenue-producing project is utilized to pay the bondholders. Revenues that protected these bonds are collected by the [conduit issuer](/conduit-issuer) from the borrower and afterward paid to the bondholders.

The borrowing organization must repay interest and principal on the bonds, except if stipulated in any case in a written agreement. For example, if a nearby non-benefit hospital needs to build another maternity community and utilizations conduit financing to fund the project, it is the hospital, not the conduit issuer, that is responsible for debt repayment.

Normal types of conduit financing incorporate [industrial development revenue bonds](/idrb) (IDRBs), [private activity bonds ](/privateactivitybond)(PABs), and housing revenue bonds â€” both for single-family and multifamily projects. Most conduit-issued securities are for projects that benefit either the public at large, such as air terminals, docks, sewage facilities, or specific population sections, including understudies, low-income homebuyers, and veterans.

## Risks of Conduit Financing

The risks of conduit financing are higher as the bond isn't backed by the full faith of the issuer. For a municipal bond, this means that it isn't backed by municipal [assets](/resource) or taxes.

The investors of the bonds are really investing in the project, rather than the [credit standing](/creditrating) of the bond issuer. Thusly, they are presented to the risks that accompany the development of another project.

It is essential, consequently, that investors are sure about all subtleties of the project being financed. That incorporates costs, season of completion, [default risk](/defaultrisk), and future revenue generation, which can ordinarily be all found in the project's prospectus.

## Benefits of Conduit Financing

Moreover, likewise with other municipal bonds, it is less difficult for an investor to transfer ownership and offload the inherent risk in conduit financing, compared to the [corporate bond](/corporatebond) market.

Another advantage that conduit bonds hold over corporate bonds is that they are generally not [taxed](/taxes) at the federal level on interest [income](/income). Investors could likewise be exempt from state taxation on interest payments in the event that they live in the state in which the bond is issued or the bond is issued by a U.S. domain.

There is, in any case, no special treatment on [capital gains](/capitalgain). Conduit bond investors are as yet responsible to pay taxes on the growth in value of their investments when they sell up like every other person.
