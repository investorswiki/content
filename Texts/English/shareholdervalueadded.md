## Shareholder Value Added in Value Investing

The notoriety of SVA arrived at a top during the 1980s as corporate managers and boards of directors went under examination for zeroing in on personal or company gains as opposed to zeroing in on shareholders. SVA is not generally held in such high respect by the investment community.

[Value investors](/valueinvesting) who center around SVA are more worried about generating short-term returns over the market average than with longer-term returns. This compromise is implicit in the SVA model, which rebuffs companies for [incurring capital costs](/capital-investment) trying to extend business operations. Pundits counter that these value investors are driving companies towards pursuing shortsighted choices instead of zeroing in on fulfilling their customers.

One might say, investors who center around SVA are in many cases really searching for [cash value added](/cva) (CVA). Companies that create a ton of cash through their operations can pay higher dividends or show greater short-term profits. This is just a general effect of real productivity or wealth creation, notwithstanding.

Real investments frequently require extraordinary capital expenditures and short-term losses. This is particularly true in the current digital age driven by innovation and heavy investment in technology and trial and error. Another concept called rush scaling could be seen as something contrary to SVA in that it concentrates entirely on short-term losses and all the consideration regarding long-term value creation.

Investors generally believe that their corporations should expand returns, pay [dividends](/profit), and show profits. Value investors can risk becoming shortsighted by zeroing in just on SVA and not thinking about the long-term ramifications of too little reinvestment.
