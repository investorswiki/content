# Negative Carry
## What Is Negative Carry?

Negative carry is a condition wherein the cost of holding an investment or [security](/security) surpasses the income earned while holding it. A negative carry trade or investment is much of the time unwanted to professional portfolio managers since it means the investment is losing money as long as the [principal](/principal) value of the investment continues as before (or falls). In any case, numerous investors and professionals routinely go into such conditions when they expect a huge payoff from holding the investment over the long run.

Negative carry can be stood out from [positive carry](/positivecarry).

## How Negative Carry Works

Any investment that costs more to hold than it returns in payments can bring about negative carry. A negative carry investment can be a securities position, (for example, [bonds](/bond), stocks, futures, or forex positions), real estate (like a rental property), or even a business. Even banks can experience negative carry on the off chance that the income earned from a loan is not exactly the bank's [cost of funds](/costoffunds). This is likewise called the negative [cost of carry](/costofcarry).

This measure does exclude any [capital gains](/capitalgain) that could happen when the asset is sold or develops. Such anticipated gains are many times the primary explanation negative carry investments of this nature are initiated and held.

## Instances of Negative Carry
### Real Estate

Claiming a house is a negative carry investment for most homeowners who live in the home as their primary residence. The costs of the interest on a commonplace [mortgage](/mortgage) every month are more than the amount that will accrue to the principal for the primary half of the mortgage term.

The cost of upkeep on the house is a financial burden too. Notwithstanding, on the grounds that house prices have would in general rise throughout the long term, numerous homeowners experience in any event some amount of capital gain by claiming the home for essentially a couple of years.

### Borrowing and Lending

In the professional investment world, an investor might borrow money at 6% interest to invest in a bond paying a 4% [yield](/yield). In this case, the investor has a negative carry of 2% and is really spending money to claim the bond.

The main justification for doing so would be that the bond was bought at a discount compared to expected future prices. In the event that the bond was purchased at [par](/parvalue) or above and held to maturity, the investor will have a negative return. In any case, in the event that the price of the bond increments, which happens when [interest rates](/interestrate) fall, then the investor's capital gains could well dominate the loss in negative carry.

### Forex Markets

Investors in the foreign exchange (forex) markets can likewise have a negative carry trade, called a [negative carry pair](/negative-carry-pair). Borrowing money in a currency with exorbitant interest rates and afterward investing in assets designated in a lower interest rate [currency](/currency) will make the negative carry. In any case, assuming the value of the greater yielding currency declines relative to the lower-yielding currency, then, at that point, the good shift in exchange rates can make profits that more than offset the negative carry.

The negative carry pair in forex trading in this way looks to take advantage of differences in the exchange rates and interest rates associated with various monetary forms, and is really the reverse of the more well known carry trade strategy.

A trader would possibly start the negative carry trade assuming that they accepted that the low-interest currency in which they are investing will see the value in relative to the exorbitant interest currency in which they are borrowing. In that scenario, the trader would profit when they reverse out of the initial trade: selling the currency they bought in exchange for the currency they borrowed in, then repaying their debt and taking the gain on the transaction.

Of course, this potential gain would have to surpass the cost of the [interest](/interest) payments made all through the term of the investment for the whole transaction to be a triumph.

## Special Considerations

One justification for purchasing a negative carry investment might be to exploit [tax benefits](/tax-benefit). For instance, assume an investor bought a condominium and leased it out. After all expenses were added in, the rental income was $50 not exactly the month to month expenses.

Nonetheless, in light of the fact that the interest payment was tax-[deductible](/deductible), the investor saved $150 each month on taxes. This permits the investor to hold the condo for sufficient opportunity to expect capital gains. Since tax laws shift, such benefits won't be uniform all over the place, and when tax laws change the cost of carry might become greater.

While borrowing to invest is the ordinary justification for negative carry (where the carry cost is the interest), [short selling](/shortselling) can likewise make a negative carry situation. One model would be in a [market-neutral](/marketneutral) strategy where a short position in a security is matched against a long position in another.
