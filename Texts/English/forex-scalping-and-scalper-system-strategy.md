# Forex Scalping
## What Is Forex Scalping?

Forex scalping is a day trading style utilized by [forex](/forex) traders that includes buying or selling currency pairs with just a short holding time trying to make a series of quick profits. A forex scalper hopes to make a large number of trades, exploiting the small price movements, which are common over the course of the day. While scalping endeavors to capture small gains, for example, 5 to 20 [pips](/pip) per trade, the profit on these trades can be amplified by expanding the position size.

Forex scalpers will commonly hold trades for as little as seconds to minutes all at once, and [open](/vacant position) and close various positions inside a single day.

## Figuring out Forex Scalping

Forex scalpers ordinarily use [leverage](/leverage), which allows for larger position sizes, so a small change in price equals a respectable profit. For instance, a five pip profit in the [EUR/USD](/eur-usd-euro-us-dollar-currency-pair) on a $10,000 position ([mini lot](/mini-parcel)) is $5, while on a $100,000 position ([standard lot](/standard-part)) that five pip movement likens to $50.

Forex scalping strategies can be manual or automated. A manual system includes a trader sitting at the computer screen, searching for signs, and deciphering whether to buy or sell. In an automated trading system, programs are utilized to tell the trading software when to buy and sell in light of inputted boundaries.

Scalping is well known at the times after important data releases, like the U.S. employment report and [interest rate](/interestrate) announcements. These types of high-impact news releases cause huge price moves in a short amount of time, which is great for the scalper who needs to get into and out of trades quickly.

Due to the increased volatility, [position sizes](/positionsizing) might be downsized to reduce risk. While a trader might endeavor to for the most part make 10 pips on a trade, in the outcome of a major news announcement they might have the option to capture 20 pips or more, for instance.

## Forex Scalping Risks

Like all styles of trading, forex scalping isn't without risk. While profits can gather quickly in the event that heaps of profitable trades are taken, losses can likewise mount quickly on the off chance that the trader doesn't have the foggiest idea what they are doing or is utilizing an imperfect system. Even if risking a small amount for each trade, taking many trades could mean a critical [drawdown](/drawdown) on the off chance that a large number of those trades turn out to be losers.

Leverage and increased position sizes can likewise represent a risk. Expect a trader has $10,000 in their account however is utilizing a $100,000 position size. This compares to 10:1 leverage. Expect the trader will risk five pips on each trade, and attempts to get out when they have a 10 pip profit.

This is a viable system, yet sometimes the trader will not have the option to get out for a five pip loss. The market may [gap](/gap) through their [stop loss](/stop-lossorder) point, bringing about the trader getting out with a 20 pip loss and losing four times as much true to form.

This scenario, known as [slippage](/slippage), is common around major news announcements, and a couple of these slippage scenarios can drain an account quickly.

## Special Considerations

Forex scalpers require a trading account with small spreads, low commissions, and the ability to post orders at any price. This large number of elements are normally just offered in [ECN forex accounts](/ecn-agent).

ECN forex accounts allow the trader to act like a [market maker](/marketmaker) and decide to buy at the [bid](/bid) price and sell at the [offer](/ask) price. Ordinary forex trading accounts require retail clients to buy at the offer and sell at the bid. Average forex accounts additionally deter or don't allow scalping.

In the event that the spread or commissions are too high, or the price at which a trader can trade is too restricted, the possibilities of the forex scalper succeeding are enormously diminished.

## Forex Scalping Strategies

There are incalculable trading strategies, despite the fact that they will ordinarily fall into just a couple of broad categories:

- [Trend trading](/trendtrading) strategies include entering toward the trend and endeavoring to capture a profit on the off chance that the trend proceeds.
- [Countertrend trading](/countertrend) is more hard for a scalper and includes steering a position the other way of the trend. Such trades would be taken when the trader anticipates that the trend should reverse or [pullback](/pullback).
- Range strategies recognize support and resistance areas and afterward the trader endeavors to buy close to support and sell close to resistance. The trader is profiting from swaying price action.
- Statistical traders search for patterns or oddities that will quite often happen given specific conditions. This could incorporate buying/selling and holding the position for five minutes in the event that a certain chart pattern shows up at a certain season of day, for instance. Statistical forex scalping strategies are in many cases in light of time, price, day of the week, or chart patterns.

## An Example of Scalping the EUR/USD

Expect a forex scalper trades the EUR/USD utilizing a trend trading strategy. They distinguish the recent trend, hang tight for a pullback, and afterward buy when the price begins moving back in the trending course.

Contingent upon volatility, the trader regularly risks four pips and takes profit at eight pips. The reward is two times the risk, which is a favorable [risk/reward](/riskrewardratio). In the event that volatility is higher than expected, the trader will risk more pips and try to create a larger gain, yet the position size will be smaller than with the four pip stop loss.

Expect the trader has a $10,000 account and will risk 0.5% of their account per trade. That means they can lose $50 per trade. They are risking four pips. Every standard parcel ($100,000) compares to $10 in profit or loss per pip. Since the trader is risking four pips, they can trade 1.25 standard parcels ($50/(4 pips x $10)). Assuming they lose four pips on 1.25 standard parts, they will lose $50, which is their maximum risk per trade. Their profit is double, so assuming they make eight pips, they will earn $100.

The account has $10,000 in it, yet the trader is utilizing a $100,000 position size. This is 10:1 leverage.

The following chart shows three trades, in light of the recent trend heading. The principal trade is a victor for eight pips, or $100. The subsequent trade is a loss for four pips, or $50. The next two trades are victors for eight pips, or $100 each.

The overall profit for the day is three victors ($300) minus one loser ($50), or $250. On a $10,000 account, that is a 2.5% return for the afternoon. This shows the [compounding](/compounding) power of scalping.

On the flip side, finding winning trades is difficult and, even with risking 0.5% of the account per trade, on the off chance that the trader doesn't have a sound method, losses can mount quickly.
