## What Is a To-Fund?

A to-fund is a type of [target-date retirement fund](/target-date_fund) whose asset allocation starts more aggressive and turns out to be generally conservative at the fund's target date. A to-fund could seem OK for somebody who hopes to cash out their investment when the fund arrives at the target date to purchase an alternate type of asset or investment.

A "to" target-date 2045 fund could have a glide path that outcomes in an asset allocation of 0% stocks and 100% bonds and short-term funds in 2045, while a "through" 2045 target-date fund could in any case be invested 60% in stocks with the leftover 40% in bonds and [short-term funds](/shorterminvestments). The "through" fund's percentage of stocks would keep on diminishing slowly after the target date so that, during retirement, the percentage of bonds and cash equivalents would keep on expanding. The to-fund's asset allocation wouldn't change in the wake of arriving at the target date.
