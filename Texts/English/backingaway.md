# Backing Away
## What Is Backing Away?

The term backing away alludes to the disappointment by a [market maker](/marketmaker) in a security to respect the quoted [bid and ask](/bid-and-ask) prices for a base quantity. Backing away is a serious violation of industry regulations. The [Financial Industry Regulatory Authority](/finra) (FINRA) utilizes an automated market surveillance system to empower the resolution of backing-away objections in real-time. Backing away is normally disapproved of and can lead to disciplinary action against the market maker who has backed away.

## Understanding Backing Away

Suppose that an investor needs to buy 1,500 shares of Company X. Bank Y is the market maker for this stock and promotes at 9:00 a.m. on Tuesday that the bid for Company X's stock is $35.67 and its asking price is $36.

The investor submits a request to buy 1,500 shares at $36, however Bank X abruptly moves in an opposite direction from the price, claiming that the bid is presently $35.97 and the ask is currently $36.50. This abuses the [firm-quote](/firmquote) rules laid out by the [Securities and Exchange Commission](/sec) (SEC), Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA), and other regulatory bodies that require market makers to execute orders at their displayed quotation, and could bring about disciplinary action.

In any case, there are a few conditions under which a market maker doesn't need to abide by these firm-quote rules. One such situation may be in the event that the market maker sends a quote change to the exchange before an investor presents an order. Another may be assuming the market maker is currently taking care of a request and changes the stock price before it is, or ought to sensibly be, aware that another order has been put; it doesn't need to take care of the new request at the old price.

## Backing Away Complaint

Backing away comprises a breach of SEC Rule 11Ac1-1 or the "firm quote rule," which requires a market maker to execute an order introduced to it at a price to some extent as positive as its distributed quotation, up to its distributed quotation size. [Broker-dealers](/specialist seller) and market makers must likewise follow SEC Rule 11Ac1-4, which is known as the "limit order display rule."

A potential backing-away grievance must be brought to the consideration of the regulation department of the specific exchange where the violation happened in something like five minutes of the supposed offense. Any other way, it very well might be hard for department staff to get a contemporaneous trade execution from the market maker.

FINRA doesn't seek after immediate disciplinary action for an individual backing-away objection where a contemporaneous trade execution from the market maker is gotten or offered. Notwithstanding, department staff keep a record of such offenses and rehashed resistance with the firm quote rule could bring about disciplinary action. Disciplinary action can incorporate fines, suspension, and some other punishments settled on by the fitting regulatory body.

## Backing Away Impact on Investors

At the point when a market maker moves in an opposite direction from a quoted price, the impact brings about the investor buying at a higher price or selling at a lower price than quoted.
