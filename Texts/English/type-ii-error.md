# Type II Error
## What Is a Type II Error?

A type II blunder is a statistical term utilized inside the setting of hypothesis testing that depicts the mistake that happens when one neglects to dismiss a [null hypothesis](/null_hypothesis) that is false. A type II mistake creates a false negative, otherwise called a blunder of oversight. For instance, a test for a disease might report a negative outcome when the patient is contaminated. This is a type II blunder since we acknowledge the finish of the test as negative, even however it is mistaken.

In statistical analysis, a [type I error](/type_1_error) is the dismissal of a true null hypothesis, while a type II mistake depicts the blunder that happens when one neglects to dismiss a null hypothesis **that is really false.** The mistake dismisses the alternative hypothesis, even however it doesn't happen due to chance.

## Grasping a Type II Error

A type II mistake, otherwise called a blunder of the subsequent kind or a beta blunder, affirms a thought that ought to have been dismissed, for example, for example, claiming that two observances are something similar, notwithstanding them being unique. A type II blunder doesn't dismiss the null hypothesis, even however the alternative hypothesis is the true state of nature. As such, a false finding is accepted as true.

A type II blunder can be reduced by making more severe criteria for dismissing a null hypothesis. For instance, assuming an analyst is thinking about anything that falls inside the +/ - limits of a 95% [confidence interval](/confidenceinterval) as statistically inconsequential (a negative outcome), then, at that point, by decreasing that tolerance to +/ - 90%, and hence restricting the limits, you will obtain less negative outcomes, and in this manner reduce the chances of a false negative.

Making these strides, notwithstanding, will in general increase the chances of experiencing a type I mistake â€” a false-positive outcome. While leading a hypothesis test, the likelihood or risk of making a type I blunder or type II mistake ought to be thought of.

## Type I Errors versus Type II Errors

The difference between a type II blunder and a type I mistake is that a type I mistake dismisses the null hypothesis when it is true (i.e., a false positive). The likelihood of committing a type I mistake is equivalent to the [level of significance](/statistical-significance) that was set for the hypothesis test. In this way, in the event that the level of significance is 0.05, there is a 5% chance a type I mistake might happen.

The likelihood of committing a type II blunder is equivalent to one minus the power of the test, otherwise called beta. The power of the test could be increased by expanding the [sample](/sample) size, which diminishes the risk of committing a type II mistake.

> Some statistical writing will incorporate overall significance level and type II blunder risk as part of the report's analysis. For instance, a 2021 meta-analysis of exosome in the treatment of spinal string injury recorded an overall significance level of 0.05 and a type II blunder risk of 0.1.

## Illustration of a Type II Error

Expect a [biotechnology](/biotechnology) company needs to compare how effective two of its medications are for treating diabetes. The null hypothesis states the two drugs are similarly effective. **A null hypothesis, H0, is the claim that the company desires to dismiss utilizing the one-tailed test**. The alternative hypothesis, H~a~, states the two medications are not similarly effective. **The alternative hypothesis,** H~a~**, is the state of nature that is upheld by dismissing the null hypothesis.**

The biotech company carries out a large [clinical trial](/clinical-trials) of 3,000 patients with diabetes to compare the treatments. The company haphazardly separates the 3,000 patients into two similarly estimated groups, giving one group one of the treatments and the other group the other treatment. It chooses a significance level of 0.05, which demonstrates it will acknowledge a 5% chance it might dismiss the null hypothesis whenever it is true or a 5% chance of committing a type I mistake.

Accept the beta is calculated to be 0.025, or 2.5%. In this way, the likelihood of committing a type II blunder is 97.5%. In the event that the two drugs are not equivalent, the null hypothesis ought to be dismissed. Nonetheless, in the event that the biotech company doesn't dismiss the null hypothesis when the medications are not similarly effective, a type II mistake happens.

## Features
- A type II blunder is basically a false negative.
- A type II blunder can be reduced by making more tough criteria for dismissing a null hypothesis, albeit this increases the chances of a false positive.
- The sample size, the true population size, and the pre-set alpha level influence the extent of risk of a mistake.
- A type II mistake is defined as the likelihood of erroneously neglecting to dismiss the null hypothesis, when as a matter of fact it isn't applicable to the whole population.
- Analysts need to gauge the probability and impact of type II errors with type I errors.
## FAQ
### What Is the Difference Between Type I and Type II Errors?
A type I mistake happens assuming a null hypothesis is dismissed that is true in the population. This type of blunder is representative of a false positive. Alternatively, a type II blunder happens on the off chance that a null hypothesis isn't dismissed that is false in the population. This type of mistake is representative of a false negative.
### What Causes Type II Errors?
A type II blunder is regularly caused on the off chance that the statistical power of a test is too low. The highest the statistical power, the greater the chance of keeping away from a blunder. It's generally expected suggested that the statistical power ought to be set to somewhere around 80% prior to directing any testing.
### What Factors Influence the Magnitude of Risk for Type II Errors?
As the sample size of the research increases, the extent of risk for type II errors ought to diminish. As the true population effect size increases, the type II mistake ought to likewise diminish. Last, the pre-set alpha level set by the research influences the size of risk. As the alpha level set diminishes, the risk of a type II blunder increases.
