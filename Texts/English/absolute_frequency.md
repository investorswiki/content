# Absolute Frequency
## What Is Absolute Frequency?

Absolute frequency is a [statistical](/insights) term portraying the number of times a specific piece of data or a specific value shows up during a trial or set of trials. Basically, absolute frequency is a simple count of the number of times a value is noticed. Absolute frequency is normally communicated as a whole number and is viewed as an exceptionally fundamental level of statistical analysis.

## Seeing Absolute Frequency

Absolute frequency is much of the time a part of fundamental [data collection](/data-examination). For instance, assuming you ask 10 friends on the off chance that blue is their #1 variety and three say OK and seven say no, you have sufficient information to determine absolute frequency: the absolute frequency of "yes" is equivalent to three and that of "no" is equivalent to seven. The number of values followed frequently increases with sample size or trial scope. For instance, assuming you ask 100 individuals on the off chance that their number one tone is blue, the absolute frequency will probably increase. In any case, there is no extra complexity in the tracking of how frequently a given value happens.

Absolute frequency is utilized in certain data visualizations. For instance, the absolute frequency of survey responses will frequently be shown on a graph to give a handily processed perspective on the majority of responses for a specific inquiry.

Absolute frequency can be utilized to show the most normally happening data piece in a trial or study, however it isn't typically utilized as a primary statistical measurement.

## Absolute Frequency versus Relative Frequency

Absolute frequency can be the starting point for a more nuanced statistical analysis. Relative frequency, for instance, is derived from absolute frequency. At the point when the absolute frequency of values is followed over the whole trial, the absolute frequency for a specific value can then be partitioned by the total number of values for that variable all through the trial to get the relative frequency. The relative frequency is what we most frequently reference, whether it is the triumphant percentage of our number one games team or the percentage of fund managers that beat the market. Dissimilar to absolute frequency, relative frequency is normally communicated as a percentage or portion instead of a whole number.

Sometimes, when relative frequencies are tiny, they are given in terms of "per thousand," "per million," and so forth, as in total number of crimes in a city for each thousand individuals. Such adjustments are called "per capita."

## Illustration of Absolute Frequency

Envision a [accounting](/accounting) conference that needs to collect data on savoring propensities the calling. The conference coordinator asks a room of 50 accountants the number of glasses of wine they that have had throughout the last week. After every one of the 50 accountants offers their response, it is put into a table showing the absolute frequencies.
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th colspan='AngleSharp.Dom.Attr'>Number of Alcoholic Drinks Per Week</th></tr>
<tr>
<th>Number of Drinks per Week</th><th>Responses</th></tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>0</td><td>11</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>1</td><td>0</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>2</td><td>2</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>3</td><td>4</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>4</td><td>8</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>5</td><td>13</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>6+</td><td>12</td></tr>

Model table appearance the absolute frequency of responses

There are a couple of perceptions you can make from the table showing absolute frequency: a greater number of accountants drink some amount of liquor than no liquor. Notwithstanding, the most important perceptions that can be produced using this data set include more analysis. For instance, half of the multitude of accountants at the conference have at least five beverages each week.

Be that as it may, as a statistical study, this survey comes up short. As far as one might be concerned, there is no [demographic information](/populace) past the calling of the respondents. The orientation of the respondents isn't revealed. This is important, given there are different wellbeing rules for liquor consumption by sex. We likewise don't have a clue about the strength, or the liquor by volume (ABV), of a specific beverage being reported. Like absolute frequency, our model survey is just the beginning of a real analysis of liquor consumption inside the accounting calling.

## Features
- Absolute frequency is many times shown as a graph to give a visual representation of where the majority of events cluster.
- Absolute frequency is a simple count of how frequently a specific response or value happens throughout the span of the study.
- "Absolute frequency" is sometimes called "crude count," and sometimes called basically "frequency."
- While absolute frequency is an exceptionally fundamental form of statistical analysis, it very well may be utilized as an input for further developed statistical analysis, like relative frequency.
