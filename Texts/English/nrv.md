## What Is Net Realizable Value (NRV)?

Net realizable value (NRV) is a valuation method, common in inventory accounting, that considers the total amount of money an asset could create upon its sale, less a reasonable estimate of the costs, fees, and taxes associated with that sale or disposal.

## Grasping Net Realizable Value (NRV)

NRV is a common method used to assess an asset's value for [inventory accounting](/inventoryaccounting). Two of the largest assets that a company might list on a balance sheet are accounts receivable and inventory. NRV is utilized to value both of these asset types.

## Instances of Uses for Net Realizable Value
### Accounts Receivable

An accounts receivable balance is changed over into cash when customers pay their outstanding solicitations, yet the balance must be adjusted down for clients who don't make payments. NRV for accounts receivable is calculated as the full receivable balance less a [allowance for doubtful accounts](/allowancefordoubtfulaccounts), which is the dollar amount of solicitations that the company estimates to be terrible debt.

### Inventory

GAAP rules previously required accountants to utilize the [lower of cost or market](/lowerofcostandmarketmethod) (LCM) method to value inventory on the balance sheet. Assuming the market price of inventory fell below the historical cost, the principle of conservatism required accountants to utilize the market price to value inventory. Market price was defined as the lower of either replacement cost or NRV.

The [Financial Accounting Standards Board](/fasb) (FASB), the independent organization that lays out GAAP standards, issued an update in 2015 to its code that changed the inventory accounting requirements for companies, gave they don't utilize [last-in-first-out](/lifo) (LIFO) or retail methods. Companies must now utilize the lower cost or NRV method, which is more predictable with IFRS rules. Fundamentally, the term "market" has been supplanted with "net realizable value."

At the point when a company purchases inventory, it might cause extra costs to store or prepare the goods available to be purchased. The costs associated with putting away inventory are alluded to as the [carrying cost of inventory](/carryingcostofinventory). Expect, for instance, a retailer purchases large parts of costly furniture as inventory, and the company needs to build a display case and hire a contractor to carefully move the furniture to the purchaser's home. These extra costs are deducted from the selling price to compute the NRV.

### Cost Accounting

[Cost accounting](/cost-accounting) is a heuristic method utilized by certain organizations to account inside for costs associated with different business activities.

NRV is utilized to account for such costs when two products are created together in a joint costing system until the products arrive at a split-off point. Every product is then delivered separately after the split-off point, and NRV is utilized to allot previous joint costs to every one of the products. This permits managers to compute the total cost and assign a sale price to every product independently.
