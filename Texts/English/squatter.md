## What Is a Squatter?

A squatter is a person who gets comfortable or possesses a piece of property with no legal claim to the property. A squatter lives on a property to which they have no [title](/title), right, or lease. A squatter might gain [adverse possession](/adverse-possession) of the property through involuntary transfer.

A property owner who doesn't utilize or examine their property for quite some time could lose the title to someone else who makes a claim to the land, claims the land, and uses the land.

## Figuring out Squatters

Each U.S. state has its own laws with respect to squatter's rights and adverse possession. For instance, certain states require continuous possession of seven years to get exclusive property, notwithstanding different requirements. State laws in regards to squatters and adverse possession can be supplanted by neighborhood laws now and again.

For instance, the state of New York awards adverse possession rights to squatters on the off chance that they involve a property for 30 days, they gain the legal right to stay on the property as a tenant of the owner even however they never marked a [lease](/lease) agreement. The intruder could break into an abandoned property and start straightforwardly living there. This might occur with investment properties that don't right now have tenants.

Assuming the intruder is gotten soon enough, they can be eliminated by the police and captured. Squatters who go undetected by the owner and stay on the property for 30 days will require a legal [eviction](/eviction) to eliminate them from the premises.

The time allotment it takes for eviction procedures to be completed may incite property owners to offer to pay off squatters to eliminate themselves from the property.

> Eviction procedures can once in a while require as long as one year.

## Illustration of a Squatter

Assume a lady named Felicia bought a two-room investment property in 2010 in Brooklyn, New York. In 2015, she stopped renting the loft and it sat void for a very long time. Facing foreclosure, Felicia chose to put the condo on the market. Tragically, she found that a cabbie had been living in the condo for a really long time.

Felicia called the police and reported the outsider for intruding. After the police eliminated the man, she had the locks changed. Be that as it may, since the man had been living there for more than 30 days, he had laid out squatter's rights. Kicking him out of the condo comprised an illegal eviction. At the point when the squatter went to housing court in New York City, the judge conceded him permission to enter the property just a couple of days after the fact.
