# Price Protection
## What is price protection?
Price protection is a common feature of most credit cards that gives cardholders a refund for the difference in price assuming that a thing they bought with that card is accessible for a lower cost than what they paid for it.
## More profound definition
In the event that you bought a thing with a credit card, odds are you have price protection. Not many consumers are aware of this standard credit card feature, which is a phenomenal way for keen customers to set aside cash.
On the off chance that you're seeking big-ticket things like airline tickets or machines, buying with a credit card that offers price protection can bring about critical savings assuming the price drops. While most credit card providers require the consumer to do the examination shopping, not all do. Citi's Price Rewind is an exclusive feature that tracks your purchase for you. Basically register your purchases online and Citi's hunt feature will follow the product and search many online shippers daily. On the off chance that it finds a lower price on your purchase, you automatically return the money in question.
The specific terms for price protection change across credit card banks and brands. Credit cards frequently shift in the amount of price protection accessible to consumers. For instance, both Discover and Chase will refund the price difference up to $500, and each has a refund maximum of $2,500 each year. Certain credit card providers might have avoidances to their price protection policies. For example, Discover doesn't offer price protection on computer parts. Different providers won't issue refunds on internet purchases.
One reason that price protection is such a lucrative benefit is that the drop in price doesn't need to accompany a similar retailer. This means that in the event that you buy a thing at Store An and, notice that Store B has it on sale for less, you can generally have the money in question returned.
Price protection may not be worth the issue of contrasting prices and filing a claim for small purchases, yet it has an effect on larger purchases that can rapidly vacillate in price. Just make certain to peruse your credit card provider's fine print before buying so that you're aware of all avoidances and expectations.
## Illustration of price protection
Suppose you bought a washing machine that went on sale soon after you made the purchase. In the event that it's inside a certain amount of time (typically 30 to 60 days), just file a claim with your credit card provider to receive a refund at the cost difference. Some credit card companies have a simple form you can finish up online; others ask you to settle on a telephone decision to their customer service line. In practically all cases, you will be asked to give a copy of your original purchase receipt, as well as proof recorded as a hard copy that shows a similar thing is currently accessible at a lower price. By and large, a printed commercial can be utilized as proof.
