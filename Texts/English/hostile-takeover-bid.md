## What Is a Hostile Takeover Bid?

A hostile takeover bid is an endeavor to buy a controlling interest in a public corporation without the consent or cooperation of the target company's board of directors. In the event that the board dismisses an offer from an expected buyer, there are three potential blueprints for the future acquirer: make a tender offer, start a proxy fight, or buy up company stock in the open market.

## Understanding the Hostile Takeover Bid

A takeover bid is most frequently sent off by a company that needs to grow its business, wipe out a rival, or both. The company might need to extend its customer base, gain access to new distribution channels, develop its market share, or gain a mechanical advantage.

A bid may likewise be made by an activist shareholder who sees an opportunity to further develop the target company's performance and profit from its stock price appreciation.

The standard initial step is to make an offer to the board of directors of the company to purchase a controlling stake in the company. The board of directors might dismiss that offer because it isn't to the greatest advantage of the company's shareholders.

By then, a hostile takeover bid may be sent off.

## Hostile Takeover Bid Tactics

The eventual acquirer can endeavor to buy an adequate number of shares of the company's stock on the open market to accomplish a controlling share. That is a long way from simple given the way that the acquisition of large measures of a company's stock definitely pushes its price continuously higher. Since the justification behind the price rise has no relationship to the company's performance, the aggressor is probably going to overpay.

That leaves two major strategies:

### Tender Offer

The future acquirer might make a [tender offer](/tenderoffer) to the company's shareholders. A tender offer is a bid to buy a controlling share of the target's stock at a fixed price. The price is normally set over the current market price to permit the sellers an incentive to sell their shares. This is a proper offer and may incorporate determinations like an offer expiry window. Desk work must be recorded with the [Securities and Exchange Commission](/sec) (SEC), and the acquirer must give a summary of its plans for the target company.

Companies can embrace takeover defense strategies to safeguard themselves against tender offers. In such cases, a proxy fight may be utilized.

### Proxy Fight

The goal of a [proxy fight](/proxyfight) is to supplant board members who go against the takeover with new board members who favor the takeover. This requires persuading shareholders that a change in management is required. In the event that shareholders like the possibility of a change in management, they are convinced to permit the expected acquirer to vote their shares by proxy for another board member or members. Assuming that the proxy fight is fruitful, the new board members are introduced and vote for the target's acquisition.

## A Comeback for the Hostile Takeover?

The hostile takeover was, somewhat, an animal of the 1980s, with a rash of widely discussed endeavors by takeover experts who became known as "[corporate raiders](/corporate-marauder)." Since then, at that point, they have happened fundamentally in the fallout of market slumps that have left a few corporations seeming to be appealingly priced targets.

In late 2020, the Harvard Law School Forum on Corporate Governance anticipated one more wave of hostile takeovers in the wake of the 2020 COVID-19 crisis. Sufficiently sure, mergers and acquisitions activity broke records in 2021. As per a PwC report, 62,000 arrangements adding up to $5.1 trillion were revealed universally in 2021, and 130 of those arrangements were "megadeals" valued at more than $5 billion.
