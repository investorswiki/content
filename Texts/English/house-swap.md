The concept gives off an impression of being a victor for remote workers, retired people, and individuals who are just fretful for a change of scene.

Home-swapping destinations like Love Home Swap and International Vacation Home Exchange (IVHE) have made it more straightforward for aliens to hook up with potential house-swap partners. A few locales, like HomeLink, were in business long before the internet.
