# Honest intentions Estimate (GFE)
## What Is a Good Faith Estimate (GFE)?

A pure intentions estimate (GFE) is a document that outlines the estimated costs and terms of a reverse mortgage loan offer, empowering borrowers to comparison shop among various lenders and pick the deal that best meets their requirements.

Under the [Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act](/real-estate-settlement-procedures-act-respa) (RESPA), lenders were required to give consumers GFEs in something like three days of an ordinary [mortgage](/mortgage) application. Then, in October 2015, GFEs were simply made applicable to individuals seeking reverse mortgages, with loan estimate forms being presented for different types of home loans.

## How a Good Faith Estimate (GFE) Works

A GFE makes it conceivable to compare offers from different [lenders](/lender) and [brokers](/merchant). When the document is received, borrowers can look at the breakdowns and contract terms and afterward show assuming they wish to continue with the mortgage loan from that specific financial institution.

The form is written in clear language to assist consumers with better comprehension the terms of the mortgage for which they are applying and borrowers might shop around and secure various estimates before picking a [loan](/loan) or a lender.

Since October 2015, GFEs presently just apply to reverse mortgages: loans that empower seniors aged 62 and more seasoned to change over their home [equity](/equity) into lump-sum sums, fixed payments, or [lines of credit](/lineofcredit) (LOCs).

The bank or financial institution must give the homeowner seeking a reverse mortgage with a GFE inside three business long stretches of accepting their application. This form incorporates a breakdown of the relative multitude of costs associated with the loan, like taxes, [title](/title) charges, [closing costs](/closingcosts), and administrative fees, as well as some other terms and conditions of the loan, including policies in regards to payback.

> Consumers ought to beware of [unscrupulous lenders](/predatory_lending), who might add their fees or charge unreasonable fees for administrative things, for example, [wire transfers](/wiretransfer).
>

The official standardized estimate forms give information about the approximated costs of taxes and insurance and how the [interest rate](/interestrate) and payments might change from now on. Borrowers might be charged a [credit report](/creditreport) fee before getting a GFE yet can't be charged any extra fees to gain the document.

## Limitations of a Good Faith Estimate (GFE)

The costs noted on the form are just estimates and simply give an unpleasant thought of how much borrowers might be expected to spend to get the loan and what's generally anticipated of them before and after the loan comes due. The actual costs could at last be higher or lower when everything is settled.

There are authentic purposes behind inconsistencies between the GFE and the actual closing costs. The lender may not have the foggiest idea about every one of the costs of closing services given by outsiders, which might be viewed as the hidden costs of claiming a home.

## Honest intentions Estimates (GFE) versus Loan Estimate Forms

As verified above, GFEs currently just apply to reverse mortgages. They were supplanted with loan estimate forms after October 2015 for anybody seeking different types of mortgages.

Loan estimates, as GFEs, are an industry standard. They must be given to mortgage candidates inside three business days of their applications and give a breakdown of costs, terms, and conditions. Furthermore, just like the GFE, the document permits borrowers to compare costs between lenders.

## Special Considerations

All things being equal, they receive truth-in-lending revelations.
