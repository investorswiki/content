# Actionable
## What Is Actionable?

The term "actionable" refers to a business directive or [investment strategy](/investmentstrategy) that can feasibly be accomplished shortly. Company managers and investors try to identify things that are immediately actionable because they might be prerequisites for accomplishing future objectives and higher-level directives.

Factors that might affect when decisions are actionable include fundamentals and technical factors, as well as [market sentiment](/marketsentiment).

## Understanding Actionable

Timing is very important in the business and investment universes. Businesses need to be able to plan how they'll develop and move forward from now on. Investors need to be able to make their buy and sell decisions at the appropriate time if they have any desire to make any money.

Some directives need to be taken in the immediate future to meet [long-term](/longterm) objectives. Essentially, when the market direction changes, for example, in a recession, businesses need to adapt rapidly.

An actionable strategy is one that can be executed in the short term to reach these objectives and prepare a business for what lies ahead. In that respect, managers need to have an understanding of their business, however the economy, its outlook, the industry it operates in, and its competitors.

A corporation might use this strategy to help set it apart from other, comparable companies in the industry. Corporate directives might be related to pricing, production, [business relationships](/business-relations), marketing, and demographics. For instance, companies might evaluate and undertake new partnerships to meet their long-term objectives of entering a new [market](/market).

Investors often take a gander at certain times of the year when their investments — either current or proposed — may become actionable. Such times are often around earnings season because it's a natural time to assess where a company is heading and the way that well it has accomplished prior objectives set for the current period.

Another time when investment decisions might move from proposed to actionable is when changes are made to short-term [interest rates](/interestrate), or when major life advances, like evolving position, buying a home, or [retirement](/retirement), are just around the corner. Furthermore, a [mutual fund](/mutualfund) may spend a month researching a company, yet just when a genuine trade to purchase the stock is prepared does the decision become actionable.

## Special Considerations

There are a number of factors that might affect when a business or investment decision is actionable, including [fundamentals](/fundamentals), technical factors, and market sentiment.

In an efficient market, stock prices would be determined primarily by fundamentals, which at the essential level, refers to a combination of two things: an earnings base, for example, [earnings per share](/eps) (EPS), and a valuation multiple, for example, a [price-to-earnings](/price-earningsratio) (P/E) ratio.

Technical factors are the mix of external conditions that alter the supply of and demand for a company's [stock](/stock). Some of these indirectly affect fundamentals. For example, economic growth indirectly contributes to earnings growth. Technical factors include the accompanying:

- [Inflation](/inflation)
- The economic strength of the market and peers
- Substitutes
- Incidental exchanges
- [Demographics](/demographics): Some important research has been done about the demographics of investors. Quite a bit of it concerns two dynamics. The first comprises middle-aged investors; those who are peak earners who tend to invest in the stock market, and older investors, who tend to pull out of the market to meet the demands of retirement.
- [Trends](/trend): This is often when a stock simply moves as indicated by a short-term trend.
- [Liquidity](/liquidity): This is an important and sometimes under-appreciated factor. It refers to how much investor interest and attention a specific stock has.

The third factor — market sentiment — refers to the psychology of market participants, both exclusively and collectively. This is perhaps the most incredibly vexing category because investors, management, and analysts realize it matters basically, yet are simply beginning to understand it. Market sentiment is often subjective.
