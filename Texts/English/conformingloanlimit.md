# Conforming Loan Limit
## What Is the Conforming Loan Limit?

The conforming loan limit is the dollar cap on the size of a mortgage that the Federal National Mortgage Association (referred to casually as Fannie Mae) and the [Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp.](/freddiemac) (otherwise known as Freddie Mac) will purchase or guarantee. Mortgages that meet the criteria for backing by the two semi government agencies are known as [conforming loans](/conformingloan).

Under the command of the [Housing and Economic Recovery Act](/housing-and-economic-recovery-act-hera) (HERA) of 2008, the conforming loan limit is adjusted consistently to reflect changes in the average price of a home in the United States. The annual limit is set by Fannie Mae's and Freddie Mac's federal regulator, the [Federal Housing Finance Agency](/fhfa) (FHFA), and announced in November for the next year. The FHFA utilizes the October-to-October percentage increase/decline in the average house price, as indicated in the House Price Index report issued by the Federal Housing Finance Board (FHFB), to change the conforming loan limit for the subsequent year.

## How the Conforming Loan Limit Works

The conforming loan limit is designated by county. Most counties are assigned the baseline conforming loan limit. Be that as it may, there can be minor departure from the conforming loan limit in view of regional economic differences.

For instance, in areas where 115% of the neighborhood median home value surpasses the baseline conforming loan limit, the maximum loan limit for that area will be set higher. The previously mentioned HERA sets the maximum loan limit for such areas as a numerous of the area median home value. The legislation likewise set a ceiling on the limit of 150% of the baseline loan limit.

Southern California, South Florida, and the greater New York metropolitan area are three instances of districts in the adjoining part of the country that fulfill the requirements for higher maximum conforming loan limits.

Moreover, there are special statutory provisions inside the HERA that lay out various loan limit computations for Alaska and Hawaii, as well with respect to two U.S. island domains: Guam and the U.S. Virgin Islands. The conforming loan limits for those areas will generally be outstandingly higher than the limits for the domestic United States since they are designated as significant expense areas.

### Conforming Loan Limits 2022

For 2022, in the greater part of the United States, the maximum conforming loan limit for one-unit properties (the baseline) is $647,200, an increase from $548,250 in 2021. This increase of $98,950 mirrors the shocking 18% average increase in housing prices from the second from last quarter (Q3) of 2020 to Q3 2021.

### Conforming Loan Limits in High-Cost Areas in 2022

Median home values generally increased in significant expense areas in 2021, driving up the maximum loan limits in numerous areas. The 2022 ceiling loan limit for one-unit properties in the greatest expense areas like Alaska, Hawaii, Guam, and the U.S. Virgin Islands is $970,800, or 150% of $647,200.

While declaring the new loan limits in November, the FHFA noticed that the maximum conforming loan limit would be higher in 2022 in everything except four counties. For 2021, it was higher in everything except 18 counties.

## Special Considerations for the Conforming Loan Limit

Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are the principal market producers in mortgages; banks and different lenders count on them to safeguard loans that they issue and to buy loans that they wish to sell. The conforming loan limits act as rules for the mortgages that most mainstream lenders offer. In fact, a few financial institutions will just deal with conforming loans that meet the agencies' criteria.

> Traditional lenders widely really like to work with mortgages that meet the conforming loan limits since they are insured and simpler to sell.

Mortgages that surpass the conforming loan limit are known as [nonconforming](/non_conforming) or [jumbo mortgages](/jumboloan). The interest rate on jumbo mortgages can be higher than the interest rate on conforming mortgages.

Since lenders favor conforming mortgages, a borrower whose mortgage amount somewhat surpasses the conforming loan limit ought to examine the economics of decreasing their loan size through a bigger down payment or utilizing secondary financing (that is, taking out two loans rather than one) to meet all requirements for a conforming mortgage.
