# Fixed-Interest Security
## Definition of Fixed-Interest Security

A fixed-interest security is a debt instrument like a bond, debenture, or [gilt-edged bond](/gilt-edged-securities) that investors use to loan money to a company in exchange for interest payments. A fixed-interest security pays a predefined rate of interest that doesn't change over the life of the instrument. The face value is returned when the security develops.

In the U.K., fixed-interest securities are alluded to as "gilts" or [gilt-edged securities](/gilt-edged-securities).

## Breaking Down Fixed-Interest Security

The fixed interest to be paid on a fixed-interest security is indicated in the [trust indenture](/trust_indenture) at the hour of issuance and is payable on specific dates until the bond develops. The benefit of possessing a fixed-interest security is that investors know with certainty how much interest they will earn as long as necessary. However long the responsible entity doesn't default, the investor can foresee precisely exact thing his return on investment will be. Be that as it may, fixed-interest securities are likewise subject to [interest rate risk](/interestraterisk). Since their interest rate is fixed, these securities will turn out to be less significant as rates go up in an increasing interest-rate environment. Assuming interest rates fall, nonetheless, the fixed-interest security turns out to be more significant.

For instance, we should expect an investor purchases a bond security that pays a fixed rate of 5%, however interest rates in the economy increase to 7%. This means that new bonds are being issued at 7%, and Tom is done earning the best return on his investment as could really be expected. Since there is an inverse relationship between bond prices and interest rates, the value of the investor's bond will fall to mirror the higher interest rate in the market. On the off chance that he chooses to sell his 5% bond to reinvest the proceeds in the new 7% bonds, he might do as such at a loss, since the bond's market value would have dropped. The longer the fixed-rate bond's term, the greater the risk that interest rates could rise and make the bond less significant.

On the off chance that interest rates reduction to 3%, notwithstanding, the investor's 5% bond would turn out to be more significant if he somehow happened to sell it, since a bond's market price increases when interest rates decline. The fixed rate on his existing bond in a declining-interest-rate environment will be a more appealing investment than new bonds issued at 3%.

Fixed-interest securities are safer than equities, since if a company is [liquidated](/sell), bondholders are repaid before shareholders. In any case, bondholders are viewed as unsecured creditors and may not get any or their principal back given that they are all next in line to secured creditors.

[Risk-opposed investors](/riskaverse) seeking a stable source of income payments at unsurprising spans regularly opt for fixed-interest securities. Instances of fixed-interest securities incorporate [government bonds](/government-bond), corporate bonds, [step-up securities](/stepupbond), term deposits, and so on.
