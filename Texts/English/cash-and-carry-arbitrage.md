# Cash-and-Carry-Arbitrage
## What is Cash-and-Carry-Arbitrage

Cash-and-carry-arbitrage is a [market-neutral](/marketneutral) strategy consolidating the purchase of a long position in an asset like a stock or commodity, and the sale (short) of a position in a futures contract on that equivalent underlying asset. It looks to take advantage of pricing failures for the asset in the cash (or spot) market and [futures market](/futuresmarket), to create riskless gains. The futures contract must be hypothetically costly relative to the underlying asset or the arbitrage won't be profitable.

## Fundamentals of Cash-and-Carry-Arbitrage

In a cash-and-carry-arbitrage, the [arbitrageur](/arbitrageur) would ordinarily look to "carry" the asset until the expiration date of the futures contract, at which point it would be delivered against the futures contract. Consequently, this strategy is just suitable in the event that the cash inflow from the short futures position surpasses the [acquisition cost](/acquisition-cost) and [carrying costs](/carrying-costs) on the long asset position.

Cash-and-carry arbitrage positions are not 100% without risk as there is still risk the carrying costs can increase, for example, a brokerage raising its [margin](/margin) rates. Nonetheless, the risk of any market movement, which is the major part in any normal long or [short](/short) trade, is alleviated by the way that once the trade is set moving the main event is the delivery of the asset against the futures contract. There is compelling reason need to access possibly one in the [open market](/open-market) at expiration.

Physical assets, for example, barrels of oil or lots of grain require storage and insurance, yet stock [indexes](/index), like the S&P 500 Index, reasonable require just financing costs, like margin. In this way, arbitrage might be more profitable, all else held steady, in these non-physical markets. Be that as it may, in light of the fact that the barriers to take part in arbitrage are a lot of lower, they permit more players to endeavor such a trade. The outcome is more efficient pricing among spot and futures markets and lower [spreads](/spread) between the two. Lower spreads mean lower opportunities to profit.

Less active markets might in any case have arbitrage prospects, for however long there is adequate liquidity on the two sides of the game â€” spot and futures.

## Illustration of Cash-and-Carry Arbitrage

Think about the accompanying illustration of cash-and-carry-arbitrage. Expect an asset at present trades at $100, while the one-month [futures contract](/futurescontract) is priced at $104. What's more, month to month carrying costs like storage, insurance, and financing costs for this asset amount to $3.

In this case, the arbitrageur would buy the asset (or open a long position in it) at $100 and simultaneously sell the one-month futures contract (for example start a short position in it) at $104. The trader would then hold or carry the asset until the [expiration date](/expirationdate) of the futures contract and deliver the asset against the contract, in this manner guaranteeing an arbitrage or riskless profit of $1.
