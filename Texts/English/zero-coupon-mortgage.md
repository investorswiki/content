## What Is a Zero-Coupon Mortgage?

A zero-coupon mortgage is a long-term commercial mortgage that concedes all payments of [principal](/principal) and interest until the maturity of the mortgage. The loan's organizing is as an accrual note, meaning [interest](/interest) due rolls into the outstanding amount borrowed. At maturity, the borrower either pays off the note or floats one more loan at the current interest rates.

## How a Zero-Coupon Mortgage Works

Zero-coupon mortgages look like [zero-coupon bonds](/zero-couponbond). The [coupon](/coupon), the annual interest rate paid on the loan, is zero until the expiration date when it must be in every way paid back in one hit, along with the full amount borrowed.

Commercial projects utilize zero-coupon mortgages when [cash flows](/cashflow) to service the debt are probably not going to be available until the project approaches completion. An illustration of this would be a games arena. In this case, no [revenues](/revenue) are generated until the structure is complete and able to have events.

Since total interest in addition to principal repayment is possibly received by the lender when the loan develops, the [credit risk](/creditrisk) is essentially higher than with a conventional [loan](/loan). Accordingly, lenders generally just offer this form of financing to laid out commercial borrowers with clean credit records. They likewise will generally charge a higher interest rate on zero-coupon mortgages to make up for the lack of immediate return.

## Illustration of a Zero-Coupon Mortgage

Suppose ABC Corp. takes out a $400,000 zero-coupon mortgage due for repayment a long time from now. Throughout the span of the next twenty years, ABC doesn't return anything to the lender. Dissimilar to conventional [mortgages](/mortgage), the company isn't required to immediately begin step by step paying back the principal, as well as interest for the privilege of applying for a new line of credit.

That all changes when its 20 years are up. Out of nowhere ABC must return the $400,000 it borrowed at the same time, along with the [compounded interest](/compoundinterest) on the loan, or [refinance](/refinance) at winning interest rates. Inability to do so will lead it to lose the property and force it to give up the keys to the lender.

## Special Considerations
### Investing in Zero-Coupon Mortgage Notes

Investors have the opportunity to get in on the action and bring in money from zero-coupon mortgages and bonds. These investments are famous among certain investors, mostly due to their accessibility in specific real estate markets and furthermore on the grounds that zero-coupon bonds sell [at a discount](/at-a-discount) from the [face value](/facevalue) of the note.

Investors won't receive normal interest payments. Be that as it may, the borrower will add the interest amount to the principal amount, which gets returned to the [creditors](/creditor) at maturity. Interest will compound semiannually, and as the primary value rises, it will make higher interest payments, which roll once again into the total principal sum.

Since they pay no coupons and just deliver money at maturity, zero-coupon mortgage prices can be extremely unstable. They are likewise subject to annual [income tax](/incometax) payments, even however the [income](/income) is credited and not routinely received by investors. An exception would be in the event that the investment agreement makes no guarantee to pay investors a specific return, in which case there would be no current taxable yearly income.

One more comparable type of investment is operated essentially for [Individual Retirement Accounts](/ira) (IRAs) and different elements where current-year taxation isn't a consideration.
