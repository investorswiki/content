# Volume-Weighted Average Price (VWAP)
## What Is the Volume-Weighted Average Price (VWAP)?

The volume-weighted average price (VWAP) is a technical analysis indicator utilized on intraday charts that resets toward the beginning of each and every new trading session.

It's a trading [benchmark](/benchmark) that addresses the average price a security has traded at over the course of the day, in view of both [volume](/volume) and price.

VWAP is important in light of the fact that it furnishes traders with pricing understanding into both the trend and value of a security.

## Understanding the Volume-Weighted Average Price

VWAP is calculated by totaling the dollars traded for each transaction (price increased by the volume) and afterward separating by the total shares traded.

VWAP = Cumulative Typical Price x Volume/Cumulative Volume

Where Typical Price = High price + Low price + Closing Price/3

Cumulative = total since the trading session opened.

### Instructions to ascertain VWAP

By adding the VWAP indicator to a streaming chart, the calculation will be made consequently. Be that as it may, to compute the VWAP yourself, follow the steps below.

Expect a 5-minute chart. The calculation is the equivalent paying little mind to what intraday time span is utilized.

1. Find the average price the stock traded at over the initial 5-minute period of the day. To do this, add the high, low, and close, then, at that point, partition by three. Increase this by the volume for that period. Record the outcome in a calculation sheet, under column PV.
1. Partition PV by the volume for that period. This will deliver the VWAP.
1. To keep up with the VWAP over the course of the day, keep on adding the PV value from every period to the prior values. Split this total by total volume to that point.

To make Step 3 more straightforward in a bookkeeping sheet, make columns for cumulative PV and cumulative volume and apply the formula to them.

## How Is VWAP Used?

VWAP is utilized in various ways by traders. Traders might involve VWAP as a trend confirmation tool and build trading rules around it. For example, they might think about stocks with prices below VWAP as undervalued and those with prices above it, overvalued. In the event that prices below VWAP move above it, traders may [go long](/long) the stock. On the off chance that prices above VWAP move below it, they might sell their positions or start [short positions](/short).

Institutional buyers including [mutual funds](/mutualfund) use VWAP to help move into or out of stocks with as small of a market impact as could be expected. In this manner, when they can, institutions will try to buy below the VWAP, or sell above it. This way their actions push the price back toward the average, rather than away from it.

## Special Considerations
### The Difference Between VWAP and a Simple Moving Average

On a chart, VWAP and a [simple moving average](/sma) (SMA) may seem to be comparable. Be that as it may, these two indicators are calculated diversely and address various outcomes.

VWAP is calculated by increasing regular price by volume, and the separating by total volume.

A simple moving average integrates price however not volume. The SMA is calculated by totaling [closing prices](/closingprice) over a certain period (say 10 days) and afterward separating the total by the number of periods (10).

### Limitations of VWAP

VWAP is a single-day indicator and restarts at the open of each new trading day. Endeavoring to make an average VWAP over numerous days could distort it and result in an erroneous indicator.

While certain institutions might like to buy when the price of a security is below the VWAP, or sell when it is above, VWAP isn't the main factor to consider. In strong uptrends, the price might keep on moving higher for a long time without dipping under the VWAP by any stretch of the imagination or just sporadically. Thusly, waiting at the cost to fall below VWAP could mean a botched opportunity on the off chance that prices are rising rapidly.

VWAP depends on historical values and doesn't intrinsically have predictive characteristics or calculations. VWAP is moored to the opening price scope of the day. Hence, the indicator builds its lag as the day goes on.

This should be visible in the manner a 1-minute period VWAP calculation following 330 minutes (the length of an ordinary trading session) will frequently look like a 390-minute moving average toward the finish of the trading day.

## FAQ
### What Is the Volume-Weighted Average Price (VWAP)?
The volume-weighted average price (VWAP) is a measurement that shows the average price of a security, adjusted for its volume. It is calculated during a specific trading session by taking the total dollar value of trading in the security and separating it by the volume of trades. The formula for computing VWAP is cumulative normal price x volume separated by cumulative volume.
### Why Is the Volume-Weighted Average Price Important?
VWAP provides traders with a streamlined indication of a security's price (adjusted for volume) over the long haul. It is utilized by institutional traders to guarantee that their trades don't move the price of the security they are trying to buy or sell too extremely.For model, a hedge fund could cease from presenting a buy order at a cost over the security's VWAP, to try not to falsely swell the price of that security. Similarly, it could try not to submit orders too far below the VWAP, so the price isn't hauled down by its sale.
### What Is the Difference Between the Volume-Weighted Average Price and a Simple Moving Average (SMA)?
Like the VWAP, the [simple moving average](/sma) furnishes traders with a less unpredictable perspective on the recent price trend of a security. In contrast to the VWAP, in any case, the simple moving average doesn't consider the level of volume in that security's trading.VWAP loads every day's price change by the amount of volume happening in that day, though the simple moving average consolidates price and no volume.
