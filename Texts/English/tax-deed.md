A tax deed gives the government agency the authority to sell the property to collect the [delinquent taxes](/back-taxes). When sold, the property is then transferred to the purchaser. These transactions are called "tax deed sales" and are typically held at auctions.

## Grasping a Tax Deed

A property tax is any tax paid on a piece of real property. Taxes are assessed by the municipal government in which the property is found and paid by the owners of real estate. There is implied understanding that owners of real estate property are responsible for paying property tax assessments.

At the point when property taxes are left unpaid, the taxing authority might sell the property's deed or title — and in this way, the property — to recover the outstanding taxes. The taxing authority — normally a district government — must go through a series of legal strides to procure a tax deed. These means differ with nearby and municipal laws however incorporate informing the property owner, applying for the tax deed, posting a notice at the property, and posting a public notice of sale.

## What Is a Tax Deed Sale?

In a tax deed sale, the property with the associated delinquent property taxes is sold. The sale happens through an auction with a base bid of the amount of back taxes owed plus interest, as well as costs associated with selling the property. The highest bidder wins the property.

The tax deed legally transfers ownership to the purchaser on one condition: The new owner must frequently pay the whole amount owed inside 48 to 72 hours, or the sale is canceled. Any amount bid by the triumphant bidder in excess of the base bid might possibly be dispatched to the delinquent owner. This relies upon the jurisdiction.

The original owner might relinquish this excess amount in the event that they don't claim it inside a predefined period of time. In California, for instance, claims must be filed in no less than one year, while the cutoff time in Texas is two years. In Georgia, funds can be claimed as long as five years after a tax deed sale, at which point a court order is required to recover excess funds.

## Special Considerations

While certain states sell the title to the triumphant bidder the day of the tax deed sale auction, others will permit a redemption period during which the original owner has an opportunity to repay their tax debt and reclaim the property. Assuming the owner decides to pay their debt obligations inside this period, they must pay the triumphant bidder the amount bid at the auction plus interest, which can be very high.

Be that as it may, assuming that the redemption period passes, the owner actually doesn't reclaim their property deed, the highest bidder gets an opportunity to foreclose on the property. The redemption period in Idaho, for instance, is 14 months, while owners in Iowa have one year and nine months to reclaim their property.

## Tax Deeds versus Tax Liens

Liens can cost anyplace from a couple hundred to two or three thousand dollars and pay simple interest that builds consistently.

The lien interaction starts government body places a lien against a property on the off chance that its owner defaults on their property taxes. These liens, which keep owners from doing anything with the property, including [refinancing](/renegotiate) or selling it, are sold off at auction instead of the property itself. Interested gatherings can invest in these tax liens by bidding for them. The return depends on a maximum rate of interest permitted by the municipality.

At the point when a property owner defaults on their property, the municipality sends a notice informing them concerning the forthcoming tax lien. In the event that the owner doesn't bring the taxes cutting-edge, the tax lien is then put available to be purchased. The lien is transferred to the highest bidder, who pays the outstanding tax amount to the municipality. To eliminate the lien, the property owner must pay the new lien owner the outstanding amount plus interest.
