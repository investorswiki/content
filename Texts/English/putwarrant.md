# Put Warrant
## What Is a Put Warrant?

A put warrant is a type of security that gives the holder the right, however not the obligation, to sell a given quantity of a [underlying asset](/underlying-asset) at a predefined cost at the latest a preset date. A put warrant is a company-issued option to sell back to the issuer a predetermined number of shares of the company's [common stock](/commonstock) at a specific price soon.

## Figuring out Put Warrants

There are two types of warrants — put warrants and [call warrants](/callwarrant). All warrants have an expiration date, which is the last day that the rights of the warrant can be exercised. In the event that investors don't exercise a warrant before the expiration date, it becomes worthless. A put warrant's [exercise price](/exerciseprice), likewise called the strike price, is the price at which the holder can sell the warrant. Both put and call warrants are classified by their exercise style. American warrants can be exercised whenever prior to the expiration date. Then again, European warrants must be exercised upon the arrival of expiration.

As with [put options](/putoption), investors can utilize put warrants to hedge against falling stock prices. Both put warrants and put options give the holder the right, yet not the obligation, to sell an underlying stock prior to the expiration date at a strike price. They will be "in-the-money" on the off chance that the price of the underlying stock is below the exercise price. Alternately, they will be "out-of-the-money" assuming the stock's price is over the strike price.

Dissimilar to options, which investors trade on an exchange, companies issue warrants. Assuming investors exercise the put warrants, they sell them back to the companies. One more fundamental difference between a put warrant and a put option is that the term for a warrant can last as long as 15 years. Options have substantially less chance to expiration — by far most terminate in 12 months or less.

## Benefits of Put Warrants

Put warrants have large numbers of similar advantages for investors as put options, however there are a couple of differences. The fundamental benefit of a put warrant is that the investor can limit likely losses. Limiting losses is most important when the company's shares are [illiquid](/illiquid), which is generally the case for small companies. Investors will most likely be unable to sell such a security rapidly in the event that unfavorable improvements happen. Moreover, an investment may be too large to utilize the options market really or, almost certain, the company may be too small to have options by any means.

The primary benefit for companies giving put warrants is the ability to draw in large investments. For what reason would it be a good idea for someone with $10 million to invest put it into a small unlisted company? All things considered, it will be more enthusiastically to get the money back out than it would accompany a large listed firm. By selling the large investor a put warrant, the company decreases this risk for the investor. Moreover, selling warrants, such as selling puts, is a bullish action that raises share prices. At the point when a company sells put warrants, doing a stock buyback at a preset price is basically encouraging.

Of course, the ability to hold put warrants for a long time likewise gives them an advantage over put options according to the investor's point of view.

## Analysis of Put Warrants

The principal disadvantage of put warrants for investors is that they are issued by the very company that issues the stock. Thus, the issuer probably won't have the option to respect the put warrants assuming the stock price really falls. That is totally different from exchange-listed put options, which are at last backed by an options exchange with a strong credit rating, like the [CBOE](/cboe). Exchanges likewise require put scholars to give excellent securities, for example, Treasury bills, as [collateral](/collateral).

While investors buying put warrants from companies don't have to venture to such an extreme as to demand Treasuries, having some sort of collateral makes put warrants more secure. At the point when a larger company invests in a smaller company in a similar industry, [hard assets](/hard_asset), like plants and equipment, are many times a decent source of collateral.

According to the responsible company's point of view, difficulty regarding put warrants when the stock price falls makes an alternate set of issues. In any event, it could lead to [cash flow](/cashflow) issues at the absolute worst time. On the off chance that the company pledged essential assets as collateral, its ability to remain in business may be risked by the need to transfer them to the put warrant holder.
