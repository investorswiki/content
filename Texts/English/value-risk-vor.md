# Value of Risk (VOR)
## What Is Value of Risk (VOR)?

Value of risk (VOR) is the financial benefit that a [risk](/risk)- taking activity will bring to the [stakeholders](/partner) of an organization. It requires the organization to decide if an activity will assist with drawing it nearer to finishing its objectives.

## Grasping Value of Risk (VOR)

In financial theory, corporations have no risk inclinations, however their partners do. The goal is generally to bring in money without being wild.

Company management knows that assuming that they put the resources available to great use, they have a fair chance of keeping their positions and supporting the wealth of investors. Sitting inactively means missing out on opportunities or, as some are quick to point out, taking [profits](/benefit) and setting fire to them. The problem is that gain rarely comes without an element of pain. Each decision is joined by risk and, in this way, should be examined carefully before seeking after.

Movements of every sort that a company might embrace, from entering another market to fostering another product, carry risk. How much relies upon the type of activity and the probability that the company can not recover costs. Simultaneously, there's likewise the recognition that spending money on one endeavor conveys with it a [opportunity cost](/opportunitycost): the potential benefits a business passes up while picking one alternative over another.

## Value of Risk (VOR) Method

Value of risk (VOR) requires a company to look at the different parts of the cost of risk. They incorporate the genuine costs for losses incurred; the cost of bonds, insurance, or [reinsurance](/reinsurance) to fund losses; the costs of moderating the risks that could make the company experience a loss; and the cost of directing a [risk management](/riskmanagement) and loss relief program.

Value of risk (VOR) treats every part of the cost of risk as an investment option. Just likewise with a stock or a [bond](/bond), the parts must show a [return on investment](/returnoninvestment) (ROI).

## Instances of Value of Risk (VOR)

A company that begins a risk management department is causing a substantial faculty expense. The department is expected to shrink the company's loss exposure by overseeing insurance and reinsurance [portfolios](/portfolio), distinguishing possible dangers, and creating methods for decreasing risk exposure.

Should the risk management department be unable to do this, then, at that point, it's not adding to [shareholder value](/shareholder-value). If, then again, a company's expected [earnings](/earnings) are higher than the cost incurred to reduce risk, then the risk reduction investment can be viewed as a positive one.

Somewhere else, one more company that got into the smart gear business — making stuff with embedded computer chips and batteries that track location and the sky is the limit from there — bet that the aircrafts and regulatory agencies would approve of customers checking in these bags. It bet wrong: the smart bags were prohibited in the U.S. in the midst of fears about battery fires, making the company [liquidate](/liquidate).

Everything was at risk on that one factor. This makes one wonder of whether the stuff manufacturer, and its friends, assessed the possibility of dismissal at a high percentage of likelihood. Assuming they had done as such, they probably couldn't ever have entered this line of business in any case.
