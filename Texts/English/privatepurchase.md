## What Is a Private Purchase?

Private purchase alludes to an investment wherein an individual or institutional investor purchases shares in a [privately-held firm](/privatecompany). The investor might buy the company's all's shares, or just a portion of them. The way that a private purchase doesn't include the utilization of capital markets means that a broker is normally required to complete the deal.

## Grasping Private Purchase

[Venture capital](/venturecapital) (VC) firms seeking to adjust their holdings in a specific company will frequently make private purchases. These positions are typically long holdings. Add that to the way that private markets are not as liquid, and offer less investment data than public exchanges, private investors and VC firms are frequently able to utilize this to their advantage.

The limited idea of private shares means they're not as simple to purchase as public stocks. In any case, there are perhaps a couple ways a private stock can be acquired. Since a private company has not yet disclosed an initial offering, its shares are normally closely held by the firm's founders and maybe a few VC and private equity investors.

Yet, individual investors with high-net-worth, called [accredited investors](/accreditedinvestor) by the [Securities and Exchange Commission](/sec) (SEC), are permitted to make private purchases with venture funds, private situations, and other exclusive opportunities. Being an accredited investor means that the investors have exhibited the personal wealth and professional experience to show that they grasp the risks of such investments.

The SEC directs private purchases by sorting them in light of the amount raised and divulgences required during an offering.

They must register with the SEC for such offerings however the revelations required of them are not quite so severe as those for publicly-held companies. Regulation D offerings limit the amount brought to $5 million up in a single year and just 35 unaccredited investors can take part in the offering.

In any case, even non-accredited investors can now and then purchase private shares. Specific companies are permitted to sell a small number of them to outside investors, and SEC rules likewise state that a few restricted private shares can be exchanged publicly following a six-month or one-year holding period.

[Crowdfunding](/crowdfunding) offers one more opportunity for private purchase opportunities.

Yet, the commission likewise has rules illustrating how much those individuals are permitted to invest: It puts severe limitations on the percentage of income or net worth a group funder can invest in a private company in a given year.
