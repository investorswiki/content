## Illustration of an Accounting Policy

Accounting policies can be utilized to control earnings legally. For instance, companies are permitted to value inventory utilizing the [average cost](/averagecostmethod),[ first in first out](/fifo) (FIFO), or [last in first out](/lifo) (LIFO) methods of accounting. Under the average cost method, when a company sells a product, the weighted average cost of all inventory delivered or acquired in the [accounting period](/accountingperiod) is utilized to decide the [cost of goods sold](/cogs) (COGS).

Under the FIFO inventory cost method, when a company sells a product, the cost of the inventory created or acquired first is viewed as sold. Under the LIFO method, when a product is sold, the cost of the inventory created last is viewed as sold. In periods of rising inventory prices, a company can utilize these accounting policies to increase or diminish its earnings.

For instance, a company in the manufacturing industry purchases inventory at $10 per unit for the main half of the month and $12 per unit for the final part of the month. The company winds up purchasing a total of 10 units at $10 and 10 units at $12 and sells a total of 15 units all month long.

On the off chance that the company utilizes FIFO, its cost of goods sold is: (10 x $10) + (5 x $12) = $160. In the event that it utilizes average cost, its cost of goods sold is: (15 x $11) = $165. Assuming that it utilizes LIFO, its cost of goods sold is: (10 x $12) + (5 x $10) = $170. It is hence profitable to involve the FIFO method in periods of rising prices to limit the cost of goods sold and increase earnings.
