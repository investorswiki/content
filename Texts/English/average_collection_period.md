365 days \u00f7 10 = Average Collection Period

For instance, the banking sector depends vigorously on receivables on account of the loans and mortgages that it offers to consumers.

[Real estate](/realestate) and construction companies likewise depend on consistent cash flows to pay for labor, services, and supplies.
