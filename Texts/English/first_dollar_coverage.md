## What is First Dollar Coverage?

First dollar coverage is a type of [insurance policy](/insurance-coverage) with no [deductible](/deductible) where the insurer expects payment once an insurable event happens. While there is no deductible, the amount the insurer will pay out is much of the time lower than on comparative plans that have a deductible, or premiums for the primary dollar plan will be higher.

## Seeing First Dollar Coverage

First dollar coverage plans are accessible on [health insurance](/healthinsurance), property holder's insurance, and vehicle insurance policies, among others.

First dollar coverage as a rule exists as far as possible up to the full amount of the policy, however the full amount here is extensively lower than the full amount in the more normal deductible-based plans. Due to this, first dollar policies are not quite so well known as deductible plans. For instance, numerous first dollar health care coverage plans will have low limits intending that there is a cap on the maximum amount the insurance company will cover.

First dollar insurance plans have higher [premiums](/insurance-premium) in light of the fact that the insurer is bearing a greater risk for the insured thing. For instance, with a first dollar health care coverage plan, the insurance company will charge the customer higher premiums since the insurer starts payment with the principal covered service the patient gets. First dollar coverage will in general be less pervasive in the home and vehicle insurance industry as a result of the higher premiums.

Pundits of first dollar coverage contend that it puts pointless burdens on the wellbeing system and drives up prices since those with this type of coverage will generally abuse or abuse wellbeing services.

## Illustration of a First Dollar Car Insurance Policy

Expect that a driver damages their vehicle while crashing into the garage. They take the vehicle to a body shop and the damage is estimated at $3,000. Normally, in this situation, the person might opt to pay to fix the actual damage, or on the other hand in the event that they can't manage the cost of the upfront cost they might file a [auto insurance](/collision protection) claim. Filing a claim as a rule includes paying a deductible, for example, $250, $500, or $1,000 relying upon the insurance policy. Lower deductibles normally have higher insurance premiums.

The insurance company covers the cost, yet the driver is likewise paying some of it via the deductible. On the off chance that the deductible is $500, they are sending $500 to the insurance company and getting $3,000 for a net inflow of $2,500 to cover the damage costs.

Expect the driver has a first dollar vehicle insurance policy. This means they don't have to pay the deductible. The insurance company pays the full amount, and the driver gets the $3,000. From the beginning, the driver is better off with this policy since their net inflow to cover accident costs is greater.

Interesting points, however, are the premiums and coverage. All else being equivalent, first dollar policies cost the insurance company more, so they will charge a higher premium. At the point when an insurable event happens, the driver's personal costs are less, yet every month or year that driver is paying more in premiums, which balances that advantage. Additionally, coverage limits might be lower with the main dollar policy. This is particularly reasonable if the premiums appear to be comparable with a deductible plan.

## Features
- First dollar coverage is a type of insurance where there is no deductible or copay.
- The insurance company begins covering costs on the principal dollar claimed.
- First dollar coverage is regularly more costly than a comparable deductible plan. In the event that costs are comparative, the main dollar coverage plan will probably have lower payout limits than a deductible plan.
