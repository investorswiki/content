# Mortgage Allocations
## What Are Mortgage Allocations?

Mortgage allocations are a step in the settlement of to-be-reported [mortgage-backed securities](/mbs) (MBS) that are traded in the secondary market. At assignment, the seller gives the buyer the exact details of the loans that make up the underlying pool of the MBS.

## Understanding Mortgage Allocations

Mortgage-backed securities (MBSs) are financial securities created by pooling multiple [mortgages](/mortgage) into a repackaged security and selling them to an investor. The buyer of a MBS receives a stream of income from the interest payments made by homeowners on those mortgages.

At the point when a MBS is traded in the secondary market, the underlying mortgages that make up a specific MBS are obscure. Mortgage allocation is the interaction by which a seller of a mortgage-backed security (MBS) details the mortgages that make up the [to-be-announced](/tba) (TBA) MBS by a certain date and time.

## Mortgage Allocation Process

At the point when a buyer and a seller settle on a TBA trade, they fundamentally consent to the terms of a contract. The parties settle on the issuer, [maturity](/maturity), [coupon](/coupon), price, and [par](/parvalue) amounts of the traded securities. Past these criteria, the underlying loans are thought of as interchangeable. That additionally means that the buyer and seller are not aware of the quality of the underlying mortgages in the MBS.

This interchangeability facilitates trading and liquidity in the [secondary market](/secondarymarket). The buyer and seller additionally settle on the date of [settlement](/settlement_period) for the trade. Two days before the settlement date, by 3 p.m., the seller needs to notify the buyer of the exact pool of mortgages remembered for the MBS. Allocation of specific mortgages to the traded security occurs in this period before delivery, which is known as mortgage allocation.

Approximately 90% of Freddie Mac, Fannie Mae, and [Ginnie Mae](/ginniemae) mortgage-backed securities trade on the TBA marketplace. This makes it the most important secondary market for mortgage securities. It is second only to the U.S. Treasury market in fixed-income trading volume and is subject to rule-production by the [Security Industry/Financial Market Association](/sifma) (SIFMA).

## Mortgage Allocation Guidelines and Non-TBA Trading

The value of TBA trades isn't known at the time of execution so are instead estimated, therefore, the last allocation of mortgages is subject to variance between the actual amount and the estimated amount. There is a variance restriction forced by the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association (SIFMA). This restriction is a means to guarantee the interchangeability of the underlying mortgages and is set at 0.01% of the price of the trade.

The mortgages that will be delivered on the settlement date must satisfy the settled upon trade within the limits of that requirement. In the past, variance limitations were more lenient and permitted traders a [arbitrage](/arbitrage) opportunity while allocating mortgages at the notification date. As SIFMA has tightened its variance allowances, this is more uncommon. Advanced software has permitted traders to satisfy tighter variance rules.

Traders hoping to stay away from the allocation cycle have the option of setting non-TBA trades in the specific pool market. In these transactions, the buyer and seller consent to trade particular [mortgage pools](/mortgage_pool) and no subsequent allocation is required. The loans sold in this market tend to be of classes that don't meet SIFMA's definition of standard loans. Among these can be [interest-only](/interestonlymortgage) loans, 40-year mortgages, or [adjustable-rate mortgages](/arm) (ARMs).

## Illustration of a Mortgage Allocation

Mary chooses to sell Peter a mortgage-backed security (MBS) and Peter chooses to buy it. They both concur the sale will take place on Tuesday. At the point when the sale is executed, neither Mary nor Peter know the types of mortgages that make up the MBS. The standard settlement is T+3, meaning the trade will settle on Friday. Per the two-day rule, Mary connects with Peter on Wednesday before 3 p.m. also, notifies him of the mortgage allocations he will receive when the trade settles on Friday.

## Highlights
- The variance between the estimated value of the underlying loans and the last allocation of the underlying loans has a restriction value that is set at 0.01% of the price of the trade.
- The mortgage allocation process happens in the secondary market for traded mortgage-backed securities (MBS).
- The seller must notify the buyer of all of the underlying mortgage details two days prior to settlement of the trade by 3 p.m.
- This step is the point at which the seller of the MBS notifies the buyer with each of the details of the underlying mortgages that make up the MBS.
- Mortgage allocation alludes to a step in a to-be-declared mortgage-backed security (MBS).
- At the time the trade is executed, neither the buyer nor the seller knows about the underlying mortgages in a MBS; this is to guarantee trading and liquidity.
