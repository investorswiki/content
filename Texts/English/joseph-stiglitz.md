## Data Asymmetry

Joseph Stiglitz made an area of study known as data economics, a branch of microeconomics that studies what data and data systems mean for an economy and economic choices. His research on data lopsidedness acquired Stiglitz the 2001 Nobel Prize in economics.

[Data Asymmetry](/asymmetricinformation) is an imbalance of data between players in a market. One party in an economic transaction might have more data than another: a buyer might have more information than a seller, or a borrower might know his repayment ability more than the lender.

Joseph Stiglitz is credited with his screening technique, a method used to extricate the missing data expected to complete an efficient market transaction. Stiglitz's screening technique is a regular device utilized by insurance companies and lenders. Insurance companies screen endorsers and sort them into high-risk or generally safe categories to charge fitting premiums. Lenders use screening to sort borrowers by risk of repayment and assign higher interest rates appropriately.

> As per Stiglitz, screening is "the course of discrimination, of recognizing among "things" which, without a trace of screening, would, for economic designs, be dealt with something similar, even however it could be realized that they vary in maybe a few important ways".

## Risk Aversion

Joseph Stiglitz's study of [risk aversion](/riskaverse) characterized how individuals make choices to set aside and spend cash. As per Stiglitz, when vulnerability exists in a situation, economic results rely upon whether one course of action is riskier than another or on the other hand on the off chance that one individual is more risk-disinclined than another. His speculations make sense of the results of risk aversion when applied to portfolio investments, individual savings, and business production choices.

## Monopolistic Competition

Stiglitz defined the theory of monopolistic competition, as a market structure where many companies are available in an industry that produce comparative yet separated products. None of the companies partake in a monopoly, and each company operates freely regardless of the actions of different companies. In monopolistic competition, advertising and marking are key and can add to barriers to entry for new firms. Industries like restaurant chains, apparel, and athletic apparel follow this model.
