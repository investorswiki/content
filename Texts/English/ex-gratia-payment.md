## What Is an Ex Gratia Payment?

An ex gratia [payment](/payment) is made to an individual by an organization, government, or insurer for damages or claims, however it doesn't need the induction of liability by the party making the payment.

An ex gratia payment is considered [voluntary](/honorarium) on the grounds that the party making the payment isn't committed to repay the individual. In Latin, "ex gratia" means "by favor."

## Figuring out Ex Gratia Payments

Ex gratia payments contrast from legally-commanded payments since ex gratia payments are voluntary. As a rule, organizations, governments, and insurers will possibly give compensation to casualties on the off chance that they are legally required to do as such. Along these lines, ex gratia payments are not extremely common.

On account of an insurance company, on the off chance that a policyholder experiences an injury that is [covered](/insurance-inclusion) by the terms of their insurance policy, the insurer is legally committed to pay for the claim. This type of payment isn't voluntary. It is the consequence of a legal obligation, and it commonly conveys with it an admission of liability.

Conversely, an ex gratia payment is a token of [goodwill](/goodwill). The type of payment is made following a specific loss or damage to a property; an ex gratia payment doesn't carry with it any admission of liability. A company giving a one-time credit to its customers wouldn't be viewed as making an ex gratia payment in light of the fact that the payment isn't connected with a specific loss. Notwithstanding, a company that gives a credit after a service disruption would be viewed as making an ex gratia payment.

An organization might involve ex gratia payments as part of a longer-term strategy to keep up with great relations with the individual getting the payment. For example, a large retailer that is forced to reduce staff might give a severance payment that is larger than the legal requirement. The retailer might establish that this token of goodwill will reduce the negative exposure created by the [layoffs](/cutback). Essentially, British Airways frequently gives an ex gratia payment card to past customers who might have been troubled to keep up with great customer relations.
