In any case, whenever held at a chartered banking institution, funds are guaranteed by the [Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation](/fdic) (FDIC) up to $250,000 per individual depositor, per insured bank.

For accounts with large balances, banks frequently offer a support to "clear" the checking account. This includes pulling out the majority of the excess cash in the account and investing it in overnight interest-bearing funds. Toward the beginning of the next business day, the funds are deposited once again into the checking account along with the interest earned overnight.

## Checking Accounts and Banks

Notwithstanding, as alternative lenders, for example, [fintech](/fintech) companies offer consumers a rising number of loans, banks might need to return to this strategy.

Everything many banks don't say to customers is that they'll charge you for every transaction that makes your account utilize an overdraft. Assuming you have a $50 account balance, for instance, and you make purchases utilizing your debit card of $25, $25, and $53, you will be charged a [overdraft](/overdraft) fee — typically a weighty one — for the purchase that overdrew your account, as well concerning each subsequent purchase after you're in the red.

The difference is that while the larger account is earning sufficient interest for the bank to earn some income, the $10 account is costing the bank more than it's acquiring.

The bank compensates for this shortfall by charging fees when customers fail to keep a [minimum balance](/least balance), compose too many checks, or, as just examined, overdraw an account.

There might be a method for escaping in any event a portion of those fees once in a while. In the event that you're a customer of a large bank (not a modest community savings-and-loan branch), the best method for abstaining from paying non-repeating fees is to courteously ask.
