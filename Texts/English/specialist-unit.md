# Specialist Unit
## What Was a Specialist Unit?

A specialist unit was a group of individuals or firms that filled in as market creators for at least one stocks that traded on a specific exchange. The work performed by individuals in this unit has been largely supplanted by electronic systems after some time. Thus the positions in such units rarely exist anyplace in the world these days.

A specialist unit kept a stable market in a given security by going about as both a principal and agent for brokers. As a principal, a specialist unit frequently held its own inventory of stock, to work with liquidity for a given trade.

Today, specialist units go under various names, for example, [designated market makers](/designated-market-creator dmm) (DMMs) and [supplemental liquidity providers](/supplemental-liquidity-supplier). Specialist units and their current-day partners were most intensely utilized by the [New York Stock Exchange](/nyse) (NYSE).

## Grasping a Specialist Unit

Specialist units were in charge of keeping up with, however much as could be expected, moderately narrow bid-ask spreads for specific securities, as well as keeping up with market liquidity, overseeing limit orders, and large block trades. The unit may be an assortment of market specialists, or for larger trading areas, a market specialist and a team of representatives that would help the specialist.

Likewise, specialist units were charged with adjusting the market by taking the rival side of bullish or bearish sentiment for a given stock by trading out of the group's own inventory. This assisted with working with trading in times of market uncertainty or volatility including specific stocks.

Due to the approach of electronic trading, barely any exchanges worldwide utilize specialist units. The New York Stock Exchange, in any case, utilizes designated market producers (DMMs). Similar as specialist units, the DMMs keep up with fair and orderly markets for a specific set of securities. Utilizing both manual and electronic means, they help to try not to big trade uneven characters that can halt the trading of specific stocks.

The DMMs likewise play an important, however rarely utilized function, of being accessible in the event of a [halt to trading](/tradinghalt). DMMs act as the primary line of defense if [circuit-breaker ](/circuitbreaker)rules must be executed. On the off chance that a given stock, or even a major index, ought to rise or fall quickly in overreacted selling or buying, the DMMs will step in and assume control over the electronic order flow to execute trades for a couple of moments manually. Assuming orders appear to return to an acceptable degree of flow and price change, the electronic systems are restored, in any case trading in that stock, or in the general market, might be halted for the afternoon.

While many exchanges like to let machines assume the job of matching buy and sell orders for customers, the NYSE honestly thinks including the two people and machines further develops price discovery and hose volatility. The DMMs consider industry-specific intelligence, as well as their insight into both economics and trading systems while going with their choices. They are given an incentive to work for the benefit of market participants, instead of to trade for their own benefit.

Also, DMMs sometimes act as points of contact for the listed companies they address for the exchange, giving companies data with respect to the mind-set of traders and who is trading the organization's stock.

As per the NYSE, DMMs make markets fundamentally less unstable at the market open and close. On days when stock [lock-ups](/lockup-period) lapse, or when stocks list interestingly, the DMMs are beneficial so they can answer conditions that might be moderately rare or even unique.

### The Role of Supplemental Liquidity Providers

Another group that acts similar as specialist units is the NYSE's [supplemental liquidity suppliers ](/supplemental-liquidity-provider)(SLPs). These are high-volume individuals from the exchange gave a financial incentive by the NYSE to keep up with narrow bid-ask spreads in specific, vigorously traded securities, utilizing their own stock to take care of approaching requests.

The exchange's goal is to add liquidity at each price level. SLPs generally trade from their own accounts, nonetheless, the NYSE keeps up with that SLPs have similar publicly accessible trading data as other NYSE customers, not more data.
