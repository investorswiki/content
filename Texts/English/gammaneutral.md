# Gamma Neutral
## What Is Gamma Neutral?

A gamma neutral options position is one that has been vaccinated to large moves in a [underlying security](/underlying-security). Achieving a gamma neutral position is a method of overseeing risk in options trading by laying out an asset portfolio whose delta's rate of change is close to zero even as the underlying ascents or falls. This is known as [gamma hedging](/gamma-hedging). A gamma-neutral portfolio is consequently hedged against second-request time [price sensitivity](/price-sensitivity).

[Gamma](/gamma) is one of the "options [Greeks](/greeks)" alongside [delta](/delta), [rho](/rho), [theta](/theta), and [vega](/vega). These are utilized to survey the various types of risk in options portfolios.

## Figuring out Gamma Neutrality

The directional risk of an options portfolio can be managed through [delta hedging](/deltahedging), making a [delta neutral](/deltaneutral), or directionally undecided portfolio. The issue is that an option's delta itself will change as the price of the underlying moves, implying that a delta neutral position could gain or lose deltas and become a directional wagered, particularly if the underlying moves substantially. Gamma hedging attempts to neutralize such a change in the delta.

A gamma neutral portfolio can be made by taking positions with offsetting gamma values. This assists with lessening varieties due to changing [market prices](/market-price) and conditions. A gamma neutral portfolio is as yet subject to risk, notwithstanding. For instance, assuming that the suppositions used to lay out the portfolio end up being wrong, a position that should be neutral might end up being risky. Moreover, the position must be re-adjusted as prices change and time elapses.

Gamma neutral options strategies can be utilized to make new security positions or to change an existing one. The goal is to utilize a combination of options leaving the overall gamma value as close to zero as could be expected. At a value close to zero, the delta value shouldn't move when the price of the underlying security moves.

Note that in the event that the goal is to accomplish a durable, delta neutral strategy, one would utilize [delta-gamma hedging](/deltagamma-hedging). Be that as it may, on the other hand, a trader might need to keep a specific delta position, in which it very well may be delta positive (or negative) however gamma neutral.

Locking in profits is a famous use for gamma neutral positions. On the off chance that a period of high volatility is expected and an options trading position has created a decent gain to date, rather than locking in the profits by selling the position and receiving no further benefits, a delta neutral or gamma neutral hedge can successfully seal in the profits.

## Gamma Neutral versus Delta Neutral

A simple delta hedge could be made by purchasing call options and shorting a certain number of shares of the underlying stock simultaneously. On the off chance that the stock's price continues as before yet volatility rises, the trader might profit except if time value erosion annihilates those profits. A trader could add a short call with an alternate [strike price](/strikeprice) to the strategy to offset time value decay and safeguard against a large move in delta. Adding that second call to the position is a gamma hedge.

As the underlying stock ascents and falls in value, an investor might buy or sell shares in the stock in the event that they wish to keep the position neutral. This can increase the exchange's volatility and costs. Delta and gamma hedging don't need to be totally neutral, and traders might change how much positive or negative gamma they are presented to over the long run.
