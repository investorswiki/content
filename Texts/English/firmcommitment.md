# Firm Commitment
## What Is a Firm Commitment?

A firm commitment has three general implications in finance, yet is most known as an underwriter's agreement to expect all [inventory](/inventory) risk and purchase all securities for a [initial public offering](/ipo) (IPO) straightforwardly from the issuer available to be purchased to the public. It is otherwise called "firm commitment underwriting" or "purchased deal."

The term likewise alludes to a lending foundation's guarantee to go into a loan agreement with a borrower inside a certain period. A third application of the firm commitment term is for accounting and reporting of derivatives that are utilized for the purpose of hedging.

## Seeing Firm Commitment

In a firm commitment, a [underwriter](/underwriter) acts as a dealer and takes care of any unsold inventory. For facing this risk challenges a firm commitment, the dealer profits from a negotiated spread between the purchase price from the issuer and the [public offering price](/publicofferingprice) to the public. A firm commitment sale method diverges from the best efforts and [standby commitment](/standbyunderwriting) basis. An underwriter selling securities on best efforts doesn't guarantee the full sale of an issue at the issuer's ideal price and won't take in unsold inventory.

A standby commitment makes best efforts one stride further by which the underwriter consents to purchase unsold IPO shares at the [subscription price](/subscription-price).
