### Funded or Unfunded

A funded trust has assets put into it by the trustor during their lifetime. An unfunded trust comprises just of the trust agreement with no funding.

## Common Purposes for Trusts

Had similar beneficiary received them as a gift when the original owner was as yet alive, their basis would be $5,000. Afterward, in the event that the shares were sold for $12,000, the person who inherited them from a trust would owe tax on a $2,000 gain, while somebody who was given the shares would owe tax on a gain of $7,000. (Note that the step-up in basis applies to inherited assets as a rule, in addition to those that include a trust.)

At long last, a person might make a trust to meet all requirements for [Medicaid](/medicare) yet save essentially a portion of their wealth.
