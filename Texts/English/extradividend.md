## True Example

A notable example of an extra dividend is when, on Dec. 2, 2004, Microsoft (MSFT) paid out a special cash dividend of $3.00 per share for a total of $32 billion, which was worth 38 times too much dividend.

On that day, Steve Ballmer, then Chief Executive Officer of Microsoft, received a dividend check for $1.2 billion; and Bill Gates, the prime supporter and afterward chair of Microsoft, likewise received a big check of almost $3.4 billion in dividends. These two executives made a fortune overnight on the grounds that they were investors in their own company.

As an investor in that scenario, envision buying 1,000 shares in a company and getting compensated $0.08 per share each quarter, which is genuinely common. After a quarter, you would have $80 and following a year, you would have gained $320, which is genuinely respectable.

Presently, envision that one of those quarterly payments was not $0.08, yet all things considered, you received a unimaginable $3.00 per share. That one payment alone would be worth $3,000, which resembles getting nine years of dividend payments from Microsoft in one day. And keeping in mind that Gates and Ballmer received billions on that day in 2004, a huge number of regular investors likewise got checks, for $1,000, $2,000, potentially even $50,000 or all the more essentially by being invested in Microsoft.

Might we at any point cash in on a comparative extra dividend today? That actually may be conceivable with Microsoft, or different companies with gigantic amounts of cash that pay large extra dividends however finding the right companies is undeniably challenging.
