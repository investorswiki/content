## Illustration of an Appellate Court Ruling

Not long later, investor trusts that Uber and Lyft might actually pull off offering drivers no access to benefit plans or workers' compensation coverage were run. In October of 2020, the California First District Court of Appeals ruled that the law was, as a matter of fact, legal and enforceable, meaning Uber and Lyft must regard their California drivers as employees, as opposed to [independent contractors](/independent-worker for hire), and give them the benefits and wages they are qualified for under state labor law.

In February of 2021, the U.S. High Court would not hear Uber and Lyft's appeal, certifying the lower court's decision. The U.K. High Court has additionally done likewise.
