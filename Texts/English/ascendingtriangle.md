# Ascending Triangle
## What Is an Ascending Triangle?

An ascending triangle is a chart pattern utilized in [technical analysis](/technicalanalysis). It is made by price moves that allow for a horizontal line to be drawn along the [swing highs](/swinghigh) and a rising trendline to be drawn along the swing lows. The two lines form a triangle. Traders frequently watch for [breakouts](/breakout) from triangle patterns. The breakout can happen to the upside or downside.

Ascending triangles are many times called continuation patterns since the price will ordinarily break out in the very bearing as the trend that was in place just prior to the triangle forming.

An ascending triangle is tradable in that it gives an unmistakable entry point, profit target, and [stop-loss](/stop-lossorder) level. It very well might be stood out from a [descending triangle](/descendingtriangle).

## What Does the Ascending Triangle Tell You?

An ascending triangle is generally viewed as a continuation pattern, meaning that the pattern is huge assuming that it happens inside an uptrend or downtrend. When the breakout from the triangle happens, traders will generally forcefully buy or sell the asset relying upon which course the price broke out.

Expanding [volume](/volume) assists with affirming the breakout, as it shows rising interest as the price moves out of the pattern.

At least two swing highs and two swing lows are required to form the ascending triangle's trendlines. In any case, a greater number of trendline contacts will in general deliver more dependable trading results. Since the trendlines are combining on each other, on the off chance that the price keeps on moving inside a triangle for numerous swings, the price action turns out to be more coiled, probable leading to a more grounded eventual breakout.

Volume will in general be more grounded during trending periods than during consolidation periods. A triangle is a type of consolidation, and in this way volume will in general contract during an ascending triangle. As referenced, traders search for volume to increase on a breakout, as this affirms the price is probably going to keep heading in the breakout bearing. In the event that the price breaks out on low volume, that is a warning sign that the breakout needs strength. This could mean the price will move once again into the pattern. This is called a [false breakout](/failedbreak).

For the purpose of trading, an entry is ordinarily taken when the price breaks out. Buy in the event that the breakout happens to the upside, or short/sell assuming a breakout happens to the downside. A stop loss is placed just outside the contrary side of the pattern. For instance, in the event that a long trade is taken on an upside breakout, a stop loss is placed just below the lower trendline.

A profit target can be estimated in view of the level of the triangle added or deducted from the breakout price. The thickest part of the triangle is utilized. In the event that the triangle is $5 high, add $5 to the upside breakout point to get the price target. On the off chance that the price breaks lower, the profit target is the breakout point less $5.

## Illustration of How to Interpret the Ascending Triangle

Here an ascending triangle forms during a downtrend, and the price proceeds with lower following the breakout. When the breakout happened, the profit target was attained. The short entry or sell signal happened when the price broke below the lower trendline. A stop loss could be placed just over the upper trendline.

Wide patterns like this present a higher [risk/reward](/riskrewardratio) than patterns that get substantially smaller over the long haul. As a pattern limits, the stop loss decreases since the distance to the breakout point is more modest, yet the profit target is as yet in view of the biggest part of the pattern.

## The Difference Between an Ascending Triangle and a Descending Triangle

These two types of triangles are both continuation patterns, with the exception of they have an alternate look. The descending triangle has a horizontal lower line, while the upper trendline is descending. This is something contrary to the ascending triangle, which has a rising lower trendline and a horizontal upper trendline.

## Limitations of Trading the Ascending Triangle

The fundamental problem with triangles, and chart patterns by and large, is the potential for false breakouts. The price might move out of the pattern just to move once again into it, or the price might even continue to break out the opposite side. A pattern might should be redrawn several times as the price edges past the trendlines yet fails to produce any momentum in the breakout heading.

While ascending triangles give a profit target, that target is just an estimate. The price may far surpass that target, or fail to arrive at it.

## Highlights
- A [long](/long) trade is taken in the event that the price breaks over the highest point of the pattern.
- Ascending triangles are viewed as a continuation pattern, as the price will normally break out of the triangle in the price course winning before the triangle, albeit this will not necessarily happen. A breakout toward any path is vital.
- A [short](/shortselling) trade is taken in the event that the price breaks below the lower [trendline](/trendline).
- The trendlines of a triangle need to run along something like two swing highs and two swing lows.
- A stop loss is ordinarily placed just outside the pattern on the contrary side from the breakout.
- A [profit target](/profit-target) is calculated by taking the level of the triangle, at its thickest point, and adding or deducting that to/from the breakout point.
