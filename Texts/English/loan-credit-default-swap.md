# Loan Credit Default Swap (LCDS)
## What Is a Loan Credit Default Swap (LCDS)?

A loan credit default swap (LCDS) is a type of [credit derivative](/creditderivative) in which the [credit exposure](/credit-exposure) of an underlying loan is exchanged between two gatherings. A loan credit default swap's structure is equivalent to a customary credit default swap (CDS), then again, actually the underlying [reference obligation](/reference-obligation) is limited stringently to [syndicated secured loans](/syndicatedloan), instead of a corporate debt.

Loan credit default swaps can likewise be alluded to as "loan-just credit default swaps."

## Understanding a Loan Credit Default Swap (LCDS)

The LCDS was acquainted with the financial market in 2006. At that point, the hot market for credit default swaps showed that there was as yet a craving for more credit derivatives, and the LCDS was to a great extent seen as a CDS with the reference obligation shifting to syndicated debt rather than corporate debt. The [International Swaps and Derivatives Association](/isda) (ISDA) assisted with normalizing the contracts being involved simultaneously as the creation of syndicated secured loans with the end goal of leveraged buyouts was additionally expanding.

The LCDS comes in two types. A cancelable LCDS is frequently alluded to as a U.S. LCDS and is generally intended to be a trading product. As the name proposes, the cancelable LCDS can be canceled at a settled upon date or dates in the future without penalty costs. A non-cancelable LCDS, or European LCDS, is a hedging product that incorporates prepayment risk into its cosmetics. The non-cancelable LCDS stays in force until the underlying syndicated loans are reimbursed in full (or a credit event triggers it). As a U.S. LCDS has the option to cancel, these swaps are sold at a higher rate than comparable non-cancelable swaps.

> The recovery rate for LCDS is a lot higher than for CDS on bonds in light of the fact that the underlying assets for LCDS are syndicated secured loans.

## Loan Credit Default Swaps versus Credit Default Swaps

Likewise with standard [credit default swaps](/creditdefaultswap), these derivative contracts can be utilized to hedge against credit exposure the buyer might have or to get credit exposure for the seller. A LCDS can likewise be utilized to make wagers on the credit quality of an underlying entity to which gatherings have not had previous exposure.

The greatest difference between a LCDS and a CDS is the recovery rate. The debt underlying a LCDS is secured to [assets](/resource) and has priority in any liquidation procedures, though the debt underlying a CDS, while senior to shares, is junior to secured loans. So the higher quality reference obligation for a LCDS prompts higher recovery values on the off chance that that loan defaults. Therefore, a LCDS generally trades at more tight spreads than an ordinary CDS.
