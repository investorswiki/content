# Reserve Tranche
## What Is a Reserve Tranche?

A reserve tranche is a portion of the required quota of currency every member country must give to the [International Monetary Fund](/imf) (IMF) that can be used for its own motivations — without a service fee or economic reform conditions.

## Grasping a Reserve Tranche

The IMF is funded through its members and their quota contributions. The reserve tranche is fundamentally an emergency account that IMF members can access whenever without consenting to conditions or paying a [service fee](/service-charge). As such, a portion of a member country's quota can be removed free of charge at its own caution.

The reserve tranches that countries hold with the IMF are viewed as their facilities of first resort, meaning they will tap into the reserve tranche before seeking a formal [credit tranche](/credit-tranche). In theory, members can borrow more than 100% of their quota. In any case, assuming the amount being looked for by the member nation surpasses its reserve tranche position (RTP), then it turns into a credit tranche that must be repaid in three years with [interest](/interest).

Initially, member nations' reserve tranches are typically 25% of their quota. In any case, their RTP can change as per any lending that the IMF does with its holdings of the member's [currency](/currency).

## Special Considerations

The RTP increments when the IMF borrows out of a nation's currency that was accumulated as part of the quota. The country whose currency is loaned out is viewed as in a [creditor](/creditor) position and is remunerated for the utilization of its funds past a portion set out as the unremunerated portion of the reserve tranche.

Assuming the IMF is lending out a country's currency over the unremunerated portion, the amounts over that become an extra reserve tranche for the country, called the remunerated RTP.

### Special Drawing Rights (SDR)

Contributions to the IMF are comprised of a combination of national currency and [special drawing rights](/sdr) (SDR). Since IMF member nations have a wide range of national currencies, the IMF names its members' quotas in terms of SDRs, which is an IMF creation backed by a predefined [basket](/currencybasket) of major international currencies.

> The SDR was initially defined as equivalent to 0.888671 grams of fine gold — the equivalent to one U.S. dollar at that point — until the collapse of the [Bretton Woods](/brettonwoodsagreement) fixed exchange rate system.

As of March 2022, the basket currencies for SDRs incorporated the [U.S. dollar](/usd) (USD), the [euro](/euro) (EUR), the Japanese yen (JPY), the pound sterling (GBP), and the Chinese yuan renminbi (CNY). Together, the dollar and euro make up 70% of the basket's value.

Currencies highlighted in the SDR basket need to meet two criteria:

1. Export criterion: "Its issuer is an IMF member or a monetary union that incorporates IMF members, and is likewise one of the best five world [exporters](/export)".
1. Freely usable criterion: "It must be widely used to make payments for international transactions and widely traded in the principal exchange markets."

The SDR basket is looked into like clockwork and some of the time prior whenever justified. Surveys occur to guarantee that the SDR mirrors the relative significance of currencies in the world's trading and [financial systems](/financial-system).

## Features
- The reserve tranches that countries hold with the IMF are viewed as their facilities of first resort, meaning they will tap into them before seeking a proper credit tranche that charges interest.
- Initially, member nations' reserve tranches are 25% of their quota, yet this position can change as per any lending that the IMF does with its holdings of the member's currency.
- The reserve tranche is a segment of an International Monetary Fund (IMF) member country's quota that is accessible without fees or economic reform conditions.
