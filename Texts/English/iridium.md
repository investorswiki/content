## What Is Iridium?

Iridium is a compound element and one of the change metals on the periodic table. Iridium shows up as symbol Ir on the periodic table and has an atomic weight of 192.217 and a density of 22.56 g/cm\u00b3, spreading the word about it the second-densest element. Since iridium is so expensive, normally utilized exclusively in applications require a tiny amount of the element.

## Grasping Iridium

Iridium is the most consumption safe metal on Earth. It is extremely challenging to soften, and in view of its high liquefying point, it is difficult to form, machine, or work iridium.

It is likewise quite possibly of the rarest element in Earth's outside. The colossal asteroid that numerous researchers accept cleared out the dinosaurs a long time back is likewise accepted to be responsible for the thin layer of iridium-rich dirt found around Earth.

This layer of iridium forms the Cretaceous-Paleogene boundary (formerly known as the Cretaceous-Tertiary boundary). It is otherwise called the K-Pg boundary on the grounds that the Cretaceous is addressed by the letter K.

## History of Iridium

The English physicist Smithson Tennant discovered iridium. He found the element in the residues from a solution of platinum minerals in 1803. He named the metal Iridium after Iris, who was the exemplification of the rainbow in Greek folklore, since iridium salts are lively and colorful. In light of its extremely high liquefying point, it was only after 1842 that researchers could disconnect it in a high-immaculateness state. Iridium is additionally quite possibly of the rarest element on earth, with gold being 40 times more normal in the earth's outside layer than iridium.

German scientist Rudolf Ludwig M\u00f6ssbauer won the Nobel Prize in physical science in 1961 for his research, utilizing iridium, concerning the reverberation absorption of gamma radiation, a phenomenon presently called the M\u00f6ssbauer effect.

## Applications of Iridium

Iridium's extremely high softening point makes it helpful in numerous [industrial applications](/base-metals), like the construction of high-level spark plugs utilized in everyday aviation aircraft. Manufacturers likewise use it in the construction of cauldrons, or compartments for liquefying and controlling other industrial metals. Iridium cauldrons have most recently assisted make sapphire gems, which with requiring temperatures over 3,632 degrees F. Given that iridium's softening point is 4,435 degrees F, pure iridium performs well at the temperatures required.

Manufacturers likewise join iridium with osmium to make wellspring pen nibs, and to build turn course and other logical and specific equipment.

Iridium has turned into an important part in the production of LED screens and illuminated showcases of technology gadgets, like iPads and iPhones. This has prompted a flood in demand for the metal and sent its price soaring. After Apple delivered its first iPad in 2010, iridium prices rose to more than $1,000 per troy ounce. After a concise fall in 2013, iridium prices kept on rising, arriving at an average price of $2,550 per troy ounce in 2020.

> At $2,550 per troy ounce, iridium is more important than gold, silver, or platinum.

## Iridium versus Palladium

Large numbers of iridium's industrial applications can measure up to [palladium](/palladium), an honorable metal with properties like platinum. Both iridium and palladium have high softening points, high electrical conductivity, and extreme consumption resistance, making the two metals highly pragmatic for hardware and industrial applications. Palladium is habitually utilized in exhaust systems, where it responds with hydrocarbons in exhaust vapor. Iridium is in many cases utilized in gadgets due to its high tolerance to warm.

## Illustration of Iridium

Due to its high electrical conductivity and resistance to erosion at high temperatures, iridium is oftentimes used to tip spark plugs, the gadgets that light the fuel-air combination in ignition motors.

Iridium is six times harder and eight times more grounded than platinum, one more precious metal utilized in high-grade spark plugs. While copper spark plugs have an expected lifetime of 20,000 miles, those with platinum terminals can last up to 100,000 miles, and iridium spark attachments can last up to 25% longer than that. Iridium-tipped spark plugs are likewise more expensive, at a price point of eight to fifteen dollars for every fitting.

## The Bottom Line

Iridium is a rare and important industrial metal with numerous applications in gadgets and machinery. Recent innovations in mobile telephone technology, combined with the boundless adoption of personal gadgets, have made iridium prices take off.

## Iridium FAQs
### What Color Is Iridium?

Iridium mineral is white or gray, and when alloyed with different metals it is commonly a sparkly silvery-white tone. Iridium salts have changed and energetic tones.

### Where Is Iridium Found?

Iridium is perhaps of the rarest element in the earth's outside layer. Iridium minerals have been found in South Africa, the United States, Myanmar, Brazil, Russia, and Australia. South Africa is the leading producer of mined iridium.

### How Is Iridium Ore Mined?

Pure iridium doesn't happen normally. Iridium normally happens in compounds with other honorable metals, like platinum. Iridium is normally created as a side-effect of copper or nickel extraction.

### The amount Does Iridium Cost?

In 2020, the average market price of iridium was $2,550 per troy ounce.

## Highlights
- Its price has flooded in recent times due to increased demand from the tech industry.
- Iridium has several industrial applications, like the aircraft industry.
- Most iridium is found in platinum minerals. Iridium extraction happens as a result of mining different metals.
- Iridium is quite possibly of the rarest element in the earth's covering. Having shown up in the very meteor that killed the dinosaurs is accepted.
