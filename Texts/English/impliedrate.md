# Implied Rate
## What Is the Implied Rate?

The implied rate is the difference between the [spot interest rate](/spot_rate) and the interest rate for the forward or futures delivery date.

## Grasping the Implied Rate

The implied interest rate gives investors a method for looking at returns across investments and assess the risk and return qualities of that specific security. An implied interest rate can be calculated for a security that likewise has a [option](/optionscontract) or [futures contract](/futurescontract).

For instance, if the current U.S. dollar [deposit rate](/deposit-interest-rate) is 1% for spot and 1.5% in one year's time, the implied rate is the difference of 0.5%. On the other hand, on the off chance that the spot price for a currency is 1.050 and the futures contract price is 1.1071, the difference of 5.71% is the implied interest rate. In both of these models, the implied rate is positive, which shows that the market expects future borrowing rates to be higher than they are currently.

To work out the implied rate, take the ratio of the [forward price](/forwardprice) over the spot price. Raise that ratio to the power of 1 partitioned by the time span until the expiration of the forward contract. Then deduct 1.

- Implied rate = (forward/spot) raised to the power of (1/time) - 1

where time = length of the forward contract in years

## Implied Rate Examples
### Products

On the off chance that the [spot price](/spotprice) for a barrel of oil is $68 and a one-year futures contract for a barrel of oil is $71, the implied interest rate is:

Implied rate = (71/68)^(1/1)^ - 1 = 4.41%

Partition the futures price of $71 by the spot price of $68. Since this is a one-year contract, the ratio is just raised to the power of 1 (1/time). Take away 1 from the ratio and find the implied interest rate of 4.41%.

### Stocks

On the off chance that a [stock](/stock) is currently trading at $30 and there is a two-year [forward contract](/forwardcontract) trading at $39, the implied interest rate is:

Implied rate = (39/30)^(1/2)^ - 1 = 14.02%

Partition the forward price of $39 by the spot price of $30. Since this is a two-year futures contract, raise the ratio to the power of 1/2. Take away 1 from the solution to find the implied interest rate is 14.02%.

### Monetary forms

Assuming the spot rate for the [euro](/euro) is $1.2291 and the one-year futures price for the euro is $1.2655, the implied interest rate is:

Implied rate = (1.2655/1.2291)^(1/1)^ - 1 = 2.96%

Compute the ratio of the forward price over the spot price by isolating 1.2655 by 1.2291. Since this is a one-year forward contract, the ratio is essentially raised to the power of 1. Deducting 1 from the ratio of the forward price over the spot price brings about an implied interest rate of 2.96%.
