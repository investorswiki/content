## Understanding Settlement Dates

The [financial market](/financial-market) indicates the number of business days after a transaction that a security or financial instrument must be paid and delivered. This [lag between transaction and settlement dates](/settlement_period) follows how settlements were recently confirmed, by physical delivery. In the past, security transactions were done physically rather than electronically. Investors would need to wait for the delivery of a particular security, which was in actual certificate form and wouldn't pay until reception. Since delivery times could differ and prices could fluctuate, market regulators set a period of time in which securities and cash must be delivered.

Today, utilizing modern technology, a transaction is electronically handled quicker than expected.

Most stocks and bonds settle within two business days after the transaction date. This two-day window is known as the [T+2](/tplus1). Government bills, bonds, and options settle the next business day. Spot foreign exchange transactions as a rule settle two business days after the execution date. A primary exception is the U.S. dollar versus the Canadian dollar, which settles the next business day.

> Historically, a stock trade could take upwards of five business days (T+5) to settle a trade. With the advent of technology, this has been diminished first to T=3 and presently to just T+2.

In the event that there is a single beneficiary, payment is as a rule within about fourteen days from the date the insurer gets a death certificate.
