## What Is Emergency Credit?

Emergency credit is money loaned by the Federal Reserve to a bank or other financial institution which has an immediate requirement for cash and no alternative wellsprings of credit. These loans are generally made in response to a financial crisis and are casually alluded to as bailout loans.

Emergency credit is typically extended for a period of 30 days or more.

## How Emergency Credit Works

The modern legal basis for the emergency credit system originates from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act (FDICIA), which was passed in 1991. This law amended the [Federal Reserve Act](/1913-federal-reserve-act) to expand the scope of financial bailouts permissible for institutions insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC).

To achieve this, the FDICIA authorized the FDIC to borrow straightforwardly from the U.S. Treasury to give bailouts to distressed banks in times of critical financial stress.

In 2010, following the wild financial crisis that started in 2007, the [Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act](/dodd-frank-financial-administrative reform-bill) made further amendments to the Federal Reserve Act. In particular, the Dodd-Frank reforms restricted the Federal Reserve's authority to issue bailouts, especially comparable to institutions that are in any case [insolvent](/bankruptcy).

These rules were additionally amended in 2015, consolidating the requirement that any new emergency lending programs must acquire prior endorsement from the Secretary of the Treasury. The 2015 reforms likewise established rules for the interest rates utilized in emergency credit transactions, determining that these rates must be set at a premium to the interest rates common under normal market conditions.

The purpose of these amendments was to keep financial institutions from taking advantage of emergency credit facilities whenever of normal market conditions. In that case, the government could actually be rivaling private lenders.

The amendments defined the emergency credit program as accessible just in circumstances when no alternative wellsprings of credit are accessible.
