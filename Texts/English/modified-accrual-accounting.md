# Modified Accrual Accounting
## What Is Modified Accrual Accounting?

Modified accrual accounting is an alternative bookkeeping method that joins [accrual basis accounting](/accrualaccounting) with [cash basis accounting](/cashbasis). It perceives revenues when they become accessible and quantifiable and, with a couple of exemptions, records expenditures when [liabilities](/liability) are incurred. Modified accrual accounting is regularly utilized by government agencies.

## Understanding Modified Accrual Accounting

To comprehend how modified accrual accounting functions it is first essential to break down how the traditional bookkeeping practices are impacted by function.

- Cash basis accounting perceives transactions upon the exchange of cash. Expenses are not recognized until they are paid and revenue isn't recognized until payment has been received. That means that future obligations or anticipated revenues are not kept in [financial statements](/financial-statements) until the cash transaction has happened.
- Conversely, accrual accounting perceives expenses when they are incurred, regardless of the payment status of the charges, and records revenue when a legal obligation is made. This demonstrates the company has satisfied an obligation and has earned the right to collect, say exactly when the goods are delivered or toward the completion of a service.

Modified accrual accounting acquires components from both cash and accrual accounting, contingent upon whether assets are long-term, for example, [fixed assets](/fixedasset) and [long-term debt](/longtermdebt), or [short-term](/currentassets, for example, [accounts receivable](/accountsreceivable) (AR) and [inventory](/inventory).

## Recording Short-Term Events

The modified accrual practice follows the cash method of accounting when economic events influencing the short term have happened. An economic event is kept in the short term when the cash balance has been impacted. The aftereffect of this rule is that practically all things recorded on the [income statement](/incomestatement) are recorded utilizing the cash basis, and things including accounts receivable and inventory are not recorded on the [balance sheet](/balancesheet).

## Recording Long-Term Events

Economic events expected to impact various reporting periods are recorded utilizing rules similar to the accrual method. This straightforwardly impacts how fixed assets and long-term debt are reported. Under the modified accrual method, these long-term things are recorded on the balance sheet and [depreciated](/deterioration), [depleted](/exhaustion), or [amortized](/amortization) over the life of the asset or liability. This systematic distribution of expenses or revenues permits future financial statements to have greater comparability.

## Special Considerations

A modified accrual accounting system joins the simplicity of cash accounting with the more sophisticated ability of accrual accounting to match related revenues with expenses.

It isn't normally utilized by public companies, in any case, as it doesn't consent to [International Financial Reporting Standards](/ifrs) (IFRS) or the [generally accepted accounting principles](/gaap) (GAAP), which frame what procedures companies must follow while preparing their officially reported financial statements. Organizations that wish to utilize this method must do as such for internal purposes and afterward convert transactions recorded under a cash basis to accrual accounting to get them closed down by [auditors](/inspector).

Under GAAP, in the event that a public company has average gross receipts for the past three years of $25 million or less, they can then pick which accounting method they would like.

### Government Friendly

For governments, it is an alternate story. The [Government Accounting Standards Board](/government-accounting-standards-board-gasb) (GASB), which is recognized as the official source of GAAP for state and nearby governments, lays out modified accrual accounting standards.

Modified accrual accounting is utilized and accepted by governmental agencies since they center around current-year obligations. Governmental agencies have two key objectives: to report whether current-year revenues are sufficiently adequate to finance current-year expenses, and to determine if resources are being utilized by legally adopted financial plans.

Modified accrual accounting checks those containers. It empowers government agencies to zero in on short-term financial assets and liabilities. It additionally permits them to partition accessible funds into separate substances inside the organization to guarantee that money is being spent where it was expected.
