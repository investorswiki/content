# Mist Browser
## What Was the Mist Browser?

The Mist browser was intended to be a vital part of the [Ethereum](/ethereum) network's [dApps](/decentralized-applications-dapps) (decentralized applications) ecosystem. It was the main graphical UI that enabled users to access the blockchain when you could access it through the command line. Its developers wanted to offer an all inclusive resource for running and executing different Ethereum applications and projects.

Sadly, the technical requirements of a fully decentralized dApp browser system were too a long ways past what the technology permitted at that point. Subsequently, the Mist browser project was abandoned, and the product was removed from circulation in March of 2019.

## Understanding the Mist Browser

The Mist browser was an Ethereum interface intended to permit users to access the different dApps available on the Ethereum network. It was otherwise called the Ethereum dApp Browser. Ethereum is a famous [blockchain](/blockchain) optimized for [smart contracts](/smart-contracts) and other decentralized applications.

As a dApp browser, Mist was a standalone application with a graphical UI (GUI) that permitted users to match up to the blockchain. It likewise provided a simple way for users to make their own dApps and deploy tokens and other smart contracts in a non-technical way. The Mist Ethereum [wallet](/blockchain-wallet) itself would run on a client's computer, which implied it must be downloaded, introduced, and run locally.

> The Mist browser was intended to permit users access to decentralized apps available on the Ethereum network, like the way Chrome, Firefox, or Internet Explorer enables users to access websites.

The browser was based on Alphabet's open-source Chromium platform, and a few tasks you could perform with it included:

- Generating client chose smart contracts
- Empowering users to pool tokens, reproducing a trustless, decentralized [crowdfunding](/crowdfunding) arrangement
- Sharing information with a select group of participants

The idea was to permit individuals to "do" things right from the browser by offering instant formats, build setups and customizations, and perform important activities instead of going about as just an app or a web browser. Sadly, the Mist browser ran into several issues that eventually prompted its disappointment.

## Reasons the Mist Browser Failed
### Security

The Mist browser depended on Electron, an open-source project that plans to facilitate the creation of cross-platform applications utilizing JavaScript. Electron, thus, depends on the Chromium open-source browser developed by Google in 2009.

Since Mist was actually two layers from refreshes pushed to Chromium browsers, it was additionally farther away from fixes to Chromium weaknesses that needed essential security patches. The layer among Mist and Chromium (i.e., Electron) was not refreshed as often as possible enough to keep in the know regarding Chromium, leading to an increased potential for assaults or data leakage over the long haul.

> Since Chromium is the structure for Chrome and a proving ground for the official browser, it misses the mark on automatic update mechanism, which compounds security issues for users.

Alex Van de Sande, the lead developer on Mist browser, wrote in a blog entry reporting the deactivation and deprecation of the browser:

>
> We received notice of a couple of intense bugs: ones that would permit an assailant to assume command over your computer (and your crypto keys) by essentially visiting an untrusted website...We delivered a fixed rendition right away, however at that point other comparable assaults were revealed and eventually, our own internal security team recommended that we not permit the client to explore to untrusted websites â€” which is the whole point of a browser.

### Synchronizing Node

One more problem with the browser was the inherent difficulty of the fully decentralized dApp approach, which required users to run a full blockchain node to connect with the Ethereum network.

In its pure form, Mist needed to be continually synchronized to the Ethereum blockchain. That operation required huge measures of hard-circle space, a ton of processing power, and a high-speed association with the Internet. Basically matching up another establishment to the current state of the network might require days, and keeping the node exceptional required 24-hour Internet access and altogether stressed users' equipment.

## Highlights
- Mist was the main browser that permitted users to peruse dApps, and it had an Ethereum wallet underlying. It was likewise the main desktop crypto wallet with a graphical UI (GUI).
- The Mist browser was a decentralized app on the Ethereum network from 2015 to 2019.
- Mist was deprecated in March 2019 after developers decided other browser developers and wallet creators were better able to make products for this rapidly advancing space.
## FAQ
### What Replaced the Mist Browser?
Mist browser was basically a wallet, so it was supplanted by numerous different wallets that permit you to access cryptocurrency, blockchains, dApps, and even trade on a cryptocurrency exchange.
### What Is a Mist Browser?
The Mist browser was an endeavor to develop a graphical UI for the Ethereum blockchain and virtual machine. It was sunsetted in 2019.
### What has been going on with Ethereum Mist?
The Mist browser was too resource intentive to be utilized in practice.
