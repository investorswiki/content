# Distress Sale
## What Is a Distress Sale?

A distress sale — likewise called a distressed sale — happens when a property, [stock](/stock), or other asset must be sold rapidly. Distress sales frequently bring about a financial loss for the seller who, because of reasons of economic duress, must acknowledge a lower price. The proceeds from these assets are most frequently used to pay [debts](/obligation) or medical expenses or for different crises.

## How Distress Sales Work

Mortgage borrowers who can presently not meet the payments for their mortgaged property might opt to sell their property to pay off the mortgage. Instances of circumstances where distress sales happen incorporate divorce, [foreclosures](/foreclosure), and relocations.

A [short sale](/shortsale) by a homeowner can be viewed as a distressed sale. Here, the homeowner is endeavoring to sell their property even however its current market value is below the amount owed to their lender. This can happen in the event that the homeowner is forced to move from the home and can hardly trust that the property's market value will recuperate. The homeowner might have a new position that requires immediate relocation, for instance. A divorce could force a home to be sold to [liquidate](/liquidate) assets that must be split between the parties. A lender normally must consent to a short sale before it can continue on the grounds that such a transaction would eliminate the [collateral](/collateral) that secured the mortgage.

### How a distress sale can lead to a net loss

Assuming that a distress sale is led for a piece of property, for example, a collectible or collectible art, the seller could decide to take offers that are lower than the value of the thing. The seller could request offers by advertising the thing or rather could offer the thing to a pawnbroker.

At the point when the seller of a thing manages a pawnbroker, they will probably receive offers below the value of the thing. The pawnbroker offers low since they plan to resell the thing at a higher cost and make money. Even on the off chance that a thing is appraised at a higher value, a pawnbroker will in any case search for a method for creating a gain.

There are times when potential buyers might exploit the conditions that forced a seller into leading a distress sale. The buyer might know about the seller's immediate need to complete a transaction and receive payment. This could lead to offers that are substantially lower than the value of the property.

## Special Considerations

On the off chance that an asset is sold through a distress sale, the valuation of the asset is considered artificial in light of the fact that it was not sold under true competitive market conditions. On account of real estate, for instance, the sales price can't be utilized as a comparator to lay out the asset's true value.
