# Contingent Credit Default Swap (CCDS)
## What Is a Contingent Credit Default Swap (CCDS)?

A contingent credit default swap (CCDS) is a variety of a customary [credit default swap](/creditdefaultswap) (CDS) where an extra triggering event is required. In a simple CDS, payment under the swap is triggered by a [credit event](/credit-event), like a default on the underlying loan. In this sense, the CDS acts as an insurance policy on the debt investment.

In a contingent credit default swap, the trigger requires **both** a credit event and one more determined event. The predefined event is normally a huge movement in an index covering equities, commodities, interest rates, or another overall measure of the economy or significant industry.

## Understanding Credit Default Swaps (CCDSs)

A contingent credit default swap is closely connected with a CDS in that it gives investors, predominantly financial institutions in this case, a method for decreasing their credit risk and [counterparty risk](/counterpartyrisk) when credit and the risk of default are implied.

Credit default swaps kick in when the reference entity (underlying) misses a payment, documents for [bankruptcy](/bankruptcy), debates the legitimacy of the contract ([repudiation](/repudiation)), or in any case blocks the normal payment of their bond/debt.

Be that as it may, there is a whole opposite side to credit default swaps where they are utilized to guess instead of essentially [hedge](/hedge). This secondary trading gives secondary demand to normal credit default swaps, making the cost of what was initially intended to be insurance on long-dated debt instruments more costly than it very well might be in any case.

## Contingent Credit Default Swap versus Ordinary CDS

A contingent credit default swap is a more vulnerable form of protection than a normal credit default swap. A customary CDS just requires one trigger — the non-payment or another credit event — while the CCDS requires two triggers before payment. Thus, the amount of protection being offered is tied back to a [benchmark](/benchmark). The CCDS is likewise less appealing as a trading tool as a result of its complexity and the lower payout amounts and chances when compared to a traditional CDS. The flip side of this is that a CCDS is a less expensive form of insurance against counterparty risk than a plain vanilla CDS.

The CCDS is targeted to safeguard against default in a specific case and is priced as needs be. A CCDS is a [derivative](/derivative) on a derivative. To receive compensation on a CCDS, the reference credit derivative must be [in-the-money](/inthemoney) (ITM) for the uncovered part, and the other party in the contract needs to experience a credit event. Besides, the protection being offered is [mark-to-market](/marktomarket) and is adjusted consistently. In short, contingent credit default swaps are complex products tailored to a specific need that an investor — generally an institutional investor — has, so the contract itself requires analysis on a case-by-case basis.

## Illustration of How a Contingent Credit Default Swap Works

The value of a CCDS is dependent on two factors: the performance of the underlying loan and exposure to an index or derivative of it.

In a normal CDS, if the [obligator](/obligor) neglects to pay the underlying loan, the seller of the CDS pays the buyer of the CDS the current value of the loan or a contracted amount.

In a CCDS, the value of the payout will vacillate in light of the performance of the underlying loan as well as the perusing of a benchmark or derivative of it. Recall that a CCDS is a derivative of a derivative.

A diminishing in the credit quality of the underlying loan will hypothetically increase the value of the CCDS, however so will an ideal movement in the index or benchmark. For the CCDS buyer to receive a payout, the underlying loan needs to trigger a credit event, like a missed payment for instance, yet the index likewise should be at a certain level (or past).

All things considered, the CCDS has a value contingent upon the probability of the payout happening or not. The price of the CCDS will change and can be traded on the secondary market, with its value in view of the two factors until the underlying loan is paid in full by the obligator or the CCDS triggers a payout.

## Features
- A CCDS is an additional tailored CDS, which makes it more complex and ordinarily should be broke down on a case-by-case basis to figure out which form of CDS fits the situation better.
- Contingent Credit Default Swaps are ordinarily less expensive than an ordinary CDS since the chances of payout are lower.
- A contingent credit default swap (CCDS) is a modified form of a CDS that requires two triggers, regularly a credit event as well as an understanding above or below a certain level on an index/benchmark.
