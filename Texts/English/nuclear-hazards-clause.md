# Nuclear Hazards Clause
## What Is a Nuclear Hazards Clause?

A nuclear hazards clause is property insurance policy language that rejects from coverage any damage brought about by nuclear responses, nuclear radiation, or radioactive tainting. The nuclear hazards clause is intentionally broad to safeguard insurers against paying the exceptionally large claims that could somehow or another outcome from such events, whether they are controlled or accidental, and whether the damage is direct or indirect. Be that as it may, an insurance policy will in any case cover losses from certain generally covered events, for example, [fires](/fire-insurance) or theft, even assuming that those events are brought about by a nuclear event.

## Grasping a Nuclear Hazards Clause

Insurance companies started excluding nuclear events from coverage in the late 1950s. Standard homeowners' insurance policies currently contain a nuclear hazards clause excluding from coverage losses from nuclear events. Commercial do as well and farm property policies, [auto insurance](/collision protection) policies, and inland [marine policies](/esteemed marine-policy), among others. The nuclear hazards clause means that in the event that you discover that your property has radioactive tainting when you go to sell it, you can't file a claim with your homeowner's insurance. You would need to sue the entity that made the tainting recover your losses.

Nuclear hazards are like other major hazards that insurance regularly doesn't cover, like acts of war and terrorism, in that the potential losses are huge to such an extent that insurers can't stand to cover them. Assuming such an event happened and on the off chance that it were covered by insurance, the claims would be enormous to the point that the insurers would leave business. Then again, insurers could endeavor to give coverage to such events, however the [premiums](/premium) would be high to the point that policyholders will most likely be unable to manage the cost of the premium cost.

## Special Considerations

The nuclear hazards exclusion likewise applies to the legal liability coverage that accompanies [property insurance](/property-insurance) policies. Notwithstanding not being covered for property damage related to nuclear acts, policyholders additionally aren't covered for legal liability damages related to nuclear acts. Once more, be that as it may, the fire exclusion applies, so on the off chance that the legal liability claim results from a fire brought about by a nuclear event, the policyholder would be covered, however just for the part of the claim related to the fire, not for the part related to the nuclear event.

This isn't to say a homeowner would have no recourse if, say, a close by nuclear power plant ought to experience a meltdown. The actual plant would carry [liability insurance](/liability_insurance) that would cover homeowners in such an event. The equivalent would hold true on the off chance that say a train or truck carrying nuclear waste toppled. Both the carrier and the entity that sent the material would have insurance to cover such losses.
