# Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT)
## What is the alternative least tax (AMT)?
The alternative least tax, or AMT, is an alternate, yet parallel, method to work out a taxpayer's bill. It applies to individuals whose income surpasses a certain level and is expected to close the escape clauses that permit them to reduce or dispense with their tax payments. It's adjusted every year for inflation.
## How the AMT functions
The AMT has its own set of rates (26 percent and 28 percent) and requires a separate calculation from normal federal income tax. Essentially, it's the difference between your standard tax bill, in view of ordinary income tax rates, and your, not entirely set in stone by finishing IRS Form 6251: Alternative Minimum Tax — Individuals. At the point when there's a difference, you might need to pay the AMT amount notwithstanding your normal tax.
The AMT expands the amount of income that is taxed for high earners. It adds things that are not taxed on the standard tax rates and rejects or reduces numerous common tax breaks utilized by individual taxpayers to bring down their IRS bills.
## AMT exemption amounts for 2020-2021
To be required to pay the AMT, you must have earned more than the base level in the chart below.
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<th>Filing status</th><th>2o21 AMT exemption</th><th>2o20 AMT exemption</th></tr>
</tbody>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Single or head of household</td><td>Up to $73,600</td><td>Up to $72,900</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>Married, filing separately</td><td>Up to $57,300</td><td>Up to $56,700</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>Married, filing jointly</td><td>Up to $114,600</td><td>Up to $113,400</td></tr>
</tbody>
</table>
## Who needs to pay the AMT?
Anybody who surpasses the income levels in the above chart might be subject to the AMT. Be that as it may, arriving at those levels doesn't naturally trigger the AMT. You can complete IRS Form 6251 manually, use tax software programs or hire a professional tax preparer to decide whether you owe the AMT and, provided that this is true, work out the amount you owe.
The IRS has set income levels to figure out which rate you're charged for your AMT. Assuming your income is below the stated level in the chart below, you're taxed at 26 percent. On the off chance that your income is over the stated level, you're taxed at a rate of 28 percent on the excess income.
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<th>Filing status</th><th>2021 AMT tax rate income level</th><th>2020 AMT tax rate income level</th></tr>
</tbody>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Single or head of household</td><td>$199,900</td><td>$197,900</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>Married, filing separately</td><td>$99,950</td><td>$98,950</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>Married, filing jointly</td><td>$199,900</td><td>$197,900</td></tr>
</tbody>
</table>
This means that for a single person who earned more than $73,600 in 2021, however under $199,900, the AMT rate is 26 percent. Assuming that person earned more than $199,900, the AMT tax rate goes up to 28 percent.
The AMT exemption — the amount of income taxpayers can exempt before triggering AMT — ultimately phases out at 25 pennies for every dollar earned whenever income has arrived at the limits in the chart below. All in all, you can at this point not exempt **any** income from the AMT assuming that your income outperforms these levels.
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<th>Filing status</th><th>2021 AMT phaseout threshold</th><th>2020 AMT phaseout threshold</th></tr>
</tbody>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Single or head of household</td><td>$523,600</td><td>$518,400</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>Married, filing separately</td><td>$523,600</td><td>$518,400</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>Married, filing jointly</td><td>$1,047,200</td><td>$1,036,800</td></tr>

## What the AMT can mean for your qualification for tax breaks
With the AMT, a large number of the things you could deduct for your standard taxes never again apply. Under the AMT:
- You don't receive the standard deduction or personal exemptions.
- You can't deduct state and nearby taxes.
- Medical expenses must surpass 7.5 percent of your gross income to be deducted.
- Home equity loan interest is restricted. It must be deducted in the event that the money is utilized exclusively to pay for home improvements.
- Real estate property taxes are prohibited as deductions under the AMT.
- Some tax credits that reduce your normal tax liability don't reduce what you owe under the AMT. When you add back these refused things and run the numbers, you may be subject to a greater IRS bill in the event that your taxable income surpasses the annual AMT exemption amount for your filing status.

Extra tax breaks not permitted under the AMT that influence overwhelmingly high-income individuals are:
- Incentive stock options.
- Immaterial drilling costs.
- Tax-exempt interest from certain private activity bonds.
- Depletion and accelerated depreciation on certain leased personal or real property.

Deciding your financial liability because of the AMT can be muddled. Tax software programs or a tax professional might be the best method for figuring out what you owe. When you complete the current year's tax return, look for the guidance of an accountant or tax professional to track down approaches to possibly reduce your tax liability proceeding.

## Highlights
- It doesn't kick in until income arrives at a certain level. For 2022, it's $118,100 for couples filing jointly.
- In 2012, Congress passed the [American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012](/american-taxpayer-relief-act-2012) that indexed the exemption amount to inflation to keep middle-income taxpayers from encountering bracket creep.
- AMT guarantees that certain taxpayers pay their fair share or possibly the base.
