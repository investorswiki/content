# Spousal IRA
## What Is a Spousal IRA?

A spousal IRA is a strategy that allows a working spouse to add to a [individual retirement account](/ira) (IRA) in the name of a non-working spouse with no income or very little income. This is an exception to the provision that an individual must have earned income to add to an IRA. Notwithstanding, the working spouse's income must equal or surpass the total IRA contributions made on behalf of the two spouses.

Spousal IRAs are just regular Roth or traditional IRAs that are utilized by married couples. They are not joint accounts; each IRA is set up in the name of an individual spouse. For 2021 and 2022, the utilization of a spousal IRA strategy allows couples who are married filing jointly to contribute $12,000 to IRAs each year â€” or $14,000 in the event that they are age 50 or more seasoned due to the [catch-up contribution](/catchupcontribution) provision.

## How a Spousal IRA Works

The couple also must file a joint tax return (married filing jointly) to qualify for spousal IRA contributions. Spousal IRAs can be either traditional or Roth IRAs and are subject to the same annual contribution limits, income limits, and catch-up contribution provisions as [traditional](/traditionalira) and [Roth IRA](/rothira)s. While IRAs cannot be held jointly in the two spouses' names, spouses can share their account distributions in retirement. Spousal IRAs allow couples to accelerate their retirement savings. An added $6,000 each year north of 30 years at a 5% rate of return can add up to above and beyond $400,000 at retirement.

The IRS has broad rules on how IRAs must be structured and specific rules on how spousal IRA strategies can be conveyed. According to the IRS, the amount of your combined contributions cannot be more than the taxable compensation reported on your joint return. See the formula in IRS Publication 590-A. In the event that neither one of the spouses participated in a retirement plan at work, all of their contributions would be deductible.

IRS-approved institutions, including banks, [brokerage companies](/brokerage-company), some credit unions, and federally protected savings and loan associations, offer spousal IRAs, and comparing brokers side-by-side can assist you with finding the one that matches your investing needs.

## Special Considerations

For married couples filing jointly and for who the spouse making the IRA contribution is covered by a workplace retirement plan, the phase-out range is $109,000 to $129,000 for 2022, up from $105,000 to $125,000 for 2021.

For an IRA donor who isn't covered by a workplace retirement plan and is married to somebody who is, the deduction is phased out in the event that the couple's income is somewhere in the range of $204,000 and $214,000 for 2022, up from $198,000 and $208,000 for 2021.

For 2021 and 2022, each half of a couple utilizing a spousal IRA strategy can contribute $6,000, or $7,000 assuming they are age 50 or more established, annually, yet contributions must be made by the tax filing deadline for that tax year.
