# Garnishment
## What Is Garnishment?

Garnishment, or wage garnishment, is when money is legally kept from your paycheck and shipped off another party. It alludes to a legal interaction that educates an outsider to deduct payments directly from a debtor's wage or bank account.

Commonly, the outsider is the debtor's employer and is known as the garnishee. Federal law precludes employers from terminating a worker to try not to handle a garnishment payment. Garnishments are utilized for debts, for example, unpaid taxes, monetary fines, child support payments, and defaulted student loans.

## How Garnishment Works

For a debtor's wage to be decorated, a creditor must commonly get a court order demonstrating that the debtor owes money and has defaulted on payment. On the off chance that the debt is a [Internal Revenue Service (IRS)](/irs) levy, a court order isn't required. For instance, assuming John Smith owes $10,000 in overdue, unpaid taxes, the IRS can resort to embellishing his wages.

The IRS would then direct Smith's employer to transmit a portion of his salary for a certain amount of time until Smith's tax obligation is completely paid. Since garnishments are typically the last resort to collect debts and show a debtor's unfavorable repayment history, they can hurt an individual's credit rating.

## Wage Garnishment

The Consumer Credit Protection Act specifies the amount of income that can be embellished from an individual's wage. The garnishment amount is the lower of the accompanying:

- 25 percent of week after week disposable income assuming that the individual's disposable income is greater than $290.
- Any amount greater than 30 times the week after week the lowest pay permitted by law, which is $217.50 ($7.25 x 30).

Individuals who earn disposable income under $217.50 each week receive no wage garnishment. Individuals who receive a disposable [income](/income) of somewhere in the range of $217.50 and $290 each week can have any amount above $217.50 embellished. For week after week disposable earnings above $290, a maximum of 25% can be embellished.

Disposable income is defined as gross income minus legally required deductions, like federal, state, and nearby taxes and social security deductions.

## Special Considerations

Garnishment limits set by the [Consumer Credit Protection Act](/consumer-credit-protection-act-of-1968) don't make a difference to unpaid tax debt, child support, bankruptcy orders, student loans, or voluntary wage allocations. Federal agencies and federal student loan holders can decorate up to 15% of an individual's wage.

A little over half of wages can be embellished for child support payments in the event that an individual has no different wards to support. Federal and state garnishment limits might vary, in which case the lower garnishment limit applies. If an individual countenances financial hardship due to wage garnishment, they might be eligible to file a claim to reduce the garnishment amount.

## Features
- The Consumer Credit Protection Act sets the limits for what can be decorated from wages, with the exception of unpaid taxes, delinquent child support, bankruptcy orders, defaulted student loans, and voluntary wage tasks.
- A garnishment is an order directing an outsider to hold onto assets, for the most part wages from employment or money in a bank account, to settle an unpaid debt.
- The debtor might be qualified for relief if facing financial hardship.
- The IRS might decorate wages without a court order.
