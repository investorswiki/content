# Fixed Amortization Method
## What Is the Fixed Amortization Method?

The fixed amortization method alludes to one of three different ways by which early retired people of any age gain access to their retirement funds without penalty before turning 59\u00bd under [Rule 72t](/rule72t).

The fixed [amortization](/amortization) method spreads retired people's account balances over their excess life hopes, as estimated by [Internal Revenue Service](/irs) (IRS) tables, at an interest rate not over 120% of the federal [mid-term rate](/applicablefederalrate). The withdrawal amount, with one exception, can't be changed until age 65 whenever it is calculated. Any other way, retired folks must pay a penalty of 10% plus interest each year, beginning with the year distributions started, up until the extended time of the change. Halting account withdrawals likewise prompts punishments.

The two different methods for sans penalty retirement withdrawals are the fixed annuitization method and the [required least distribution](/required distribution) (RMD) method. Note that the RMDs are to be taken after retirement and are not early distributions.

## How the Fixed Amortization Method Works

Rule 72t just becomes possibly the most important factor for the people who plan on resigning before age 60, and financial planners use it decently scantily. A few planners stay away from both the fixed amortization and [fixed annuitization](/fixed-annuitization-method) methods, as they are not flexible, require suspicions that must hold for the overwhelming majority years at times, and, just like the case for Rule 72t, have many rules and limitations.

The fixed amortization method produces higher payments than the required least distribution method at times. In any case, it includes complex computations and runs the risk of not keeping up with [inflation](/inflation) or the pace of rising prices. As its name suggests, the fixed amortization method brings about a payment that is fixed. Such is the case for the fixed annuitization method, too.

Alternately, the required least distribution method is recalculated every year. Of the three, the required least distribution method is easiest, yet it frequently brings about the most minimal annual payment. It likewise generally runs the most reduced risk of premature account depletion, since payments reset lower in the event of a large drawdown.

The main distribution type change the IRS permits without penalty is a one-time move to either the fixed amortization or fixed annuitized methods to the required least distribution method. This is basically for investors that experienced large drawdowns, so they reduce their distributions and make what's left in their account last longer in retirement.

## Illustration of the Fixed Amortization Method

For instance, expect a 53-year-elderly person with an IRA earning 1.5% annually, and a balance of $250,000 wishes to pull out money right on time under rule 72(t). Utilizing the fixed amortization method, the lady gets about $10,042 in yearly payments, in light of the current table. With the base distribution method, she gets $7,962 annually north of a five-year period. Utilizing the fixed annuitization method, be that as it may, her annual payment is about $9,976.
