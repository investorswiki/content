# Gypsy Swap
## What Is a Gypsy Swap?

The term "gypsy swap," however a laid out term, is risky in light of its bigoted suggestions with respect to the Romani public. The term portrays a method by which a company might raise capital without giving extra debt or holding a [secondary](/secondaryoffering) public offering. Here and there, this type of swap is like a [rights offering](/rightsoffering), yet in this case, the restricted party's equity claim doesn't lapse, and the swap is immediately [dilutive](/weakening).

## Understanding a Gypsy Swap

Gypsy swaps are made out of numerous transactions with the ultimate goal of expanding [capital](/capital) for the business. By persuading existing shareholders to trade in [common](/commonstock) shares for [restricted shares](/restrictedstock), the business can then sell the common shares to new investors, hence expanding capital. Generally speaking, gypsy swaps are viewed as final desperate attempts to stay away from cash limitations or bank pledges by participating in some "imaginative" capital-raising.

While gypsy swaps give off an impression of being an indirect approach to making capital, the act normally brings about the company improving the pot for both new and existing shareholders for them to acknowledge the terms of the deal. This means that the company would likely be better off raising capital through traditional channels, if conceivable, since it would be less expensive and more straightforward.

The [Securities and Exchange Commission](/sec) (SEC) will at times consider a gypsy swap as a method for bypassing regulations. For example, Sections 5(a) and 5(c) of the [Securities Act](/uniformsecuritiesact) explain that you can't sell or offer to sell any security without enrolling the security in advance or getting a waiver. The SEC has taken a firm position concerning Section 5, infringement, and gypsy swaps. In the legal case of Zacharias v. SEC, the Court agreed with the SEC's position that both the original shareholder and the purchaser were participants in the transaction and maintained a [disgorgement](/disgorgement) penalty of 100% of the proceeds of the sale.

## How a Gypsy Swap Works

The gypsy swap includes two principal transactions. Initial, a group of existing shareholders is persuaded to exchange [common stock](/commonstock) for restricted shares from the responsible company so the company gets the common shares to their treasury. In monetary terms, these shareholders break even; they don't gain or lose from the transaction itself, despite the fact that there might be some tax results relying upon the situation.

Second, the company sells the common stock that they've received to new investors at a price that might be higher or lower than the current [market price](/market-price), getting cash in return. The company effectively raised extra capital and the new investors become [equity](/equity) holders in the responsible company while the principal set of investors keeps a position in the restricted stock.

A gypsy swap is viewed as a last-ditch financing option in light of the fact that the new investors quite often demand a mix of below-market value price or special consideration from the deal. In fact, in the event that the responsible company could raise funding traditionally — inside from the equity markets or the debt markets — it positively would decide to do as such.
