# Value Averaging
## What Is Value Averaging?

Value averaging (VA) is an investing strategy that works like [dollar-cost averaging](/dollarcostaveraging) (DCA) in terms of making consistent month to month contributions however contrasts in its approach to the amount of every month to month contribution. In value averaging, the investor sets a target growth rate or an amount of their asset base or portfolio every month and afterward changes the next month's contribution as per the relative gain or [shortfall](/shortfall) made on the original asset base.

Consequently, rather than investing a set amount every period, a VA strategy makes investments based on the total size of the portfolio at every interval.

## Understanding Value Averaging

The fundamental goal of value averaging (VA) is to procure more shares when prices are falling and less shares when prices are rising. This occurs in dollar-cost averaging also, yet the effect is less articulated. Several independent studies have shown that over long term periods, value averaging can deliver somewhat better returns than dollar-cost averaging, albeit both will closely look like market returns over a similar period.

In dollar-cost averaging (DCA), investors generally make a similar periodic investment. The possibly reason they buy more shares when prices are lower is that the shares cost less. Interestingly, utilizing value averaging, investors buy more shares since prices are lower, and the strategy guarantees that the bulk of investments is spent on securing shares at lower prices.

The explanation value averaging might be pretty much alluring to an investor than utilizing a set contribution schedule is that you are to some degree protected from overpaying for stock when the market is hot. On the off chance that you abstain from overpaying, your long-term returns will be more grounded compared to individuals who invested set amounts regardless of the market condition.

## Illustration of Value Averaging

For the model above, assume the goal is for the portfolio to increase by $1,000 each quarter. On the off chance that in a quarter's time, the assets have developed to $1,250 (based on the 100 shares in Q1 duplicated by Q2 price of $12.50), the investor will fund the account with $750 ($2,000 - $1250) worth of assets. Q2 purchase of $750 partitioned by a share price of $12.50 will buy 60 extra shares, carrying the total to 160 shares. 160 shares x $12.50=$2,000 value for Q2.

In the accompanying quarter, the goal is have account holdings of $3,000. This pattern keeps on being rehashed in the accompanying quarter, etc.

## Difficulties to Value Averaging

The greatest possible test with value averaging is that as an investor's asset base develops, the ability to fund shortfalls can turn out to be too large to keep up with. This is particularly noteworthy in retirement plans, where an investor probably won't even can possibly fund a shortfall given limits on annual contributions.

One strategy for getting around this problem is to dispense a portion of assets to a [fixed-income](/fixedincome) fund or funds, then turn money all through equity holdings as directed by the month to month targeted return. Along these lines, rather than apportioning cash as new funding, cash can be brought up in the fixed income portion and allocated in higher amounts to equity holdings depending on the situation.

One more likely problem with the VA [strategy](/investmentstrategy) is that in a down market an investor could really run out of money, making the larger required investments unthinkable before things pivot. This problem can be enhanced after the portfolio has developed larger when [drawdown](/drawdown) in the account could require substantially larger amounts of capital to stick with the VA strategy.

## Features
- In value averaging, one would invest more when the price or portfolio value falls and less when it rises.
- Value averaging is an investment strategy that includes making standard contributions to a portfolio over the long run.
- Value averaging includes ascertaining predetermined amounts for the total value of the investment in later periods, then making an investment estimated to match these amounts at every future period.
