# Generally Accepted Principles And Practices (GAPP)
## Definition of Generally Accepted Principles And Practices (GAPP)

The generally accepted principles and practices (GAPP), which are otherwise called the Santiago principles, are normalized business procedures connected with the operation of [sovereign wealth funds](/sovereign_wealth_fund) (SWFs), which have agreed to seek after financial as opposed to political plans and keep a stable global financial system.

## Seeing Generally Accepted Principles And Practices (GAPP)

The generally accepted principles and practices (GAPP), were agreed upon by the International Working Group of the Sovereign Wealth Funds (IWG) — 23 countries with SWFs — in October 2008. In response to the concern of [investors](/investor) and regulators about the inadequate transparency, independence, and governance of the industry, the IWG settled that SWFs exhibit that their arrangements are appropriately set up and investments are made on an economic and financial basis — rather than seeking after political plans.

GAPP is supported by the accompanying directing objectives for SWFs, defined as "particular purpose investment funds or arrangements, owned by the overall government":

1. To assist with keeping a stable global financial system and free flow of capital and investment;
1. To agree with all applicable regulatory and disclosure requirements in the countries in which they invest;
1. To invest on the basis of economic and financial risk and return-related contemplations; and
1. To have in place a transparent and sound governance structure that accommodates adequate operational controls, [risk management](/riskmanagement), and accountability."

The 24 voluntary Santiago Principles essentially give a structure to these core values in three key areas: legal, institutional, and investment and risk. The principles are kept up with and advanced by the International Forum of Sovereign Wealth Funds (IFSWF), whose individuals willfully embrace the principles and try to carry out them in their governance and investment rehearses. Starting around 2021, the forum addressed in excess of 30 sovereign wealth funds from all sides of the globe.
