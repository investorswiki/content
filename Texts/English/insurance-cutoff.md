## What Is an Insurance Cutoff?

An insurance cutoff is a [reinsurance](/reinsurance) contract provision that forestalls the [reinsurer](/reinsurer) from being responsible for claims after the contract termination date. An insurance cutoff, likewise called a cutoff cancellation, characterizes how long the reinsurer will have financial obligations from insurance policies that were in force while the reinsurance contract was in effect.

Reinsurance contracts frequently have a termination provision remembered for the contract language to characterize when the financial obligations of the reinsurer end. This provision is an important feature since certain claims, like those connected with personal injury, may occur a long time after the reinsurance contract has expired.

## How an Insurance Cutoff Works

Regularly, when one of the gatherings to a reinsurance agreement chooses to cease the arrangement, they must give a provisional notice of cancellation to the counterparty to the agreement.

Otherwise called a cutoff cancellation, the insurance cutoff language in the contract will determine how much longer the reinsurer keeps on having financial obligations to the insured. This language becomes important when there is a potential for a claim connected with personal injury, which can generally happen well after a reinsurance contract lapses.

The contract might indicate that the reinsurer's liability is limited to the natural expiration of the ceded policy, implying that the reinsurer isn't responsible for liabilities after the policy is recharged.
