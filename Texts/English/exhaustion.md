# Exhaustion
## What Is Exhaustion?

Exhaustion is a situation where a majority of participants trading in a similar asset are either long or short, which passes on couple of investors to take the opposite side of the transaction when participants wish to [close](/closeposition) their positions. For instance, in the event that everybody has previously bought, when those individuals need to sell, there will be no more buyers to sell. This will make the price fall.

Exhaustion frequently signals the [reversal](/reversal) of a current trend since it represents excess levels of supply or demand, showing a market is either [overbought](/overbought) or [oversold](/oversold).

## Figuring out Exhaustion

Exhaustion infers a state or condition that is hard to fight: Surrender to the inevitable is inescapable. The equivalent goes for exhaustion in the [financial markets](/financial-market), which depends on auctions.

At an auction, there are [bidders](/bidder) and [sellers](/seller). The former are bidding on an asset or security to buy, and the last option is offering a price for buyers. At the point when there are more aggressive buyers than sellers, the price goes up. In like manner, when there are more aggressive sellers, the price goes down.

A trend is exhausted when the price of the asset or security has moved too far in one bearing. This might happen when the number of buyers in the auction diminishes and sellers begin to dominate. Exhaustion is reached when the asset or security doesn't have the support from buyers or sellers to keep moving either up or down.

## Distinguishing Exhaustion

Traders can recognize periods of exhaustion by taking a gander at the [Commitments of Traders Report](/bed). This report is distributed consistently and shows position levels in the futures markets.

An excessively high number of long contracts could show that every individual who wishes to be long has proactively taken a position, passing on couple of investors to keep buying the asset at current prices (let alone higher prices). On the off chance that there is possible nobody left to buy, sellers will begin turning out to be more aggressive to escape long positions or get [short](/short).

[Blow-off tops](/blowofftop) are an extreme illustration of exhaustion. The price has been rising aggressively on expanding volume. In any case, eventually, the sellers overpower the buyers, the buyers transform into sellers, and the price falls emphatically.

Exhaustion on a small scale happens on each price wave. The price goes up or down — and afterward has a [pullback](/pullback). It happens on one-minute charts with small trend reversals and pullbacks, and it happens on longer-term week after week and month to month charts concerning large trends.

Technical traders view uptrends as a series of rising [swing lows](/swinglow) and [swing highs](/swinghigh). Lower swing lows and lower swing highs show the uptrend could be in a tough situation and a reversal might be in progress. A [downtrend](/downtrend) is a series of lower swing lows and lower swing highs. Higher swing lows and higher swing highs could show a reversal to the upside.

> Exhaustion can't be recognized by just taking a gander at a price chart. Traders focus on different metrics, like volume and the [Relative Strength Index](/rsi), to affirm whether a market is finished or under-sold.

<!--25A5788E4D2A821A55BD5E43BDD26F5C-->
The price then, at that point, drops below the trendline and furthermore made a lower swing low, followed by a lower swing high. The reversal has begun and the price keeps on dropping as sellers overpower any buyers that are remaining.

[Volume](/volume) dropped through a significant part of the rise, showing that there was less and less interest at the increasingly high prices. This was a warning indication of forthcoming exhaustion; normally, volume assist with affirming price moves — rising prices are joined by rising volume on the climbs.

Excessive volume can likewise show a looming reversal on the grounds that the monstrous volume spike ordinarily means every individual who wanted to buy had the option to buy. This scenario is more normal in blow-off tops. The Nvidia case was not a blow-off top, rather it was a consistent uptrend that dynamically had less interest. At the point when sellers began to turn out to be more aggressive, there were insufficient buyers to support the price, even as the price got less expensive and less expensive.
