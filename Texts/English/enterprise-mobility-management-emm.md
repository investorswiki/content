# Enterprise Mobility Management (EMM)
## What Is Enterprise Mobility Management (EMM)?

Enterprise Mobility Management (EMM) is the distribution, organization, and control of mobile gadgets like cell telephones, cell phones, tablets, and workstations, utilized in enterprise mobility.

EMM is important on the grounds that it gives companies more control over and safeguards enterprise data by overseeing how mobile gadgets connect with the enterprise infrastructure. Pundits, in any case, voice concern over companies' ability to follow the location and non-work activities of their employees.

## Grasping Enterprise Mobility Management (EMM)

Enterprise mobility management emerged from mobile gadget management (MDM), which centers around the control and security of individual gadgets. Microsoft's 2015 Windows 10 permitted most EMM software suppliers to venture into brought together endpoint management (UEM), which permits data technology offices to oversee personal PCs and mobile gadgets through a single control center.

Enterprise mobility management is imperative for companies that need to make preparations for [data security and privacy breaches](/data-break), especially with the risk of employees losing their mobile gadgets or falling casualty to theft. EMM guarantees that the mobile gadgets utilized by employees are sufficiently secure to safeguard the organization's data and private data.

This security can be accomplished by restricting which employees or gadgets can access specific data by requiring a virtual private network (VPN) or secure [HTTPS](/encryption) associations, commanding [two-factor authentication](/twofactor-authentication-2fa) (2FA), by limiting the ability to download certain applications or visit certain sites, or potentially by secret key safeguarding the gadgets including utilizing fingerprints or other [biometrics](/biometrics).

As well as addressing security concerns, EMM software can likewise assist with expanding employee productivity since IT divisions can give them the applications and data they need to perform business related tasks on mobile gadgets.

## Special Considerations

Today, EMM ordinarily includes a blend of MDM, mobile application management (MAM), mobile substance management (MCM), and identity and access management. MDM is the base of EMM in light of the fact that it depends on the combination of an agent app, which is introduced on an endpoint gadget, and server software running in the corporate data center or the cloud.

Administrators utilize the MDM server's management console as its headquarters to set policies and settings, and the agent upholds these policies and arranges these settings by coordinating with [APIs](/application-programming-interface) incorporated into mobile operating systems.

MAM permits [administrators](/overseer) to set policies for specific application families, as opposed to for the whole gadget. With MCM, just approved applications can access or send corporate data. What's more, identity and access management control how, when, and where workers might utilize corporate apps and data.

These advancements all address specific concerns, and the overlap between MDM, MAM, and MCM is very negligible. As additional organizations embraced enterprise mobility, merchants began to design products established in EMM, for the most part by adding MAM or MCM highlights to their MDM products. An enterprise app store or another self-administration portal for application delivery and sending is likewise a common part of EMM software.

## Features
- EMM additionally supports productivity as need might have arisen to perform work duties can be supplied on employees' mobile gadgets.
- EMM outgrew mobile gadget management (MDM) and incorporates parts of MDM, mobile substance management (MCM), and identity access management.
- Enterprise Mobility Management (EMM) incorporates the distribution and management by organizations of mobile telephones and tablets utilized by their employees to defend data privacy and forestall security breaks.
