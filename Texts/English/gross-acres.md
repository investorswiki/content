Investors in these companies would consider the gross and net acres while evaluating the company's risk profile and management effectiveness. For instance, if company A has far greater net acres in its overall portfolio regardless of generating comparable profits as its rivals, then, at that point, investors in company A may feel that its management is inefficient at using its invested [capital](/capital).

Additionally, assuming company B's portfolio of projects is disproportionately situated in countries with politically unpredictable conditions, then, at that point, investors in company B might feel they are not being satisfactorily compensated for the company's uplifted risks.
