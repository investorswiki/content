# Disability Insurance Trust Fund (DI)
## What Is the Disability Insurance Trust Fund (DI)?

The Disability Insurance Trust Fund (DI) is the more modest of two funds inside the [Social Security Trust Fund](/social-security-trust-fund), laid out as part of the Social Security Act Amendments of 1956. The [Old-Age and Survivors Insurance Trust Fund](/old-age-and-survivors-insurance-trust-fund) (OASI) is the subsequent fund.

The Disability Fund pays Social Security benefits to the people who are intellectually or physically unequipped for gainful employment. Spouses and children of beneficiaries may likewise receive benefits.

## Understanding the Disability Insurance Trust Fund (DI)

The Disability Insurance Trust Fund (DI) gathers deposits from the [Federal Insurance Contributions Act](/fica) (FICA) tax and the [Self Employed Contributions Act](/seca) (SECA) tax.

FICA is a derivation from the checks of employees which matches the contribution from employers to fund the Social Security Trust Fund. SECA payments are from self-employed business owners, who pay both the employee and employer sums — in light of their net earnings — into the Fund. The Disability Insurance Trust Fund (DI) further funds itself as it utilizes surplus revenues to purchase interest-bearing [government securities](/governmentsecurity), which it holds in the Trust. These equivalent taxes help to fund the Old-Age and Survivors Insurance Trust Fund (OASI).

Neither Congress nor the President can utilize the Trust Funds' receipts and disbursements toward the [federal budget](/federal-budget). This restriction is known as a special budgetary status. As the funds fund-raise from dedicated taxes, there is a fiscal firewall between Social Security funds and federal spending. Notwithstanding, surplus revenue does ultimately make as its would prefer into federal coffers as the Trust purchases interest-bearing government securities.

A six-part board of trustees manages the Disability Insurance Trust Fund (DI). The Secretary of the Treasury, Labor, Health and Human Services, and the Commissioner of Social Security fill four seats. The president fills the other two spots with Senate-affirmed arrangements. The named trustees serve four-year terms. The six-part board releases annual reports through the Office of the Chief Actuary, which distributes the financial status of the Social Security program. The [Social Security Administration](/ssa) (SSA) surveys its finances consistently and can modify payouts and qualification requirements.

A most loved method for estimating the strength of the Disability Insurance Trust Fund (DI) is regarding the year when it would debilitate reserves, given the current trends. For instance, in 2020, Social Security trustees projected the trust fund to stay dissolvable until 2065. That is a significant improvement over the forecast in 2015 when the White House cautioned that insolvency was up and coming.

### The most effective method to Apply for Benefits From the Disability Insurance Trust Fund (DI)

Individuals might apply for Retirement, Medicare, and Disability benefits for them as well as their spouse and children either at their nearby Social Security office or online. Further, candidates might call the office at 1-800-772-1213 (TTY 1-800-325-0778). Candidates must have a medical condition that meets the Social Security disability definition and have met work requirements.

For instance, qualifying for disability benefits requires a certain number of work credits. Workers earn credits every year that they earn wages and make good on FICA taxes. Credits are necessary for somebody to receive Social Security Disability, Retirement, and Medicare benefits. Workers might get a maximum of four credits assigned every year and must earn a base add up to earn a credit.

Different acclimations to payments and qualification come as cost-of-living estimations, changing the income thresholds for [substantial gainful activity](/substantialgainfulactivity) (SGA) and trial work period (TWP), the two of which influence qualification.
