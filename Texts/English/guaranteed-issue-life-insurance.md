## What Is Guaranteed Issue Life Insurance?

Guaranteed issue life insurance, or guaranteed acceptance life insurance, is a type of [whole life insurance](/wholelife) policy that doesn't expect you to respond to wellbeing questions, go through a medical exam, or permit an insurance company to survey your medical and remedy records. You may likewise see it alluded to as "no inquiries life insurance" or "no inquiries last expense insurance."

Sounds great, right? Here is the trick. Guaranteed issue life insurance generally has a waiting period. Assuming you pass on during the waiting period, your beneficiaries won't receive the policy's [death benefit](/deathbenefit). With most policies the waiting period is two years. With some it's three.

This isn't a scam of some sort. As a matter of fact, on the off chance that you kick the bucket during the waiting period, the insurance company will repay (to your beneficiaries) all your insurance premiums plus interest, as a rule at a rate of 10%.

Your beneficiaries will in any case get something; it will just be short of what you'd like. Insurance companies put this waiting period in place on the grounds that, in the event that they didn't, everybody could apply for insurance on their deathbed and pay two or three hundred dollars to secure a $25,000 benefit for their family.

"They make a large portion of their money by means of investments." Life insurance premiums are fundamentally similar to sans interest loans to the insurance company, says Martin. The company invests that money.

Insurance companies invest in stocks, mortgages, real estate, derivatives, and different assets.

"For guaranteed issue, they truly do lose money on clients who bite the dust in the initial two years," says Martin. It requires five years for the insurance company to break even on this type of insurance, and it's a shared benefit for the insured much of the time. "The main time the insured wouldn't win out over the competition would be assuming they live long enough where their premiums surpass the policy," he proceeds.

This means they pay premiums for a couple of years, then, at that point, stop and lose their coverage. Assuming they have any type of whole life insurance, they will receive their policy's cash surrender value, however that sum will be substantially less than the premiums they paid in or the death benefit their heirs would have received. Life insurance companies paid out $339.6 billion on surrendered policies in 2019.
