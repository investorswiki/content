# Attachment
## What Is Attachment?

Attachment is a legal cycle alluding to the action of seizing [property](/property) in anticipation of a good ruling for an offended party who claims to be owed money by the respondent.

At the request of a creditor, a court of law might transfer specific property owned by the debtor to the creditor (or sell the property for the benefit of the creditor).

## Figuring out Attachment

Attachment is a preliminary strategy. The property is held onto before a last ruling is delivered. The seizure might demonstrate outlandish assuming that the court rules for the litigant. Attachment might be utilized as a form of provisional solution for the offended party.

Intermittently real estate, vehicles, and bank accounts are held onto under these conditions. A judge will hold onto such property whenever there is a decent chance that the offended party will win the case and a high likelihood that the litigant will escape and not pay a court-ordered settlement.

For instance, a judge might order the bank assets of a respondent to be seized to keep them from transferring them to [offshore](/offshore) accounts or block different endeavors to move ownership of property outside of the court's jurisdiction. A litigant could try to sell their property to keep an offended party from claiming it in court.

Attachments become possibly the most important factor in different types of common cases. Combative divorce procedures might raise worries that one party might look to eliminate their assets from the court's authority. Litigants blamed for [fraud](/fraud) could endeavor to transfer ownership or control of their assets to leave offended parties without any means of finding relief.

The utilization of attachment originated as a means to constrain a litigant to show up in court and reply for the charges brought against them. The methodology has since been expanded to offer a provisional solution for offended parties and as a jurisdictional predicate. A court might utilize attachment to hold onto property, for example, real estate or vehicles, in view of such reasons as the litigant carrying on with work in the state, the respondent being a resident of the state, or the commission of wrongful acts in the state.

Attachment actually requires a conference and different procedures to be followed before the assets or property might be held onto by the court. The authority of the court could likewise be obliged on the off chance that real estate or other property in the state is the main legal association the respondent has to the state where the case will be heard. The court, under such conditions, could grant the offended party an award up to the value of the property that is in the state.

On the off chance that the attachment demonstrates to have been pointless, the court must pay the litigant a bond to cover any damages the seizure caused.
