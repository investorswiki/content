# Collaborative Consumption
## What Is Collaborative Consumption?

Collaborative consumption is the shared utilization of a decent or service by a group. Though with normal consumption an individual pays the full cost of a decent and keeps up with exclusive access to it, with collaborative consumption various individuals approach a decent and bear its cost. A common model is ridesharing, by which numerous individuals approach transportation and pay for it, in addition to the owner of the vehicle.

## How Collaborative Consumption Works

Collaborative consumption is a form of sharing. Peer-to-peer renting, for instance, has been involved by societies for millennia and furnish a group of individuals with a [asset](/asset) without requiring every person to purchase it on their own. It permits consumers to acquire resources that they need, while likewise permitting them to give resources that others need and are not being fully used.

Collaborative consumption is viewed as part of the [sharing economy](/sharing-economy) since it means that individuals rent out their underused assets. This approach is probably going to be utilized when both the price of a particular asset, like a vehicle, is high and the asset isn't used consistently by one person. By renting out an asset when it isn't being utilized, its owner transforms the asset into a kind of commodity. This makes a scenario where physical items are treated as services.

For instance, Airbnb made an online platform that lets owners of homes, apartments, and different abodes lease or rent out their space to other people. This may be finished for residences that the owner just possesses part-time or during periods they expect to be away for a significant time frame. Individual renters probably won't have the option to bear the cost of such a residence themselves, however by isolating the costs across different renters who consume the space at separate times, the residence becomes affordable.

## Special Considerations: Legalities

Pundits of collaborative consumption contend that the informal idea of such arrangements permits individuals to sidestep neighborhood [regulations](/managed market) that organizations offering comparable services must follow. These organizations might need to pay licensing or other regulatory-related fees to legally operate. Those fees make their services more costly than those given by individuals who don't pay such fees.

Traditional inns have tested the legality of Airbnb rentals, for instance, since those owners regularly don't need to stick to regulatory requirements of running an inn or pay the associated operating costs. This outcry prompted efforts to manage or crackdown on rental operations like Airbnb.

Comparable legal difficulties emerged around ride-sharing services like Uber and Lyft. The operators of taxi companies and limousine services battle that offering ride-sharing services was an illegal form of competition. The operations of Uber, for instance, were blocked or limited in certain urban areas where nearby specialists looked with require the company to comply to the very regulations that taxi and limousine services submit to.
