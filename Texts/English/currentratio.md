## What Is the Current Ratio and How Is It Interpreted?
The current ratio is one of the most famous liquidity metrics utilized by investors and analysts to determine how likely a company is to have the option to cover its debts and payments in the short term. It is basically the same as the [quick ratio](/quickratio), however it incorporates **all** current assets in its calculation rather than just the **most liquid**.
Since the current ratio compares short-term [assets](/assets) straightforwardly to short-term [liabilities](/liabilities), a ratio of at least 1 demonstrates that a company would have the option to cover its short-term liabilities utilizing assets that are all planned to be transformed into cash inside the next year or somewhere in the vicinity. A ratio of under 1, then again, can demonstrate that a company may not be very sufficiently dissolvable to cover its forthcoming debts were all they all to come due immediately.
It's important to keep as a primary concern that the current ratio is a snapshot of a moment in time, so it can change quickly as accounts like payables and receivables vary in balance, so it ought to constantly be believed tentatively.
On the off chance that short-term liabilities surpass short-term assets just barely, a company might in any case be in fine shape. In the event that a company's ratio waits fundamentally below 1 for quite a while, notwithstanding, this might demonstrate a problem with the business' short-term solvency.
## How Is the Current Ratio Calculated?
The current ratio is calculated by separating the value of a company's current assets (those liable to be changed over completely to cash or paid out in the span of a year) by the value of its current liabilities (those approaching due soon)
Ordinarily, current assets incorporate cash, cash equivalents, marketable securities, and other miscellaneous liquid assets; while current liabilities generally incorporate impending tax payments, accounts payable, notes payable, and other short-term debts (if coming due soon).
### Current Ratio Formula
> CR = Current Assets/Current Liabilities

## Current Ratio Example: Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL)
We should calculate Apple's current ratio as of March 27th, 2021. To calculate the current ratio, we'll remember all current assets for the numerator. These figures can be found on Apple's financial filings from that date. The figures below are in large number of dollars.
> **Current assets:** $121,465
>
> **Current liabilities:** $106,385

> CR = Liquid Assets/Current Liabilities
>
> CR = $121,465/$106,385
>
> CR = 1.14

All since the ratio emerged over 1, it seems as though Apple was well-positioned to cover its impending liabilities actually March 2021.
## Current Ratio versus Quick Ratio: What's the Difference?
The current and quick ratios are very comparable. Both compare a company's current assets to its current liabilities. That being said, the current ratio incorporates **all** current assets, though the quick ratio just incorporates **the most liquid** among them.
Since assets feature in the numerator of the two ratios however the current ratio incorporates more total assets (and the ratios have a similar denominator), a company's current ratio ought to continuously be higher than its quick ratio.

## What Is a Good Current Ratio?
A current ratio over 1 is great since it demonstrates that a company is well-positioned to cover its impending payments utilizing its all current assets. That being said, a current ratio too high over one (e.g., 2.9) could demonstrate that a company isn't taking full advantage of its current assets by utilizing them to invest in expansion, development, hiring, or different practices that could assist with developing the value of the business over the long haul.
Preferably, a company ought to have an adequate number of current assets to offset its current liabilities by a reasonable margin, however not such countless that they are grieving in accounts as opposed to being reinvested in growth or operations.
## What Are the Limitations of the Current Ratio?
While the current ratio offers investors a helpful method for looking at the short-term liquidity of different companies they are thinking about investing in, it doesn't necessarily in all cases give an accurate image of each and every company's true current liquidity.
The current ratio expects, for instance, that inventory will constantly be transformed into cash soon. This might be true for some companies, yet in certain industries and circumstances, inventory isn't that liquid all the time. Since the quick ratio does exclude inventory in its calculation, it could be a better liquidity indicator in certain circumstances.
Essentially, not all companies have stable sales throughout the span of every year. A few businesses bring in money seasonally, so their ratios would be inflated during high-sales periods and deflated during the slow time of year.
Further, various industries have altogether different liquidity standards, so looking at the liquidity ratio of tech company to that of an organic product company may not give meaningful knowledge into how liquid each company is inside its market segment. Liquidity metrics like the quick and current ratios are most helpful in contrasting companies of somewhat comparative size inside a molecule industry.
