The ex-dividend date is typically set for two business days prior to the record date, due to the T+3 system of settlement utilized in U.S. financial markets. To put it all the more evidently, on the off chance that you buy a share one day before the ex-dividend date your name will show up on the record date, making you eligible to receive the dividend payment. On the off chance that you buy a share on the ex-dividend date or after, you won't receive the dividend for that period.
