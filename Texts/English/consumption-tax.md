# Consumption Tax
## What Is a Consumption Tax?

A consumption tax is a tax on the purchase of a decent or service. Consumption taxes can appear as sales taxes, tariffs, excise, and different taxes on consumed goods and services.

A consumption tax can likewise allude to a taxing system as a whole where individuals are taxed in view of the amount they consume as opposed to the amount they add to the economy (income tax).

## Understanding a Consumption Tax

Instances of consumption taxes incorporate retail sales taxes, excise taxes, value-added taxes, [use taxes](/use-tax), taxes on [gross business receipts](/gross-receipts), and import duties. These taxes are borne by consumers who pay a higher retail price for a long term benefit or service.

The higher price incorporates the consumption tax, which is collected by the vendor and transmitted to the proper federal, state, or neighborhood government. Consumption taxes are frequently demanded at various rates on various commodities as indicated by perceptions of whether a commodity is viewed as a necessity (like food) or a luxury (like jewelry).

The consumption tax is certainly not a groundbreaking thought. The U.S. government utilized a consumption tax for a lot of its history before supplanting it with a [income tax](/incometax). The Bush administration backed a rendition of this, albeit the proposal was crushed. The proposal called for the United States to shift from a fundamentally [progressive income tax](/progressivetax) system to a national tax system that uses consumption taxes only.

Preferably, an appropriately planned consumption tax system would reward savers and punish spenders. While the U.S. doesn't have a national consumption tax, numerous countries in the world have forced some form of a national consumption tax.

Japan, for instance, added a 3% consumption tax to its income tax in 1989. The Japanese Consumption Tax (JCT) rose to 5% in 1997. In 2012, a two-section tax increase to double the tax raised it first to 8% in April 2014. It was initially scheduled to rise to 10% in October 2015, yet two defers pushed it to October 2019. There are exemptions that incorporate food, papers, and a few other daily things to keep the consumption tax at 8% for those things.

## Types of Consumption Taxes
### Value-Added Tax

Most European countries and Canada have a consumption tax system as VATs, or [value-added taxes](/valueaddedtax). In Canada, the VAT is alluded to as a [goods and services tax (GST)](/gst) in certain territories, and a [harmonized sales tax (HST)](/harmonized-sales-tax) in others.

A VAT is a tax on the difference between what a producer pays for raw materials and labor and what the producer charges for completed goods. Consequently this consumption tax is exacted on the "value added" to goods and services from the production stage to the last consumption stage.

### Excise Tax

A [excise tax](/excisetax) is a sales tax that applies to a specific class of goods, commonly liquor, tobacco, gas, or the travel industry. Some excise taxes are charged to deter a behavior or purchase of certain goods that are believed to be negative to the economy. These excise taxes are all the more generally known as [sin taxes](/sin_tax). Other excise taxes are applied to individuals who benefit from a program or infrastructure. For instance, taxes on fuel are collected from drivers to keep up with streets, parkways, and scaffolds.

### Import Duties

[Import duties](/import-obligation) are taxes demanded on an importer for goods entering the country. The taxes are given by the importer to conclusive consumers through higher costs. The amount of this consumption tax payable differs extraordinarily relying upon the imported great, the country of beginning, and several different factors. Import duties can be calculated as a percentage of the value of the goods being imported, or in light of the quantity, weight, or volume of the goods being imported.

### Retail Sales Tax

The sales tax is normally [ad valorem](/advaloremtax), that is, it is calculated by applying a percentage rate to the taxable price of a sale. In spite of the fact that there is a sales tax in the U.S., it is a form of state tax, not a federal tax. Also, state sales taxes exempt a wide range of spending, like food, wellbeing, and housing. Countries that have carried out the sales tax as a federal consumption tax, tax practically all consumption.

## Consumption Tax versus Income Tax

A consumption tax is charged to individuals when they spend money. An income tax is demanded on individuals when they earn money or when they receive interest, [dividends](/profit), or [capital gains](/capitalgain) from their investments.

Defenders of a consumption tax contend that it supports saving and investment and makes the economy more efficient, while income taxation punishes savers and rewards spenders. Accordingly, they contend that not out of the question individuals are taxed on what they remove from the limited resource pool through consumption, instead of what they add to the pool using their income.

Then again, rivals keep up with that a consumption tax adversely influences the poor who, by necessity, spend a greater amount of their income. They state that since a consumption tax is a form of a [regressive tax](/regressivetax), the well off population consumes a more modest part of their income than do poorer families.
