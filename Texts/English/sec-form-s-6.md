# SEC Form S-6
## What Is SEC Form S-6?

SEC Form S-6 is an initial registration statement documented with the U.S. [Securities and Exchange Commission](/sec) (SEC), which unit investment trusts (UITs) use to register securities they issue.

A unit investment trust is a type of [investment company](/investmentcompany) that offers a fixed portfolio, generally of stocks and bonds, as redeemable units to investors for a specific period. It is designed to provide [capital appreciation](/capitalappreciation) or potentially dividend income for investors. Dissimilar to mutual funds, UITs have a stated expiration date based on what investments are held in their portfolio, and when the portfolio terminates, investors receive their pro-rata portion of the UIT's net assets.

## Understanding SEC Form S-6

SEC Form S-6 is also known as the Registration Statement under the Securities Exchange Act of 1933 for [unit investment trusts](/uit) (UITs). (Form N-8B-2 is for UITs registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940.) Since unit investment trusts offer a fixed portfolio to investors, regularly including the standard stocks and bonds for a specific period, all securities must be registered for the SEC to have a complete outline of the investment and securities basket.

The [Securities Exchange Act of 1933](/securitiesact1933), "reality in securities" law, requires that these registration forms disclose important endless supply of a company's securities. SEC Form S-6 helps the SEC accomplish the objectives of this act by expecting that investors receive relevant information in regards to securities offered and to prohibit fraud in the sale of the offered securities. In this manner, the S-6 is likened to the prospectus that is required by mutual fund companies.

The five-page form is accessible on the SEC website, and the Securities and Exchange Commission maintains a comprehensive list of all recent securities registered by these UITs. In the one month of December 2020, 130 SEC Form S-6s were documented. These incorporated numerous entries by Fitzgerald Marketing and Communications, Invesco Unit Trusts, Guggenheim Defined Portfolios, and other unit investment trusts.
