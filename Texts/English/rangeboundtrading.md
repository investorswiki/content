# Range-Bound Trading
## What Is Range-Bound Trading?

Subsequent to finding major support and resistance levels and interfacing them with horizontal [trendlines](/trendline), a trader can buy a security at the lower trendline support (lower part of the channel) and sell it at the upper trendline resistance (top of the channel).

## Understanding Range-Bound Trading

Range-bound trading strategies include interfacing reaction highs and lows with horizontal trendlines to recognize areas of [support](/support) and [resistance](/resistance). The strength, or unwavering quality, of the trendline as an area of support or resistance relies upon the number of times the price has responded to it. For instance, in the event that the price has gotten lower off of the resistance trendline five or four times, it's viewed as more dependable than if the price just moved off of it two times.

A [trading range](/tradingrange) happens when a security trades between steady high and low prices for a while. The highest point of a security's trading range frequently gives price resistance, while the lower part of the trading range commonly offers price support.

Most traders place [stop-loss](/stop-lossorder) points just over the upper and lower trendlines to relieve the risk of heavy losses from a high [volume](/volume) breakout or breakdown. For instance, in the event that a security has a lower support trendline at $10.00 and an upper resistance trendline at $15.00, the trader might purchase the stock at $11.00, just after a rebound, with a stop-loss of $9.00.
