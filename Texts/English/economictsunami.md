# Economic Tsunami
## What Is an Economic Tsunami?

An economic tsunami is a widespread set of economic difficulties brought about by a single huge event. The downstream effects of economic tsunamis generally spread to broad geographic areas, numerous industry [sectors](/sector), or both.

## Figuring out Economic Tsunamis

Economic tsunamis take their name from natural tsunamis, which are strangely large waves triggered by an unsettling influence to the ocean floor, like a tremor. The subsequent wave causes widespread destruction once it arrives at the shore and floods low-lying coastal areas, and it could cross oceans in its effects.

Moreover, economic tsunamis produce destructive effects past the geographic area or industry sector in which the triggering event happens. These consequences can show previously undetected connections between parts of the global [economy](/economy) that make a ripple effect just under extreme stress.

Contingent upon the seriousness of the consequences and the mechanism by which they spread, economic tsunamis can lead to new regulations as markets endeavor to adjust to or prevent a future repeat under comparative conditions.

## Illustration of an Economic Tsunami

The 2008 global [financial crisis](/financial-crisis) sits among the most pervasive recent instances of an economic tsunami. The [subprime mortgage](/subprime_mortgage) market in the U.S. acted as a trigger in this case, with large investment banks (IBs) misinterpreting the amount of risk in certain [collateralized debt instruments](/cdo).

Unexpectedly high default rates prompted large financial losses in portfolios with high [credit ratings](/creditrating), which triggered gigantic losses for highly leveraged investments made by [financial institutions](/financialinstitution) (FIs) and [hedge funds](/hedgefund). The subsequent liquidity crunch spread quickly past the subprime mortgage market. In response, the U.S. government took over [secondary mortgage market](/secondary_mortgage_market) goliaths Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, while Lehman Brothers declared financial insolvency. Losses at Bear Stearns and Merrill Lynch prompted acquisitions of those companies by JPMorgan Chase and Co. what's more, Bank of America, individually.

Foreign banks additionally endured losses through [investments](/investment) impacted by the economic crisis. Iceland's banking sector experienced an almost complete collapse following the subprime crisis, failing the country's economy. In the mean time, in the United Kingdom, the British government stepped in to [bail out](/bailout) its banking sector.

The U.S., the U.K., and Iceland all undertook differing degrees of regulatory reform following the crisis. Iceland's economy basically rehashed itself to depend more intensely upon the travel industry than on international banking. The U.S. presented a scope of regulatory controls by means of the [Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act](/dodd-frank-financial-regulatory-reform-bill) of 2010 as well as the [Housing and Economic Recovery Act](/housing-and-economic-recovery-act-hera) of 2008. A considerable lot of these regulations fortified oversight of mortgage lending. The U.K. response incorporated the presentation of the Financial Services Act in 2012.

## Special Considerations

[Globalization](/globalization) is one of the primary justifications for why an economic downturn in one part of the world can be felt on the opposite side of the globe. Without widespread economic relationship between markets across the world, economic tsunamis, along with their associated costs, would basically cease to exist. [Free trade agreements](/free-trade) (FTAs) between various countries have made companies more competitive and assisted with bringing down the prices that consumers pay for different goods and services, however the benefits of globalization come with important admonitions.

Closer economic and financial relations likewise lead to increased transmission of economic shocks. The increased interconnectedness of national economies means that an economic downturn in one country can make a cascading type of influence through its trading partners. Nations currently rely upon one another to remain above water. In the event that the economy of a key buyer or seller of goods and services encounters choppiness, this could be expected to have a thump on effect, impacting [exports](/send out) and [imports](/import) in different countries.

The rising interconnectedness of global financial markets over the long haul has likewise become a major factor in the spread of economic tsunamis. This should be visible above in the case of the global financial crisis and the [Great Recession](/great-recession) as well as in other prior events, for example, the [Asian currency crisis](/asian-financial-crisis) and the [Long Term Capital Management](/longtermcapital) episode.

### Trade Wars

Developing calls from a quarters to unwind globalization are likewise working up dangers of economic tsunamis while perhaps at the same time moderating the risk presented by economic tsunamis by diminishing reliance on foreign supply chains.

An illustration of this is the [trade war](/trade-war) among China and the United States. An unpleasant standoff between the world's two greatest economies is harming companies from the two countries, burdening [equity markets](/equitymarket), investments, the [labor market](/labor-market), and [consumer spending](/consumer-spending). In 2019, the value of U.S. exports to China amounted to $106.6, down from around $120.3 billion in the previous year. A paper distributed by the National Bureau of Economic Research in January 2020 (and reexamined in August 2020) by the economists Kyle Handley, Farina Kamal, and Ryan Monarch found that one-fourth of U.S. exporters — companies that account for over 80% of U.S. exports, by value — imported products subject to tariffs during 2019. On average, the higher costs made by these tariffs approached $900 per worker.

Different countries have been trapped in the crossfire, too. The [International Monetary Fund](/imf) (IMF) warned that America's trade spat with China could cost the global economy generally $700 billion by 2020.

Then again, to the degree that inexorably protectionist trade policies accomplish their stated objectives of expanding dependence on domestic supply chains and decreasing reliance on foreign markets, they might reduce the risk of economic tsunamis being communicated among economies and increase the overall flexibility of the domestic economy to economic shocks.

### Financial Crises

Globally connected financial markets address a major transmission mechanism for economic tsunamis. Stocks, bonds, commodities, currencies, and derivatives are totally traded across effectively global markets in the modern economy. A disruption to trading or collapse in the value of an asset in any one market can immediately spread across the planet. Besides, the major financial institutions, whose rise and fall has the power to move markets, are interconnected around the world with investors and governments in a complex web of financial obligations and counterparty risk.

This increases the risk of economic tsunamis starting in or going through international financial organizations as found in the financial crisis of 2008 and the Great Recession. To be sure several economists, remembering Kenneth Rogoff and Carmen Reinhart for their 2009 book, This Time It's Different, have recorded clear, relentless connections between the degree of international capital mobility and financial crises.

Since the Great Recession, total global capital flows, which crested in 2007, have fallen, according to the International Monetary Fund. Be that as it may, different measures of financial globalization have consistently risen, for example, foreign direct investment and foreign holdings of equity and credit instruments. Notwithstanding conventional financial arrangements, the global shadow banking system (which was so vigorously ensnared in the 2008 financial crisis) has flooded, expanding in total assets by 75% somewhere in the range of 2010 and 2017, according to the international Financial Stability Board situated in Basel, Switzerland. This all recommends that global financial transmission of economic tsunamis will stay a substantial risk to the world economy.
