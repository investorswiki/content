# Risk-Adjusted Return
## What Is a Risk-Adjusted Return?

A risk-adjusted return is a calculation of the [profit](/profit) or potential profit from an investment that takes into account the degree of risk that must be accepted to accomplish it. The risk is measured in comparison to that of a virtually risk-free investment â€” normally U.S. Treasuries.

Contingent upon the method utilized, the [risk](/risk) calculation is expressed as a number or a rating. Risk-adjusted returns are applied to individual stocks, investment funds, and entire [portfolios](/portfolio).

## Understanding Risk-Adjusted Return

The risk-adjusted return measures the profit your investment has made relative to the amount of risk the investment has represented throughout a given period of time. If two or more [investments](/investment) delivered the equivalent [return](/return) over a given time period, the one that has the lowest risk will have a better risk-adjusted return.

Some common risk measures utilized in investing incorporate [alpha](/alpha), [beta](/beta), [R-squared](/r-squared), standard deviation, and the Sharpe ratio. While comparing two or more potential investments, an investor ought to apply a similar risk measure to every investment under consideration to get a relative performance perspective.

## Instances of Risk-Adjusted Return Methods
### Sharpe Ratio

The [Sharpe ratio](/sharperatio) measures the profit of an investment that surpasses the [risk-free rate](/risk-freerate), per unit of standard deviation. It is calculated by taking the return of the investment, subtracting the risk-free rate, and partitioning this result by the investment's standard deviation.

All else equivalent, a higher Sharpe ratio is better. The [standard deviation](/standarddeviation) shows the volatility of an investment's returns relative to its average return, with greater standard deviations reflecting wider returns, and narrower standard deviations inferring more concentrated returns. The risk-free rate utilized is the [yield](/yield) on a no-risk investment, for example, a Treasury bond (T-bond), for the relevant period of time.

For instance, say Mutual Fund A returned 12% over the past year and had a standard deviation of 10%, Mutual Fund B returns 10% and had a standard deviation of 7%, and the risk-free rate over the time period was 3%. The Sharpe ratios would be calculated as follows:

- Mutual Fund A: (12% - 3%)/10% = 0.9
- Mutual Fund B: (10% - 3%)/7% = 1

Despite the fact that Mutual Fund A had a higher return, Mutual Fund B had a higher risk-adjusted return, meaning that it acquired per unit of total risk than Mutual Fund A.

### Treynor Ratio

The [Treynor ratio](/treynorratio) is calculated the same way as the Sharpe ratio, but utilizes the investment's [beta](/beta) in the denominator. Similarly as with the Sharpe, a higher Treynor ratio is better.

Utilizing the previous fund model, and expecting that every one of the funds has a beta of 0.75, the calculations are as per the following:

- Mutual Fund A: (12% - 3%)/0.75 = 0.12
- Mutual Fund B: (10% - 3%)/0.75 = 0.09

Here, Mutual Fund A has a higher Treynor ratio, meaning that the fund is earning more return per unit of [systematic risk](/systematicrisk) than Fund B.

## Special Considerations

Risk avoidance isn't generally something to be thankful for in investing, so be wary of over-reacting to these numbers, especially in the event that the timeline being measured is short. In strong markets, a [mutual fund](/mutualfund) with a lower risk than its [benchmark](/benchmark) can limit the real performance that the investor wants to see.

> Beware of over-reacting to these numbers, especially assuming the timeline being measured is short. Greater risks can mean greater rewards over the long-term.

A fund that entertains more risk than its benchmark might experience better returns. In fact, it has been shown ordinarily that higher-risk mutual funds might accrue greater losses during [volatile](/volatility) periods, but are likewise prone to outperform their benchmarks over full [market cycles](/market_cycles).

## Highlights
- Anyway, the purpose of risk-adjusted return is to assist investors with determining whether the risk taken was worth the expected reward.
- There are several methods of risk-adjusting performance, like the Sharpe ratio and Treynor ratio, with each yielding a slightly different result.
- A risk-adjusted return measures an investment's return after taking into account the degree of risk that was taken to accomplish it.
