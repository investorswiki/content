# Loss Given Default (LGD)
## What Is Loss Given Default (LGD)?

Loss given default (LGD) is the estimated amount of money a bank or other financial institution loses when a borrower [defaults](/default2) on a loan. LGD is portrayed as a percentage of total exposure at the hour of default or a single dollar value of expected loss. A financial institution's total LGD is calculated after a survey of all outstanding loans utilizing cumulative losses and exposure.

## Understanding Loss Given Default (LGD)

Banks and other financial institutions determine credit losses by investigating genuine loan defaults. Evaluating losses can be complex and require an analysis of several variables. How credit losses are represented on a company's financial statements incorporate determining both a [allowance for credit losses](/allowance-for-credit-losses) and a [allowance for doubtful accounts](/allowancefordoubtfulaccounts).

Consider if Bank A loans $2 million to Company XYZ, and the company defaults. Bank A's loss isn't really $2 million. Different factors must be viewed as, for example, the amount of collateral, whether installment payments have been made, and whether the bank utilizes the court system for reparations from Company XYZ. With these and different factors considered, Bank A may, in reality, have supported a far more modest loss than the initial $2 million loan.

Determining the amount of loss is an important and genuinely common boundary in most risk models. LGD is an essential part of the Basel Model ([Basel II](/baselii)), a set of international banking regulations, as it is utilized in the calculation of [economic capital](/economic-capital), expected loss, and regulatory capital. The expected loss is calculated as a loan's LGD increased by the two its [probability of default (PD)](/defaultprobability) and the financial institution's [exposure at default (EAD)](/exposure_at_default).

## The most effective method to Calculate LGD

There are a number of various ways of working out LGD.

A common variation considers the exposure at risk and recovery rate. Exposure at default is an estimated value that predicts the amount of loss a bank might experience when a debtor defaults on a loan. The recovery rate is a risk-adjusted measure to right-estimate the default in light of the probability of the outcome.

**LGD (in dollars) = Exposure at Risk (EAD) * (1 - Recovery Rate)**

Another fundamental variation compares the expected net collectible proceeds to the outstanding debt. This formula gives an overall ratio of which portion of debt is expected to be lost:

**LGD (as percentage) = 1 - (Potential Sale Proceeds/Outstanding Debt)**

Of these two methods, it is more considered normal to see the main formula be utilized as it is more conservative approach to mirror the maximum expected loss. It can frequently be challenging to survey what the potential sale proceeds are particularly considering different collateral assets, disposition costs, timing of payments, and liquidity of every asset.

## Loss Given Default (LGD) versus Exposure at Default (EAD)

Exposure at default is the total value of a loan that a bank is presented to when a borrower defaults. For instance, in the event that a borrower applies for a new line of credit for $100,000 and after two years the amount left on the loan is $75,000, and the borrower defaults, the exposure at default is $75,000.

While investigating [default risk](/defaultrisk), banks will frequently work out the EAD on a loan as it plans to foresee the amount the bank will be presented to when a borrower defaults. Exposure at default continually changes as a borrower settles their loan.

The primary difference among LGD and EAD is that LGD thinks about any recovery on the default. Thus, EAD is the more conservative measurement as it is the higher figure. LGD is all the more frequently the best case scenario that depends on different suspicions.

For instance, in the event that a borrower defaults on their excess vehicle loan, the EAD is the amount of the loan left they defaulted on. Presently, on the off chance that a bank can then sell that vehicle and recuperate a certain amount of the EAD, that will be thought about to work out LGD.

## Illustration of Loss Given Default (LGD)

Envision a borrower takes out a $400,000 loan for a condo. Subsequent to making installment payments on the loan for a couple of years, the borrower starts to face financial hardships. It is estimated that the borrower has a 80% of default. The outstanding loan balance is $300,000, and the bank will actually want to sell the condo for $200,000 upon foreclosure.

To ascertain the LGD in dollars, compare the amount at risk to the probability of default. In this situation, the lender deciphers $240,000 at risk of default.

**LGD (in dollars discarding collateral) = $300,000 * (1 - 80%) = $240,000**

On the other hand, LGD can be calculated as a percentage that regularly incorporates the value of the collateral. Albeit the formula above is simpler to compute, it didn't factor in the [disposition](/disposition) proceeds of the condo in the event of default. Utilizing the subsequent variation, the lender ought to expect to lose 33% of their capital should the condo owner default **when considering the collateral value.**

**LGD (as percentage including collateral) = 1 - ($200,000/$300,000) = 33.33%**

## The Bottom Line

While making loans, banks will generally reduce their risk however much they can. They assess a borrower and determine the risk factors of lending to that borrower, including the likelihood of them defaulting on the loan and how much the bank stands to lose assuming they do default. Loss given default (LGD), likelihood of default (PD), and exposure at default (EAD) are calculations that assist banks with measuring their possible losses.

## Features
- The expected loss of a given loan is calculated as the LGD duplicated by both the likelihood of default and the exposure at default.
- Exposure at default is the total value of the loan at the time a borrower defaults.
- LGD is an essential part of the Basel Model (Basel II), a set of international banking regulations.
- An important figure for any financial institution is the cumulative amount of expected losses on every outstanding loan.
- The loss given default (LGD) is an important calculation for financial institutions extending out their expected losses due to borrowers defaulting on loans.
## FAQ
### What Is the Difference Between EAD and LGD?
EAD is exposure at default and addresses the value of a loan that a bank is at risk of losing at the time a borrower defaults on their loan. Loss given default is the value of a loan that a bank is at the risk of losing, subsequent to taking into proceeds from the sale of the asset, addressed as a percentage of total exposure.
### What Are PD and LGD?
LGD is loss given default and alludes to the amount of money a bank loses when a borrower defaults on a loan. PD is the likelihood of default, which measures the likelihood, or probability that a borrower will default on their loan.
### What Does Loss Given Default Mean?
Loss given default (LGD) is the amount of money a financial institution loses when a borrower defaults on a loan, in the wake of thinking about any recovery, addressed as a percentage of total exposure at the hour of loss.
### Will Loss Given Default Be Zero?
Loss given default can hypothetically be zero when a financial institution is modeling LGD. Assuming the model accepts that a full recovery on the loan is conceivable then the LGD can be zero. This is normally not the situation, nonetheless.
### What Is Usage Given Default?
Utilization given default is one more term for exposure at default, which is the total value left on a loan when the borrower defaults.
