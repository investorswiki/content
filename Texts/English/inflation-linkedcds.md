## What Are Inflation-Linked Certificates of Deposit?

As their name recommends, inflation-linked [certificates of deposit (CD)](/certificateofdeposit) are a type of CD whose [interest rates](/interestrate) are indexed to the rate of [inflation](/inflation). In exchange for this additional protection, inflation-linked CDs generally offer somewhat lower interest rates as compared to traditional CDs.

## How Inflation-Linked Certificates of Deposit Work

In contrast to different assets, like real estate or publicly traded [shares](/shares), debt instruments and savings accounts are named in dollars as they were valued at the hour of the investment. Accordingly, if inflation somehow managed to increase during the term of the investment, this could disintegrate the real value of the principal returned toward the finish of the investment term. Thus, investors who are worried about inflation might wish to consider investment vehicles that have an implicit protection against [inflation risk](/inflationrisk).

Inflation-linked CDs furnish investors with this protection by indexing the CD's interest rate to the [consumer price index (CPI)](/consumerpriceindex), which is a widely utilized measure of inflation. Assuming inflation increases during the CD's term, the increase will be added to the instrument's interest rate, in this way protecting the investor against interest rate risk. These securities are likewise insured for up to $250,000 by the [Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC)](/fdic), making inflation-linked CDs among the most secure assets that anyone could hope to find to investors.

One way for investors to increase the interest rate received on their inflation-linked CDs is to consent to lock in their funds for a more drawn out investment period. Ordinarily, the terms for inflation-linked CDs range between six months and six years, with longer periods bringing about higher interest rates.
