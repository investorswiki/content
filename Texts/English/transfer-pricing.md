# Transfer Pricing
## What Is Transfer Pricing?

Transfer pricing is a [accounting practice](/accounting-practice) that addresses the price that one division in a company charges one more division for goods and services gave.

Transfer pricing allows at the foundation of costs for the goods and services traded between [subsidiaries](/subsidiary), [affiliates](/affiliate), or commonly controlled companies that are part of a similar bigger enterprise. Transfer pricing can lead to tax savings for corporations, however tax specialists might contest their claims.

## How Transfer Pricing Works

Transfer pricing is an accounting and taxation practice that allows for pricing transactions inside organizations and between auxiliaries that operate under common control or ownership. The transfer pricing practice reaches out to cross-border transactions as well as domestic ones.

A transfer price is utilized to decide the cost to charge another division, subsidiary, or [holding company](/holdingcompany) for services delivered. Normally, transfer prices are intelligent of the going market price for that great or service. Transfer pricing can likewise be applied to [intellectual property](/intellectualproperty) like research, licenses, and eminences.

[Multinational corporations (MNC)](/multinationalcorporation) are legally allowed to utilize the transfer pricing method for apportioning earnings among their different subsidiary and affiliate companies that are part of the [parent organization](/parentcompany). Notwithstanding, companies now and again can likewise utilize (or abuse) this practice by modifying their taxable income, subsequently decreasing their overall taxes. The transfer pricing mechanism is a way that companies can shift tax liabilities to low-cost tax purviews.

## Transfer Pricing and Taxes

To better comprehend what transfer pricing means for a company's tax bill, we should consider the following scenario. Suppose that an automobile manufacturer has two divisions: Division A, which makes software, and Division B, which fabricates cars. Division An offers the software to different carmakers as well as its parent company. Division B pays Division A for the software, ordinarily at the overarching market price that Division A charges different carmakers.

Suppose that Division A chooses to charge a lower price to Division B as opposed to utilizing the market price. Thus, Division A's sales or incomes are lower due to the lower pricing. Then again, Division B's [costs of goods sold (COGS)](/cogs) are lower, expanding the division's profits. In short, Division An's incomes are lower by a similar amount as Division B's cost savings â€” so there's no financial impact on the overall corporation.

Nonetheless, suppose that Division An is in a higher tax country than Division B. The overall company can save money on taxes by making Division A less profitable and Division B more profitable. By making Division A charge lower prices and give those savings to Division B, helping its profits through a lower COGS, Division B will be taxed at a lower rate. All in all, Division A's decision not to charge market pricing to Division B allows the overall company to sidestep taxes.

In short, by charging above or below the market price, companies can utilize transfer pricing to transfer profits and costs to different divisions inside to reduce their tax burden.

## Transfer Pricing and the IRS

The IRS states that transfer pricing ought to be something similar between intercompany transactions that would have if not happened had the company done the transaction with a party or customer outside the company. According to the IRS website, transfer pricing is defined as follows:

>
> The regulations under section 482 generally give that prices charged by one affiliate to another, in an intercompany transaction including the transfer of goods, services, or intangibles, yield results that are consistent with the outcomes that would have been realized whether uncontrolled taxpayers had participated in similar transaction under similar conditions.
>

Accordingly, the financial reporting of transfer pricing has severe rules and is closely watched by tax specialists. Auditors and regulators frequently require broad documentation. Assuming the transfer value is done incorrectly or improperly, the financial statements might should be repeated, and fees or punishments could be applied.

Be that as it may, there is a lot of discussion and uncertainty encompassing how transfer pricing between divisions ought to be accounted for and what division ought to take the brunt of the tax burden.
