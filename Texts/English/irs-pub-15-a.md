Put another way, an independent contractor is free to perform the required work utilizing their own methods and apparatuses, as long as the outcome satisfies the employer. This is analogous to independent contractors working on a construction job site, where they own their own instruments and use them to perform work for the builder, but are not actual employees of the contractor.
