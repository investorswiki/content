## What Is an Expatriation Tax?

An expatriation tax is a government fee charged to individuals who deny their citizenship, typically founded on the value of a taxpayer's property. In the United States, the expatriation tax provisions under Section 877 and Section 877A of the [Internal Revenue Code](/internal-revenue-code) (IRC) apply to U.S. residents who surrender their citizenship, and long-term residents who end their U.S. resident status for federal tax purposes. Various rules apply, as per the date whereupon a person expatriated.

## Understanding the Expatriation Tax

Expatriation tax rules in the U.S. apply to individuals who settled abroad permanently on or after June 17, 2008. These rules apply to any individual who expatriates with a [net worth](/networth) of more than $2 million, neglects to ensure that they've consented to U.S. tax law for the five years going before their expatriation, or who has an annual net income tax for the five going before years over a certain amount. This amount changes every year founded on [inflation](/inflation), yet in 2020 it was $171,000.

Expatriation taxes are not common all through the world. Just the U.S. also, Eritrea charge income tax on residents who take up residence abroad. A few different countries, like Canada, have a takeoff tax for those emigrating to different countries, however this varies from an expatriation tax.

The expatriation tax in the U.S. depends on the value of an individual taxpayer's [property](/property) on the day preceding their expatriation. The IRS considers [fair-market value](/fairmarketvalue) of taxpayers' property like taxpayers liquidated their assets, selling all of their property on this day. The difference between the fair market value and what a specific taxpayer paid for a property is a net gain under the tax. In like manner, any losses additionally are considered through a similar method. Any gain more than $737,000 (2020 limit), a number adjusted consistently for inflation, is subject to tax.

Since many individuals who expatriate do as such to stay away from tax laws with respect to their assets, the IRS forces more serious tax suggestions for expatriates. The expatriation tax doesn't matter to individuals who demonstrate to the [Secretary of the Treasury](/treasury-secretary) that their justification behind expatriation isn't to dodge taxes, for example, a person with dual citizenship deciding to make another country a permanent residence.

The IRS forces still punishments any individual who failed to file an expatriation form as required. Covered expatriates must file form 8854. The IRS informs individuals who don't file this form as required they are in infringement and subject to a potential $10,000 penalty.
