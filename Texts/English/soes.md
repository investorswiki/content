# Small Order Execution System (SOES)
## What Was the Small Order Execution System (SOES)?

The small order execution system (SOES) was a computer network that automatically executed trades in [Nasdaq market securities](/nasdaq-nm) and some Nasdaq small-cap securities. Nasdaq carried out this mandatory system because of a lack of liquidity following the [1987 stock market crash](/stock-market-crash-1987). SOES empowered individual investors to execute trades in fast-moving markets and gave them similar access to orders and execution as larger traders.

SOES was vital in computerizing markets for retail investors and extraordinarily enhanced individuals' ability to become active informal investors. The system has largely been phased out with the development of all-electronic trading that increased transaction speed at ever higher trading volumes.

## Seeing Small Order Execution Systems

SOES was first presented in December 1984 for 25 stocks to give automatic order execution to individual traders with orders not exactly or equivalent to 1,000 shares. At the point when SOES became mandatory in late 1987, it initially confronted heavy negativity from Nasdaq member firms since it forced them to execute all SOES trades that met the market producer's advertised price. Critical limitations were put in place to prevent informal investors from taking advantage of the system and exploiting old prices quoted by market creators.

The legacy of SOES in the financial markets is that it basically "evened the odds" and altogether further developed liquidity for small-scale investors. It required market producers to acknowledge SOES orders that matched their advertised bid and ask prices, and permitted individual traders to execute orders for stocks trading at something like $250 per share. Institutions couldn't utilize SOES; neither could brokers trading in their own accounts, despite the fact that they could utilize SOES to trade for the benefit of small clients. When a trader places an order through SOES, they must stand by no less than five minutes to place one more trade on a similar stock through SOES.

The utilization of this legacy system is as of now excessive since advances in computer and communications technology have made it workable for individual traders to conduct quick, large trades on par with institutional traders. SOES currently works as a computerized linkup of Nasdaq market producers that permits orders of 1,000 shares or less (for a few less actively traded shares, the essentials might be 500 or 200 shares) to sidestep brokers and receive automatic execution at the best conceivable price.

## SOES Bandits

[SOES bandit](/soesbandits) is a shoptalk term for traders who exploit the system by making fast buy and sell orders to create a gain from small price changes. SOES bandits execute a small transaction on a security to manipulate the price and afterward execute a larger transaction to exploit the price shortcoming. Their average profit is small, yet they can trade hundreds or even a great many times each week. This is viewed as a form of insider trading since the person submitting the request has advanced information about the market's probable movement that other market participants don't have the foggiest idea.

Harvey Houtkin of All-Tech Direct Inc. became one of the most mind-blowing known SOES bandits subsequent to winning a 1993 federal requests court case that forced the Securities and Exchange Commission to permit more extensive access to SOES and distributing the 1998 book **Secrets of the SOES Bandit**.
