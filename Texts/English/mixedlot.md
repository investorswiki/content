# Mixed Lot
## What Is a Mixed Lot?

A mixed parcel order is a blend of a [round lot](/roundlot) order, which is a standardized trading amount, and at least one non-standardized [odd lot](/oddlot) orders.

## Grasping Mixed Lots

A mixed parcel is an order to execute in a [security](/security) for an amount that is definitely not a round (or whole) part order amount yet is bigger than the littlest round part amount. Since this order can't fit the round parcel requirements, it must be a combination of a round part order, the exchange-laid out trading unit, and an odd parcel order, an order that falls below the initial round parcel amount.

[Stocks](/stock) commonly trade in round loads of 100, and that means orders made in these multiples are traded effectively between parties. An odd part would be all orders for 99 shares or less. If an investor wanted to buy 425 shares, they would need to utilize a mixed part order, which is broken into a round parcel order for 400 shares (4 x 100), and an odd part order for 25 shares.

The fees that [brokers](/specialist) regularly charge depend on the standard size for trading. [Commissions](/commission) for mixed parts might put a mark in a trader's return since they are generally higher than those of standard round parcel trades since they contain odd parcels too. This is called an odd-parcel differential. These orders require a round parcel to be executed at the same time. Numerous odd parcels piggyback onto round part transactions.

Beside commission fees, there are a couple of alternate ways mixed parcel trades contrast from standard trades. To begin with, they don't impact the [bid or ask](/bid-and-ask) price â€” the price a buyer will pay for a security and the price a seller will acknowledge for a similar security, separately. Mixed parcel trades additionally take more time to settle than standard trades, particularly on the off chance that there are no round part orders coming through. As indicated by the [Securities and Exchange Commission](/sec) (SEC), standard trades take two business days to settle.

## Benefits of Trading in Round Lots versus Mixed Lots

Stock exchange trading systems are fundamentally set up to deal with round parcels. While submitting such a trade, it will appear on the bid or ask pricing data shipped off traders from the exchanges. In any case, odd part orders (a mixed parcel order is broken into a round parcel and odd parcel) are excluded from these data reports. Traders frequently utilize bid or ask data to see where supply and demand are most grounded in the markets.

Likewise, round-part orders can be directed to off-exchange trading systems, where investors could get better prices or quicker executions of their trades.

## Features
- A mixed parcel order contains both round parts and odd parcels.
- Commissions for mixed parcels might put a gouge in a trader's return since they are generally higher than those of standard trades.
- Mixed part trades contrast from standard trades in that they don't impact the bid or ask price and take more time to settle.
