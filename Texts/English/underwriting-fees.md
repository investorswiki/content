# Underwriting Fees
## What Are Underwriting Fees?

Underwriting fees are [monies](/cash) collected by underwriters for performing [underwriting](/underwriting) services. Underwriters work in various markets including investments, mortgages, and insurance. In every situation, the underwriter's job changes somewhat, yet each gathers underwriting fees in exchange for their underwriting services.

## How Underwriting Fees Work

In [capital markets](/capitalmarkets), underwriting fees are collected by underwriters who regulate the giving and distributing of certain [financial instruments](/financialinstrument). At the point when a company issues stock, bonds, or other publicly traded securities, for example, it recruits an underwriter.

The responsible company and the underwriter work closely together to decide the price of an offering. In the wake of deciding the offer structure, underwriters collect a group of speculation banks and brokerage firms that focus on selling a certain percentage of the offering. After an underwriting agreement is struck, the underwriter bears the risk of being not able to sell the underlying securities and the cost of holding them on its books until they can be sold. When the underwriter realizes it will sell each of the shares in the offering, it shuts the offering by buying every one of the shares from the company (in the event that the offering is a guaranteed offering), and the issuer gets the proceeds minus the underwriting fees, generally 3.5 to 7 percent of the amount of capital being raised.

Underwriters or [underwriter syndicates](/underwriter-organization) earn underwriting fees for completing three things: arranging and dealing with the offering, accepting the risk of buying the securities (if no other person will), and dealing with the offer of the shares.

## Underwriting Fees for Mortgage Underwriters

A mortgage underwriter earns underwriting fees by assessing and checking mortgage loan applications and either supporting or denying the loan.

An underwriting fee for the service of assessing the loan application for endorsement is a nonrecurring fee that the lender might charge in lieu of a [origination fee](/origination-fee), or notwithstanding it. Origination fees pay for various costs associated with getting a loan and could incorporate administrative services, for example, loan processing and mortgage broker fees. Other loan fees can incorporate an appraisal, a credit report, flood certification, and a tax service fee. When charged separated from origination, underwriting costs somewhere in the range of $400 and $900, contingent upon the lender and loan type.

## Underwriting Fees for Insurance Underwriters

Insurance underwriters gather underwriting fees for recognizing and computing a policyholder's risk of loss and by composing the policies to cover these risks. An insurance underwriter's job is to shield the company's book of business from risks that they feel will make a loss and issue insurance policies at a premium that is suitable for the risk exposure.
