## History of Balance of Payments (BOP)

Before the nineteenth century, international transactions were designated in gold, giving little flexibility to countries encountering trade deficits. Growth was low, so invigorating a trade surplus was the primary method of reinforcing a country's financial position. National economies were not all around integrated, nonetheless, so steep trade imbalances rarely incited emergencies. The industrial revolution increased international economic integration, and balance of payment emergencies started to happen all the more habitually.

The Great Depression drove countries to abandon the gold standard and take part in competitive devaluation of their currencies, yet the Bretton Woods system that won from the finish of World War II until the 1970s presented a gold-convertible dollar with fixed exchange rates to different currencies.

As the U.S. money supply increased and its trade deficit extended, nonetheless, the government became incapable to completely reclaim foreign central banks' dollar reserves for gold, and the system was abandoned.

Since the [Nixon shock](/nixon-shock) — as the finish of the dollar's convertibility to gold is known — currencies have drifted unreservedly, implying that a country encountering a trade deficit can misleadingly push down its currency — by hoarding foreign reserves, for instance — making its products more alluring and expanding its exports. Due to the increased mobility of capital across borders, balance-of-payments emergencies some of the time happen, causing sharp currency devaluations, for example, the ones that struck in [Southeast Asian countries](/asian-financial-crisis) in 1998.

During the [Great Recession](/great-recession), several countries left on competitive devaluation of their currencies to try to support their exports. The world's all's major central banks answered the financial crisis at the time by executing emphatically expansionary monetary policy. This prompted other nations' currencies, especially in emerging markets, appreciating against the U.S. dollar and other major currencies.

A significant number of those nations answered by additional relaxing the reins on their monetary policy to support their exports, especially those whose exports were feeling the squeeze from stale global demand during the Great Recession.

## Special Considerations

Balance of payments and international investment position data are critical in formulating national and international economic policy. Certain parts of the balance of payments data, like payment imbalances and [foreign direct investment](/fdi), are key issues that a country's policymakers look to address,

While a country's balance of payments essentially zeroes out the current and capital accounts, imbalances can and do show up between various countries' current accounts. The U.S. had the world's biggest [current account deficit](/currentaccountdeficit) in 2020, at $616 billion. China had the world's biggest surplus, at $274 billion.

Economic policies are frequently targeted at specific objectives that, thusly, impact the balance of payments. For instance, one country could embrace policies specifically intended to draw in foreign investment in a specific sector, while one more could endeavor to keep its currency at a falsely low level to animate exports and build up its currency reserves. The impact of these policies is at last caught yet to be determined of payments data.
