## Grasping Mortgage Equity Withdrawals (MEWs)

Mortgage equity withdrawals are a common practice during times of economic boom and rising home prices. If the [value](/value) of a property increases at similar rate as the mortgage equity withdrawals, the real value of the home remaining parts consistent.
