# Execution
## What Is an Execution?

Execution is the completion of a buy or sell order for a security. The execution of an order happens when it gets [filled](/fill), not when the investor places it. At the point when the investor submits the trade, it is shipped off a broker, who then, at that point, determines the best way for it to be executed.

## Understanding Execution

Brokers are required by law to give investors the best execution conceivable. The [Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)](/sec) expects brokers to report the quality of their executions on a stock by stock basis as well as to inform customers who didn't have their orders directed for best execution. The cost of executing trades has been essentially diminished due to the growth of online brokers. Many brokers offer their customers a commission rebate on the off chance that they execute a certain amount of trades or dollar value each month. This is especially important for short-term traders where execution costs should be kept as low as could really be expected.

On the off chance that the order placed is a market order or an order which can be changed over into a market order generally rapidly, then, at that point, the possibilities that it will be settled at the ideal price are high. Yet, there may be instances, particularly in the case of a large order that is broken down into several small orders, when it very well may be challenging to execute at the best conceivable price range. In such cases, an execution risk is introduced into the system. The risk alludes to the lag between the placement of an order and its settlement.

## How Orders Get Executed
- **Order to the Floor:** This can be tedious on the grounds that a human trader processes the transaction. The floor broker requirements to receive the order and fill it.
- **Order to Market Maker:** On exchanges like the Nasdaq, [market makers](/marketmaker) are responsible for providing liquidity. The investor's broker might direct the trade to one of these market makers for execution.
- **Electronic Communications Network (ECN):** An efficient method, by which computer systems electronically match up buy and sell orders.
- **Internalization:** If the broker holds an inventory of the stock being referred to, it might choose to execute the order [in-house](/in-house). Brokers allude to this as an internal crossing.

## Best Execution and Broker Obligations

By law, brokers are committed to give every one of their investors the best conceivable order execution. There is, nonetheless, the discussion about whether this occurs, or on the other hand assuming brokers are routing the orders for different reasons, similar to the extra revenue streams we outlined previously.

Suppose, for instance, you need to buy 1,000 shares of the TSJ Sports Conglomerate, which is selling at the [current price](/currentprice) of $40. You place the [market order](/marketorder), and it gets filled at $40.10. That means the order costs you an extra $100. A few brokers state that they generally "battle for an extra one-sixteenth," yet in reality, the opportunity for [price improvement](/priceimprovement) is essentially an opportunity and not a guarantee. Likewise, when the broker pursues at a better cost (for a limit order), the speed and the probability of execution diminishes. In any case, the market itself, and not the broker, might be the guilty party of an order not being executed at the [quoted price](/quoted-price), particularly in [fast-moving markets](/fastmarket).

It is to some degree a high-wire act that brokers walk in trying to execute trades in the best interest of their clients as well as their own. In any case, as we will learn, the SEC has put measures in place to tilt the scale toward the client's best interests.

The SEC has done whatever it may take to guarantee that investors get the [best execution](/bestexecution), with rules forcing brokers to report the quality of executions on a stock-by-stock basis, including how market orders are executed and what the execution price is compared to the public statement's effective spreads. Moreover, when a broker, while executing an order from an investor using a limit order, gives the execution at a better price than the public statements, that broker must report the subtleties of these better prices. With these rules in place, it is a lot simpler to determine which brokers get the best prices and which ones use them just as a marketing pitch.

Moreover, the SEC requires broker/vendors to advise their customers on the off chance that their orders are not steered for best execution. Commonly, this disclosure is on the trade confirmation slip you receive subsequent to placing your order. Sadly, this disclaimer quite often slips by everyone's notice.

## Execution and Dark Pools

[Dark pools](/dark-pool) are private exchanges or discussions that are intended to assist institutional investors with executing their large orders by not disclosing their quantity. Since dark pools are fundamentally utilized by institutions, it is frequently more straightforward to find liquidity to execute a block trade at a better price than if it was executed on a public exchange, like the [Nasdaq](/nasdaq) or New York Stock Exchange. Assuming an institutional trader places a sizable order on a public exchange, it is noticeable in the order book and different investors might discover that there is a large buy or sell order getting executed which could push the price of the stock lower.

Most dark pools additionally offer execution at the mid-point of the bid and ask price which assists brokers with achieving the best conceivable execution for their customers. For instance, assuming that a stock's bid price was $100 and the asking price was $101, a market order could get executed at $100.50 in the event that there was a seller at that price in the dark pool. Main Street is generally wary of dark pools due to their lack of transparency and lack of access to retail investors.

## Illustration of Execution

Assume Olga enters an order to sell 500 shares of stock ABC for $25. Her broker is under obligation to find the best conceivable execution price for the stock. He investigates the stock's prices across markets and finds that he can get a price of $25.50 for the stock internally versus the $25.25 price at which it is trading in the markets. The broker executes the order internally and nets a profit of $125 for Olga.
