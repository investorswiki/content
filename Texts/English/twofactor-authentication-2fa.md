# Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)
## What Is Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)?

Two-factor authentication (2FA) is a security system that requires two distinct forms of identification to access something.

Two-factor authentication can be utilized to fortify the security of an online account, a smartphone, or even a door. 2FA does this by requiring two types of information from the client — a secret key or [personal identification number (PIN)](/personal-identification-number), a code shipped off the client's smartphone, or a unique mark — before whatever is being secured can be accessed.

## Grasping Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)

Two-factor authentication is intended to prevent unauthorized users from gaining access to an account with just a taken secret word. Users might be at greater risk of compromised passwords than they understand, especially assuming they utilize a similar secret key on more than one website. Downloading software and tapping on joins in emails can likewise open a person to secret word theft.

Two-factor authentication is a combination of two of the accompanying:

- Something you know (your secret word)
- Something you have, (for example, a message with a code shipped off your smartphone or other gadget, or a smartphone authenticator app)
- Something you are (biometrics utilizing your finger impression, face, or retina)

2FA isn't just applied to online settings. It is likewise working when a consumer is required to enter their postal division before utilizing their Visa at a gas pump or when a client is required to enter an authentication code from a RSA SecurID key fob to sign in remotely to a business' system.

> In spite of the slight burden of a more drawn out sign in process, security specialists suggest empowering 2FA at every possible opportunity: email accounts, secret key managers, social media applications, cloud storage services, financial services, and that's only the tip of the iceberg.

## Instances of Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)

Apple account holders can utilize 2FA to guarantee that accounts must be accessed from confided in gadgets. On the off chance that a client attempts to sign in to their iCloud account from an alternate computer, the client will require the secret key, yet additionally a multi-digit code that Apple will ship off one of the client's gadgets, like their iPhone.

Numerous organizations additionally send 2FA to control access to company networks and data. Employees might be required to enter an extra code to sign into the remote work area software that permits them to interface with their work computers from outside the office.

## Special Considerations

While 2FA further develops security, it isn't idiot proof. Programmers who procure the authentication factors can in any case gain unauthorized access to accounts. Common ways of doing so incorporate [phishing](/phishing) assaults, account recovery procedures, and malware.

Programmers can likewise catch instant messages utilized in 2FA. Pundits contend that instant messages are not a true form of 2FA since they are not something the client as of now has but instead something the client is sent, and the sending system is helpless. All things being equal, the pundits contend that this interaction ought to be called two-step verification. A few companies, like Google, utilize this term.

In any case, even two-step verification is safer than secret phrase protection alone. Even more grounded is multi-factor authentication, which requires multiple factors before account access will be conceded.

## Features
- Two-factor authentication (2FA) is a security system that requires two separate, distinct forms of identification to access something.
- The main factor is a secret key and the second commonly incorporates a message with a code shipped off your smartphone, or biometrics utilizing your finger impression, face, or retina.
- While 2FA further develops security, it isn't idiot proof.
