# Book Value Per Share (BVPS)
## What Is Book Value Per Share (BVPS)?

Book value per share (BVPS) is the ratio of equity available to common shareholders partitioned by the number of [outstanding shares](/outstandingshares). This figure addresses the base value of a company's equity and measures the [book value](/bookvalue) of a firm on a per-share basis.

## Understanding Book Value Per Share (BVPS)

The book value per share (BVPS) metric can be utilized by investors to check whether a stock price is undervalued by contrasting it with the firm's market value per share. In the event that a company's BVPS is higher than its [market value](/marketvalue) per share — its current stock price — then, at that point, the stock is viewed as undervalued. On the off chance that the firm's BVPS increases, the stock ought to be perceived as more valuable, and the stock price ought to increase.

In theory, BVPS is the sum that shareholders would receive if the firm was liquidated, the substantial assets were all sold and the liabilities were all paid. Notwithstanding, as the assets would be sold at market prices, and book value utilizes the historical costs of assets, market value is viewed as a better floor price than book value for a company.

On the off chance that a company's share price falls below its BVPS, a corporate raider could create a risk-free gain by buying the company and liquidating it. In the event that book value is negative, where a company's liabilities surpass its assets, this is known as a balance sheet insolvency.

The formula for BVPS is:

## Illustration of Book Value Per Share

Assume, for instance, that XYZ Manufacturing's common equity balance is $10 million, and that 1 million shares of common stock are outstanding. This means that the BVPS is ($10 million/1 million shares), or $10 per share. On the off chance that XYZ can generate higher profits and utilize those profits to buy more assets or reduce liabilities, the firm's common equity increases.

Utilizing the XYZ model, assume that the firm repurchases 200,000 shares of stock and that 800,000 shares stay outstanding. Assuming common equity is $10 million, BVPS increases to $12.50 per share. Other than stock repurchases, a company can likewise increase BVPS by doing whatever it takes to increase the asset balance and reduce liabilities.
