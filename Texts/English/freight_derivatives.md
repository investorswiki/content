# Freight Derivatives
## What Are Freight Derivatives?

Freight derivatives are financial instruments whose value is derived from what's in store levels of freight rates, as [dry bulk](/dry-bulk-ware) carrying rates and oil big hauler rates.

Freight derivatives are frequently utilized by end-clients (ship owners and grain-houses) and by providers (integrated oil companies and international trading corporations) to moderate risk and hedge against price unpredictability in the supply chain. Nonetheless, similarly as with any derivative, market examiners — like hedge funds and retail brokers — partake in both the buying and selling of freight contracts accommodating a new, more liquid, marketplace.

## How Freight Derivatives Work

Freight derivatives incorporate exchange-traded futures, [swap](/swap) futures, forward freight agreements (FFAs), holder freight swap agreements, compartment freight derivatives, and physical deliverable freight derivatives.

The instruments are settled against different freight rate indexes distributed by the [Baltic Exchange](/baltic-exchange) and the Shanghai Shipping Exchange. Cleared contracts, interestingly, are margined consistently through the designated clearinghouse. Toward the finish of every day, investors receive or owe the difference between the price of the paper contracts and the market index. Clearing services are given by leading exchanges, including the NASDAQ OMX Commodities, European Energy Exchange, and [Chicago Mercantile Exchange](/cme) (CME), to give some examples.

With shipping markets bearing more risk, freight derivatives have turned into a practical method for shipowners and administrators, oil companies, trading companies, and grain houses to oversee freight rate risk.

## Special Considerations

The London-based Baltic Exchange issues the daily [Baltic Dry Index](/baltic_dry_index) as a market barometer and leading indicator of the shipping industry. It gives investors knowledge into the price of moving major raw materials via sea yet additionally assists price with freighting derivatives. The index accounts for 20 shipping routes estimated by a period chart basis and covers different measured dry bulk transporters, including Handysize, Supramax, Panamax, and Capesize.

A shipowner utilizes the index to monitor and safeguard against a drop in freight rates. Charters, on the hand, use it to moderate the risks of rising freight rates. The Baltic Dry Index is viewed as a leading indicator of economic activity in light of the fact that a rise in dry bulk shipping signals a flood in raw production materials that invigorate growth.

## Freight Derivatives and Forward Freight Agreements (FFAs)

FFAs, the most common freight derivative, are traded over the counter based on the conditions and conditions of the Forward Freight Agreement Broker Association (FFABA) standard contracts. The principal terms of an agreement cover the agreed-upon route, season of settlement, contract size, and the rate at which differences are settled.

FFAs were developed for shipping in the mid 1990s. FFAs are traded both [over-the-counter](/otc) (OTC) and exchange-traded. Trades are many times unpublished and done on trust alone. The contract terminates on the [settlement date](/settlementdate) and assuming the agreed price is higher than the settlement price the seller pays the difference to the contract buyer.

Meanwhile, assuming that the agreed price is lower than the settlement price, the buyer pays the seller the difference. The settlement and contract price difference is then increased by the cargo size or the voyage duration.
