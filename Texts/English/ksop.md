# KSOP
## What Is KSOP?

The term KSOP alludes to a qualified retirement plan that consolidates a [employee stock ownership plan](/esop) (ESOP) with a [401(k)](/401kplan). Basically an ESOP works inside a 401(k). In that capacity, KSOPs are offered by employers to their employees. Companies that offer these plans match employee contributions with stock as opposed to cash. KSOPs are viewed as defined-benefit plans, as companies that offer them can reduce the [administrative expenses](/administrative-expenses) of operating separate ESOPs and 401(k) plans.

## How a KSOP Works

Individuals have several options accessible to them with regards to retirement planning. In the event that their employer doesn't offer a sponsored plan, they can decide to invest in accounts all alone, for example, a [individual retirement account](/ira) (IRA). Yet, most employers offer some sort of retirement plans, for example, 401(k)s or [403(b)s](/403bplan). A few companies might choose to offer what's called a KSOP, wherein an ESOP works inside a 401(k).

ESOPs are benefit plans that give employees an ownership stake in the company for which they work. These plans accompany certain benefits, including no upfront costs. 401(k)s, then again, are plans that permit individuals to set to the side money from their paycheck for retirement.

The KSOP gives the highlights and benefits of the two plans by joining them into one. Employees make contributions by setting to the side a certain amount of money from their wages through normal payroll deductions. Employers make [matching contributions](/matchingcontribution). Yet rather than contributing cash, the employer rather offers shares in the company.

A KSOP is a great option for companies that can assist them with making a market for their shares with adequate [liquidity](/liquidity), which measures how effectively a stock can be bought or sold in the [market](/market). They additionally boost employees to guarantee the company's profitability. This could support the share price and create extra value down the road. On the flip side, employees could lose value assuming the share price declines, passing on less incentive to outperform.

> The benefits a retired person gets from a KSOP rely heavily on the amount they contribute, the employer contributions along with the manner in which the company's share perform in the market.

## Special Considerations

KSOPs bring extra [risk](/risk) to plan holders far in excess of those associated with 401(k)s. Employees with traditional 401(k)s are generally offered several options of funds with different risk and reward profiles in which to invest. As employers step by step add to an employee's 401(k), the employee has more money to circulate among these funds and expand their assets.

There could be various securities inside a common fund, including stocks, [bonds](/security), money market instruments, and cash. Then again, a KSOP moves employee assets in company stock, leaving less room for balance and spreading risk among various shares of stock and [asset classes](/assetclasses).

## KSOPs versus Other Employer-Sponsored Plans
