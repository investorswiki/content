## What Was the Halloween Massacre?

The Halloween Massacre alludes to the Canadian government's 2006 decision to tax all income trusts domiciled in Canada. On Halloween, Oct. 31, 2006, Canada's then-pastor of finance, Jim Flaherty, announced that all income trusts would be taxed likewise as corporations at a rate of over 30% on taxable income, making unitholders' values decline emphatically basically overnight.

Income trusts — which were permitted to make distributions to unitholders on a pretax basis under previous Canadian income tax regulations — were a famous investment vehicle in the mid 2000s, especially in Canada. The Canadian energy sector was hardest hit by the change, experiencing an estimated loss of around 17.85% in value (about $35 billion) to investors over the 10 days following the announcement, leading to the term "massacre."

## The Fallout from the Halloween Massacre

In the decade since, interest rates have been low in Canada and the United States, as investors have clamored for additional yields like the sort that income trusts once gave. By and by, starting around 2021, income trusts are as yet accessible, a large number of them [real estate investment trusts (REITs)](/reit).

As of the finish of September 2020, Canadian REITs failed to meet expectations with a negative 20% return over the past 12 months. The pandemic's effect on real estate — including tenant insolvency, void customer facing facades, decreased retail business, and closed shops, caf\u00e9s, and that's just the beginning — was to be faulted.

Canadian REITs have since encountered a major rebound. As of the finish of September 2021, they returned 43% over the previous 12 months, as per RBC.
