# Market Indicators
## What are Market Indicators?

Market indicators are quantitative in nature and try to decipher stock or financial index data trying to forecast market moves. Market indicators are a subset of technical indicators and are typically involved formulas and ratios. They aid investors' venture/exchanging choices.

## Figuring out Market Indicators

Market indicators are like [technical indicators](/technicalindicator) in that both apply a statistical formula to a series of data points to draw an end. The difference is that market indicators use data points from various [securities](/security) as opposed to just a single security. Periodically, market indicators are plotted on a separate chart as opposed to showing up above or below an index price chart.

Most stock market indicators are made by breaking down the number of companies that have arrived at new highs relative to the number that made new lows, known as [market breadth](/market_breadth), since it shows where the overall [trend](/trend) is going.

The two most common types of market indicators are:

- **Market Breadth** indicators compare the number of stocks moving in a similar bearing as a bigger trend. For instance, the [Advance-Decline Line](/advancedeclineline) takes a gander at the number of propelling stocks versus the number of declining stocks.
- **Market Sentiment** indicators compare price and [volume](/volume) to decide if investors are bullish or bearish on the overall market. For instance, the Put Call Ratio takes a gander at the number of put options versus call options during a given period.

Here is an illustration of the NASDAQ Advance-Decline Issues index:

## Famous Market Indicators

There are many different market indicators covering different indexes in the United States and around the world, including the [NYSE](/nyse), [NASDAQ](/nasdaq), [AMEX](/amex), [TSX](/toronto-stock-trade tsx), TSX-V, and different options exchanges.

Probably the most well known market indicators include:

- **Advance-Decline Issues** - The ratio of progressing to declining securities at some random point in time. Since the indexes are weighted by [market capitalization](/marketcapitalization), this is useful in deciding true sentiment as opposed to just checking out at the performance of the biggest companies in a given index. Models: $NYAD and $NAAD.
- **New Highs-New Lows** - The ratio of new highs to new lows at some random point in time. At the point when there are numerous new highs, it's an indication that the market might be getting [frothy](/foam), while many new lows recommend that a market might be [bottoming](/base) out.
- [McClellan Oscillator](/mcclellanoscillator) - This [oscillator](/oscillator) utilizes a moving average of ups and downs to assist with streamlining market breadth and make it simpler to decipher instead of taking a gander at choppy charts showing the raw numbers. It goes from +150 to - 150.
- [Moving Averages](/movingaverage) - Many market indicators take a gander at the percentage of stocks above or below key moving averages, for example, the 50-and 200-day moving averages. Models: $NYA50, $NYA200, $NAA50, and $NAA200.
