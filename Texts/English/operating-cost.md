# Operating Costs
## What Are Operating Costs?

Operating costs are associated with the maintenance and administration of a business on an everyday basis. Operating costs incorporate direct [costs of goods sold](/cogs) (COGS) and other operating expenses — frequently called [selling, general, and administrative](/sga) (SG&A) — which incorporate rent, payroll, and other overhead costs, as well as raw materials and maintenance expenses. Operating costs reject [non-operating expenses](/non-operating-expense) connected with financing, like interest, investments, or foreign currency translation.

The operating cost is deducted from [revenue](/revenue) to show up at [operating income](/operatingincome) and is considered a company's [income statement](/incomestatement).

## Figuring out Operating Costs

Businesses need to keep track of operating costs as well as the costs associated with non-operating activities, for example, [interest expenses](/interestexpense) on a loan. The two costs are represented differently in a company's books, allowing analysts to determine how costs are associated with revenue-producing activities and whether the business can be run all the more efficiently.

Generally speaking, a company's management will seek to boost [profits](/profit) for the company. Since profits are determined both by the revenue that the company procures and the amount the company spends to operate, profit can be increased both by expanding revenue and by decreasing operating costs. Since cutting costs generally appears to be a simpler and more available approach to expanding profits, managers will frequently rush to pick this method.

Managing operating costs too much can reduce a company's productivity and, thus, its profit too. While lessening a particular operating cost will generally increase short-term profits, it can likewise hurt the company's earnings in the long term.

For instance, on the off chance that a company cuts its advertising costs, its short-term profits will likely improve since it is spending less money on operating costs. Nonetheless, by lessening its advertising, the company could likewise reduce its capacity to generate new business with the end goal that earnings in the future could endure.

1. Add total operating expenses and COGS to show up at the total operating costs for the period.

## Types of Operating Costs

While operating costs generally do exclude capital outlays, they can incorporate a huge number of [operating expenses](/operating_expense, for example,

- Accounting and legal charges
- Bank charges
- Sales and marketing costs
- Travel expenses
- Amusement costs
- Non-capitalized [research and development expenses](/research-and-development-expenses)
- Office supply costs
- Rent
- Repair and maintenance costs
- Utility expenses
- Salary and [wage expenses](/wage-expense)

Operating costs will likewise incorporate the cost of goods sold, which are the expenses directly tied to the production of goods and services. A portion of the costs include:

- Direct material costs
- Direct labor
- Rent of the plant or production office
- Benefits and wages for the production workers
- Repair costs of equipment
- Utility costs and taxes of the production offices

A business' operating costs are comprised of two parts, fixed costs and variable costs, which vary in important ways.

## Fixed Costs

A [fixed cost](/fixedcost) is one that doesn't change with an increase or reduction in sales or productivity and must be paid no matter what the company's activity or performance. For instance, a manufacturing company must pay rent for factory space, paying little heed to the amount it is delivering or earning. While it can downsize and reduce the cost of its rent payments, it can't dispense with these costs, thus they are viewed as fixed. Fixed costs generally incorporate overhead costs, insurance, security, and equipment.

Fixed costs can help in achieving [economies of scale](/economiesofscale), as when a large number of a company's costs are fixed, the company can make more profit per unit as it creates more units. In this system, fixed costs are spread out over the number of units created, making production more efficient as production increases by decreasing the average per-unit cost of production. Economies of scale can allow large companies to sell similar goods as smaller companies at lower costs.

The economies of scale principle can be limited in that fixed costs generally need to increase with certain benchmarks in production growth. For instance, a manufacturing company that increases its rate of production over a predetermined period will eventually arrive at a point where it needs to increase the size of its factory space to oblige the increased production of its products.

## Variable Costs

[Variable costs](/variablecost), like the name suggests, are comprised of costs that differ with production. Unlike fixed costs, variable costs increase as production increases and decline as production diminishes. Instances of variable costs incorporate raw material costs and the cost of power. For a drive-through joint chain that sells french fries to increase its fry sales, for example, it should increase its purchase orders of potatoes from its provider.

It's occasionally workable for a company to accomplish a [volume discount](/volume-discount) or "price break" while purchasing supplies in bulk, wherein the seller consents to somewhat reduce the per-unit cost in exchange for the buyer's agreement to buy the supplies in large amounts consistently. Subsequently, the agreement could lessen the correlation fairly between an increase or decline in production and an increase or reduction in the company's operating costs.

For instance, the cheap food company might buy its potatoes at $0.50 per pound when it buys potatoes in amounts of under 200 pounds. In any case, the potato provider might offer the restaurant chain a price of $0.45 per pound when it buys potatoes in bulk amounts of 200 to 500 pounds. Volume discounts generally smallly affect the correlation among production and variable costs, and the trend in any case continues as before.

> Regularly, companies with a high extent of variable costs relative to fixed costs are viewed as less unpredictable, as their profits are more dependent on the progress of their sales. Similarly, the profitability and risk for similar companies are likewise simpler to check.
>
## Semi-Variable Costs

Notwithstanding fixed and variable costs, it is likewise workable for a company's operating costs to be considered [semi-variable](/semivariablecost) (or "semi-fixed"). These costs address a combination of fixed and variable parts and can be considered existing between fixed costs and variable costs. Semi-variable costs differ in part with increases or diminishes in production, like variable costs, yet exist when production is zero, like fixed costs. This basically differentiates semi-variable costs from fixed costs and variable costs.

An illustration of semi-variable costs is extra time labor. Normal wages for workers are generally viewed as fixed costs, as while a company's management can reduce the number of workers and paid work hours, it will continuously require a workforce of a size to function. Extra time payments are frequently viewed as variable costs, as the number of extra time hours that a company pays its workers will generally rise with increased production and drop with reduced production. At the point when wages are paid in view of conditions of productivity allowing for extra time, the cost has both fixed and variable parts and is viewed as a semi-variable cost.

## True Example of Operating Costs

Below is the income statement for Apple Inc. (AAPL) for the year ending Sept. 25, 2021, as per its annual [10-K](/10-k) report:

- Apple reported total revenue or net sales of $365.8 billion for the year period.
- The total cost of sales (or cost of goods sold) was $213 billion, while total operating expenses were $43.9 billion.
- We compute operating costs as $213 billion + $43.9 billion.
- Operating costs (cost of sales + operating expenses) were $256.9 billion for the period.
<!--EAF173CE287B6CA000EEC9064DC8C8EA-->
Apple's total operating costs must be inspected more than several quarters to get a feeling of whether the company is dealing with its operating costs successfully. Likewise, investors can monitor operating expenses and cost of goods sold (or cost of sales) separately to determine whether costs are either expanding or decreasing after some time.

## SG&A versus Operating Costs

Selling, general, and administrative expense (SG&A) is reported on the income statement as the sum of all direct and indirect selling expenses and all broad and administrative expenses (G&A) of a company. It incorporates every one of the costs not directly tied to making a product or playing out a help — that is, SG&A incorporates the costs to sell and deliver products or services, notwithstanding the costs to deal with the company.

SG&A incorporates almost all that isn't in that frame of mind of goods sold (COGS). Operating costs incorporate COGS plus every operating expense, including SG&A.

## Limitations of Operating Costs

Similarly as with any financial measurement, operating costs must be compared over different reporting periods to get a feeling of any trend. Companies at times can cut costs for a particular quarter, which expands their earnings briefly. Investors must monitor costs to check whether they're expanding or decreasing over the long run while likewise contrasting those outcomes with the performance of revenue and profit.

## Highlights
- Common operating costs notwithstanding COGS might incorporate rent, equipment, inventory costs, marketing, payroll, insurance, and funds allocated for research and development.
- Operating costs incorporate the two costs of goods sold (COGS) and other operating expenses — frequently called selling, general, and administrative (SG&A) expenses.
- Operating costs are the continuous expenses incurred from the normal everyday of running a business.
- Operating costs can be found and examined by looking at a company's income statement.
