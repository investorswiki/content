# Developed to Net Premiums Earned
## What Is Developed to Net Premiums Earned?

Developed to net premiums earned is the ratio of developed premiums to [net premiums](/net-premium) earned over a given period. This ratio shows whether an insurance company is charging high enough premiums to cover benefits guaranteed by the policies it composes, alluded to as its loss reserves.

The insurers must set to the side required reserves to guarantee that they have sufficient money to pay for future claims, with any money left over in the wake of making a reserve viewed as profit.
