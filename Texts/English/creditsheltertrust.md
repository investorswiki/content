# Credit Shelter Trust (CST)
## What is a credit shelter trust?
A credit shelter trust is a way that spouses can reduce federal [estate tax](/estatetax) liabilities after one or the other or the two of them have died. This trust is helpful when the value of the joint estate surpasses the estate and gift tax exemption totals, which for 2017 is $5.49 million for every individual and $10.98 million for each married couple.
## More profound definition
Under current tax law, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) permits unused bits of estate tax exemptions to be passed from a deceased spouse to the enduring one. While the enduring spouse kicks the bucket, the total estate is considered for estate tax. Assuming it surpasses the married couple exemption of $10.98 million, an estate tax of 40 percent is payable on the excess. This is known as portability.
Assuming that two or three has laid out a credit shelter trust that designates their children as beneficiaries, when the first spouse bites the dust, the assets determined in that trust go to the beneficiaries. Be that as it may, while the enduring spouse is alive, the person in question has free utilization of these assets. In certain conditions, the enduring spouse is permitted to liquidate assets.
Setting up a credit shelter trust is convoluted, and it's essential the language utilized follows IRS requirements. To guarantee a credit shelter trust accomplishes its objectives, an accomplished estate planning attorney ought to be counseled. Different trusts that have comparative implications and capabilities as credit shelter trusts incorporate detour trusts and AB trusts.
## Credit shelter trust model
Daphne and Niles have two children, Peter and Paul. On account of their effective careers, the couple's joint estate is estimated to be worth $12.5 million and is as yet developing. In spite of the fact that Daphne won't need to pay estate taxes when Niles bites the dust, their children will probably face a big tax bill when Daphne passes on the grounds that the joint estate will be greater than the $10.98 million exclusion considered a married couple. To limit future tax obligations for their relatives, they address their attorney, who draws up a credit shelter trust.
