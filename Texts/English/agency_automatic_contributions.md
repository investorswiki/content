## What Are Agency Automatic Contributions?

Agency automatic contributions are contributions made by the federal government to an employee's [Thrift Savings Plan](/thrift_savings_plan) (TSP) that equals 1% of their pay. When federal government employees lay out a TSP, the agency they work for automatically makes a contribution equivalent to 1% of their essential pay every payday. That happens regardless of whether the employee adds to their TSP.

Most normally, this feature is in [401(k) plans](/401kplan), yet it can likewise be remembered for the accompanying types of plans that permit employees to make elective contributions: 403(b) plans, 457(b) plans, [SARSEPs](/sarsep), and [SIMPLE IRA](/simple-ira) plans.

## Figuring out Agency Automatic Contributions

Agency automatic contributions are not added to taxable income for the current year's income taxes, decreasing an employee's wages by a default percentage. In any case, these automatic contributions are subject to [vesting](/vesting) boundaries. Employees are qualified for keep them — and any earnings they accrue from now on — after working three years in their positions.

Congressional and certain non-career government positions become vested after two years of service. Assuming you leave federal service before fulfilling the vesting requirement for your agency, automatic contributions and the earnings on them will be forfeited to the TSP. Assuming you pass on during your service to the government, you will automatically be considered vested in your TSP account.

## Illustration of an Agency Automatic Contribution Plan

TSP benefits can incorporate automatic payroll contributions and agency matching contributions. Participants can decide to make tax-deferred contributions into a traditional TSP, and that means the money that flows into the account won't be taxed until it is removed.

Employees new to federal employment can rollover qualified 401(k) and [individual retirement account](/ira) (IRA) assets into a TSP and vice versa in the event that they move to the private sector.

Starting in the year you turn 50, you might be eligible to make catch-up contributions to your TSP account notwithstanding your customary employee contributions.
