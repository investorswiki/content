# Child Tax Credit
## What is the child tax credit?
The child tax credit is a tax credit planned to make really focusing on children or qualifying dependents more affordable for working families. There are requirements expressing which children fit the bill for the credit, and roofs on the total credit amount accessible. You must have somewhere around $3,000 in earned income to meet all requirements for the child tax credit.
## More profound definition
As of the 2017 tax year, the maximum value of the child tax credit was $1,000 per child. The specific amount of the credit differs in view of your filing status and [adjusted gross income](/agi). The credit diminishes by $50 for each $1,000 of income that surpasses the following income thresholds:
- **Married filing separately**: $55,000
- **Single, head of household, or qualifying widow/widower**: $75,000
- **Married filing jointly**: $110,000

To claim the credit, the following requirements must be met:
- The child must be a U.S. citizen or resident alien, and be under 17 years old toward the finish of the tax year.
- The child must have a taxpayer identification number or a Social Security number.
- The taxpayer claiming the credit must have a familial or foster relationship with the child. Both foster children and adopted kids fit the bill for the child tax credit.
- The taxpayer must have given half of the child's financial support in the stated tax year, and the child must have lived with the filer for to some extent half of the year.

Not at all like other tax credits, the child tax credit isn't refundable. This means that in the event that the credit surpasses the amount of your tax obligation, the extra won't be returned as a [tax refund](/refund). An optional credit known as the extra child tax credit allows taxpayers to reclaim a portion of the non-refundable portion of the tax credit. Families who have at least three qualifying children or dependants might claim the extra tax credit.
## Child tax credit model
Atticus, a widower, files as head of household and has two qualifying children. His modified change gross income is $76,000. Since his income surpasses the threshold by $1,000, his child tax credit is diminished by $100 to a total of $1,900. This amount is deducted from his total tax liability. In the event that Atticus' modified adjusted gross income was $116,000 or more, he would be excluded from getting any child tax credit.

## Features
- To fit the bill for the credit, the taxpayer's dependent must generally be age 18, be a specific relative, have lived with the taxpayer for the greater part the year, and give something like half of their own financial support.
- For 2021 taxes, the credit was $3,000 (children under age 18) or $3,600 (children under age 6) per eligible child for American taxpayers — it was completely refundable and could be received in month to month advance payments.
- For 2020 taxes, the tax law allowed a credit against income tax of up to $2,000 per eligible child (under age 17) that was partially refundable for certain taxpayers.
- Legislation to broaden the increased credit for 2022 was not passed — accordingly, the credit will return to $2,000 and be partially refundable on an annual basis for tax year 2022.
- The Child Tax Credit is a refundable tax benefit claimed by filing Form 1040 and joining Schedule 8812 to the return.
## FAQ
### Is the Tax Credit for 2021 the Same as the 2020 Credit?
No. In spite of the fact that there are a few similitudes, the 2021 child tax credit varies fundamentally from the 2020 allowance. First, the credit increments from $2,000 for children under age 17 out of 2020 to $3,600 for every child under 6 years and $3,000 for every child age 6 up to age 17 for 2021. Additionally, beginning in July 2021, the credit was distributed in month to month advance cash payments. The 2020 credit was just partially refundable, the 2021 credit is completely refundable. The 2021 credit targets more to benefit low-and middle-income taxpayers.
### How Do the Monthly Advance Payments of the Child Tax Credit Affect the Credit on the Tax Return for 2021?
The IRS estimated the advance payments in view of the number of dependent children reported on a taxpayer's prior year return. In the event that taxpayers claim more or less eligible children for 2021, the total payment amount might be pretty much than their real credit. On the off chance that, as will be the case for most taxpayers, the advance payments comprise under a taxpayer's whole annual child tax credit, the taxpayer can claim the leftover undistributed credit balance on their 2021 tax return.If a taxpayer received advance payments that surpassed their total credit for the year, they might be required to repay the overabundance while filing their return. Nonetheless, repayments for low-income taxpayers and repayments of small amounts generally will be deferred.
### What Is the Child Tax Credit Income Limits for 2022?
For the 2021 Child Tax Credit claimed as part of 2022 tax returns, the credit is amplified for single filers making under $75,000, heads of household making under $112,500, and married filing jointly filers earning under $150,000. These figures depend on the filer's modified adjusted gross income.There are two phaseout limits for the Child Tax Credit. The first phaseout limits the Child Tax Credit amount for each $1,000 of modified adjusted gross income the taxpayer surpasses the amounts above. The first phaseout stops when the credit is diminished to $2,000 per qualifying child.The second phaseout orders a similar reduction practice ($50 reduction for each $1,000 of modified adjusted gross income above threshold limits) starting at $400,000 for married couples filing joint returns and $200,000 for any remaining filing situations with.
### Are the Advance Payments of the Child Tax Credit Treated as Taxable Income for 2021?
No. The advance payments are not treated as taxable income. Half the total credit amount was paid in advance regularly scheduled payments in 2021 and you claim the other half when you file your 2021 income tax return.
### Who Is Eligible for the Child Tax Credit?
There are qualification requirements for the taxpayer and the dependent. The taxpayer must meet certain relationship requirements with the dependent, and the taxpayer's income might limit their ability to claim the Child Tax Credit. The taxpayer must have a social security number, and just a single taxpayer might claim the Child Tax Credit for any single dependent (even in the event that that dependent can be claimed by other taxpayers).It's much of the time more hard to meet the requirements for the qualifying child. The individual must be younger than 18 toward the year's end, give something like half of their own financial support, and have lived with the taxpayer for half of the year. The qualifying child must be the taxpayer's child, little girl, stepchild, sibling, sister, stepsibling, half-kin, or a relative of any of these.
