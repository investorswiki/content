## Grasping Sub-Sovereign Obligations

Sub-sovereign obligations are issued to raise capital to finance a project that would enhance a region or community after completion. Interest payment on the obligation can be funded from the revenue that will be generated from the project or from the revenue account of the municipal issuer. Giving bodies are responsible for their own debt issues, which can carry huge risk contingent upon the financial wellbeing of the municipality.

Rating agencies assess the [risk of default](/defaultrisk) of every issuer and rate the bonds appropriately. In any case, given that these bonds are backed by a small governmental body, the risk of default is lower than that of [corporate bonds](/corporatebond). Thus, municipal bonds are typically issued with lower yields than corporate bonds.

While some sub-sovereign debt obligations are taxable, others are not. A tax-exempt bond is issued to fund a project that straightforwardly impacts the community decidedly. Interest earned on these bonds isn't subject to tax at the federal level. An investor has an additional tax-exemption benefit at the state or neighborhood level assuming they live in the state of issue.

## SSOs and Call Risk

Investors who purchase debt issued by a sub-sovereign body are presented to [call risk](/callrisk). The municipal debt obligations are callable, and that means that an issuer that desires to refinance its outstanding debt with a lower interest rate, looks for a better payment schedule, or needs a better debt covenant, can recover the bonds prior to maturity. When a bond is retired from the market on a [call date](/calldate), the bondholder stops getting interest payments.

A debtholder confronted with the risk that their bond could be called likewise faces [reinvestment risk](/reinvestmentrisk). In an economy with declining interest rates, an issuer might jump all over the chance to buy back its existing bonds and reissue the bonds at a lower interest rate.
