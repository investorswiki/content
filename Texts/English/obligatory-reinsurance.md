#### Facultative

Facultative coverage safeguards an insurer for an individual or a predetermined risk or contract. Assuming several risks or contracts need reinsurance, each is negotiated separately.

All things considered, there is likewise a hybrid rendition that gives the primary insurer the option to surrender individual risks, regardless of the reinsurer's desires.

#### Treaty
