## What Are Derivatives (and Why Are They Called That)?
A derivative is a contract that determines its value and risk from a particular security (like a stock or commodity) — subsequently the name derivative. Derivatives are some of the time called secondary securities since they just exist because of primary securities like stocks, bonds, and commodities. A few derivatives may likewise get their value from interest rates, currencies, or whole indexes of securities.
Options contracts are one famous type of derivative security. They grant their owners the right to purchase or sell a [security](/security) (generally a stock) at a specific cost at the very latest a specific expiration date. Since the value of an options contract depends in part on the value of the underlying stock or security, an options contract is viewed as a derivative (or secondary) security.
## Qualities of Derivatives
Various types of derivatives have various highlights and qualities, however there are a couple of things they all share practically speaking:
- They infer their value (and risk) from the price movement of an underlying asset or group of assets.
- They are agreements (contracts) between at least two parties.
- They terminate or settle on a particular date.

## The 4 Types of Derivative Securities
There are four fundamental types of derivative financial instruments — options, futures, forwards, and swaps.
### 1. Options
Options are contracts that grant their owners the right (yet not the obligation) to purchase or sell a specific security for a specific [strike price](/strikeprice) at the latest a specific expiration date. [Put options](/putoption) give their owners the right to sell something, and [call options](/calloption) give their owners the right to buy something.
The price an option buyer pays an option seller (some of the time alluded to as an option writer) for an options contract is called a [premium](/option-premium). An option's premium relies upon its strike price, the amount of time staying until its expiry, and the [volatility](/volatility) of the underlying asset.
Normalized options contracts can be traded on public exchanges like the NYSE and Nasdaq, or they can be traded between private parties on the over-the-counter (OTC) market. Various investors use options for various purposes, however they are most frequently used to hedge positions or hypothesize on future price movements of different securities.
### 3. Futures
A futures contract commits its buyer to purchase — and its seller to sell — a specific quantity of a particular security (frequently a commodity like corn or crude oil) at a foreordained price (generally the current market value of the security) on a particular date from here on out. In other words, futures contracts permit buyers and sellers to "lock in" the current price of an asset for a future date.
Assuming an investor estimates that oil prices will rise over the next six months, they could buy a futures contract that commits them to purchase X barrels of crude at the present price six months from now. In the event that the price of oil goes up, they can either sell the contract to another buyer for a higher premium or hold on until the contract's expiration and claim the barrels at the now-limited price.
Like options, futures are typically used to hedge positions or guess on price movement. While futures most frequently deal with commodities, contracts likewise exist for [stock indexes](/marketindex), individual stocks, currencies, and [bonds](/security). Futures have normalized terms and trade on public exchanges.
### 2. Forwards
Forward contracts are like futures in that they are agreements between two parties to buy/sell a specific asset at a foreordained cost on a specific date. They contrast from futures, nonetheless, in that they are not normalized — the terms of each contract are not set in stone by the parties in question. Thus, they are traded exclusively on the over-the-counter market — not on public exchanges.
Furthermore, while futures contracts settle daily and can be bought and exchanged by retail traders until expiration without taking delivery of the genuine commodity, forward contracts just settle upon delivery. In other words, a forward contract buyer must really take delivery of the asset being referred to (e.g., 10,000 pounds of corn). Consequently, forward contracts are well known with genuine producers and users of physical assets.
### 4. Swaps
A swap is a customized derivative contract through which two parties consent to exchange the payments or cash flows from two assets at a set frequency for a settled upon period of time. These contracts are negotiated privately — typically among organizations and additionally institutional investors instead of individuals — by means of the over-the-counter market.
One payment or cash flow is typically fixed, while the other fluctuates relying upon some component — models incorporate interest rates, currency exchange rates, stock index values, and commodity prices. Fixed-versus variable interest rate swaps and currency swaps are among the most well known types of swap contracts.
