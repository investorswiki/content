## What Is Performance Drag?

Performance drag alludes to the difference between the [return](/return) on an investment accepting there are no costs associated with it and the return on the investment in the wake of deducting costs associated with it.

The costs that cause performance drag and negatively influence the performance of an investment incorporate things, for example, paying taxes on investment returns, paying for [transaction costs ](/transactioncosts)and fees connected with keeping an investment or account or potentially holding cash in a portfolio as opposed to investing the whole value of the portfolio. Performance drag is basically undeniable.

## Understanding Performance Drag

For some traders, the genuine return of an asset is pointedly unique in relation to what might be recognized in the event that all transaction costs were taken out. This is due to the direct and indirect costs engaged with trading a security. Instances of direct costs for security trading are commissions and fees engaged with trading. Illustration of indirect costs for security trading are the opportunity costs to execute a trade as well as defers that would accompany the transaction.

A single method to relieve performance drag doesn't exist since it is caused due to different factors. Rather traders utilize investment strategies fit to their overall return objectives to limit performance drag.

## Illustration of Performance Drag

We should expect an investor pays $30 in brokerage [commissions](/commission) to buy 100 shares of ABC Company at an entry price of $24 per share and another $30 to sell those shares. In this case, the investor needs the stock's price to rise 2.5% so they can recuperate the commissions paid to do the trades (a $0.60 rise on 100 shares will rise to the $60 that the investor needs to recover the commissions. $0.60 is equivalent to 2.5% of the $24 purchase price). The 2.5% cost of the transaction will make the investor's total return drag behind the change in the price of the asset, bringing about performance drag.
