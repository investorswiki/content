# Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG)
## What Is Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG)?

Liquefied natural gas (LNG) is natural gas that has been switched over completely to a liquid form for the straightforwardness and safety of natural gas transport. Natural gas is cooled to roughly - 260 F, making an unmistakable, lackluster, and non-poisonous liquid that can be shipped from areas with a large supply of natural gas to areas that demand more natural gas.

In its liquid state, natural gas takes up 1/600th of the space, implying that natural gas is contracted 600 times, making it a lot more straightforward to ship and store when pipeline transport isn't plausible. As world energy consumption increases, specialists guess that the LNG trade will fill in significance.

## How Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) Works

Liquefied natural gas is basically used to move natural gas starting with one source then onto the next. [Exporters](/send out) utilize this method while shipping to various countries and across bodies of water when pipelines aren't free.

There are two primary ways to deal with condensing natural gas in large amounts

- The cascade cycle
- The Linde Method

The cascade cycle alludes to the cooling of one gas by another gas, bringing about a flowing effect. The Linde Method is regenerative cooling, where it is compacted, cooled, and expanded, until it is in the end cooled into a liquid.

Liquefied natural gas is best known as a vehicle instrument, yet acquiring mainstream adoption is starting. The automotive industry is assessing the helpfulness of gas as fuel for gas powered motors in over-the-street shipping, rough terrain vehicles, marine vessels, and rail lines.

## Global Demand for Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG)

Regardless of having one of the world's largest reserves of natural gas, the United States [imports](/import) a small percentage of its natural gas as liquefied natural gas from France and Trinidad. As a matter of fact, starting around 2019, the United States was the third-largest exporter of LNG and is expected to turn into the largest exporter by 2025, outperforming Australia and Qatar.

In 2020, the largest importers of U.S. LNG were South Korea, Japan, and China. Future demand growth will come from Asian countries, as they look toward LNG as a replacement for coal as an energy source.

When the natural gas is liquefied, it is then stored in special big haulers and moved to its point of objective. There is no possibility of LNG detonating on the off chance that there is any kind of break or spill. LNG and the gases that it comprises of don't detonate in an outside environment. When LNG is delivered, the natural gas is permitted to extend and change back over completely to its gaseous form by warming, a cycle known as regasification. Once regasified, the natural gas is distributed through pipelines to consumers.

Other major exporters of LNG incorporate Indonesia, Nigeria, Russia, and Malaysia. Russia has the world's largest supply of natural gas, trailed by Iran and Qatar. Starting around 2020, Japan is the world's largest importer of natural gas principally through increases in LNG purchases.

## The Future of Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG)

Global demand for LNG experienced fast growth from close to zero levels in 1970 to a significant [market share](/marketshare) today. 51% of that demand came from China, Japan, and South Korea in 2019. The LNG industry is blasting as the world expects to break away from traditional and dirtying energy sources, for example, oil and coal to zero in on clean energy.

McKinsey and Company gauges LNG demand to increase 3.4% each year till 2035. Gas will be the quickest developing petroleum derivative with an estimated growth rate of 0.9% from 2020 to 2035, and in 2020, the gas demand diminished by 3.0% while the LNG demand became by 1.0%.

## Features
- LNG [demand](/demand) is developing as the world turns towards cleaner sources of energy.
- LNG is being taken a gander at as an alternative source of fuel for automotive vehicles and different purposes as opposed to just a means of transport.
- Liquified natural gas (LNG) is natural gas that has been cooled into a liquid form for simplicity of transportation.
- The largest exporters of LNG are Australia and Qatar, with the U.S. expected to surpass them in the next couple of years.
- The largest demand for LNG comes from China.
