Any dividends or capital gains collected from the securities returns to the investors. Indian regulators are generally not in support of participatory notes since they fear that hedge funds acting through participatory notes will cause [economic volatility](/volatility) in India's exchanges.

## Participatory Notes Explained

[Foreign institutional investors](/fii) (FIIs), issue the financial instruments to investors in different countries who need to invest in Indian securities. A FII is an investor or [investment fund](/investment-fund) registered in a country outside of the one in which it is investing.

This framework allows unregistered overseas investors to buy Indian shares without the need to register with the Indian regulatory body. These investments are likewise beneficial to India. They give access to quick money to the Indian capital market. As a result of the short-term nature of investing, regulators have less rules for foreign institutional investors. To invest in the Indian stock markets and to keep away from the bulky regulatory endorsement process, these investors trade participatory notes.

## How Do Participatory Notes Work?

Participatory notes are offshore [derivative](/derivative) instruments with Indian shares as underlying assets. Brokers and foreign institutional investors registered with the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) issue the participatory notes and invest in the interest of the foreign investors. Brokers must report their participatory note issuance status to the regulatory board each quarter. The notes allow foreign investors with high net worth, hedge funds, and different investors, to partake in the Indian markets without registering with the SEBI. Investors save time, money and examination associated with direct registration.

## Upsides and downsides of Participatory Notes

Participatory notes are effectively traded overseas through endorsement and delivery. They are famous on the grounds that investors anonymously take positions in Indian markets, and hedge funds may anonymously carry out their operations. A few elements route their investments through participatory notes to exploit tax laws that are accessible in certain countries.

In any case, as a result of the anonymity, Indian regulators face difficulty determining a participatory notes original owner and end owner. Hence, substantial measures of unaccounted for money enters the country through participatory notes. This flow of unmanaged funds has raised a few red banners.

## Participatory Note Regulatory Issues

SEBI has no jurisdiction over participatory note trading. Albeit foreign institutional investors must register with the Indian regulatory board, the participatory notes trading among foreign institutional investors are not recorded. Authorities fear this practice might lead to the P-Notes being utilized for money laundering or other criminal behavior.

This failure to follow money is additionally why the Special Investigation Team (SIT) would like stricter compliance measures for the trading of participatory notes. The SIT is a particular team of officers in Indian law enforcement which comprises of staff who have been prepared to investigate serious crimes.

In any case, when the government [proposed trade restrictions](/essential controller) on the notes in the past, the Indian market turned out to be very unstable. For instance, in October 2007, the government announced it was thinking about checking participatory note trading. The announcement caused the Sensex index to plunge 1,744 points during the day's session, which was greater than an eight percent drop at that point.

This market aggravation was in response to investor and government stresses that the controling of the P-Notes would be a direct hit on the Indian economy. That is on the grounds that foreign institutional investors assist with fueling the growth of the Indian economy, industries, and capital markets, and expanding regulation would make it more hard for foreign money to enter the market. The government at last chose not to regulate participatory notes.

## Current State of Participatory Note Regulations

Participatory notes stay defenseless against regulatory decisions. In late 2017, Indian regulators determined that P-Notes can't take any derivative positions in that frame of mind because of reasons other than hedging. As reported by EconomicTimes.IndiaTimes.com, this severe regulatory intervention caused investments through P-Notes to drop all through 2018, at long last hitting a more than/long term low in November 2018. Nonetheless, investments bounced back in December 2018 after regulators loosened up a portion of the more restrictive requirements.

## True Example

P-Notes can be utilized to purchase any Indian security an investor needs through a series of steps.

An investor deposits funds with the U.S. or on the other hand European operations of a registered foreign institutional investor (FII), like HSBC or Deutsche Bank. The investors then, at that point, advise the bank regarding the Indian security or securities they wish to purchase. Funds transfer from the investor to the FII account, and the FII issues the participatory notes to the client and buys the underlying stock or stocks in the right amounts from the Indian marketplace.

The investor is eligible to receive dividends, capital gains and some other payouts due to stockholders holding the shares of the Indian company. All the FII reports its issuances each quarter to the Indian regulators, yet according to law, it doesn't uncover the identity of the genuine investor.
