# Target Risk (Insurance)
## What is Target Risk (Insurance)?

Target risk assets are classes of assets excluded from coverage under either insurance policies or reinsurance deals due to the specific risk they present. A separate insurance policy or reinsurance treaty might cover a target risk asset.

## Understanding Target Risk (Insurance)

At the point when an insurance company guarantees a policy, it consents to [indemnify](/reimbursement) the policyholder from losses coming about because of specific risks. In exchange for expecting this liability, the insurer gets a premium from the policyholder. Insurers base this premium price on historical loss experience, as well as an assessment of the possible frequency and seriousness of future losses. The insurer might conclude that a few assets are far riskier than others and may reject those things from coverage. These assets are target risks, as the insurer has specifically distinguished them for exclusion.

Exclusionary language in insurance contracts makes a disallowed class of assets that require separate insurance or [reinsurance coverage](/reinsurance). The types of assets that fall into a target risk class are normally costly to supplant or are assets that are bound to make substantial liability claims. For instance, a mortgage holder's policy might bar fine art since the value of crafted by art may far surpass the price of different things in the house. A region entering a property reinsurance treaty might find the exclusion of scaffolds on the grounds that their replacement cost is substantial.

## Target Risk in Commercial Settings

In [commercial insurance](/commercial-insurance-lines) policies, for example, liability or property insurance, insurers are frequently approached to cover a large number of business assets. For instance, a business might need its fleet of vehicles protected. In the event that the types of assets included are different, the insurer will decide whether every asset conveys a similar level of a [risk profile](/risk-profile).

An asset considered a target risk can be covered in a [facultative reinsurance treaty](/facultative-reinsurance), as this type of treaty is intended to cover a single risk or a narrow package of risks. Facultative reinsurance is not quite the same as [treaty reinsurance](/treaty-reinsurance), as this type of reinsurance has the reinsurer consequently acknowledge all ceded risks in a specific class.
