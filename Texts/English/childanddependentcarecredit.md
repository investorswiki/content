# Child and Dependent Care Credit
## What Is the Child and Dependent Care Credit?

The child and dependent care credit is a tax credit offered to taxpayers who pay out-of-pocket expenses for childcare. The credit gives relief to people and spouses who pay for the care of a qualifying child or disabled dependent while working or searching for work. The percentage of eligible expenses that fit the bill for the [tax credit](/taxcredit) shifts relying upon the taxpayer's income level, and there is a limit on the total dollar amount of expenses that qualify.

The American Rescue Plan Act of 2021, enacted March 11, 2021, rolled out huge improvements to the credit that made it more liberal and possibly refundable — meaning you never again need to owe taxes to claim the credit.

## Understanding the Child and Dependent Care Credit

You could possibly claim the child and dependent care credit in the event that you paid someone to care for a "qualifying person" so you could work or search for work. As indicated by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), a qualifying person for the credit is:

- Your dependent child who was under age 13 when they received care; or
- Your spouse who is genuinely or intellectually incapable of taking care of oneself and lived with you for the greater part of the year; or
- Someone who is truly or intellectually incapable of taking care of oneself, lived with you for the greater part of the year, and either (1) was your dependent, or (2) might have been your dependent aside from they received $4,300 or more in gross income, filed a joint return, or you (or your spouse, if filing jointly) might have been claimed as a dependent on someone else's tax return.

A person is thought about genuinely or intellectually incapable of taking care of oneself on the off chance that they're unable to dress, clean, or feed themselves or need someone else's full-time regard for stay safe or keep others safe.

Not at all like [deductions](/tax-derivation), tax credits address a dollar-for-dollar reduction in one's [tax liability](/taxliability). The credit equals a percentage of business related expenses you paid someone to care for your child or another qualifying person. For 2020, the percentage went from 20% to 35% of your allowable expenses, contingent upon your [earned income](/earnedincome) and [adjusted gross income](/agi) (AGI). The credit began to diminish assuming your AGI surpassed $15,000.

You could claim up to $3,000 of paid expenses assuming you made them qualify person or up to $6,000 for at least two people. In this way, the maximum credit for 2020 was $1,050 for one qualifying person (35% of $3,000) and $2,100 for at least two individuals ($35% of $6,000).

## Changes to the Child and Dependent Care Credit for 2021

The American Rescue Plan rolled out several important improvements to the child tax credit for the 2021 tax year as it were. In particular, the law:

- Increased the child tax credit from $1,050 to $4,000 for one qualifying person and from $2,100 to $8,000 for at least two qualifying people
- Increased the maximum credit from 35% to half of the taxpayer's business related child and dependent care expenses
- Raised the income level at which the child tax credit starts to phase out from $15,000 to $125,000
- Made the credit fully refundable for individuals who live in the U.S. for half of the year

You can now claim up to $8,000 of paid expenses for one person and up to $16,000 for at least two. That means the maximum credit for 2021 is $4,000 for one qualifying person (half of $8,000) and $8,000 for at least two individuals (half of $16,000).

The new rules likewise mean that each eligible taxpayer with an AGI of $125,000 or less will get a credit worth half of their qualifying expenses. As AGI climbs, the percentage is step by step reduced from half to 0%. For instance, on the off chance that your AGI is somewhere in the range of $173,000 and $175,000, your credit will be worth 25% of your qualifying expenses. In the event that your AGI is $438,000 or higher, you will not get the credit.

Remember that in light of the fact that the credit is presently fully refundable, you could receive a refund even you owe no taxes. For instance, on the off chance that you owe $1,000 in taxes and can claim a credit for $2,000, you could receive a $1,000 refund. Beforehand, the credit was [non-refundable](/nonrefundabletaxcredit) — meaning it could reduce your taxes to $0 however not give a refund, and any credit amount that remained was naturally forfeited.

The American Rescue Plan increased the 2021 dependent care FSA contribution limit to $10,500 for single filers and couples filing jointly (up from $5,000 in 2020) and $5,250 for married couples filing separately (up from $2,500 in 2020). This increase was a one-time exception executed by the American Rescue Plan; in 2022, the limit will return to $5,000 for single filers and couples filing jointly. Money in these FSAs is withheld from your paycheck on a pretax basis and put into a non-interest-bearing account that you can use for eligible expenses.
