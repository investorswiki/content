# Collateral Value
## What Is Collateral Value?

The term collateral value alludes to the [fair market value](/fairmarketvalue) of the assets used to secure a loan. Collateral value is commonly determined by taking a gander at the recent sale prices of comparative assets or having the asset appraised by a qualified expert.

In a secured loan, the lender has the option to get ownership of a particular asset — called the "[collateral](/collateral)" of the loan — if the borrower [defaults](/default2) on their obligation. In theory, the lender ought to recuperate all or a large portion of their investment by selling the collateral. Subsequently, assessing the value of that collateral is a key step before any secured loan is approved.

> ### Loan to Value Ratios
> The size of a secured loan relative to its collateral value is known as the [loan-to-value ratio](/loantovalue) (LTV). For instance, in the event that a bank gives a $800,000 loan to purchase a house with a collateral value of $1 million, then, at that point, its LTV ratio would be 80%.
