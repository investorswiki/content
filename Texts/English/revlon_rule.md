# Revlon Rule
## What is the Revlon Rule

The Revlon rule is the legal principle expressing that a company's [board of directors](/boardoftrustees) will put forth a reasonable attempt to get the highest value for a company, when a hostile takeover is inevitable. This addresses an all around shift in responsibility, since boards of directors are essentially entrusted with keeping takeovers from occurring in any case. Be that as it may, when a takeover is considered undeniable, the Revlon rule kicks in, and the board thusly coordinates its concentration towards getting the highest value for their partners, as part of its inherent fiduciary obligation.

## BREAKING DOWN Revlon Rule

The case that made the Revlon rule was Revlon, Inc. v. MacAndrews and Forbes Holdings, Inc., and was attempted before the Delaware Supreme Court. Delaware courts commonly didn't assess the merits of a merger except if the offended party could show the board of directors failed to act in due care or didn't act impartially. Since the 1985 case, passes judgment on treat cases distinctively in the event that they include the sale of a company, and utilize the Revlon rule for guidance.

The Revlon rule set a huge legal precedent. It shifted the board of directors' duty from taking care of the wellbeing and preservation of the corporation to expanding the short-term financial gains of shareholders. This smaller interpretation of fiduciary duties, alluded to as Revlon duties, brings about more investigation placed on a board's choices.

In the case, Revlon's board of directors boosted a [white knight](/whiteknight) bid from Forstmann, Little and Company, over a bid from Pantry Pride, a supermarket that looked for a hostile takeover bid after Revlon dismissed its initial buy offer. The board took part in several takeover defense strategies, notwithstanding Pantry Pride offering a higher bid.

## Thumbing a Nose at the Revlon Rule

What Warren Buffett needs Warren Buffett gets. In March 2015, H.J. Heinz Company and Kraft Foods Group, Inc. gone into a definitive merger agreement fully supported by Mr. Buffett. The agreement contained a no-shop provision, successfully banishing Kraft's board of directors from seeking a prevalent deal for Kraft shareholders under the soul of the Revlon Rule. Whether the board acted freely to ignore the rule or was scared to sign a no-shop clause isn't clear. It's undeniably true that Kraft was not shopped to other possible bidders, and the Buffett-upheld group caught the company according to its own preferences.
