# Term Out
## What Is Term Out?

Term out is a financial concept used to depict the transfer of debt inside, inside a company's balance sheet. This is finished through the capitalization of short-term debt to [long-term debt](/longtermdebt). Changing the classification of debt on the balance sheet permits companies to further develop their [working capital](/workingcapital) and exploit lower interest rates.

## How Term Out Works

Term out is the [accounting practice](/accounting-practice) of capitalizing short-term debt into long-term without procuring any new debt. The ability of a company or lending institution to "term out" a loan is an important strategy for debt management and regularly happens in two situations.

## Types of Term Out
### Facility Loan

A facility loan is a banking agreement that permits a company to borrow short-term financing periodically. Bank facilities are put in place by a company to guarantee it has reliable access to cash and liquidity anytime. Businesses with cyclical sales cycles or [seasonality](/seasonality) typically take out a bank facility loan to guarantee they have sufficient cash close by to purchase inventory during active times and pay employees during quiet periods.

Manufacturing companies, for instance, face high seasonality. Frequently, a large portion of a manufacturer's business comes in the late spring months, when it makes products to be sold by retailers in the fourth quarter. This means manufacturers have slow periods toward the year's end when retailers normally have their most active sales period. Be that as it may, retailers don't make a great deal of purchases during this time, and a few manufacturers are stone cold broke as they try to keep up with [payroll](/payroll).

At the point when a situation like this happens, a manufacturer can take out a facility loan to cover expenses in the fourth quarter. Then, in the event that the loan balance is especially high, the company can term out the loan and broaden the [repayment](/repayment) period, successfully renaming it from short-term debt to long-term debt. Terming out a facility loan is exceptionally advantageous for companies that have [cash flow](/cashflow) issues.

### Evergreen Loan

Evergreen loans are revolving [debt instruments](/debtinstrument). This means a company can utilize a [evergreen loan](/evergreen-loans), pay the money back, and quickly use it once more. The loan is audited by the lending institution every year, and in the event that the company keeps on gathering certain requirements, it can draw on the loan consistently. The most common type of evergreen loan is a revolving [line of credit](/lineofcredit) (LOC).

Notwithstanding, there are situations that emerge where companies completely broaden the loan and never repay the principal, all things being equal, paying only the month to month interest payments. At the point when this occurs, the lending institution can term out the loan by amortizing the principal, successfully changing the company's interest-only payments over completely to regularly scheduled payments that consolidate interest and principal.
