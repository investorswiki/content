# Clean Shares
## What Are Clean Shares?

Clean shares are a generally new class of [mutual fund](/mutualfund) shares. The mutual fund industry presented clean shares, alongside [T shares](/t-shares), in response to the Department of Labor's [fiduciary](/fiduciary) rule. This [conflict of interest](/conflict-of-interest) rule was intended to put an end to corrupt behavior among brokers and financial advisors, for example, recommending more costly fund options to clients so they could collect a higher commission. Since clean shares give a single uniform price across the board, advisors are not enticed to push a costly fund over a more affordable one.

Clean shares subsequently give investors access to precisely the same fund management as other retail mutual fund share classes, yet ordinarily with lower and more transparent costs.

## Seeing Clean Shares

Clean shares were sent off in 2017 as a manner to further develop transparency in mutual fund fees and commissions borne by investors, and to follow new regulations illuminated by the Fiduciary Rule.

As indicated by a Morningstar report, clean shares are the best method for upgrading transparency for mutual fund investors. Dissimilar to T shares, clean shares don't have front-end sales loads or annual [12b-1 fees](/12b-1fees) for fund services. Albeit clean shares might carry fees for investment management and administrative costs, these shares do exclude distribution fees or [commissions](/commission). Notwithstanding, advisory firms can in any case layer on their own extra fees for their services rendered. Brokers frequently set their own commissions for selling clean shares which can be founded on a fixed rate or a percentage, which adds some transparency for investors.

In addition to the fact that clean shares lead to higher transparency and less conflicts of interest, yet this share class could likewise offer investors big savings. As per the Morningstar analysis, clean shares and other new share classes planned in the wake of the fiduciary rule could save investors no less than 0.50% in returns, compared to current offerings. To finish it off, investors could receive an extra 0.20% in savings in light of the fact that their advisors will have the incentive to recommend the fund that is in the purchaser's best interest.

## Illustration of Clean Shares

For instance, we can compare the costs associated with two different share classes for a similar underlying mutual fund. Take the famous The American Funds Washington Mutual Investors Fund (AWSHX).

The class A fund shares charge a maximum [load](/front-endload) of 5.75% and charges a net expense ratio of 0.59% each year. With a T share class of a similar fund, an investor would in any case pay the 0.59% annually, however their broker would simply have the option to charge a maximum 2.5% sales load. With a clean share class of AWSHX, there would be zero sales load joined to the transaction. All things considered, brokers would have the option to charge a separate fee for their recommendation or continuous service. Even assuming their fee is indistinguishable across all funds, the investor can be guaranteed that their advisor isn't pushing this specific fund due to its incentive structure.
