# Anticipatory Breach
## What is anticipatory breach?
Anticipatory breach, likewise ordinarily known as an anticipatory repudiation, is a notice that one party plans to renege on a contract, setting the other party free from satisfying its finish of the agreement.
## More profound definition
Anticipatory repudiation applies when obviously one party is either reluctant or incapable to satisfy the terms of a contract by the agreed-upon cutoff time. The other party is set free from contractual obligations and is qualified for file a lawsuit for breach of contract, seeking payment or different damages. Indication that one party is reneging on a contract can come through words or actions.
Courts generally perceive three types of anticipatory repudiation:
- Express repudiation: When the other party gives a positive and unconditional refusal, either verbally or recorded as a hard copy, to satisfy guarantees made under the deal.
- Action: When one party's actions make it inconceivable for expressed party to perform as guaranteed.
- Transfer of assets: When assets or different items required for satisfying a contract have been sold to an outsider or discarded in another manner.

## Anticipatory breach model
Franny deals in old fashioned metal instruments. From the get-go in June, she agreed to sell an antique flugelhorn to Zooey for $3,000 on June 15. On June 14, Zooey advised Franny that he is done ready to purchase the flugelhorn since he has settled on an alternate wedding gift for his girl. Zooey has breached the contract through express repudiation.
On the other hand, assuming Franny had admitted to Zooey that she was unable to sell the flugelhorn since she had ruined it by accident, Franny would have breached the contract through her actions. At long last, in the event that Franny had sold the unique collectible instrument to one more party for $4,000, she would have breached the contract through the transfer of assets.

## Features
- The intent to break the contract must be an absolute refusal to satisfy the terms for it to qualify as an anticipatory breach.
- An anticipatory breach, or repudiation, seizes a disappointment of a party to meet its contractual obligations to another party.
- Parties claiming an anticipatory breach are obliged to bend over backward to moderate their own damages assuming they wish to look for compensation in court.
