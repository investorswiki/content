Notwithstanding, he likewise notes that, given his long [investment horizon](/investment_horizon), he ought to have the option to average in excess of a 3% annual return on the $400 he can invest every month.

On the off chance that John had the option to get an average annual return of 6%, his month to month investments of $400 would be worth more than $1.5 million out of 50 years' time. In light of these perceptions, John chooses to continue with the level death benefit, determined to invest an extra $400 each month for his family's sake until the end of his life.
