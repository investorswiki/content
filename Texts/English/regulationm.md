# Regulation M
## What Is Regulation M?

Regulation M, otherwise called Subchapter M, is an Internal Revenue Service (IRS) regulation that permits [regulated investment companies](/ric) to pass taxes from capital gains, dividends, and interest distributions onto individual investors. Regulation M conforms to the conduit theory, which states that investment firms ought to pass capital gains, interest, and dividends to shareholders to keep away from [double taxation](/double_taxation) by the company and the individual investors.

## How Regulation M Works

Regulation M is framed in IRS tax code Title 26, beginning with Section 851. Regulation M essentially applies to regulated investment companies that would have these payouts from investments. These companies have U.S. operations and are registered as investment companies as directed by the [Investment Company Act of 1940](/investmentcompanyact). As defined by the act legislation, these companies can take various forms and offer a wide range of investment vehicles including mutual funds, exchange-traded funds (ETFs), real estate investment trusts (REITs), and unit investment trusts (UITs).

Regulated investment companies are given qualification to go through taxes to individuals under IRS Regulation M. Most regulated investment companies use this regulation to go through distributions to shareholders to stay away from double taxation since they are not the end beneficiary of these extra dollars.

[Conduit theory](/conduittheory), otherwise called pipeline theory, proposes that regulated investment companies ought to use this qualification for tax savings. Eligible investment companies act as a conduit for certain distributions that are specific to investment company operations. Regularly the conduit decides the distribution sums which are characterized as capital gains, dividends, and interest. Due to the unique organizing of investment company management, regulated investment companies can gain an incremental benefit from paying out distributions made arrangements for shareholders. As a conduit, investment companies give determined distributions to shareholders and subsequently are not required to pay portfolio taxes on these scattered payouts.

## Mutual Fund Distributions

For instance, a mutual fund company fills in as a conduit for investors, passing on dividends, interest, and capital gains. Different distributions from a [mutual fund](/mutualfund) are paid out over time. Capital gain distributions are regularly paid annually toward the year's end.

Assume an investor claims a couple of shares of a mutual fund. The fund pays quarterly dividends and circulates an annual capital gains payout. For the year, the investor must pay taxes on the fund's all's distributions whether or not or net the payouts are reinvested. Without Regulation M, the mutual fund company might actually be subject to certain standard corporate tax rules which expect it to pay taxes on [capital gains](/capitalgain). With IRS Regulation M, double taxation is kept away from and taxes are just paid by the investor.
