## What is Acquisition Accounting?

Acquisition accounting is a set of formal rules portraying how [assets,](/asset) [liabilities](/risk), [non-controlling interest](/noncontrolling_interest) (NCI) and [goodwill](/goodwill) of a purchased company must be reported by the buyer on its [consolidated statement](/consolidatedfinancialstatement) of financial position.

The [fair market value](/fairmarketvalue) (FMV) of the acquired company is allocated between the [net tangible](/nettangibleassets) and [intangible assets](/intangibleasset) portion of the [balance sheet](/balancesheet) of the buyer. Any subsequent difference is viewed as goodwill. Acquisition accounting is likewise alluded to as business combination accounting.

## How Acquisition Accounting Works

[International Financial Reporting Standards](/ifrs) (IFRS) and [International Accounting Standards](/ias) (IAS) require all business combinations to be treated as [acquisitions](/acquisition) for the purpose of accounting, implying that one company must be distinguished as a [acquirer](/acquirer) and one company must be recognized as a [acquiree](/acquiree) even on the off chance that the transaction makes another company.

The acquisition accounting approach expects all that to be estimated at FMV, the amount a third-party would pay on the open market, at the hour of acquisition â€” the date that the acquirer assumed command over the target company. That incorporates the accompanying:

- **Substantial assets and liabilities**: Assets that have a physical form, including machinery, structures, and land.
- **Immaterial assets and liabilities**: Nonphysical assets, like licenses, brand names, copyrights, goodwill, and brand recognition.
- **Non-controlling interest**: Also known as minority interest, this alludes to a [shareholder](/shareholder) possessing under half of [outstanding shares](/outstandingshares) and having no control over choices. On the off chance that conceivable, the fair value of non-controlling interest can be derived from the share price of the acquiree.
- **Thought paid to the seller**: The buyer can pay in numerous ways, including cash, stock or a contingent [earnout](/earnout). Computations must be accommodated any future payment obligations.
- **Goodwill**: Once that multitude of steps have been taken, the purchaser must then compute assuming there is any goodwill.

## History of Acquisition Accounting

Acquisition accounting was presented in 2008 by the major accounting specialists, the [Financial Accounting Standards Board](/fasb) (FASB) and the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB), to supplant the previous method, known as purchase accounting.

Acquisition accounting was preferred on the grounds that it reinforced the concept of fair value. It centers around winning market values in a transaction and incorporates [contingencies](/possibility) and non-controlling interests, which were not represented under the purchase method.

One more difference between the two strategies is the manner by which bargain acquisitions are dealt with. Under the purchase method, the difference between the acquired company's fair value and its purchase price was recorded as [negative goodwill](/negativegoodwill) (NGW) on the balance sheet that should have been [amortized](/amortization) over the long haul. Interestingly, with acquisition accounting, NGW is promptly treated as a gain on the [income statement](/incomestatement).

Every part of assets and liabilities of the acquired substance must be adjusted for fair value in things going from [inventory](/inventory) and agreements to hedging instruments and contingencies, to give some examples.

The amount of work expected to adjust and incorporate the books of the two companies is one primary justification behind the long period between agreement on a deal by the particular [boards of directors](/boardofdirectors) and the real deal closing.
