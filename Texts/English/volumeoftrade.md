## How Volume of Trade Works

Each market exchange tracks its trading volume and gives volume data. The volumes of trade numbers are reported as frequently as once an hour all through the current trading day. These hourly reported trade volumes are estimates. A trade volume reported by the day's end is likewise an estimate. Last genuine figures are reported the following day.

Investors may likewise follow a security's tick volume, or the number of changes in an agreement's price, as a substitute for trade volume, since prices will generally change all the more regularly with a higher volume of trade.

Traders can likewise utilize several technical analysis indicators that consolidate volume. The [Securities and Exchange Commission](/sec) (SEC) directs the sale of securities by traders. As indicated by [Rule 144](/sec), sellers can't make security sales surpassing 1% of outstanding shares of a similar class being sold.

## Illustration of Volume of Trade

Assume a market comprises of two traders, trader 1 and trader 2. The principal trader purchases 500 shares of stock ABC and sells 250 shares of XYZ. The other trader sells those 500 shares and purchases the 250 shares of stock XYZ to the principal trader. The total volume of trade in the market is 750 (500 shares of ABC + 250 XYZ shares). This is on the grounds that we don't twofold count the volume â€” when trader 1 purchases 500 ABC shares from trader 2, just 500 shares are counted. In like manner, just 250 shares of XYZ would be recorded on the volume count.
