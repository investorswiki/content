A hedonic pricing model is much of the time used to estimate quantitative values for environmental or ecosystem services that straightforwardly influence market prices for homes. This method of valuation can require a strong degree of statistical mastery and model determination, following a period of data assortment.

The hedonic pricing model is utilized to estimate the degree to which each factor influences the [market price](/market-price) of the property. While running this type of model, if non-environmental factors are controlled for (held consistent), any leftover disparities in price will address differences in the great's outside environmental factors.

At the home cost model, the price of the home would be examined in view of independent factors, like separation from a park. With that, the outcome would seem something as per, for each mile closer to a park the home value increments by $10,000.
