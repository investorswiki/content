# Hyperledger Sawtooth
## What Is Hyperledger Sawtooth?

Hyperledger Sawtooth is a [open source](/open-source) project under the [Hyperledger](/hyperledger) umbrella, and functions as an enterprise level [blockchain](/blockchain) system utilized for creating and operating [distributed ledger](/distributed-ledgers) applications and networks particularly for use by enterprises.

## Understanding Hyperledger Sawtooth

Developed by the Linux Foundation in collaboration with IBM, Intel, and SAP, the underlying design concept of Hyperledger Sawtooth aims to keep the ledgers genuinely distributed, and make [smart contracts](/smart-contracts) much secure and in this manner suitable for businesses. It is an implementation of [blockchain-as-a-service](/blockchainasaservice-baas) (BaaS).

In most standard blockchain-based systems, core and applications are facilitated and executed on the same platform, which may lead to performance issues as well as security concerns.

Hyperledger Sawtooth segregates the core ledger system from the application specific environment, in this manner improving on the application development yet keeping the system safe and secure. Utilizing this architecture, a designer can construct applications in their programming language of decision that can be facilitated, operated, and run on the system fringe without impeding the core blockchain system.

Upheld languages incorporate C++, Go, Java, JavaScript, Python and Rust. A Sawtooth application can be based on a core business logic required for a business need, or it tends to be developed and run as a smart contract virtual machine that has a self-overseeing mechanism for creating, informing and executing the contracts between various participants on the blockchain.

The core system allows applications to coincide on the same blockchain, chooses transaction rules, chooses the necessary permissioning mechanism, and characterizes the consensus algorithms that are utilized to finalize the working of the digital ledger such that best backings the requirements of an enterprise.

## How Hyperledger Sawtooth Works

Sawtooth enables particular authorizations - that is, one can easily send certain select clusters of Sawtooth hubs with various consents on the same blockchain. The ledger stores the necessary details about the authorizations, hubs and personalities.

The operating performance of the Sawtooth network is helped by the mechanism of parallel transaction execution, which has an upper hand over the serial execution mechanism that frequently is a bottleneck while dealing with high volumes of transactions on many popular cryptocurrency networks.

Sawtooth upholds Proof of Elapsed Time (POET) [consensus mechanism](/consensus-mechanism-cryptocurrency) that offers benefits of low resource utilization and low energy consumption, and is usually utilized on the permissioned blockchain networks to conclude the mining rights or the block victors on the network..)

A few real-world examples utilizing Sawtooth-based applications incorporate Sawtooth Supply Chain, which assists an enterprise with keeping track of contextual and planned operations related information of an asset addressed on the blockchain, Sawtooth Marketplace, which assists participants with trading in determined quantities of digital assets on the blockchain, and Sawtooth Private UTXO, which facilitates digital asset creation and trading, including off-ledger and privately-held transactions.

## Highlights
- Hyperledger is an umbrella blockchain development group sponsored by organizations, for example, the Linux Project, IBM, Intel, and SAP.
- Hyperledger Sawtooth upholds a variety of consensus algorithms, including Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance (PBFT) and Proof of Elapsed Time (PoET)
- Hyperledger Sawtooth is an open source enterprise blockchain-as-a-service platform that can run tweaked smart contracts without having to know the underlying design of the core system.
