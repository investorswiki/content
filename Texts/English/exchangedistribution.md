# Exchange Distribution
## What Is an Exchange Distribution?

The term "exchange distribution" alludes to the sale of a large block of stock or one more security that is reported as a large, single [transaction](/transaction) following the order is complete. Exchange distributions happen when a [broker](/broker) receives a number of buy orders for similar stock or security and sells them in a single block simultaneously. Given the complexity of such a trade, brokers receive an extra [commission](/commission) for distributing orders from the sellers as opposed to the buyers.

## How an Exchange Distribution Works

An exchange distribution becomes vital when an individual or party who stands firm on a huge footing in a specific security needs to sell the [shares](/shares) as one transaction as opposed to splitting the request into various [trades](/trade). The order might be comparative in size to a [block trade](/blocktrade), which might be sold to just a single buyer and may not even happen on the [open market](/open-market).

> Exchange distributions are unique in relation to block trades; the former includes numerous buyers while the last option includes a single one.

Large block orders can't be filled, however, except if there are different buyers who each need to buy a portion of the shares. Despite the fact that there is no precise definition of the number of shares that make a block, it generally includes something like 10,000 shares on a non-[penny stock](/pennystock) or a [bond](/bond) transaction adding up to $200,000 or more. These trades normally start from huge [hedge funds](/hedgefund) and institutions since they're typically too large for individual investors to start.

To convey a large sell order, a broker circles the requesting price to a group from possible buyers. When the matching of an adequate number of orders is complete, it can report on the [exchange](/exchange) as a single trade. This grouping can make the presence of a solitary position between one buyer and one seller, even when it addresses a wide range of buyers purchasing shares from one seller.

Most individual investors don't have the sheer [volume](/volume) of [securities](/security) associated with exchange distributions. This means that assuming these trades were reported individually, the daily trading data might be skewed. That is the reason brokers really must report these trades following they're complete as one, single transaction.

## Special Considerations

Brokers frequently charge buyers a commission when they execute conventional trades. However nowadays, retail investors can execute trades on online brokerage platforms with next to no commission. These are commonly little measured trades.

In any case, things work somewhat better with regards to exchange distributions and other related trades. Buyers frequently have an incentive to partake in purchasing a portion of a large block of shares since they as a rule don't need to pay a [commission](/commission) on the transaction executed by a broker.

The responsibility of paying these costs rather falls on the seller of a large block. As a matter of fact, the selling broker might require even more compensation to connect with the participation of other [registered representatives](/registeredrepresentative) and firms that take part in the transaction.

## Exchange Distribution versus Exchange Acquisition

Buying is something contrary to selling, right? On the off chance that brokers execute an exchange distribution for large buy orders of a similar security, there must be a term that depicts large buy [orders](/order). Something contrary to an exchange distribution is an exchange acquisition. In this sort of acquisition, brokers take care of one large buy request by grouping more modest orders from investors ready to sell. These transactions are likewise reported as one single trade even assuming various sellers were required to take care of that request.
