# Advance Determination Ruling (ADR)
## What Is an Advance Determination Ruling?

An advance determination ruling (ADR) is a decision or ruling issued by the [Internal Revenue Service](/irs) to a taxpayer about a taxation or pricing matter. While determination letters from the IRS ordinarily address transactions that have proactively happened, they may likewise be issued on the tax results of proposed transactions, subsequently the term "advance." It is otherwise called an "Advance Pricing Agreement." The IRS has broad carefulness in declining to consider an advance determination request and furthermore has broad watchfulness in declining to issue a ruling even however it might have agreed to consider the ADR request.

## Understanding Advance Determination Ruling (ADR)

Most advance determination rulings (ADRs) concern the tax-exempt status of organizations and employee benefit plans. Determination letters are issued to [tax-exempt](/tax_exempt) organizations, for instance, showing the determination of the IRS that the organization is to be sure tax exempt and which provision of the tax code is the basis for the exemption. The determination letter is binding on the IRS insofar as current realities and law underlying the determination stay in place. Assuming the taxpayers' realities or the law changes, the letter may presently not be legitimate. While companies might like to get an advance determination ruling before any transaction whose tax perspectives are indistinct, it may not generally be imaginable from a commonsense viewpoint.

## ADR and Transfer Pricing

ADRs frequently include matters about [transfer price](/transferprice), which is the price at what divisions of a company execute with one another, like the trade of supplies or labor between offices. For instance, consider a transaction that includes transfer pricing between a U.S. company and its foreign subsidiary. Assuming this transaction is finished up before the ADR is gotten from the IRS, in the event of an adverse ruling, the company might need to change or reverse the transaction and furthermore be possibly subject to fines. The IRS perceives that international transfer pricing cases can frequently lead to extensive and costly administrative requests and litigation.

The purpose of the ADR strategy is to reduce the vulnerabilities and work on the consistency for both the taxpayer and the government due to international transactions, and furthermore to facilitate the cost burden and expense of an examination important to determine transfer pricing discussions for both the taxpayers and the governments in question. The IRS will make a judgment about the request in the wake of dissecting the data supplied by the taxpayer, along with other important data. The IRS will survey the submission, and if important, examine it with the taxpayer, and, whenever found acceptable, issue a ruling.
