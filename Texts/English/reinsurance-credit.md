## What Is Reinsurance Credit?

Reinsurance credit is an accounting entry made by an insurer for [premiums](/premium) ceded to reinsurers and losses recovered from reinsurers. [Reinsurance](/reinsurance) credit procedures permit an insurance company to treat money owed by reinsurers for covered losses as assets.

At the point when an insurance company goes into a reinsurance contract, it is consenting to shift a portion of the risk from the policies that it has guaranteed to the reinsurer, and thus, will give the reinsurer a portion of the premium that it procures on those policies. It is an accounting move made by insurance companies that helps them not to lose money in the event that customers don't pay their bills.

## How Reinsurance Credit Works

This is the risk associated with the reinsurer becoming bankrupt, and consequently becoming incapable to satisfy its portion of the reinsurance agreement. If the reinsurer can't cover the claims that it is contractually committed to, the insurance company might wind up with a lot bigger liability than anticipated.

Insurance companies consider this [credit risk](/creditrisk) through reinsurance credits. These are accounting passages that permit it to show that it actually has expected exposure to loss (non-admitted balance), however ideally the loss would be covered by the reinsurance company.

> Utilizing reinsurance permits an insurer to endorse more policies in light of the fact that its overall [risk profile](/risk-profile) is decreased, yet additionally opens up the insurer to reinsurance credit risk.

## Risk Profile

The credit risk might fluctuate as per the reinsurer that the [ceding company](/ceding-company) is working with, as each reinsurer may have an alternate level of creditworthiness from the other. Normally, insurance companies will set up [internal controls](/internalcontrols) to ensure that the reinsurers that they work with have adequate capital to stay dissolvable assuming claims are documented.

A reinsurance credit entry permits the insurer to either list reinsurance as an asset or as a reduction in liability just when the reinsurer meets an essential set of requirements as put forward by the insurance company.

These requirements remember the reinsurer being licensed to give reinsurance to the state that the insurer is operating in, the reinsurer filing the suitable regulatory documentation, and the reinsurer submitting to financial surveys.

## Special Considerations

As per a paper distributed on Actuaries.org, insurers must deal with industry concentration and single-name concentration with regards to reinsurance. Why? The paper states: "The number of reinsurers is small (when compared to the number of bond issuers) thus a common insurer — anyway reasonable — is probably going to have concentrated exposure to individual names.

## Features
- A reinsurance credit entry empowers insurers to account for money owed by reinsurers for covered losses as assets.
- Since the number of reinsurers in a given market and sector is generally small, insurance agencies regularly have exposure to just a limited number of names.
- The reinsurance credit entry can be treated as a reduction in the insurer's liability just while the reinsuring agency meets a specific set of requirements, for example, being licensed to work in the state and having a decent credit rating.
