# Designated Roth Account
## What Is a Designated Roth Account?

A designated Roth account is a separate account in a [401(k](/401kplan)), [403(b](/403bplan)), or legislative [457(b)](/457plan) that holds designated Roth contributions. Designated Roth contributions are elective deferrals that the participant chooses to remember for gross income.

## How a Designated Roth Account Works

Designated Roth account matching contributions can be made by employers, just as contributions can be made to 401(k) or 403(b) accounts. Investors can make contributions both to a pretax, traditional retirement account, and a designated Roth account during the equivalent [tax year](/taxyear), however the total contributions are subject to an annual contribution limit.

For designated Roth accounts, the annual contribution limit is equivalent to limits for 401(k) plans, which is $19,500 for 2021 (expanding to $20,500 in 2022), with a $6,500 catch-up contribution for those 50 and more established in the two 2021 and 2022.

Employers might offer employees an opportunity to make after-tax salary deferral contributions to a separate designated Roth account in the employer's 401(k), 403(b), or legislative 457(b) retirement plan.

Not at all like pretax elective deferrals, the amount employees add to a designated Roth account is includable in [gross income](/grossincome). Notwithstanding, distributions from the account are generally tax-free, remembering already untaxed earnings for the account.

## Special Considerations
### Employer Matching

Just employee [elective deferrals](/electivedeferralcontribution) might be contributed to a designated Roth account. [Matching contributions](/matchingcontribution) and profit-sharing contributions may not be made straightforwardly to the designated Roth account.

An employer might involve designated Roth deferrals in working out a matching contribution, yet the match amount must be contributed to one more account inside the plan.

### Tax Treatment

Designated Roth contributions are dealt with equivalent to pretax elective deferrals for some reasons, including the accompanying:

- Annual contribution limits
- Nonforfeitability and [distribution](/distribution) limitations and nondiscrimination testing
- [Required least distributions](/requiredminimumdistribution) (RMDs)
- Computations of the plan's deduction limits

## Benefits of a Designated Roth Account

Qualified distributions from a designated Roth account are excludable from gross income. Generally, a distribution fits the bill for income exclusion when it happens over five years after the initial contribution to the account and when the participant is age 59\u00bd or more seasoned, kicks the bucket, or becomes disabled. A 401(k), 403(b), or legislative 457(b) plan might permit employees to assign some or all of their plan [elective deferrals](/electivedeferralcontribution) as after-tax Roth contributions.

SARSEP and SIMPLE IRA plans may not offer designated Roth accounts. When a participant adds to a designated Roth account, the participant can't later change the contributions to pretax deferrals, so no re-portrayals are permitted. Participants might have the option to roll over an eligible [rollover](/rollover) distribution to a designated Roth account from one more account in a similar plan.

Compared to a [Roth IRA](/rothira), designated Roth accounts offer bigger annual contribution limits than Roth IRAs and are not subject to the modified gross income limitations that confine a few people from adding to Roth IRAs and permit participants to keep their Roth and pretax savings inside a single plan.

## FAQ
### What Is the Difference Between a Roth IRA and a Designated Roth Account?
Bigger contribution limits are permitted in a designated Roth account than are permitted in a Roth IRA ($19,500 versus $6,000 in 2021 and $20,500 versus $6,000 in 2022). Furthermore, a designated Roth account isn't subject to the modified adjusted gross income (MAGI) limits that keep a few people from adding to a Roth IRA.
### What Is the Contribution Limit for a Designated Roth Account?
The contribution limit for a designated Roth account is equivalent to that for a 401(k); $19,500 in 2021 and $20,500 in 2022. For both 2021 and 2022, there is a catch-up contribution limit of $6,500.
### Might I at any point Have Both a 401(k) and a Roth IRA?
Indeed, you can have both a 401(k) and a Roth IRA. It is a common practice. Be that as it may, on the off chance that your income is too high you will most likely be unable to add to a Roth IRA in light of the income limitations.
