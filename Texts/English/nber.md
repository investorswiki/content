##  Job of NBER In Modern Economics

The in excess of 1,600 economists who are NBER researchers are the leading researchers in their fields. Most NBER-partnered researchers are either Faculty Research Fellows (FRFs) or Research Associates (RAs). Personnel Research Fellows are regularly junior researchers. Research Associates, whose arrangements are approved by the NBER Board of Directors, hold tenured positions at their home institutions.

The group took in $32 million for the year ended June 30, 2020, as per its financial statement.

The economist Paul Krugman, writing in the New York Times, said NBER is "best depicted, I'd say, as the old-kid network of economics made tissue. There are several NBER offices, however they're little; what the organization mostly comprises of is its partners and what they do. In many sub-fields of economics, just about anyone notable in the calling is a NBER research partner; it's normal for these partners to release new research as NBER working papers.

The function of these papers, thusly, is to get research out rapidly so different economists can examine it (which incorporates reprimanding it). For working economists, the NBER WP series gives what adds up to one-stop shopping for new advancements in their field."
