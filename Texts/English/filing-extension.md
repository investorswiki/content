# Filing Extension
## What Is a Filing Extension?

A filing extension is an exemption that can be made to either individual taxpayers or businesses that are unable to file a tax return to the federal government by the due date. Individuals can complete and file IRS Form 4868 by the regular date of their return-which is normally April 15 — for an automatic half year extension. Most business tax returns can be extended by filing IRS Form 7004.

However, the extension of time to file does not provide a corresponding extension for payment of taxes owed. An explanation of the reason for the extension isn't required. Some states accept IRS extensions, however others require taxpayers to file a separate state extension form.

## How a Filing Extension Works

Taxpayers who can't pay their taxes will not gain anything by not filing an extension, they will likewise pay a lot greater penalty than those who file and can't pay. The failure-to-file penalty is normally 5% of the total amount owed per month — and can go as high as 25% — while the failure-to-pay penalty is just 0.5% of the amount owed per month. The interest runs until the tax is paid in full. Beginning with returns due after Dec. 31, 2019, in the event that a return is more than 60 days late, the extra tax is $435 or 100% of the amount due, whichever is less, an increase from $330.

There are three different ways for a taxpayer to request an automatic extension of time to file an individual tax return:

1. Pay all or part of their estimated income tax due and indicate that the payment is for an extension
1. File Form 4868 electronically by accessing IRS [e-file](/efile) utilizing a home computer or with the help of a tax professional who uses e-file
1. File a paper Form 4868 and enclose payment of the estimate of tax due.

U.S. citizen and resident taxpayers who are out of the country on the regular due date are allowed two extra months to file returns — and pay any amount due — without requesting an extension. However, interest will in any case be charged on payments made after the regular due date, regardless of the extension.

For businesses organized as [C corporations](/c-corporation), the filing extension is due by the fifteenth day of the fourth month after the end of its tax year. For businesses organized as [S corporations](/subchapters), the income tax return or extension is due by the fifteenth day of the third month after the end of its tax year. For businesses organized as partnerships, the extension is due by the fifteenth day of the third month after the end of its tax year. For example, the due date for an extension of a S corporation with a fiscal year ending April 30, 2020, would be July 15, 2020.
