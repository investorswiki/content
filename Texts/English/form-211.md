# Form 211
## What Is Form 211: Application for Award for Original Information?

Internal Revenue Service (IRS) Form 211 is an application that must be submitted to the IRS by a "whistleblower" who looks to claim a reward for giving information about [tax evasion](/taxevasion) to the U.S. government. In the event that the IRS can recuperate funds in view of a whistleblower's or alternately informant's claim, the whistleblower or informant will receive a percentage of funds recuperated.

The title of Form 211 is Application for Award for Original Information.

## Understanding Form 211: Application for Award for Original Information

A whistleblower can submit IRS Form 211 to claim a reward except if the [U.S. Department of the Treasury](/ustreasury) employed them at the hour of getting or giving the information on the tax evasion, or the person is a present or former federal government employee who received the information in the course of official duties.

Likewise, the IRS expects that the information is specific, upheld, and believable; not an estimate.

Form 211 rewards can be substantial, up to 30% of the extra tax, punishments, or different amounts the IRS collects because of the information.

The IRS runs two whistleblower reward programs. Under the first program, assuming that the IRS collects taxes, interest, and punishments on an amount surpassing $2 million, the whistleblower might be rewarded 15 to 30 percent of the amount the IRS collects.

Assuming the whistleblower is reporting an individual taxpayer, that person must have an annual income in an amount greater than $200,000 for the whistleblower to be eligible to collect 15% to 30% of the funds recuperated. Under the first program, on the off chance that the whistleblower isn't content with the outcome of the investigation, they can bring it before the [Tax Court](/taxcourt) in an appeal. Rules for this program are available in the [Internal Revenue Code](/internal-revenue-code) (IRC) Section 7623(b).

Under the subsequent whistleblower reward program, whistleblowers can file Form 211 to inform the IRS of tax evasion in amounts under $2 million, or by individuals earning under $200,000. Whistleblowers utilizing this subsequent program might collect a maximum of 15% of the total funds recuperated, up to $10 million. They may not appeal the situation to the Tax Court. The rules for informant claims under this program can be found at IRC 7623(a).

Any whistleblower award received under the program is subject to taxation.

## Instructions to File Form 211: Application for Award for Original Information

The whistleblower submits Form 211, under penalty of prevarication, to the IRS at the accompanying address:

Internal Revenue Service Whistleblower Office - ICE

1973 N. Rulon White Blvd.

M/S 4110

Ogden, UT 84404

The Application for Award for Original Information can be downloaded off the IRS website.

The Form isn't intended to be utilized to resolve personal disputes between individuals or business partners. The program searches for a "huge Federal tax issue," not small tax botches.

## Whistleblower Financial Results

Commonly, the greater part of the claims wind up getting an award. In 2016, 761 claims were submitted, bringing about 418 awards for a total of $61 million on an extra $369 million collected in taxes.

In 2017, there were 367 claims and 242 awards for a total of $34 million paid out on $190 million in extra collections.

In 2018, there were 423 claims and 217 awards. The award payouts totaled $312 million on $1.4 billion collected in extra taxes.

Awards are commonly not paid out for something like eight years after a claim has been submitted, as the evidence gathering and subsequent collection of the tax funds takes a lot of time. The whistleblower isn't paid out until there is a last determination on the amount really collected.

## Instance of Using Form 211 to Report Tax Evasion

Expect a person, like an employee, knows that their company is dodging taxes to a huge degree. Without breaking different laws, the person could collect information on the degree of the tax evasion, as well as those included, and other appropriate information.

When the person has gathered this information, they download Form 211, finish it up, and send it to the IRS alongside their point by point information on the supposed tax offense. False information is punishable under penalty of prevarication.

The Form is received by the IRS. They will decide whether the case is worth chasing after. Assuming they continue they will [audit](/audit) or investigate the supposed culpable company.

Assuming that the information fits the bill for an award, the award amount (percentage of total) is discretionary, and it normally requires over seven years for the whistleblower to receive payment for the information. This is on the grounds that the information gathering and tax collection can require years. The whistleblower is just paid out once the last count for monies collected on the avoided taxes not entirely settled.

On the off chance that the IRS can collect $10 million in dodged taxes because of the whistleblower's information, they might fit the bill for an award somewhere in the range of 15% and 30% of the total.

In the event that the funds require nine years to collect (counting the investigation or audit), and the IRS decides a payout of 20%, the whistleblower would receive a check for $2 million, less [withholding tax](/withholdingtax)**,** nine years after they file the Form.

The whistleblower is responsible for reporting the award amount on their taxes and paying the fitting taxes on it.
