# Matrix Trading
## What Is Matrix Trading?

Matrix trading is a [fixed income](/fixedincome) trading strategy that searches for disparities in the [yield curve](/yieldcurve), which an investor can capitalize upon by founding a [bond swap](/bondswap). Inconsistencies come about when current yields on a particular class of bond —, for example, corporate or municipal, for instance — don't match up with the remainder of the yield curve or to its historical standards.

## Understanding Matrix Trading

Matrix trading is a strategy of swapping bonds to exploit impermanent differences in the [yield spread](/yieldspread) between bonds with various ratings or various classes. An investor playing out a matrix trade could be hoping to profit simply as a [arbitrageur](/arbitrageur) — by waiting for the market to "right" a yield spread disparity — or by trading up for free yield, for instance, by swapping debt with comparative risks however unique [risk premiums](/riskpremium).

Matrix trading might require matrix pricing. At the point when a particular fixed income instrument isn't vigorously traded, the trader must concoct a value at it since recent costs may not necessarily in all cases mirror the real value in a [thinly traded ](/thinly-traded)market. Matrix pricing includes assessing what the price of a bond ought to be by taking a gander at comparable debt issues and afterward applying calculations and recipes to coax out a reasonable value. On the off chance that the current price is not the same as the expected value, the trader can devise a strategy for making the most of the mispricing.

Matrix traders eventually expect that apparent mispricings in relative yields are bizarre and will address over a short period of time. Yield curves and yield spreads can be lost historical examples for quite a few reasons, yet the majority of those reasons will have a common source: uncertainty with respect to traders.

Individual classes of bonds may likewise be wastefully priced for a while, similar to when a prominent corporate [default](/default2) sends shock waves through other corporate debt instruments with comparable ratings. While certain bonds may not be straightforwardly impacted by the event by any means, they actually experience mispricing as traders hope to reshuffle positions or view the future as uncertain. As the dust settles, the prices will generally return to their legitimate values.

## Matrix Trading Risks

Matrix trading isn't without risk. Mispricings can happen for good explanation, and may not right back to expected levels. A higher yield than expected could be due to selling pressure in a bond connected with the underlying company's battles that haven't been completely realized yet.

Additionally, conditions might keep on decaying, even assuming there is not a great explanation for it. During a [market panic](/capitulation), mispricings can be broad and enduring. While the mispricing might sort itself out, a trader will be unable to endure the losses meanwhile.

Like any strategy, matrix traders profit when what they hope to happen happens. On the off chance that they are off-base, and the mispricing doesn't right itself or keeps on moving against them bringing about a loss, they will hope to exit the position and limit losses.

## Illustration of Matrix Trading

Expect that the difference in interest rates between U.S. short-term [Treasuries](/on-the-runtreasuries) and AAA-evaluated corporate bonds has historically been 2%, while the difference among Treasuries and AA-appraised bonds is normally 2.5%.

Company XYZ has an AAA-evaluated bond yielding 4% and its rival ABC Corp. has an AA-evaluated bond yielding 4.2%. The difference between the AAA and AA bond is just 0.2% rather than the historic 0.5%. A matrix trader would buy the AAA-evaluated bond and sell the AA-evaluated bond, expecting the yield spread to broaden (causing the price of the AA bond to fall as its yield rises).

Traders may likewise take a gander at ranges rather than specific numbers, and become interested when the spread goes outside the historical reach. For instance, a trader might notice that the spread among AA and AAA is frequently contained somewhere in the range of 0.4% and 0.7%. In the event that a bond moves essentially outside this reach, it cautions the trader that something important is going on, or that there is potential mispricing that can be exploited.

Comparable strategies can be employed for bonds arranged in various [maturities](/development), in various economic sectors, and in various countries or regions.
