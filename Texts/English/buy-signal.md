## What Is a Buy Signal?

A buy signal is an event or condition chosen by a trader or investor as an alert for entering a purchase order for an investment. Buy signals can be either seen by examining chart patterns or calculated and automated by trading systems.

For instance, [momentum investors](/momentum_investing) may compare the relative strength of several investment decisions throughout the course of recent months and select the best performing decision as a candidate to add to their portfolio in the approaching month. Then again, short-term traders might utilize devices, for example, [moving averages](/movingaverage) or other technical studies to enter a position on some random day.

Then again, a trader utilizing an automated trading system may consequently create buy and sell signals in view of a set of rules.

The absolute most common buy signals include:
