# Non-Controlling Interest
## What Is Non-Controlling Interest?

A non-controlling interest, otherwise called a [minority interest](/minorityinterest), is an ownership position wherein a shareholder claims under half of outstanding shares and has no control over decisions. Non-controlling interests are estimated at the [net asset value](/nav) of substances and don't account for potential [voting rights](/votingright).

Most [shareholders](/shareholder) of public companies today would be classified as holding a non-controlling interest, with even a 5% to 10% equity stake viewed as a large holding in a single company. A non-controlling interest might be diverged from a controlling, or majority interest in a company, where the investor has voting rights and can frequently influence the course of the company.

## Grasping Non-Controlling Interest

Most shareholders are conceded a set of rights when they purchase common stock, including the right to a cash [dividend](/dividend) in the event that the company has adequate [earnings](/earnings) and declares a dividend. Shareholders may likewise reserve the option to vote on major corporate decisions, for example, a [merger](/merger) or company sale. A corporation can issue various classes of stock, each with various shareholder rights.

Generally, there are two types of non-controlling interests: a direct non-controlling interest and an indirect non-controlling interest. A direct non-controlling interest gets a proportionate allocation of all (pre and post-acquisition sums) recorded equity of a subsidiary. An indirect non-controlling interest gets a proportionate allocation of a subsidiary's post-acquisition sums as it were.

It is generally not until an investor controls 5% to 10% of the shares that they convey specific recommendations to the board and management, propose changes to the board of directors, propose changes at a shareholder meeting and team with different investors to make their actions bound to succeed. Such investors are named Activist investors. Activist investors range widely in style of action and objectives. Objectives range from seeking operational improvements to restructuring to natural environment and social policy.

## Financial Statements and Non-Controlling Interest

Consolidation is a set of financial statements that join the accounting records of several elements into one set of financials. These normally incorporate a parent company, as the majority owner, a subsidiary, or a purchased firm, and a non-controlling interest company. The consolidated financials permits investors, creditors, and company managers to see the three separate elements as though every one of the three firms are one company.

A consolidation likewise expects that a parent and a non-controlling interest company jointly purchased the equity of a subsidiary company. Any transactions between the parent and the subsidiary company, or between the parent and the non-controlling interest firm, are wiped out before the [consolidated financial statements](/consolidatedfinancialstatement) are made.

## Illustration of Non-Controlling Interest

Expect that a parent company buys 80% of XYZ firm and that a non-controlling interest company buys the leftover 20% of the new subsidiary, XYZ. The subsidiary's assets and liabilities on the balance sheet are adjusted to [fair market value](/fairmarketvalue), and those values are utilized on the consolidated financial statements. In the event that the parent and a non-controlling interest pay more than the fair value of the net assets, the excess is posted to a [goodwill](/goodwill) account in the consolidated financial statements.

Goodwill is an extra expense incurred to buy a company for more than the fair market value, and goodwill is amortized into an expense account after some time after an impairment test. This is finished under the [purchase acquisition accounting](/purchaseacquisition) method approved by the [Financial Accounting Standards Board](/fasb) (FASB).
