## What is a deduction?
A deduction is an amount that you can deduct from your gross income to bring down the amount of tax you pay. The IRS offers taxpayers the option of utilizing a standard deduction or to organize individual deductions. For single individuals and married individuals filing separately, the standard deduction is $6,350 for the 2017 tax year. For married individuals filing jointly, the standard deduction is $12,700.
## More profound definition
The IRS permits taxpayers to deduct certain amounts of money from their gross income to genuinely reduce their tax bill. The amount that can be deducted relies upon the marital status of the taxpayer and whether married taxpayers file separately or jointly. The amount that can be deducted is adjusted every year in accordance with inflation.
Aside from being sorted as single or married, the IRS permits certain taxpayers to claim a deduction as a head of household. This is somebody who is unmarried, is responsible for the greater part the household expenses and resides with dependent family individuals.
As an alternative to the standard deduction, taxpayers who bring about qualifying expenses have the decision of organizing their deductions. This benefits the taxpayer on the off chance that the itemized deductions surpass the standard deduction applicable to the taxpayer. Qualifying expenditures that can be itemized for deduction include:
- Medical expenses.
- State and municipal taxes.
- Personal property taxes.
- Interest on mortgages.
- Interest from investments.

The IRS has rules with respect to organizing deductions so not all qualifying expenditures can be deducted. Moreover, the amount that might be claimed as a deduction is capped for taxpayers who have large incomes.
Taxpayers can either claim the standard deduction or itemized deductions, yet all the same not both.
