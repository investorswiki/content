## What Is MBIA Insurance Corporation?

MBIA Insurance Corporation is a company that gave insurance to municipalities that issue [bonds](/bond). A division of the publicly-exchanged MBIA, Inc. (MBI), MBIA Insurance Corporation was a primary worldwide issuer of financial guarantee insurance.

## How MBIA Insurance Corporation Works

MBIA insurance was utilized to back municipal bonds and structured finance products, and as a road to credit enhancement for municipal bond issuers, as MBIA's insurance guaranteed to pay interest and principal on any bonds that experience an issuer [default](/default2).

Bill Ackman, hedge fund manager, said in 2002 that parent company MBIA didn't merit its AAA rating and called for a split of the municipal bond insurance business from the structured finance business. This was due to the way that MBIA's credit default swaps sold on mortgage-backed collateralized debt obligations would have been an issue at last, Ackman asserted. The hedge fund manager was right as MBIA crashed during the financial crisis.

Municipal bond insurers were hit hard with the financial crisis. The majority of recently issued municipal bonds carried insurance before the crisis. In any case, the fallout from the crisis has forced a large decline in municipal insurance. Also, major rating agencies, for example, MBIA and Ambac, saw their ratings pushed down.

From that point forward, market share has stayed packed as interest rates stay at historical lows. Companies, for example, MBIA have endeavored to oversee risks. In 2014, MBIA began a municipal-just unit called National Public Finance Guarantee. MBIA likewise has not written any new insurance beginning around 2017 after S&P cut its ratings.

## Special Considerations

The presence of MBIA insurance on municipal bonds recently guaranteed an AAA [rating](/rating) or its equivalent from the major rating agencies, which made the bonds considerably more marketable to investors.

MBIA Insurance Corporation gave insurance to back [municipal bonds](/municipalbond), otherwise called munis. To support investor confidence, numerous urban communities (the issuer of municipal bonds) purchased insurance through MBIA Insurance Corporation to get a higher rating and guarantee the bonds.

Bond issuers found they could bring down the total cost of giving debt by purchasing MBIA insurance, as the higher rating the bonds accumulate, the lower the issuer could change the [coupon rate](/coupon-rate) while introducing to investors.

## Requirements for MBIA Insurance Corporation

MBIA insurance is purchased the same way different types of insurance are, with the policyholder choosing specific measures of coverage and a [underwriter](/underwriter) computing the risks to the insurer of giving this coverage to decide the price of the insurance. The risks are calculated by the probability that the bond issuer will default on the bond and MBIA should pay out to investors, so the stability of the project the bond funds is the key indicator of risk.

In the event that the project succeeds and collects the money the issuer predicts it will, the issuer can undoubtedly pay investors without a need to conjure MBIA's insurance coverage. On the off chance that the project doesn't succeed, the issuer won't have the funds to pay investors and will default.

MBIA and its rivals attempted to keep their own credit ratings at the highest levels, as this made their services considerably more significant to clients and investors. A bond issuer is probably not going to pay for insurance from a company with a terrible credit rating that could default on paying out to investors.
