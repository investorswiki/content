# Liquidity Trap
## What Is a Liquidity Trap?

A liquidity trap is a disconnected economic situation wherein interest rates are extremely low and [savings rates](/savings-rate) are high, delivering [monetary policy](/monetarypolicy) ineffective. First portrayed by economist John Maynard Keynes, during a liquidity trap, consumers decide to keep away from bonds and keep their funds in cash savings as a result of the overall conviction that interest rates could before long rise (which would push bond prices down). Since bonds have an inverse relationship to interest rates, numerous consumers would rather not hold an asset with a price that is expected to decline. Simultaneously, central bank efforts to prod economic activity are hampered as they are unable to lower interest rates further to boost investors and consumers.

## Understanding Liquidity Traps

In a liquidity trap, should a country's reserve bank, similar to the [Federal Reserve](/federalreservebank) in the USA, try to invigorate the economy by increasing the [money supply](/moneysupply), there would be no effect on interest rates, as individuals needn't bother with to be urged to hold extra cash.

As part of the [liquidity](/liquidity) trap, consumers keep on holding funds in standard deposit accounts, like savings and checking accounts, rather than in other investment options, even when the [central banking system](/centralbank) endeavors to animate the economy through the injection of extra funds. High consumer savings levels, frequently prodded by the conviction of a negative economic event on the horizon, makes monetary policy be generally ineffective.

The confidence in a future negative event is key, in light of the fact that as consumers crowd cash and sell bonds, this will drive bond prices down and yields up. In spite of rising yields, consumers are not interested in that frame of mind as bond prices are falling. They like rather to hold cash at a lower yield.

A notable issue of a liquidity trap includes financial institutions having issues finding qualified borrowers. This is accumulated by the way that, with interest rates moving toward zero, there is no place for extra incentive to draw in very capable applicants. This lack of borrowers frequently appears in different areas too, where consumers normally borrow money, for example, for the purchase of cars or homes.

## Indications of a Liquidity Trap

One marker of a liquidity trap is low [interest rates](/interestrate). Low interest rates can influence bondholder behavior, alongside different worries with respect to the current financial state of the nation, bringing about the selling of bonds in a manner that is destructive to the economy. Further, augmentations made to the money supply fail to bring about price level changes, as consumer behavior inclines toward saving funds in low-risk ways. Since an increase in money supply means more money is in the [economy](/economy), it is reasonable that a portion of that money ought to flow toward the higher-yield assets like bonds. Yet, in a liquidity trap it doesn't, it just moves buried in that frame of mind as savings.

Low interest rates alone don't characterize a liquidity trap. For the situation to qualify, there must be a lack of bondholders wishing to keep their bonds and a limited supply of investors hoping to purchase them. All things considered, the investors are focusing on severe cash savings over bond purchasing. On the off chance that investors are as yet interested in holding or purchasing bonds on occasion when interest rates are low, even moving toward zero percent, the situation doesn't qualify as a liquidity trap.

## Restoring the Liquidity Trap

There are a number of ways of assisting the economy with emerging from a liquidity trap. None of these may chip away at their own, however may assist with actuating confidence in consumers to begin spending/investing again as opposed to saving.

1. The Federal Reserve can raise interest rates, which might lead individuals to invest a greater amount of their money, instead of crowd it. This may not work, yet it is one potential solution.
1. A (big) drop in prices. At the point when this occurs, individuals can't help themselves from spending money. The bait of lower prices turns out to be too appealing, and savings are utilized to exploit those low prices.
1. Increasing government spending. At the point when the government does as such, it suggests that the government is committed and certain about the national economy. This strategy likewise fuels job growth.

Governments sometimes buy or sell bonds to assist with controlling interest rates, yet buying bonds in such a negative environment does pretty much nothing, as consumers are anxious to sell what they have when they are able to. In this manner, it becomes challenging to push yields up or down, and harder yet to prompt consumers to exploit the new rate.

As talked about above, when consumers are unfortunate due to past events or future events, it is difficult to instigate them to spend and not save. Government activities become less effective than when consumers are more gamble and yield-chasing as they are the point at which the economy is sound.

## Real World Examples of Liquidity Traps

Japan confronted deflation through the 1990s, and of 2019 still has a negative interest rate of - 0.1%.

Interest rates were set to 0%, yet investing, consumption, and inflation all stayed subdued for a very long time following the level of the crisis. The European Central Bank turned to [quantitative easing](/quantitative-easing) (QE) and a [negative interest rate policy](/negative-interest-rate-policy-nirp) (NIRP) in an areas to free themselves from the liquidity trap.
