# Rolling Settlement
## What Is a Rolling Settlement?

A rolling settlement is the method involved with settling security [trades](/trade) on successive dates in light of the specific date when the original trade was made so that trades executed today will have a [settlement date](/settlementdate) one business day later than trades executed yesterday.

This contrasts with [account settlement](/account_settlement), in which all trades are settled once in a set period of days, paying little mind to when the trade took place. Trade settlement alludes to when the security is delivered after the trade is executed.

## Understanding Rolling Settlement

Securities that are sold on the [secondary market](/secondarymarket) normally settle two business days after the initial [trade date](/tradedate). Thus, on the off chance that a few stocks within a portfolio are sold on Wednesday, these trades will settle on Friday assuming that there are no market occasions. In like manner, stocks in that equivalent portfolio that are sold on Thursday would settle on the next Monday assuming there are no market occasions, etc.

At the point when securities are sold and settled on successive [business days](/business-day), they are supposed to encounter a rolling settlement. In contrast, investors who participate in account settlement will see every one of the trades placed within a defined period of time settling around the same time.

For instance, assuming an institution settles all trades that take place the 1st through the 15th of the month on the 16th of the month, all investors who placed trades throughout that period will see their settlements around the same time. An investor who has purchased a security won't receive the security in their account and formally own that security until the trade has settled.

## Settlement Periods

In 1975, Congress enacted Section 17A of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, which directed the [Securities and Exchange Commission](/sec) (SEC) to establish a national clearance and settlement system to facilitate securities transactions. Thus, the SEC created rules to oversee the method involved with trading securities, which incorporated the concept of a settlement cycle.

The SEC additionally determined the actual length of the settlement period. Originally, the settlement period gave both buyer and seller the time to do what was essential — which used to mean hand-conveying [stock certificates](/stockcertificate) or money to the respective specialist — to satisfy their part of the trade.

Today, money is transferred instantly, but the settlement period stays in place — both as a rule and as a convenience for traders, brokers, and investors.

Presently, most online brokers expect traders to have sufficient assets in their accounts before buying stock. Likewise, the industry no longer issues paper stock certificates to represent ownership. Although a few stock certificates still exist from the past, securities transactions today are recorded almost solely electronically utilizing a cycle known as [book-entry](/bookentrysecurities); and electronic trades are backed up by account statements.

## Highlights
- The thought is to permit trades to hit an investor's or alternately trader's account not long after they happen, rather than waiting for a specific day of every month (for example account settlement).
- Rolling settlement is the clearing of trades over a predetermined series of days.
- Most stocks settle on a rolling basis in view of the second business day after they were executed (T+2).
