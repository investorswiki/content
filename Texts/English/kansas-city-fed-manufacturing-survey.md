# Kansas City Fed Manufacturing Survey
Official name: Survey of Tenth District Manufacturers

What precisely? Regional manufacturing index that covers Colorado, Kansas, Nebraska, Oklahoma, Wyoming, northern New Mexico and western Missouri. The production index signals industrial facility area expansion when over zero and contraction when below it.

Source: Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City

Recurrence: Quarterly

Delivered when? Around the eighteenth of February, May, August and September at 11 a.m. Eastern. Data for prior month.

Market significance: None. Not accessible until after the national Purchasing Managers' Index - - as well as a large group of other regional manufacturing indices - - have been delivered. Too dated. Not worth tracking.
