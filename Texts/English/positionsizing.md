# Position Sizing in Investment
## What Is Position Sizing?

Position sizing alludes to the number of units invested in a specific security by an investor or trader. An investor's account size and risk tolerance ought to be considered while determining proper position sizing.

## Understanding Position Sizing

Position sizing alludes to the size of a position inside a specific portfolio, or the dollar amount that an investor will trade. Investors use position sizing to assist with determining the number of units of security they that can purchase, which assists them with controlling risk and expand returns.

While position sizing is an important concept in practically every investment type, the term is generally closely associated with day trading and currency trading ([forex](/forex)).

## Position Sizing Example

Utilizing right position sizing includes weighing three unique factors to determine the best course of action:

### Account Risk

Before an investor can utilize proper position sizing for a specific trade, they must determine his account risk. This normally gets communicated as a percentage of the investor's capital. As a rule of thumb, most retail investors [risk something like 2%](/two-percent-rule) of their investment capital on any one trade; fund managers normally risk not exactly this amount.

For instance, on the off chance that an investor has a $25,000 account and chooses to set their maximum account risk at 2%, they can't risk more than $500 per trade (2% x $25,000). Even on the off chance that the investor loses 10 sequential trades in succession, they have just lost 20% of their investment capital.

### Trade Risk

The investor must then determine where to place their [stop-loss order](/stop-lossorder) for the specific trade. In the event that the investor is trading stocks, the trade risk is the distance, in dollars, between the planned entry price and the stop-loss price. For instance, assuming that an investor means to purchase Apple Inc. at $160 and place a stop-loss order at $140, the trade risk is $20 per share.

### Legitimate Position Size

The investor presently realizes that they can risk $500 per trade and is risking $20 per share. To figure out the right position size from this data, the investor just has to partition the account risk, which is $500, by the trade risk, which is $20. This means 25 [shares](/shares) can be bought ($500/$20).

## Position Sizing and Gap Risk

Investors ought to know that even on the off chance that they utilize right position sizing, they might lose more than their predefined account risk limit if a stock [gaps](/gaprisk) below their stop-loss order.

On the off chance that increased volatility is expected, for example, before company earnings declarations, investors might need to split their position size to reduce hole risk.
