There are two methods for ascertaining the retention ratio. The primary formula includes finding retained earnings in the [shareholders' equity](/shareholdersequity) section of the balance sheet.

1. Get the company's net income figure listed at the lower part of its income statement.
1. Partition the company's retained earnings by the net income figure.

The alternative formula doesn't utilize retained earnings yet rather deducts dividends distributed from net income and partitions the outcome by [net income](/netincome).

## Special Considerations

The retention ratio is regularly higher for [growth companies](/growthcompany) that are encountering fast expansions in incomes and profits. A growth company would like to plow earnings back into its business on the off chance that it accepts that it can reward its shareholders by expanding incomes and profits at a quicker pace than shareholders could accomplish by investing their dividend receipts.

Investors might forego dividends on the off chance that a company has high growth possibilities, which is commonly the case with companies in sectors like technology and biotechnology.

The retention rate for technology companies in a moderately beginning phase of development is generally 100%, as they only occasionally pay dividends. Be that as it may, in mature sectors like utilities and telecommunications, where investors expect a reasonable dividend, the retention ratio is regularly very low due to the high dividend payout ratio.

The retention ratio might change over time, contingent upon the company's earnings volatility and dividend payment policy. Numerous [blue chip](/bluechip) companies have a policy of paying consistently expanding or, in any event, stable dividends. Companies in defensive sectors, for example, drugs and consumer staples are likely to have more stable payout and retention ratios than energy and commodity companies, whose earnings are more cyclical.

## Limitations of Using the Retention Ratio

A limitation of the retention ratio is that companies that have a lot of retained earnings will likely have a high retention ratio, however that doesn't be guaranteed to mean the company is investing those funds back into the company.

Likewise, a retention ratio doesn't work out how the funds are invested or on the other hand on the off chance that any investment back into the company was done really. It's best to use the retention ratio alongside other financial metrics to decide how well a company is conveying its retained earnings into investments.

Similarly as with any financial ratio, it's additionally important to compare the outcomes with companies in similar industry as well as monitor the ratio north of several quarters to decide whether there's any trend.

## Real World Example

Below is a copy of the balance sheet for Meta (META), formerly Facebook, as reported in the company's annual 10-K, which was recorded on Jan. 31, 2019.

- In the shareholders' equity section, the company's retained earnings added up to $41.981 billion for the period (highlighted in green).
- From the company's income statement (not shown) it posted a profit or net income of $22.112 billion for a similar period.
- Work out its retention ratio by the following: $41.981 billion/$22.112 billion, which equals 1.89 or 189%.

The explanation the retention ratio is so high is that the tech company has accumulated profit and didn't pay dividends. Accordingly, the company had a lot of retained earnings to invest in the company's future. A high retention ratio is exceptionally common for technology companies.
