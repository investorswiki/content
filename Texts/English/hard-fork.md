# Hard Fork (Blockchain)
## What Is a Hard Fork?

A hard fork (or hardfork), as it connects with [blockchain](/blockchain) technology, is an extreme change to a network's protocol that makes previously invalid blocks and transactions substantial, or the other way around. A hard fork requires all hubs or users to upgrade to the most recent variant of the protocol software.

Forks might be initiated by engineers or individuals from a crypto community who become disappointed with functionalities offered by existing blockchain executions. They may likewise arise as an approach to publicly support funding for new technology projects or [cryptocurrency](/cryptocurrency) offerings.

A hard fork can be stood out from a [soft fork](/soft-fork).

## Grasping a Hard Fork

A hard fork is when hubs of the freshest form of a blockchain never again acknowledge the more established version(s) of the blockchain; which makes a long-lasting divergence from the previous rendition of the blockchain.

Adding another rule to the code basically makes a fork in the blockchain: one path follows the new, upgraded blockchain, and the other path proceeds with the old path. Generally, before long, those on the old chain will understand that their rendition of the blockchain is obsolete or irrelevant and immediately upgrade to the most recent variant.

## How Forks Work

A fork in a blockchain can happen in **any** crypto-technology platform — not just [Bitcoin](/bitcoin). That is on the grounds that blockchains and cryptocurrency work in basically the same manner regardless of which crypto platform they're on. You might think of the blocks in blockchains as cryptographic keys that move memory. Since the excavators in a blockchain set the rules that move the memory in the network, these diggers grasp the new rules.

Notwithstanding, **all** of the excavators need to concur about the new rules and about what contains a legitimate block in the chain. So as needs be "fork it" — like a fork in a street — to show that there's been a change in or a redirection to the protocol. The engineers can then refresh all of the software to mirror the new rules.

It is through this forking system that different digital currencies with names like bitcoin have become: bitcoin cash, bitcoin gold, and others. For the easygoing cryptocurrency investor, it very well may be hard to differentiate between these cryptocurrencies and to plan the different forks onto a timetable. To take care of sort this, we have made a history out of the most important bitcoin hard forks of the past several years. Moreover, those hoping to engage with one of the most outstanding cryptocurrency exchanges need to proceed carefully while investing in currencies like Bitcoin so as not to sit around idly and money on some unacceptable digital currency.

> As the realistic below shows, hubs that are not upgraded reject the new rules, which makes a divergence, or hard fork, in the blockchain.

## Purposes behind a Hard Fork?

There are a number of justifications for why engineers might execute a hard fork, for example, rectifying important security risks found in more established renditions of the software, to add new usefulness, or to reverse transactions —, for example, when the [Ethereum](/ethereum) blockchain made a hard fork to reverse the hack on the Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO).

After the hack, the Ethereum community consistently casted a ballot for a hard fork to roll back transactions that redirected huge number of dollars worth of digital currency by an anonymous hacker. The hard fork additionally assisted DAO token holders with getting their [ether](/ether-cryptocurrency) (ETH) funds returned.

The proposal for a hard fork didn't precisely unwind the network's transaction history. Rather, it migrated the funds tied to the DAO to a recently made smart contract with the single purpose of allowing the original owners to pull out their funds.

DAO token holders could pull out ETH at a rate of roughly 1 ETH to 100 DAO. The extra balance of tokens and any ether that stayed because of the hard fork was removed and distributed by the DAO caretakers to give "safeguard security" for the organization.

## Hard Forks versus Soft Forks

Hard forks and soft forks are basically the very as in when a cryptocurrency platform's existing code is changed, an old form stays on the network while the new variant is made.

With a soft fork, only one blockchain will stay substantial as users take on the update. Though with a hard fork, both the old and new blockchains exist one next to the other, and that means that the software must be refreshed to work by the new rules. The two forks make a split, however a hard fork makes two blockchains and a soft fork is intended to bring about one.

Taking into account the differences in security among hard and soft forks, practically all users and designers call for a hard fork, even when a soft fork seems like it could finish the work. Redesiging the blocks in a blockchain requires a gigantic amount of computing power, yet the privacy acquired from a hard fork checks out than utilizing a soft fork.

## Features
- A hard fork can happen in any blockchain, and not just Bitcoin (where hard forks have made Bitcoin Cash and Bitcoin SV, among several others, for instance).
- In a hard fork, holders of tokens in the original blockchain will be conceded tokens in the new fork too, however diggers must pick which blockchain to confirm.
- A hard fork alludes to an extreme change to the protocol of a blockchain network that successfully brings about two branches, one that follows the previous protocol and one that follows the new variant.
