# Manufacturing Resource Planning
## What Is Manufacturing Resource Planning?

Manufacturing Resource Planning (MRP II) is an integrated data system utilized by businesses. Manufacturing Resource Planning (MRP II) advanced from early [Materials Requirement Planning (MRP)](/mrp) systems by including the integration of extra data, like employee and financial necessities.

The system is designed to concentrate, coordinate, and cycle data for effective decision making in planning, design engineering, [inventory management](/inventory-management), and [cost control](/cost-control) in manufacturing.

Both MRP and MRP II are viewed as ancestors to [Enterprise resource planning (ERP)](/equityriskpremium), which is an interaction by which a company, frequently a manufacturer, oversees and coordinates the important parts of its business.

An ERP management data system incorporates areas like planning, purchasing, inventory, sales, marketing, finance, and [human resources](/humanresources). ERP is most often utilized with regards to software, with numerous enormous applications having been developed to assist companies with executing ERP.

## Understanding Manufacturing Resource Planning (MRP II)

MRP II is a PC based system that can make itemized production schedules utilizing real-time data to facilitate the appearance of part materials with machine and labor availability. MRP II is utilized widely without anyone else, but on the other hand it's utilized as a module of greater [enterprise resource planning (ERP)](/erp) systems.

MRP II is an extension of the original materials requirements planning (MRP I) system. Materials requirements planning (MRP) is one of the principal software-based integrated data systems designed to improve [productivity](/productivity) for businesses.

A materials requirements planning data system is a sales forecast-based system used to schedule raw material [deliveries](/delivery) and quantities, given suppositions of machine and labor units required to satisfy a sales forecast.

By the 1980s, manufacturers realized they required software that could likewise tie into their accounting systems and forecast inventory requirements. MRP II was given as a solution, which remembered this usefulness for expansion to every one of the capabilities offered by MRP I.

### Real-World Examples of MRP II Software

Coming up next are a small sampling of some famous MRP II software suppliers, as of mid 2020:

- IQMS
- Fishbowl
- FactoryEdge
- Prodsmart
- abas
- Oracle Netsuite Manufacturing Edition
- Epicor
- S2K Enterprise

### MRP I versus MRP II

In every way that really matters, MRP II has effectively supplanted MRP I software. Most MRP II systems deliver all of the usefulness of a MRP system. Be that as it may, as well as offering master production booking, bill of materials (BOM), and inventory tracking, MRP II gives usefulness inside logistics, marketing, and general finance.

For instance, MRP II can account for variables that MRP isn't — including machine and staff capacity — giving a more realistic and comprehensive representation of a company's operating capabilities. Numerous MRP II solutions likewise offer simulation includes that permit administrators to enter variables and see the downstream effect. In view of its ability to give feedback on a given operation, MRP II is sometimes alluded to as a shut circle system.

MRP I incorporated the accompanying three major functionalities:

- master production booking
- bill of materials
- inventory tracking

MRP II incorporates those three, plus the accompanying:

- machine capacity planning
- demand forecasting
- quality affirmation
- general accounting

MRP II systems are still in wide use by manufacturing companies today and can either be found as independent solutions or as part of an enterprise resource planning (ERP) system. Enterprise Resources Planning (ERP) software systems are viewed as the replacements of MRP II software.

ERP suites incorporate applications well outside the scope of manufacturing. These can incorporate everything from human resources and customer relationship management to enterprise asset management.

## Features
- Both MRP and MRP II are viewed as ancestors to Enterprise resource planning (ERP).
- Manufacturing Resource Planning (MRP II) is an integrated data system utilized by businesses.
- MRP II is an extension of materials requirement planning (MRP).
