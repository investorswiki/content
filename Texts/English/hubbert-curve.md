# Hubbert Curve
## What Is the Hubbert Curve?

The Hubbert curve is a method for anticipating the reasonable [production rate](/production-rate) of any finite resource over the long run. At the point when plotted on a chart, the outcome looks like a symmetrical [bell-formed curve](/chime curve).

The theory was developed during the 1950s to portray the production cycle of [fossil fuels](/nonrenewableresource). Nonetheless, it is presently viewed as an accurate model for the production cycle of any finite resource.

## How the Hubbert Curve Works

The Hubbert curve was proposed by Marion King Hubbert in 1956 in a show to the [American Petroleum Institute](/american-petroleum-institute) named "Thermal power and the Fossil Fuels." As its name recommends, Hubbert's show was initially centered around the production of non-renewable energy sources. Be that as it may, the Hubbert curve has since turned into a well known and widely accepted method for projecting the production rates of natural resources all the more generally.

Of special significance to investors is the Hubbert curve's prediction about when the pinnacle of resource production is probably going to happen. While investing in another project, for example, an oil well, substantial [upfront costs](/capitalexpenditure) must be invested before the project starts generating a saleable product. On account of oil wells, this incorporates drilling the well, setting up key equipment, and covering work force costs before the oil starts to flow. When the key infrastructure is in place, production volumes will step by step gather before ultimately beginning to decline once the oil in the well has been to a great extent exhausted.

By consolidating factors, for example, the natural reserves of the well, the likelihood of discovering oil in a given region and the speed at which oil can be separated from the ground, Hubbert's model had the option to foresee when a well would arrive at its level of maximum production. In visual terms, this happens in the curve, just before the depletion of the well purposes production rates to decline.

## Real World Example of the Hubbert Curve

Hubbert's model functions admirably both for individual projects and for whole regions. For example, the Hubbert curve can be utilized to portray the entirety of global oil output as well as the regional production of areas like Saudi Arabia or Texas. The outward presentation and predictions of the model are strikingly comparable and accurate in the two cases.

Of course, in reality, production rates won't show up as an entirely symmetrical curve. By the by, the Hubbert curve is widely utilized as a close estimate of real production rates. When such notable application is the alleged [Hubbert Peak Theory](/hubbert-top theory), which has been utilized to foresee [peak oil](/peak_oil) production around the world.

As per some industry analysts, the Hubbert top for oil production in the United States was reached during the 1970s, in spite of the fact that there is little consensus on when the top for global oil production will be reached. One justification for this conflict is that [new technologies](/upgraded oil-recuperation) for separating oil might have pushed the date for any forced decline in production further into what's to come.

## Features
- The Hubbert curve is a method for anticipating the production rate of any finite resource.
- It was first developed in 1956 to make sense of production rates of petroleum derivatives.
- Today, the Hubbert curve is utilized across different resource sectors and has educated banter around the rate regarding change in global oil production rates.
