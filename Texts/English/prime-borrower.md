## What Is a Prime Borrower?

A prime borrower is somebody who is viewed as a below-normal credit risk. This type of borrower is viewed as prone to make loan payments on time and liable to repay the loan in full.

## Grasping Prime Borrower

Prime borrowers have credit documents that show a strong history of utilizing credit carefully and dealing with loans capably. Accordingly, their [credit scores](/credit_score) will generally fall on the higher finish of the range, but not so high as those of [super-prime](/superprime-credit) borrowers. While prime borrowers represent a low risk to lenders and creditors, super-prime borrowers represent the least risk. A prime credit score normally falls some place in the 640 to 740 territory, however the specific score that is viewed as prime relies upon the scoring model utilized.

Prime borrowers generally experience no difficulty getting approved for new credit cards with favorable terms and conditions or getting approved for mortgages or different loans. Disregarding this, prime borrowers actually may not be eligible for lenders' advertised rates, which are in some cases expected exclusively for super-prime borrowers.

On the off chance that a prime borrower's credit score slips below the reach classified as prime, the borrower can never again effectively get new loans and credit cards or get the best terms. Borrowers with credit issues, who are classified as [subprime](/subprime) or close prime, quite often need to pay higher rates.

## Various Scores for Different Credit Bureaus

Equifax, Experian, and TransUnion, which are the three major [credit bureaus](/creditbureau), each has their credit scoring reach and methods for characterizing borrowers. At times, each of the three credit bureaus will consider a borrower a prime borrower. In different cases, be that as it may, one credit bureau will consider a borrower a prime borrower, and another will put a similar borrower in an alternate category. Beside the fluctuating scoring methods, once in a while every one of the three bureaus has marginally unique data about a borrower's credit history on the grounds that not all creditors report to each bureau.

For instance, assuming a borrower has a delinquent vehicle loan that was simply reported to TransUnion, the borrower's TransUnion score could make the borrower a close prime borrower. A similar individual's Equifax score, which doesn't factor that delinquent loan into the credit score, could bring about a prime borrower classification. Consequently, borrowers might benefit from reaching several distinct lenders while shopping for a loan. Various lenders might pull a borrower's credit score from various credit bureaus, and that means the borrower might meet all requirements for a better rate with one lender over another.
