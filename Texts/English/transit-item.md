## What Is a Transit Item?

A transit thing is any check or draft that is issued by an institution other than the bank where it was initially deposited. Transit things are isolated from internal transactions including checks that were written by a bank's own customers.

Transit things are submitted to the drawee's bank through either direct show or by means of a nearby [clearinghouse](/clearinghouse).

## Grasping Transit Items

Suppose John composes Susan a personal check in the amount of $50, drawn from his checking account at Wells Fargo. Susan takes the personal check to her own bank, Bank of America, to deposit it in her own checking account. Since the thing is drawn from an account in an alternate bank from where it is being deposited, it is a transit thing.

Transit things can likewise be introduced to the drawee bank through one of the [Federal Reserve Banks](/federalreservebank) or a regional check-processing center. These checks are normally drawn and arranged by banks before their own checks are handled.

At the point when a bank accepts a transit check or other transit thing for deposit, it must clear the thing with the bank on which it's drawn. This means it needs to confirm that there are adequate funds in the account on which the thing is drawn to cover the thing, and afterward get those funds from the responsible bank.

## How Banks Handle Transit Items

Most banks will place a hold on a deposited transit check, as permitted by [Federal Reserve Regulation CC](/regulation-cc). Regulation CC permits banks to place a [hold ](/hold)of as long as nine days on transit things. Most banks will place a hold on a transit thing long enough for the thing to clear the account on which it's drawn. Since the thing is drawn on an account at an alternate bank from the one where it's been deposited, this can require a couple of days.

Be that as it may, many banks make funds from deposited transit things accessible the next business day after the deposits, or two business days after the fact, as an issue of policy. This is conceivable in light of the fact that electronic check conversion and different forms of electronic bank draft conversion make it conceivable to clear transit things quicker.

In the event that there are [insufficient funds](/nsf) in the account on which it's drawn, the transit thing won't clear. At the point when this occurs, the funds won't be deposited as plans. At times, a bank might consent to cash a transit thing before it has cleared, however in the event that it doesn't clear, the bank will then, at that point, debit the amount from the depositor's account to cover the error.
