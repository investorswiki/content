## What Is a Takeunder?

A takeunder is an offer to purchase or obtain a public company at a price for each share that is not exactly its current market price. A takeunder is quite often unsolicited and generally happens when the target company is in serious [financial distress](/financial_distress) — or has some other major problem that compromises its long-term reasonability.

Regularly, a takeunder possibly happens when a company's stock is under descending pressure. On the off chance that the trend proceeds, the takeunder price may before long be more than the company is worth; for this reason shareholders might acknowledge the offer (even however it is below the market value).

## Grasping a Takeunder

A takeunder is a corporate purchase out that is like a [takeover](/takeover) in many regards, with the exception of the potential purchase price, since a conventional takeover target would for the most part receive a premium to its market price from an expected bidder. For instance, a company that receives an offer to be acquired at $20 per share — when its shares are trading at $22 — would be viewed as the subject of a takeunder offer. Note that in a takeunder situation, the offer is probably not going to be at an extremely large discount to the current market price, since the target company's shareholders would be very far-fetched to tender their shares in the event that the offer is substantially below the current market price. Nonetheless, the securing company might know about regrettable conditions that may possibly impact the target company (or is as of now in progress) that isn't known to the market.

Existing shareholders can sell their shares at the (higher) market price, as opposed to the takeunder price.

The target company might dismiss a takeunder endeavor outright as a [low-ball](/lowball) offer, yet it might give the offer due consideration in the event that it is faced with unfavorable difficulties. This might incorporate desperate financial straits, steep erosion in market share, legal difficulties, etc. In such cases, assuming the company accepts that its possibilities of survival are greatly improved assuming it is acquired as opposed to continuing as an independent entity, it might prescribe to its shareholders to acknowledge the takeunder offer.

Generally speaking, the potential for a takeunder scenario emerges when an entity is viewed as at this point not suitable. Albeit a management team can put on a decent face, and, surprisingly, secure some speculative funding, in every way that really matters, an acquisition is the last best option.
