## What Is a Bank Investment Contract (BIC)?

A bank investment contract (BIC) is a security or portfolio of securities that offer a guaranteed [rate of return](/rateofreturn). A bank offers such a deal to investors for a foreordained period, typically one to 10 years, albeit a few contracts can be for a couple of months.

These contracts regularly yield lower interest rates however at a lower level of risk, which makes them suitable for investors seeking to safeguard as opposed to develop their wealth. Pension and retirement funds are the absolute greatest buyers of bank investment contracts. On the off chance that you are an employee who invests through your boss' [401(k) plan](/401kplan) or pension fund, you could in a roundabout way put resources into a BIC through your retirement plan.

## Understanding a Bank Investment Contract (BIC)

Bank investment contracts are like [guaranteed investment contracts](/guaranteedinvestmentcontract) (GICs), which are issued by insurance companies. Albeit these contracts generally incorporate relatively okay securities, they are very illiquid, and that means they won't be quickly sold or exchanged for cash. Investors who buy these contracts are generally required to leave the money they invest in them however long the contract might last.

One advantage to BICs is that not at all like [certificates of deposit](/certificateofdeposit) (CDs), bank investment contracts frequently permit subsequent incremental investments, with those deposits earning a similar guaranteed rate.

## Requirements for a Bank Investment Contract

In exchange for a bank's customer consenting to keep deposits invested for a foreordained, fixed period, the bank, thusly, guarantees a specific rate of return. Payments of interest, as defined in the contract, and the return of principal invested occurs at the contract expiration.

In spite of the fact that certificates of deposit (CDs) offer comparative guarantees and an okay profile, they contrast from BICs in light of the fact that BICs frequently consider progressing deposits. A CD requires one lump sum investment to receive a specific rate of return. A BIC, nonetheless, generally incorporates a "deposit window" of a couple of months. During this window, subsequent deposits can be made and receive a similar guaranteed rate. Limits might exist on the total amount invested.

A BIC would generally be viewed as a "buy-and-hold" investment since there is no secondary market for such contracts. They will quite often yield more than savings accounts and CDs since they are not [Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) insured deposits](/fdic-insured-account). They likewise generally generate more than Treasury notes and bonds on the grounds that the U.S. government doesn't back them.

BICs might take into account [early withdrawals](/earlywithdrawal) under specific conditions before the contract terminates. These may incorporate the depositor becoming disabled or experiencing financial hardship. At times, pension plans may likewise be permitted to receive an early withdrawal of funds invested in a BIC. Notwithstanding, early termination of such agreements frequently expects fees to be paid to repay the bank for administrative services and [interest rate risk](/interestraterisk) the bank might face while endorsing an early withdrawal.

> Likewise with most types of bank deposits, the guaranteed rate of return for BICs is higher for additional substantial deposits and throughout longer time periods. For instance, $100,000 invested for a long time can be expected to earn a higher interest rate than $20,000 invested for quite some time.
