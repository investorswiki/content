# Cryptography
Propels in computer technology have made data more open, and albeit this might offer a colossal advantage, it has a downside too. Online data is presented to numerous dangers, including theft and corruption. Cryptography (or cryptology) is one solution that has made it conceivable to safeguard data from a portion of the risks associated with data storage and distribution. It isn't to say that the concept of scrambling data is new. Even before the digital period, individuals have been veiling messages to prevent accidental crowds from understanding them. Yet, the increased utilization of computing gadgets brought the science of encryption to a whole new level.

## What is Cryptography?
In a couple of words, cryptography is the science of concealing data. All the more specifically, modern cryptography utilizes mathematical speculations and calculation to scramble and unscramble data or to guarantee the integrity and realness of the data.
In a fundamental course of text [encryption](/encryption), a plaintext (data that can be obviously perceived) goes through an encryption cycle that transforms it into ciphertext (which is unreadable). By doing this, one can guarantee that the data sent must be perused by a person in possession of a specific [decryption](/decryption) key.
By utilizing specific cryptographic strategies, one can send sensitive data even over unsecured networks. The level of encryption will rely upon the degree of protection that the data requires. For example, the type of security utilized on ordinary personal records (like contacts) isn't equivalent to the one utilized on cryptocurrency networks.
Learning how cryptography functions is critical to grasping its significance inside cryptocurrency systems. Most blockchain systems, for example, the one of Bitcoin, utilize a particular set of cryptographic methods that permit them to function as a decentralized and public ledger, through which digital transactions can happen in an extremely secure manner.

## How Does Cryptography Work?
The modern cryptography comprises of different areas of study, however the absolute most significant are the ones that deal with symmetric encryption, asymmetric encryption, hash functions, and digital signatures.
The Bitcoin protocol utilizes cryptographic proofs to secure the network and to guarantee the legitimacy of every transaction. Digital signatures guarantee that every client is simply able to spend the funds of his own wallet and that these funds can't be spent at least a couple of times. For example, on the off chance that Alice sends 2 bitcoins to Bob, she makes a transaction that is, essentially, a message that affirms the expansion of 2 bitcoins to Bob's wallet, while eliminating the coins from Alice's wallet. In any case, she is simply able to do as such by giving a digital signature.
One more important element of the Bitcoin Protocol is the Hashcash function, which characterizes the Proof of Work consensus mechanism and the mining system (responsible for getting the network, approving transactions and generating new coins). Hashcash utilizes a cryptographic function called SHA-256.
Cryptography is an essential part of the blockchain technology and, in this way, is urgent for any cryptocurrency. Cryptographic proofs applied to distributed networks enabled the creation of trustless economic systems, bringing forth Bitcoin and other decentralized digital currencies.
