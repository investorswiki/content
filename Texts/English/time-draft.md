# Time Draft
## What Is a Time Draft?

A period draft is a form of payment that is guaranteed by a responsible bank yet isn't payable in full until a predetermined amount of time after it is received and accepted. Numerous international trade transactions use drafts as a method for showing the terms of payment for transported goods. A period draft permits the importer (or buyer) time to pay for the goods received from the exporter (or seller). Time drafts are a type of short-term credit utilized for [financing](/financing) transactions of goods in international trade.

## How Time Drafts Work

The purpose of time drafts is to work with international trade. At the point when an exporter receives an order from an obscure importer (or with which it has little credit history) in another country, the importer can apply for a [banker's acceptance](/bankersacceptance) with their bank, which substitutes the bank's credit for the importer's credit. The banker's acceptance is a negotiable instrument or document that permits the bank to guarantee payment to the exporter for the delivered goods.

The payment is due at a specific date later on after the goods are sent. Thus, the document is called a period draft, what works much the same way to a post-dated check. Notwithstanding, the bank — rather than the importer — guarantees the payment.

The post-dated payment permits the importer time to receive the ordered goods and affirm satisfaction. After the issuance of the banker's acceptance, the exporter currently has a commitment of payment from the financial institution. It can hold this asset until [maturity](/maturity) and be paid in full, or sell it before maturity [at a discount](/at-a-discount) to get prior access to the funds. The time among acceptance and maturity is called "tenor" or "usance." thus, time drafts might be alluded to as "usance drafts."

## Time Draft versus Sight Draft

A [sight draft](/sight-draft) is one more type of draft utilized in international trade. A sight draft permits the seller (or exporter) to hold the title — or possession — of the goods until the importer receives them and makes a payment. When the importer acknowledges the documents and everything shows up all together, the sight draft requires immediate payment from the buyer to the seller.

Subsequently, the key difference between a period draft and a sight draft is that sight drafts require an immediate payment while time drafts permit the importer to pay sometime in the not too distant future.

## Illustration of a Time Draft

Assume a manufacturer of cutting edge hardware situated in Texas needs electrical parts from a provider in Taiwan. The Taiwanese company has never worked with the U.S. manufacturer. To work with the transaction, the importer in Texas presents a period draft (with a two-month post-date for payment) to a large global bank with a branch office in Taipei, Taiwan, which then, at that point, acknowledges it, in this way authoritatively making a banker's acceptance.

The exporter in Taiwan delivers the order of electrical parts. The buyer acknowledges the documents and consents to pay the exporter in 60 days as stipulated in the time draft. When the buyer consents to the terms of the draft, the buyer takes the delivery documents, which are utilized to work with the release of the goods situated at the dock. The exporter chooses to hold the banker's acceptance until maturity as opposed to selling it at a discount prior to maturity.
