# Lender Confirmation Auction
## What Is a Lender Confirmation Auction?

A lender confirmation auction is a type of [foreclosure](/foreclosure) sale in which the highest bid might be concluded after it is approved and accepted by the mortgage holder. This varies from an absolute auction, where the triumphant bidder naturally takes ownership of the property.

The lender confirmation auction is one of several assortments of property auction sales. Properties sold this way are generally in foreclosure. The previous owners have left, and the bank has turned into the sole owner.

## How a Lender Confirmation Auction Works

A lender confirmation auction will be advertised as subject to lender confirmation. At the point when it comes time for the auction, the event permits closely involved individuals to place bids on the property until a high bid is received.

In any case, the sale doesn't naturally go through. To begin with, the auction listing will show the situation with a bid. A listing showing a "bid pending confirmation" before the scheduled auction date means that a seller's "make an offer currently" bid has been accepted condition on its confirmation. A listing of a "bid pending confirmation" after the scheduled auction date demonstrates that a bid on the property was accepted at the auction and is anticipating acceptance.

> In a short sale, a property is owned (and perhaps still occupied) by a seller, shown by a professional realtor, and the price is normally not as much as what is owed on the home. In a lender confirmation auction, the dispossessed property is empty and owned by the bank.

## Lender Confirmation Auction versus Short Sale

 A [short sale](/shortsale) is one more type of real estate transaction in which the purchase bid is subject to lender endorsement. The property isn't sold at auction during a short sale. All things being equal, it is sold in an agreement negotiated between the seller and a buyer at a cost that is not exactly the outstanding mortgage on the property.

In a short sale, the property is listed by a licensed realtor and displayed to prospective buyers. The buyer might make an offer to the owner, who may be in default or close defaulting on the mortgage. In such cases, the lender must survey and support the transaction.

In a lender confirmation auction, the homeowner has been eliminated from the cycle. The foreclosure cycle has proactively been started, and generally speaking, the property is empty. In this case, the lender has decided an acceptable least [bid](/bid) price that it will acknowledge to push ahead with the transaction.

## Special Considerations

One more variation of the foreclosure sale is the [real estate owned](/realestateowned) (REO) sale. In this case, the bank has previously handled the foreclosure and taken ownership of the property. By and large, the property is being kept up with by a management company working for the benefit of the bank.

Since the REO cycle can be drawn out, it isn't unusual for the property to be in horrible shape or seriously harmed. Likewise with short sales, REO properties are listed available to be purchased, and prospective buyers examine them and choose whether to put in an offer. Generally, the bank has proactively decided the amount it will acknowledge. The terms of the purchase are "with no guarantees," and the bank holds the right to decline to make any repairs.

Buyers of REO properties are much of the time investors who purchase harmed properties to repair or refresh them and sell them for a profit. This practice is regularly alluded to as [flipping](/flipping) in the real estate industry.

## Highlights
- A lender confirmation auction is just one of numerous ways of buying properties in foreclosure.
- Conversely, a short sale is negotiated between a prospective buyer and the bank.
- In a lender confirmation auction, the triumphant bid awaits endorsement by the bank that holds the mortgage.
- A real estate-owned (REO) sale is another foreclosure sale, however a REO means the bank possesses the dispossessed property rather than an individual.
- Bids might be accepted before or during the auction.
