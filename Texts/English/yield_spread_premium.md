# Yield Spread Premium (YSP)
## What Is a Yield Spread Premium (YSP)?

A yield spread premium (YSP) is a form of compensation that a [mortgage broker](/mortgagebroker), acting as the intermediary, receives from the beginning lender for selling an interest rate to a borrower that is over the lender's [par rate](/mortgage_par_rate) for which the borrower qualifies. The YSP can in some cases be applied to cover costs associated with the loan, so the borrower isn't on the hook for extra fees.

Because of legislation that was passed in 1999, the yield spread premium must be sensibly connected with the actual services the mortgage broker performs for the home buyer. The yield spread premium likewise must be disclosed by law on the [HUD-1 Form](/hud-1) when the loan is closed. The 2010 [Dodd-Frank Financial Reform Bill](/dodd-frank-financial-administrative reform-bill) in this way restricted yield-spread premium through and through, a denial put into place to safeguard consumers after the 2008-09 financial crisis.

## How a Yield Spread Premium Worked

Mortgage brokers are compensated straight by borrowers when the borrower pays an origination fee when the lender pays the broker a yield spread premium or a combination of these. In the event that there is no origination fee, the borrower is in all probability consenting to pay an interest rate over the market rate.

Paying an interest rate above-market rates to remunerate a mortgage broker/lender isn't really something terrible for the borrower, as it can reduce the mortgage's upfront costs.

> There is no such thing as a 100% [no-cost mortgage](/no_cost_mortgage) for the borrower. On the off chance that a borrower doesn't pay closing costs or commissions, they will wind up paying those fees spread out over the life of the loan as somewhat higher regularly scheduled payments.

Note that in the event that a borrower hopes to hold the mortgage for a brief time frame, paying a somewhat high-interest rate can be more economical than paying high fees upfront. An intensive cost-benefit analysis ought to be performed before any contracts are agreed upon.

## Par Rates and Mortgage Brokers

The par rate is the standard interest rate offered by a mortgage lender in light of the terms of the loan and the creditworthiness of the borrower. This rate is free of any adjustments like closing points, [discount (mortgage) points](/points), fees, or commissions.

When a homebuyer chooses to work with an independent [mortgage broker](/mortgagebroker), the broker will actually want to compare loans from different banks and mortgage companies. For their work, the broker will be paid a commission. Rather than getting a cash commission, many brokers rather receive compensation as the yield spread premium, which is an adjustment vertical in the par rate. All adjustments made to the par rate must be disclosed in the loan agreement and agreed to at closing in the [settlement statements](/settlementstatement) (the HUD-1 form).
