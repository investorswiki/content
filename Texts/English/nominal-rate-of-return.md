# Nominal Rate of Return
## What Is the Nominal Rate of Return?

The nominal rate of return is the amount of money generated by an investment before figuring in expenses, for example, taxes, investment fees, and [inflation](/inflation). On the off chance that an investment generated a 10% return, the nominal rate would rise to 10%. After figuring in inflation during the investment period, the genuine ("[real](/realrateofreturn)") return would probably be lower.

In any case, the nominal rate of return has its merits since it permits [investors](/investor) to compare the performance of an investment regardless of the different [tax rates](/taxrate) that may be applied for every investment.

## Step by step instructions to Calculate the Nominal Rate of Return
1. Deduct the original investment amount (or principal amount invested) from the [current market value](/cmv) of the investment (or toward the finish of the investment period).
1. Take the outcome from the numerator and gap it by the original investment amount.
1. Increase the outcome by 100 to accomplish the nominal rate of return as a percentage.

## What Does the Nominal Rate of Return Tell You?

The nominal rate of return assists investors with checking the performance of their portfolio whether it's contained stocks, bonds, or different investments. The nominal rate of return strips out outside factors that can influence performance like taxes and inflation. By utilizing the nominal rate of return, investors can compare the performance of various investments throughout various time spans that could have different inflation rates.

Tracking the nominal rate of return for a portfolio or its parts assists investors with perceiving how they're dealing with their investments over the long run.

### Nominal versus After-Tax Rate of Return

The after-tax rate of return of an investment produces the results of taxation on the investment's returns into account. As a rule, investors pay various amounts of tax on investments in view of the investment, how long the investment was held, and the investor's tax bracket. Subsequently, the two investors might face different after-tax rates of return on their investment, even assuming it is a similar investment with a similar nominal rate of return.

Likewise, various investments will have different tax rates applied to them. In the event that an investor is contrasting a municipal bond and a corporate bond by which the two bonds have a similar nominal rate of return, their after-tax return is extraordinarily unique. Much of the time, municipal bonds are tax-excluded while income from [corporate bonds](/corporatebond) is subject to taxation. Accordingly, in the event that the IRS taxes the corporate bond, the rate of return will be altogether not exactly the rate of return on the municipal bond, in light of the fact that the corporate bond is subject to capital gains tax.

## Illustration of a Nominal Rate of Return

Suppose an investor set $100,000 in a no-fee fund to be invested for one year. Toward the year's end, the investment was worth $108,000, given the market price toward the finish of that very year:

- The nominal rate of return = 8%.

## The Difference Between the Nominal Rate of Return and Real Rate of Return

[A real rate of return](/realrateofreturn) is the annual percentage return realized on an investment, which is adjusted at changes in costs due to inflation or other outside factors. Adjusting the nominal return to make up for factors, for example, inflation permits you to decide the amount of your nominal return is a real return. On the other hand, the nominal rate of return strips out outside factors that can influence performance like taxes and inflation.

## Limitations of the Nominal Rate of Return

The nominal rate of return does exclude inflation or taxes while working out the performance of an investment. For instance, assuming an investment earned 10% more than one year, however inflation was 2.5% for a similar period, the genuine rate of return would be 7.5%, or 10% - 2.5% inflation. Albeit the nominal rate return is an important metric while looking at the performance of numerous investments, it ought to be utilized in tandem with the real rate of return to ensure that investment gains are not being dissolved by inflation or rising prices.
