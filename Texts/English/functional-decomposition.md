# Functional Decomposition
## What Is Functional Decomposition?

Functional decomposition is a method of analysis that analyzes a complex cycle to inspect its individual components. A function, in this specific circumstance, is a task in a larger cycle by which decomposition breaks down that cycle into smaller, simpler to fathom units.

In business, functional decomposition is utilized to work with the comprehension and management of large and complex processes. Functional decomposition takes care of problems and aids in the development of business operations, computer programming, machine learning, and various different fields.

## Grasping Functional Decomposition

Functional decomposition has its starting point in math, where it alludes to the most common way of examining the connections and relationships between every one of the parts that make a functional relationship so the original function might be recomposed. At its substance, functional decomposition takes something muddled and works on it.

Likewise, the decomposition of a cycle or function into smaller sub-functions can assist with projecting managers to decide how the individual functions or tasks help to accomplish the overall project's goal. Both large and small businesses utilize functional decomposition in their project analysis to decide if a project is on target or on the other hand assuming that there are smaller sub-functions that are holding up the cycle.

## Functional Decomposition Diagrams

The individual components of the cycle and their hierarchical relationship to one another are commonly shown in a diagram called a functional decomposition diagram. The diagram is displayed in a top-down design showing a cycle. A functional decomposition diagram contains the overall function or task along with the fundamental sub-functions or tasks expected to accomplish the overall objective.

Other common business methods for working on complex problems and processes incorporate decision trees, which permit users to think about different conceivable solution ways to a problem, as well as flow charts that picture the transient sequence of a cycle.

## Functional Decomposition Applications

Functional decomposition has applications in various disciplines, for example, systems engineering, [software architecture](/open-architecture), database theory, [machine learning](/machine-learning), information representation, and signal processing.

Practically, functional decomposition is utilized by engineers to depict the steps taken in the act of breaking down the function of a gadget, cycle, or system into its fundamental parts. Because of the analysis, a functional decomposition diagram will detail the functions, tasks, and sub-tasks and how they cooperate. The diagram may likewise address any problems, as well as propose solutions to those problems.

Functional decomposition is particularly important in programming. When a diagram has been made, coding might start as the software engineer may then deal with the most essential parts first and afterward build out an application. In that capacity, functional decomposition helps center and improve on the programming system. One drawback, notwithstanding, is that functional decomposition can be particularly work concentrated and tedious.

## Functional Decomposition Steps

The course of functional decomposition can be broken down into several steps. The utilization of a functional decomposition diagram is key to this step.

1. **Find the fundamental function**: What is the essential task a gadget or process must achieve?
1. **List essential sub-functions**: These sub-functions or sub-tasks are instrumental to the outcome of the fundamental function.
1. **List the next tier of sub-functions**: These sub-functions serve the upper-level sub-functions.
1. **Inspect the diagram**: If there are functions that have been excluded, add them to the diagram.

## Features
- Functional decomposition breaks down a large, complex interaction into a variety of smaller, less difficult units or tasks, encouraging a better comprehension of the overall cycle.
- A functional decomposition diagram contains the whole function or project alongside each of the fundamental sub-tasks expected to complete it.
- Functional decomposition is a problem-tackling device utilized in several specific situations, from business and industry to computer programming and AI.
