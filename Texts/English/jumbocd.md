# Jumbo Certificate of Deposit (CD)
## What is a jumbo CD?
A jumbo CD is a savings certificate that has a predefined interest rate, fixed maturity date and a base investment requirement of $100,000.
## More profound definition
A [certificate of deposit](/certificateofdeposit) is a savings account that requires an investment of a certain amount of money for a set period of time. CDs offer higher interest rates than customary savings accounts. Most CDs are accessible with maturities going from a couple of months to several years, with longer maturities earning higher interest rates. CD savers are punished for pulling out the money before the maturity date.
Jumbo CDs require investments that are bigger than those of standard CDs. At the point when the CD develops, the customer can pull out the money without penalty and collect the interest the CD earned. Many individuals like CDs since they are okay investments.
There are two types of jumbo CDs: negotiable and non-negotiable.
- **Negotiable CDs** are traded in secondary markets, frequently in bearer form. This means that the sole proof of ownership is in the physical possession of the document. Institutions that sell bearer certificates don't have the records of ownership.
- **Non-negotiable CDs** are held by the responsible bank on deposit. They bear the name of the purchaser.

All CDs that have been purchased at banks insured by the [Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. (FDIC)](/fdic) are insured for up to $250,000. The [National Credit Union Administration (NCUA)](/ncua) guarantees CDs from credit unions.
