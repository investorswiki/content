# Howey Test
## What Is the Howey Test?

The Howey Test alludes to the U.S. High Court case for deciding if a transaction qualifies as an "investment contract," and in this way would be considered a [security](/security) and subject to disclosure and registration requirements under the [Securities Act of 1933](/securitiesact1933) and the [Securities Exchange Act of 1934](/seact1934). Under the Howey Test, an investment contract exists on the off chance that there is an "investment of money in a common enterprise with a reasonable expectation of profits to be derived from the efforts of others."

The test applies to any contract, scheme, or transaction. The Howey Test is important for arranging [blockchain](/blockchain) and digital currency projects with investors and project patrons. Certain cryptocurrencies and [initial coin offerings](/initial-coin-offering-ico) (ICOs) might be found to meet the definition of an "investment contract" under the test.

## Understanding the Howey Test

The Howey Test alludes to **SEC v. W.J. Howey Co.**, which arrived at the Supreme Court in 1946. Howey Company sold tracts of citrus forests to purchasers in Florida, who might then [lease back](/leaseback) the land to Howey. Company staff would watch out for the forests and sell the natural product for the benefit of the owners. The two players shared in the revenue. Most purchasers had no experience in agriculture and were not required to keep an eye on the actual land.

Howey had failed to register the transactions and the [U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission](/sec) (SEC) mediated. The court's last ruling decided the leaseback arrangements qualified as investment contracts.

In doing as such, the Supreme Court laid out four criteria to decide if an investment contract exists. An investment contract is:

1. An investment of money
1. In a common enterprise
1. With the expectation of profit
1. To be derived from the efforts of others

On account of Howey, the purchasers of the Florida citrus forests saw the transactions as significant basically in light of the fact that the labor and skill were given by others. Purchasers simply had to invest capital to access an income stream. This classified the transaction as an investment contract under what is currently known as the Howey Test, and accordingly it should have been registered with the SEC.

## Howey Test and Cryptocurrencies

Digital currencies, for example, bitcoin are famously challenging to order. They are decentralized and, thusly, escape regulation in numerous ways. Regardless, the SEC has checked out digital assets and has tried to explain when their sale meets the definition of an investment contract.

According to the SEC, the "investment of money" test is effectively happy with the sale of digital assets on the grounds that [fiat money](/fiatmoney) or other digitals assets are being exchanged. Moreover, the "common enterprise" test is likewise handily met.

Generally speaking, whether a digital asset qualifies as an investment contract to a great extent turns on whether there is an "expectation of profit to be derived from the efforts of others."

For instance, the purchasers of a digital asset might be depending on the efforts of others on the off chance that they rely upon the project's supporters to create and keep up with the digital network (especially in the beginning phases), as opposed to these tasks being performed by a scattered community of unaffiliated users. The test is additionally met in the event that the project's sponsor do whatever it takes to support the price of the digital asset, for example, by making scarcity through token consuming. Another way the "efforts of others" test is met is on the off chance that the project's benefactors continue to act in a managerial job.

These are nevertheless a modest bunch of models illustrated by the SEC. On the off chance that the progress of a project relies upon the continuous participation of its benefactors, the purchaser of the associated digital asset is probable depending on the "efforts of others."

## Special Considerations

A large group of suggestions are raised in the event that the SEC decides a [cryptocurrency](/cryptocurrency) token is a security. Really, it means the SEC can decide if a token can be sold to U.S. investors and compels the project to register with the SEC.

A huge application of the Howey Test came in 2017 when the SEC decided that the sale of DAO tokens in exchange for [Ether](/ether-cryptocurrency) disregarded federal securities law. Rather than making an enforcement move, the SEC cautioned that securities laws applied to token sales â€” successfully shooting a warning shot at the cryptocurrency industry.

As a result of the Howey Test, most ICOs that happen today are probably going to be forbidden to U.S investors. In 2018, then, at that point SEC Chair Jay Clayton said each ICO he'd seen could be classified as a security.
