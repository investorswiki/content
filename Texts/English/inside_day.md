# Inside Day
## What Is an Inside Day?

An inside day is a two-day price pattern that happens when a subsequent day has a [range](/range) that is totally inside the main day's price range. The high of the subsequent day is lower than the first, and the low of the second is higher than the first.

Inside days show a contraction in volatility and are many times a [continuation pattern](/continuationpattern). This means that following the inside day the price will frequently keep moving in a similar course after the pattern as it did before. All things considered, the pattern is common and habitually immaterial.

Inside days might be diverged from [outside days](/outside-days).

## Figuring out Inside Days

Inside days are common. On a daily chart, they might happen several times each month in numerous assets. This means that numerous inside days will give little information to a trader and won't bring about a critical price move following the pattern.

An inside day shows that [volatility](/volatility) has dropped from the prior day. The market is taking a respite. For this reason the pattern is in many cases considered a continuation pattern. In the Encyclopedia of Chart Patterns, Thomas Bulkowski found that in north of 29,000 examples of the pattern, the price went on in a similar course it entered the pattern 62% of the time.

While endeavoring to trade the pattern, the best outcomes will generally accompany trading it as a continuation pattern. For instance, in the event that hoping to buy a stock, it ought to be a [bull market](/bullmarket), the stock ought to drift higher when it forms the inside day, and afterward the price ought to exit the pattern to the [upside](/upside).

In the model over, the trader could buy when the price moves over the highest point of the pattern, which is the high of the main candle of the two-bar pattern.

- To enter [short](/short), the trader would short-sell when the price dipped under the low of the pattern. The short ought to line up with a [bear market](/bearmarket), the price ought to be moving lower into the inside day, and afterward the price ought to break below the two-bar pattern.
- A [stop loss](/stop-lossorder) is put outside the pattern on the contrary side of the entry. In the event that going [long](/long), the stop loss is put just below the low of the two-day pattern, for instance.

> The inside day pattern doesn't have a profit target connected to it. Traders can use different methods to collect profits, for example, a [trailing stop loss](/trailingstop), risk/reward ratio, an indicator or moving average, or searching for other candlestick patterns to signal an exit.
