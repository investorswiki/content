# Term Bond
## What Is a Term Bond?

Term bonds are notes issued by companies to the public or investors with scheduled [maturity dates](/maturitydate). The term of the bond is the amount of time between bond issuance and bond maturity. On the maturity date of a term bond, the bond's [face value](/facevalue), the principal amount, must be reimbursed to the bondholder.

Term bonds can be stood out from [serial bonds](/serialbond), which mature in portions throughout some stretch of time.

## How a Term Bond Works

Term bonds can have short-or long-term developments; some might mature very quickly or months while others mature several years from the issue date.

Term bonds that have a call feature can be reclaimed at a prior stipulated date before the maturity date. A call feature, or [call provision](/callprovision), is an agreement that bond issuers make with investors. This agreement is written in a document alluded to as a [indenture](/indenture), which makes sense of how and when the bond can be called, including the various call dates all through the bond's life. In this manner, the issuer of a callable bond can recover the bond at a predetermined price, at specific times before the bond matures. The time from issuance to call date(s) addresses the bond's active term. A few corporate and municipal bonds are instances of term bonds that have 10-year call features.

## Types of Term Bonds

Term bonds might accompany a [sinking fund](/sinkingfund) requirement, where the company sets to the side an annual fund to repay the bond. A few companies likewise offer "secured term bonds" in which they vow to back their bond with company [collateral](/collateral) or assets, in case they fail to repay the stated amount of the bond upon maturity. Different companies offer no such support. Their term bonds stay "unsecured," in which case investors must depend upon the company's credibility and history.

With registered term bonds, the issuer records subtleties of the sale so that assuming the account is lost, the issuer can follow the owner. Non-registered bonds are untraceable in that the company doesn't register the people to whom it sells its bonds.

## Term Bonds versus Serial Bonds

A term bond can be stood out from a serial bond, which has different maturity plans set at customary stretches until the issue is retired. A term bond alludes to the issuance of bonds that are reimbursed simultaneously. Term bonds can be short-term or long-term, with the last option having longer maturity dates than the former.

A serial bond structure is a common strategy for municipal [revenue bonds](/revenuebond) on the grounds that these bonds are issued for expense creating projects worked by states and urban communities. Expect, for instance, that a city constructs a games arena that is funded with parking fees, arena [concession](/concession) income, and lease income. In the event that the bond issuer accepts that the facility can produce income reliably every year, it can structure the bond for serial maturity dates. As the total amount of bonds outstanding abatements, the future risk of the bond issue defaulting additionally declines.

For instance, we should expect a company issues 1,000,000 dollars worth of bonds in January 2020, which are all set to mature on similar date two years after the fact. The investor can hope to receive repayment from these term bonds in January 2022.

Serial bonds, then again, have different maturity dates and offer different interest rates. In this way, for example, a company might issue a $1 million bond issue and dispense its repayment of $250,000 north of five years.

Corporations will generally issue term bonds in which these obligations mature all the while. Municipalities, then again, really like to consolidate serial and term issuances with the goal that a few obligations mature in one block, while the payment of others is redirected.
