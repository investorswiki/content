# Business Development Company (BDC)
## What Is a Business Development Company (BDC)?

A business development company (BDC) is an organization that invests in small-and medium-sized companies as well as distressed companies. A BDC assists the small-and medium-sized firms with filling in the initial phases of their development. With distressed businesses, the BDC assists the companies with recapturing sound financial balance.

Set up in much the same way to closed-end investment funds, numerous BDCs are regularly public companies whose shares trade on major stock exchanges, like the American Stock Exchange (AMEX), Nasdaq, and others. As investments, they can be to some degree high-risk yet additionally offer high dividend yields.

As per [Closed-End Fund Advisors](/bdc), as of May 2019, there are roughly 49 public BDCs.

## Understanding the Business Development Company

The U.S. Congress made business development companies in 1980 to fuel job growth and help emerging U.S. businesses in raising funds. BDCs are closely associated with giving guidance about the operations of their portfolio companies.

Numerous BDCs cause investments in private companies and now and again in small public firms that to have low trading volumes. They give permanent capital to these businesses by exploiting a wide assortment of sources, like equity, debt, and hybrid financial instruments.

## Qualifying as a BDC

To qualify as a BDC, a company must be registered in compliance with Section 54 of the [Investment Company Act of 1940](/investmentcompanyact). It must be a domestic company whose class of securities is registered with the [Securities and Exchange Commission](/sec) (SEC).

The BDC must invest no less than 70% of its assets in private or public U.S. firms with market values of under US$250 million. These companies are many times youthful businesses, seeking financing, or firms that are experiencing or emerging financial hardships. Likewise, the BDC must give managerial assistance to the companies in its portfolio.

## BDCs versus Venture Capital

Assuming BDCs sound like [venture capital funds](/vcfund), they are. In any case, there are a few key differences. One connects with the idea of the investors each looks for. Venture capital funds are accessible generally to large institutions and well off people through private situations. Conversely, BDCs allow smaller, nonaccredited investors to invest in them, and by extension, in small growth companies.

Venture capital funds keep a limited number of investors and must meet certain asset-related tests to try not to be classified as regulated investment companies. BDC shares, then again, are regularly traded on stock exchanges and are continually accessible as investments for the public.

BDCs that decline to list on an exchange are as yet required to follow similar regulations as listed BDCs. Less rigid provisions for the amount of borrowing, related-party transactions, and equity-based compensation make the BDC an engaging form of incorporation to venture capitalists who were formerly reluctant to accept the difficult regulation of an investment company.

## The Upside of BDC Investment

BDCs furnish investors with exposure to debt and equity investments in transcendently private companies — regularly closed to investments.

Since BDCs are [regulated investment companies](/ric) (RICs), they must circulate more than 90% of their profits to shareholders. That RIC status, however, means they don't pay corporate income tax on profits before they circulate them to shareholders. The outcome is better than expected dividend yields. As indicated by "BDCInvestor.com," as of May 2019, the ten highest-yielding BDCs were posting somewhere in the range of 10.82% to 14.04%.

Investors getting dividends will pay taxes on them at their tax rate for ordinary income. Likewise, BDC investments might broaden an investor's portfolio with securities that can display substantially various returns from stocks and bonds. Of course, the fact that they trade on public exchanges gives them a fair amount of liquidity and transparency.

## The Downside of BDC Investment

Albeit a BDC itself is liquid, a considerable lot of its holdings are not. The portfolio holdings are basically private firms or small, meagerly traded public companies. Since most BDC holdings are commonly invested in illiquid securities, a BDC's portfolio has subjective fair-value gauges and may experience sudden and quick losses.

These losses can be amplified on the grounds that BDCs frequently utilize leverage — that is, they borrow the money they invest or loan to their target companies. Leverage can work on the rate of [return on investment](/returnoninvestment) (ROI), however it can likewise cause income issues in the event that the leveraged asset declines in value.

The BDC-invested target companies commonly have no histories or alarming histories. There is consistently the chance they could go under or default on a loan. A rise in interest rates — making it more costly to borrow funds — can obstruct a BDC's profit edges too.

In short, BDCs invest forcefully in companies that offer the two incomes now and capital appreciation later; thusly, they register fairly high on the risk scale.
