## What Is a Clone Fund?

A clone fund is a [mutual fund](/mutualfund) decisively intended to imitate the performance of an effective mutual fund. Clone funds are developed to model the performance of larger and more effective mutual funds.

The [fund manager](/fundmanager) is responsible for operating the fund, picking which assets to buy or sell over the long haul to boost their investors' benefits. Philosophy and strategy drive each mutual fundy. What's more, a few parts of these methods of reasoning and strategies are publicly known.

Since the price of entry to [hedge funds](/hedgefund) is too high for some investors, hedge funds become alluring possibility for cloning. Other clone funds will model themselves on the investment methods of reasoning and strategies of highly effective investors like Warren Buffett. All things considered, other clone funds exist to copy [closed funds](/closedfund), for a brief time or permanently closed to new investors.
