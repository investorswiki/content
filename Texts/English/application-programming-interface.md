# Application Programming Interface (API)
An application programming interface, or API, is a piece of code that permits two applications to share information.
A genuine illustration of an API is an aggregator site for inn appointments. The aggregator site utilizes APIs to request information from various inn networks in response to a customer's request.
For instance, the customer requests information on accessible rooms that meet specific criteria - the beginning and end date for the stay, geographical area, cost. This information is shipped off the lodging's systems utilizing an API, which makes an interpretation of the request into a format which the inn servers can comprehend. These systems then, at that point, reply through the API with the rooms they have accessible that match these criteria.

The API empowers the information to be traded rapidly and effectively notwithstanding the aggregator site and the lodging system being worked with various technology and by various companies.

In this scenario, the lodging is the API provider. It has constructed the API to empower other Apps to access the information. The inn does this since it needs to make it simple for users to look into its accessible rooms. The aggregator site is the consumer of the API. It utilizes the API since it would be either unthinkable or too much work to get the data it needs without one.
## What might APIs at any point be utilized for?
APIs assist designers with utilizing existing usefulness and data as opposed to utilizing a workaround or building it themselves. For example, by utilizing the Google Maps API to show the location of a store or restaurant, the engineer dodges the need to draw or code map usefulness without any preparation. This sets aside significant time and cash.

APIs exist any place various bits of software need to communicate, and on the grounds that making data accessible is really great for business, a significant number of them are free to utilize.
Blockchain, for instance, give free APIs that empower designers to access Bitcoin payment processing, wallet services, transaction data, and market data for use on their websites and applications.
Cryptocurrency exchanges likewise give APIs. Traders can utilize these APIs to supply market data to trading bots, empowering them to make trades (as indicated by preset directions) in the interest of the traders. This form of trading is known as algorithmic trading (or bot trading).

## Features
- For financial markets, APIs interface trading calculations or models and a trade's and additionally dealer's platform.
- More brokers are making their platforms accessible through an API.
- An application programming interface (API) lays out an online association between a data provider and an end-client.
- An API is essential to carrying out an automated trading strategy.
