# Australian Stock Price Riskless Indexed Note (ASPIRIN)
## What Is an Australian Stock Price Riskless Indexed Note (ASPIRIN)?

An Australian stock price riskless indexed note (ASPIRIN) is a zero-coupon bond with a return that is linked to the Australian [All-Ordinaries Stock Index](/all-ordinaries-stock-index).

The bond has a four-year maturity and is repayable at face value, with a yield derived from the index's percentage increase over a foreordained level. The bond is otherwise called an All-Ordinaries Share Price Riskless Indexed Note.

## Grasping ASPIRIN

Australian stock price riskless indexed note (ASPIRIN) is an alternative investment opportunity for those investors who wish to capture gains in the stock market, while likewise expecting to relieve the downside risk of equity investing. ASPIRINs are indexed to the [Australian All-Ordinaries Stock Index](/all-ordinaries-stock-index) (XAO), which is contained common shares from the [Australian Stock Exchange](/asx) (ASX). The All-Ordinaries Index is the most quoted benchmark for Australian equities. The ASX is responsible for working out and distributing the XAO index and its returns.

An ASPIRIN note will pay investors a return when the All-Ordinaries Index performs over a specific percentage level. For instance, assume the note's pre-resolved percentage increase, otherwise called a hurdle rate, was 10%. On the off chance that the All-Ordinaries Index gained 15% during the note's four-year life expectancy, the ASPIRIN holder would receive a yield of 5%.

In any case, what occurs assuming the Index neglects to earn over 10% during that time span? For sure on the off chance that the index has a negative return? The downside of the note happens in the event that the index doesn't outperform its hurdle rate, or percentage level, for the overall four-year period.

In this event, investors would receive a zero percent return on the note. Notwithstanding, on the grounds that the note is repayable at face value, investors would in any case receive their original principal in full. This feature mirrors the "riskless" part of the security.

## ASPIRINs and Zero-Coupon Bonds

An ASPIRIN is a [zero-coupon bond](/zero-couponbond), which is defined as a debt security that doesn't pay interest however is traded at a deep discount, delivering profit at maturity when the bond is reclaimed for its full face value. So an ASPIRIN is a zero-coupon bond with an equity return kicker, meaning an investor receives the excess return of the Australian All-Ordinaries Stock Index on the off chance that its gain is far beyond the predefined [hurdle rate](/hurdlerate).

In any case, ASPIRINs vary from zero-coupon bonds that offer a fixed rate of interest, like U.S. savings bonds. At the point when a savings bond develops, it's not unexpected worth two times as much as its initial investment. In any case, that is no guarantee with an ASPIRIN since it doesn't earn interest; it possibly creates a gain assuming the index to which it is linked surpasses its hurdle rate. And keeping in mind that the face value of the note is paid in full, it could be worth less upon maturity than at issuance due to the effects of inflation.
