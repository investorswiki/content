# BHD (Berhad)
## What Is BHD (Berhad)?

BHD is a postfix for Berhad, which is utilized in Malaysia to recognize a public limited company. Berhad, BHD, or Bhd after a company's name demonstrates that it is a Malaysian [public limited compan](/plc)y (PLC) while the extended postfix Sendirian Berhad (SDN BHD) signifies that it is a private limited company.

## Share Issue and BHD

Both BHD and SDN BHD companies are classified as those that issue shares, which is the most common type of business entity in Malaysia. Such companies have a limited number of shares, and the [liability](/liability) of their [shareholders](/shareholder) is restricted to the amount indicated on their unpaid shares.

Different types of companies in Malaysia are companies limited by guarantees, for example, [nonprofit organizations](/non-profitorganization), public societies, and unlimited liability corporations (ULC).

## BHD Versus SDN BHD

A BHD company must have at least two shareholders, and the maximum is unlimited; a SDN BHD company can have two to 50 shareholders. SDN BHD companies are regularly [small or medium sized enterprises](/smallandmidsizeenterprises) (SME) while BHD companies are the biggest companies in Malaysia. BHD companies have stricter financial reporting standards than SDN BHD companies since they must unveil their financial statements to the public. BHD firms likewise have greater access to capital than SDN BHD companies since they can access public equity and debt supporting when they require subsidizing.

Albeit the course of incorporation for the two types of companies is substantially comparative, a SDN BHD company has a few severe expectations in its [Articles of Association](/articles-of-association). These remember limitations for transfers of the company's shares, a maximum of 50 shareholders, a restriction on public memberships to the company's shares or [debentures](/debenture), and on gathering public deposits. Albeit most BHD companies list their shares and trade on a stock market, it's anything but a mandatory requirement. In this way, they can decide to remain unlisted.
