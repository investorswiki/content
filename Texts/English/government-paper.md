# Government Paper
## What Is a Government Paper?

Government paper is a debt security that is issued or guaranteed by a sovereign government. Government paper of a nation is typically perceived as the least risky class of debt securities in that country and will offer investors the lowest yields compared with debt of a comparative maturity issued by other entities in that nation.

## Understanding Government Paper

On account of their ability to tax or create new, legal tender money, government paper is generally seen as carrying less risk than otherwise equivalent, privately-issued securities. As a result, the government's debt obligations and the market interest rates thereof are often utilized as benchmarks for other market rates.

Risk perceptions of government paper issued by different nations shift widely contingent upon a number of factors including credit rating, default history, political stability, etc.

As a dominant world geopolitical and financial power and the issuer of the most famous world reserve currency, the U.S. government paper is viewed as among the safest investments and practically risk-free.

## Types of U.S. Government Paper
### Treasury Bills

A Treasury bill (T-Bill) is a short-term debt obligation backed by the [Treasury Dept.](/ustreasury) of the U.S. government with a maturity of short of what one year, sold in [denominations](/denomination) of $100 up to a maximum purchase of $5 million.

T-bills have various maturities and are issued [at a discount](/at-a-discount) from par. At the point when an investor purchases a T-Bill, the U.S. government effectively writes investors a [IOU](/iou); they don't receive normal interest payments as with a [coupon bond](/couponbond), but a T-Bill incorporates interest, reflected in the amount it pays when it matures.

### Treasury Bonds

A Treasury bond (T-bond) is a marketable, fixed-interest U.S. government [debt security](/debtsecurity) with a maturity of 20 or 30 years. Treasury bonds make interest payments semi-every year, and the income received is just taxed at the federal level.

Treasury bonds are referred to in the market as basically risk-free; they are issued by the U.S. government with very little risk of default.

### Treasury Notes

A Treasury note is a marketable U.S. government [debt security](/debtsecurity) with a fixed interest rate and a maturity between 2 and 10 years. Treasury notes are accessible from the government with either a competitive or noncompetitive bid.

With a [competitive bid](/competitivebid), investors indicate the yield they want, at the risk that their bid may not be supported; with a noncompetitive bid, investors accept whatever yield is determined at auction.

## Special Considerations

Government paper in the U.S. is viewed as the risk-free rate of interest. It is the safest investment in terms of return of principal, backed by the full faith and credit of the government. That's not to say these instruments can't lose value.

They will rise and fall with winning interest rates until they arrive at maturity. On the off chance that you went to sell a bill, bond, or note before maturity, you might get pretty much than its face value. Assuming you hold them until maturity, you'll be reimbursed the face value, plus you'll either collect interest en route, or at the end, contingent upon the instrument.

## Highlights

- In light of their powers to tax or create legal tender, governments are generally seen as presenting less default risk to lenders and the interest rates on government paper are often utilized as benchmarks for risk among market securities.
