## History of the Omani Rial (OMR)

Oman sits on the Strait of Hormuz at the Persian Gulf and is key to stability in the region. Before 1970, Oman didn't have a national currency. Prior, the area, then, at that point, known as Muscat and Oman, utilized the Indian rupee (INR) and the Maria Theresa thaler, with the currencies seeing circulation in various regions.

Beginning in 1970, the OMR was known as the **rial Saidi** and had a value equivalent to the [British pound (GBP)](/gbp). This currency became well known and replaced the Indian rupee in seaside regions. By 1973 the currency was replaced by **rial Omani** (at [par](/parvalue)) and turned into the overwhelming form of money. OMR turned into the currency of Oman after Sultan Qaboos bin Said formally changed the name of the country to the Sultanate of Oman.

The most eminent development in the history of the Omani rial occurred in 1970, when Sultan Qaboos bin Said accepted power in the wake of toppling and banishing his dad Sultan Said bin Taimur. The change in initiative followed a castle overthrow.

In this manner, Qaboos bin Said set out on a program of economic and social reform. His reforms incorporated the foundation of a national currency and the foundation of the Central Bank of Oman in 1974. The [central bank](/centralbank) issues and deals with the Omani rial.

Suppose that a traveler is looking into rates for making a trip to Oman from Canada. They are keen on the OMR/CAD rate, or the number of [Canadian dollars (CAD)](/cad-canadian-dollar) it takes to buy one OMR.

Back in 2014, the traveler might have gotten a rate of around 2.80, and that means it costs C$2.80 (Canadian dollars) for one rial. In mid 2016 the rate increased above C$3.70. It cost more CAD to buy one OMR, and that means the OMR [appreciated](/appreciation) against the CAD or the CAD [depreciated](/currency-devaluation) against the OMR.

The years 2016 through 2018 saw the rate settle between those lows and highs, remaining generally somewhere in the range of C$3.50 and C$3.10. As the rate dropped from C$3.70 to C$3.10, the OMR was devaluing against the CAD, or the CAD was appreciating against the OMR, in light of the fact that it was costing less CAD to buy one OMR. As of June 2021, one Omani rial equals C$3.14.
