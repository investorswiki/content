## The For-Profit Controversy

In spite of the fact that there are endless endearing examples of overcoming adversity going from miniature entrepreneurs starting their own water supply business in Tanzania, to a $1,500 loan that allowed a family to open a grill restaurant in China, to foreigners in the U.S. having the option to build their own businesses, microfinance has at times fallen under analysis.

While microfinance interest rates are generally lower than conventional banks', pundits have charged that these operations are bringing in money off of the poor. Particularly since the trend in for-profit microfinance institutions, for example, BancoSol in Bolivia and the previously mentioned SKS (which really started as a [nonprofit organization](/non-profitorganization) (NPO) however became for-profit in 2003.)

One of the largest, and generally disputable, is Mexico's Compartamos Banco. The bank was begun in 1990 as a nonprofit. Be that as it may, after 10 years, management chose to transform the enterprise into a traditional, for-profit company. In 2007, it opened up to the world on the Mexican Stock Exchange, and its initial public offering (IPO) raised more than $400 million.
Like most other microfinance companies, Compartamos Banco makes generally small loans, serves a largely female clientele, and pools borrowers into groups.

Notwithstanding Compartamos Banco, many major financial institutions and other large corporations have sent off for-profit microfinance departments, including Citigroup, Barclays, and General Electric, for instance.

Compartamos Banco and its for-profit peers have been reprimanded by a larger number of people, including the grandfather of modern microfinance himself, Muhammad Yunus. That's what the immediate, commonsense fear is, out of a longing to bring in money, large microfinance bankers will charge higher interest rates that might make a debt trap for low-income borrowers.

However, Yunus and others likewise have a more fundamental concern: that the incentive for microcredit ought to be poverty mitigation, not profit. By their actual nature — and their obligation to stockholders — these publicly-traded firms neutralize the original mission of microfinance, helping the poor regardless of anything else.

In response, Compartamos and other for-profit microfinanciers counter that [commercialization](/commercialization) allows them to operate all the more effectively, and to draw in more capital by engaging profit-seeking investors. By turning into a profitable business, their contention goes, a microfinance bank can broaden its range, giving more money and more loans to low-income candidates. For the present, however, charitable and popularized microfinanciers do coincide.

## Nonprofit versus Revenue driven Microfinance

Notwithstanding the split between the nonprofit and for-profit microfinance enterprises, different reactions exist. Some say that individual microloans of $100 are insufficient money to give independence — rather, they keep beneficiaries working in means level trades, or just cover essential requirements, similar to food and shelter.

A better approach, these pundits keep up with, is to make jobs by building new production lines and delivering new goods. They refer to the instances of China and India, where the development of large industries has prompted stable employment and higher wages, which thusly has assisted millions with rising up out of the lowest levels of poverty.

Different pundits have said that the presence of interest payments, but low, is as yet a burden. In spite of the solid repayment rates, there actually are borrowers who can't, or don't, repay loans, on account of the disappointment of their endeavors, personal catastrophe, or different reasons. Thus, this additional debt can make beneficiaries of microcredit even poorer than when they began.
