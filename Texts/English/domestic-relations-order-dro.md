# Domestic Relations Order - DRO
## What Is a Domestic Relations Order - DRO

A domestic relations order (DRO) is a court order that gives a spouse or dependent the right to receive all or a portion of the benefits of an employee's qualified retirement plan in the event of divorce. A DRO is normally shipped off a plan administrator or employer for survey, and on the off chance that it meets certain laws, it will bring about the plan benefits distributed between the gatherings involved. The gatherings involved are normally the employee and their spouse.

## Regulations for Public Employees

The Retirement Equity Act (REA) of 1984 which falls under the [Employee Retirement Income Security Act](/erisa) (ERISA) states that the retirement benefit plan of a public employee comprises an asset for both the employee and their alternative payee. An alternate [payee](/payee), according to the IRS, can be the spouse, ex-spouse, or dependent of the employee. In the event of marital disintegration, this asset must, hence, be considered.

An approved DRO is known as a [Qualified Domestic Relations Order](/qdro) (QDRO). Under federal laws, qualified plans like defined benefit plans, [ESOPs](/esop), 401(k) plans, and profit-sharing plans require a QDRO in order to disseminate benefits to an alternative payee. When a DRO has been determined to be qualified, notice of endorsement is shipped off the attorney who in turn presents their final modifications to the court for a judgment.

An official copy of the court's judgment is given to the plan administrator to begin processing the retirement plan benefit. A QDRO is a mandatory order that must be followed perfectly and respected by the employee's company or plan administrator. Notwithstanding, in the event that a DRO is wrongly decided as qualified, the QDRO can be prosecuted to be remedied or changed.

## Plan Administrator Review

An employer or [plan administrator](/plan_administrator) is normally in charge of reviewing a Domestic Relations Order (DRO). The employer's company might have in-house HR employees who are knowledgeable in pension laws or contract the services of outside plan administrators who conduct DRO assessments. At the point when an order is sent by an attorney to a plan administrator for survey, the employer or administrator applies a checklist to guarantee that the plan meets the requirements for it to be qualified and limited by the order.

An order might be unqualified in the event that the benefit required from the order isn't upheld by [the retirement plan](/retirement) or on the other hand in the event that the terms of the order don't conform to federal laws. In this case, the plan administrator tells the attorney representing the beneficiary on the motivations behind why the order doesn't meet the plan's requirements. The attorney who audits the assessment may then change the copy of the DRO and yet again send it to the employer or administrator to re-evaluate.

## DRO Processing Times

The time it takes to handle a benefits plan relies upon the type of retirement plan the employee has and the limitations set out in the court's judgment. Endless supply of the distributed payments, the plan is split in two and the alternative payee has one of the two accounts in their name.

On the off chance that the account is a qualified [defined benefit plan](/definedbenefitpensionplan), the alternate payee may not receive any payout until the employee resigns or arrives at the normal retirement age as defined by the plan. In any case, some retirement plans make it workable for the alternative payee to be paid right away. Under a qualified [defined contribution plan](/definedcontributionplan), a check payable to the alternate payee might be made when practicable.

While the federal law ERISA oversees the distribution of private [qualified retirement plans](/qrp), this law doesn't make a difference to government benefits and plans. Government retirement benefits are thusly split between the plan owner and the alternative employee using a DRO as it were. Retirement [benefits gave by a state](/calpers), the military, federal government, a district, or city are all government plans that are not qualified. ERISA's laws, in this way, don't make a difference to these plans.
