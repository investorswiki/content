# Negative Convexity
## What Is Negative Convexity?

Negative convexity exists when the state of a bond's [yield curve](/yieldcurve) is inward. A bond's convexity is the [rate of change](/rateofchange) of its duration, and it is measured as the second [derivative](/derivative) of the bond's price with respect to its yield. Most mortgage bonds are negatively arched, and callable bonds typically show negative convexity at lower yields.

## Grasping Negative Convexity

A bond's [duration](/duration) alludes to the degree to which a bond's price is influenced by the rise and fall of interest rates. Convexity demonstrates how the duration of a bond changes as the interest rate changes. Typically, when interest rates decline, a bond's price increases. In any case, for bonds that have negative convexity, prices decline as interest rates fall.

For instance, with a callable bond, as interest rates fall, the incentive for the issuer to call the bond [at par](/at-par) increases; subsequently, its price won't rise as fast as the price of a non-callable bond. The price of a [callable bond](/callablebond) could really drop as the probability that the bond will be called increases. For this reason the state of a callable bond's curve of price with respect to yield is sunken or negatively raised.

## Convexity Calculation Example

Since duration is an imperfect price change assessor, investors, analysts, and traders work out a bond's convexity. Convexity is a helpful risk-the board device and is utilized to measure and deal with a portfolio's exposure to market risk. This assists with expanding the precision of price-development expectations.

While the specific formula for convexity is fairly convoluted, a guess for convexity can be found utilizing the accompanying simplified formula:

Convexity estimate = (P(+) + P(- ) - 2 x P(0))/(2 x P(0) x dy ^2)

Where:

P(+) = bond price when interest rate is diminished

P(- ) = bond price when interest rate is increased

P(0) = bond price

dy = change in interest rate in decimal structure

For instance, expect a bond is at present priced at $1,000. In the event that interest rates are diminished by 1%, the bond's new price is $1,035. Assuming interest rates are increased by 1%, the bond's new price is $970. The surmised convexity would be:

Convexity estimate = ($1,035 + $970 - 2 x $1,000)/(2 x $1,000 x 0.01^2) = $5/$0.2 = 25

While applying this to estimate a bond's price utilizing duration a [convexity adjustment](/convexity-adjustment) must be utilized. The formula for the convexity adjustment is:

Convexity adjustment = convexity x 100 x (dy)^2

In this model, the convexity adjustment would be:

Convexity adjustment = 25 x 100 x (0.01)^2 = 0.25

At last, utilizing duration and convexity to get an estimate of a bond's price for a given change in interest rates, an investor can utilize the accompanying formula:

Bond price change = duration x yield change + convexity adjustment

## Features
- Surveying a bond's convexity is a great method for estimating and deal with a portfolio's exposure to market risk.
- Negative convexity exists when the price of a bond falls as well as interest rates, bringing about an inward yield curve.
