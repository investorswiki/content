# Asymmetric Volatility Phenomenon (AVP)
## What Is the Asymmetric Volatility Phenomenon (AVP)?

The asymmetric volatility phenomenon (AVP) is the noticed propensity of equity market [volatility](/volatility) to be higher in declining markets than in rising markets. This means that volatility will increase additional given a 10% drop from current price levels than given a 10% gain.

Market psychology assumes a part in this phenomenon since individuals can go overboard with fear or panic to selloffs. There is likewise a more natural propensity to safeguard positions against downside losses as opposed to selling upside gains in the more limited term.

## Figuring out the Asymmetric Volatility Phenomenon (AVP)

Asymmetric volatility is a real phenomenon: market uptrends will generally be more continuous and downtrends will more often than not be more keen and more extreme and become flowing declines. Furthermore, the daily reach in prices will in general be higher during downtrends than uptrends.

Be that as it may, there is no consensus about what causes it. One clarification is that trading leverage prompts margin calls and forced selling. Different clarifications come from the field of [behavioral finance](/behavioralfinance), like behavioral feedback circles in which certain behavior affects business as usual behavior and [panic selling](/panicselling).

> Options markets perceive this reality, and integrate higher [implied volatility](/iv) (IV) levels for downside [strikes](/strikeprice), making a 10% downsize option relatively more expensive than a 10% upside option.

## Special Considerations

Individuals are subject to [loss aversion](/loss-psychology), as per behavioral economics and [prospect theory](/prospecttheory), developed by Kahneman and Tversky in 1979. All in all, they favor staying away from losses to obtaining equivalent gains. A few studies propose that losses are two times as strong, psychologically, as gains. This bias skews our assessments of likelihood.

For instance, prospect theory likewise accounts for other [illogical financial behaviors](/prospecttheory, for example, the disposition effect, which is the inclination for investors to hold onto losing stocks for a really long time and sell winning stocks too soon. Building on crafted by Kahneman and Tversky, evolutionary analysts have developed speculations with respect to why the assessment of risks and chances are indivisible from feeling â€” and why loss aversion could cause asymmetric volatility.

One of the troublesome factors in recognizing the reasons for asymmetric volatility is isolating out broad (systematic) factors from stock-explicit (idiosyncratic) factors. Loss-aversion theory has developed into the [asymmetric value function](/prospecttheory).

The presence of asymmetric volatility assumes an important part in risk management and hedging strategies as well as options pricing. In light of AVP, there is a [volatility smile](/volatilitysmile) or skew, by which lower-strike options, on average, have greater implied volatilities (IV) than higher strikes. A few traders attribute the presentation of AVP into options pricing to the [Black Monday](/blackmonday) stock market crash of 1987.

> AVP is viewed as a market anomaly since on the off chance that markets were efficient and market participants rational entertainers, volatility ought not be impacted by whether prices moves are to the upside or the downside.
