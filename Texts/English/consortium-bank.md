# Consortium Bank
## What Is a Consortium Bank?

A consortium bank is a [subsidiary bank](/subsidiarybank), which various different banks make. These banks could make a consortium bank to fund a large-scale project that is too large for one bank to complete itself, for example, giving affordable homeownership to low-and moderate-pay home purchasers or to execute a large deal, for example, selling loans in the [loan syndication](/loansyndication) market.

The consortium leverages individual banks' assets to accomplish their objectives. All member banks have equivalent ownership shares and nobody member has a [controlling interest](/controllinginterest). After the consortium bank meets its objective, it regularly disintegrates.

## Understanding a Consortium Bank

At the point when projects emerge that are too large for one bank to finance all alone, many banks pool their resources to make a consortium bank to carry out that project. A legal contract generally oversees the consortium bank and delegates liabilities among its members. This can incorporate a common appraisal, documentation, and follow-up, as well as a decision to portion out equivalent ownership shares in the transaction.

Consortium banks originated in the mid 1960s to empower more modest banks to participate in international banking activities. They are most common in Europe. Consortium banks are not generally so active as they have generally been, nonetheless, strong models actually exist in the U.S. what's more, overseas. Member banks might be headquartered in various countries.

## Consortium Bank versus Loan Syndicate

Moreover, a loan syndicate as a rule includes international transactions and different currencies. Loan syndication generally needs a group of partners to both guarantee payments and [reduce exposure](/risk-participation) given the high level of risk.

One overseeing bank will typically head a loan syndicate. A borrower may initially approach this manager to orchestrate credit. From that point, the overseeing bank will by and large arrange conditions among different partners and make extra arrangements for the [syndicate](/syndicate) in spite of the fact that it could not generally be the majority lender. Contingent upon the [credit agreement](/creditagreement), any of the participating banks might lead the most common way of lending.

More than several years the aim is for the consortium to invest a huge number of dollars in the nearby ecosystem to assist with easing poverty. Given the large sum of money engaged with the project, different banks pooled their resources to make a consortium bank to give this investment.
