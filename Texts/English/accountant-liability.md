# Accountant's Liability
## What Is Accountant's Liability?

An accountant's liability depicts the legal liability assumed while performing professional duties. An accountant is obligated for a client's accounting misstatements. This risk of being responsible for [fraud](/fraud) or error powers accountants to be learned and utilize all applicable accounting standards.

An accountant who is immaterial in their examination of a company can face legal charges from either the company, investors, or creditors that depend on the accountant's work. The accountant could likewise be responsible for the financial losses incurred from any inaccurate representation of a company's books. This conceivable negative scenario frequently prompts accountants taking out professional [liability insurance](/liability_insurance).

## Figuring out Accountant's Liability

The standard of care applicable to the conduct of audits by [public accountants](/cpa) is the same than that of specialists, lawyers, architects, engineers, and others offering skilled types of assistance for compensation, and that standard requires reasonable care and ability in that.

Accountant's liability adds an element of pressure to an accountant's performance of duties. An accountant's real participation in fraud can be difficult to demonstrate on the grounds that management could be the ones committing the fraud, which the accountant can fail to notice. This makes the accountant legally responsible for being careless of fraud or misstatements, even assuming that they had no direct hand in committing them.

## The Impact of Inaccurate Statements

On the off chance that a bank chooses to loan money to a company in light of the positive survey of a company's [financial statements](/financial-statements) audited by an accountant and afterward down the line the company can't pay back its [debt](/debt), bringing about a loss for the bank, the accountant could be held responsible. Likewise, on the off chance that investors purchase a company's stock in view of the financial statements and the company performs ineffectively and the stock goes down, the accountant can be held responsible for the losses. Of course, in these scenarios, the harmed party would need to demonstrate that their decision depended on assessing the company's financial statements.

Auditors normally purchase professional liability insurance to safeguard themselves from any monetary damage emerging from such circumstances. This is frequently alluded to as [errors and omissions insurance](/errors-omissions-insurance). This extra cost for the accountant can frequently raise the cost of the audit.

That being the person or business entity who contracts for or connects with the audit services. Different persons may not recover on a pure negligence theory.
