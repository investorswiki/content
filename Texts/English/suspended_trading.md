# Suspended Trading
## What Is Suspended Trading?

Suspended trading happens when the U.S. [Securities and Exchange Commission](/sec) (SEC) mediates in the market to halt trading activity due to serious worries about a company's assets, operations, or other financial information.

## Grasping Suspended Trading

The SEC has the authority to suspend the trading of a security for up to ten trading days to safeguard investors under Section 12(k) of the [Securities Exchange Act of 1934](/seact1934). The SEC will pursue the choice to do this in light of an investigation and will then issue a [press release](/pressrelease) enumerating the justification for the suspension. During the ten-day period, the SEC won't comment publicly on the situation with the investigation. When trading in a [security](/security) is suspended, shares can't trade until the suspension is lifted or slips by. The suspension not set in stone on a case-by-case basis.

Suspended trading happens for the vast majority various reasons, including:

- A lack of current, accurate, or adequate information about a company, for example, when it's not current in that frame of mind of periodic reports.
- Inquiries concerning the precision of publicly accessible information, including the items in recent press releases.
- Worries about trading in the stock, for example, [insider trading](/insidertrading) or market [manipulation](/manipulation).

The most common justification for a suspension is the lack of current or accurate financial information. Generally speaking, companies can determine the issue by presenting the required [financial statements](/financial-statements) to return into compliance. More uncommon cases could include examples of [fraud](/fraud), in which a company could see a more extended term impact from a trading suspension.

The SEC can't caution investors about a forthcoming suspension to safeguard the integrity of the investigation. In the event that the suspension didn't wind up happening, then a premature announcement would adversely affect existing investors.

Securities trading on national exchanges, for example, the [New York Stock Exchange](/nyse) (NYSE) or the [Nasdaq](/nasdaq), can quickly resume trading when a suspension is lifted. With regards to [over-the-counter](/otc) securities, [broker-dealers](/specialist vendor) can't request investors to buy or sell recently suspended securities until certain requirements are met, yet unsolicited trading is permitted.

Specifically, merchant vendors must finish up [Form 211](/form-211) with the [Financial Industry Regulatory Authority](/finra) (FINRA) addressing that they have fulfilled all applicable requirements of Securities Exchange Act Rule 15c2-11 and FINRA Rule 6432. These rules ensure that specialist vendors have motivation to accept that its financial statements and other records are accurate.

The price of a security frequently moves forcefully lower following a suspension since there might be a lack of confidence in [management](/upper-management). The price may rapidly recover, notwithstanding, assuming that the issues are considered to have been settled.

## Instances of Suspended Trading

There are several occasions of suspended trading in recent history. Maybe the most renowned such case was the Enron scandal that became exposed in 2001. The company's stock price slumped and was trading in pennies inside several days. Enron in this way petitioned for financial protection soon thereafter, and the NYSE suspended trading in Enron's shares the next year, refering to the stock's share price of below $1 in violation of its Big Board standards as the explanation.

All the more recently, the NYSE suspended trading in some Nasdaq-recorded shares, similar to Alphabet (GOOG) and Amazon (AMZN), for under a day, after a technical error brought about traders getting trade execution reports in an unusual way.
