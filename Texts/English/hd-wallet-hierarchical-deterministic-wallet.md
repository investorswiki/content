# Hierarchical Deterministic (HD) Wallet
## What Is a Hierarchical Deterministic (HD) Wallet?

A hierarchical deterministic (HD) wallet is a [digital wallet](/digital-wallet) generally used to store the digital keys for holders of cryptographic forms of money like Bitcoin and Ethereum. Anybody with a copy of both the public and secret key like private key have some control over the [cryptocurrency](/cryptocurrency) in the account.

## Understanding Hierarchical Deterministic (HD) Wallets

In the cryptocurrency world, wallets contain keys rather than coins. A cryptocurrency wallet has two keys: a public key or address, which acts similar as an account number, and a [private key](/private-key) that the holder uses to transfer funds to different accounts. The private key is similar as a secret word. Somebody transferring [Bitcoin](/bitcoin) from their account, for instance, would utilize their private key to approve the transaction.

This combination of public and private keys is intended to guarantee security from programmers as well as namelessness in transactions. Since the pair of keys empowers the transfer of somebody's cryptocurrency, it is critical that the private key remaining parts safe. To this end, the keys are produced randomly.

Each key must be backed up in the wallet to forestall it and the funds it is linked to from getting permanently derailed to the owner. However, to guarantee protection — one of the reasons driving the creation of Bitcoin and other digital currencies — and limit the utilization of public keys to one transaction each, another pair of keys would should be made for every transaction. This can get hard to oversee over the long haul.

Deterministic wallets were made to offer a solution, one in which all keys can be followed back to an original random seed, normally a set of random words, and a [hash function](/hash). With a deterministic wallet, the original seed is sufficient to recuperate all private and public keys, hence requiring just a single backup at the hour of creation.

## Deterministic versus Hierarchical Deterministic Wallets

HD Wallets are the most advanced type of deterministic wallet. They contain keys in a tree structure, in which parent keys can create children keys, which can deliver grandchildren keys, etc, vastly. The cryptocurrency holder can utilize the tree structure to arrange transactions by type of transaction or by entity included, like divisions or auxiliaries.

Like simple deterministic wallets, all HD wallets are made from a single master root seed, generally addressed by a mental helper word sequence, which makes it more straightforward for account holders to decipher and store. Yet, HD wallets likewise offer the option of making public keys without getting to the comparing private keys. This means they can be utilized on insecure servers or in a get just mode.

## Features
- To forestall hacking these keys must be randomly created and backed up in the wallet.
- A hierarchical deterministic wallet is a digital wallet regularly used to store the keys for holders of digital currencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum.
- HD wallets empower a series of key pairs to be made from one random seed, giving convenience and reasonability as well as undeniable level security.
