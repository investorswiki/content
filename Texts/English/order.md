## What Is an Order?

An order comprises of directions to a [broker](/broker) or brokerage firm to purchase or sell a security for an investor's sake. An order is the fundamental trading unit of a securities market. Orders are normally placed via telephone or online through a [trading platform](/trading-platform), in spite of the fact that orders may progressively be placed through automated trading systems and calculations. At the point when an order is placed, it follows a course of [order execution](/execution).

Orders comprehensively fall into various categories, which allow investors to place limitations on their orders influencing the price and time at which the order can be executed. These [conditional order](/conditionalorder) guidelines can direct a specific price level (limit) at which the order must be executed, for how long the order can stay in force, or whether an order is set off or canceled in view of another order, in addition to other things.

## Figuring out Orders

Investors use a broker to buy or sell an asset utilizing an order type fitting their personal preference. At the point when an investor has chosen to buy or sell an asset, they start an order. The order gives the broker directions on the most proficient method to continue.

Generally, [exchanges](/exchange) trade securities through a bid/ask process. This means that to sell, there must be a buyer ready to pay the selling price. To buy there must be a seller able to sell at the buyer's price. Except if a buyer and seller meet up at a similar price, no transaction happens.

The [bid](/bid) is the highest advertised price somebody will pay for an asset, and the [ask](/ask) is the lowest advertised price at which somebody will sell an asset. The bid and ask are continually changing, as each bid and offer addresses an order. As orders are [filled](/fill), these levels will change. For instance, on the off chance that there is a bid at 25.25 and one more at 25.26, when every one of the orders at 25.26 have been filled, the next highest bid is 25.25.

This bid/ask process is important to keep as a top priority while submitting a request on the grounds that the type of order chosen will impact the price at which the trade is filled, when it will be filled, or whether it will be filled by any means.

## Order Types

On most markets, orders are accepted from both individual and institutional investors. Most individuals trade through [broker-dealers](/broker-vendor), which expect them to place one of many order types while making a trade. Markets work with various order types that accommodate some investing prudence while planning a trade.

### Here are some fundamental order types:
- A [market order](/marketorder) educates the brokerage to complete the order at the next accessible price. Market orders have no specific price and are generally consistently executed except if there is no trading liquidity. Market orders are regularly utilized in the event that the trader needs access or out of a trade rapidly and isn't worried about the price they get.
- A [limit order](/limitorder) trains the brokerage to buy a security at or below a predefined price. Limit orders guarantee that a buyer pays just a specific price to purchase a security. Limit orders can stay in effect until they are executed, terminate, or are canceled.
- A limit sell order trains the broker to sell the asset at a price that is over the current price. For [long](/long) positions, this order type is utilized to take profits when the price has moved higher in the wake of buying.
- A [stop order](/stoporder) educates the brokerage to sell in the event that an asset arrives at a predefined price below the current price. A stop order can be a market order, meaning it takes any price when set off, or it tends to be a stop-limit order wherein it can execute inside a certain price range (limit) subsequent to being set off.
- A [buy stop order](/buystoporder) teaches the broker to buy an asset when it arrives at a predetermined price over the current price.
- A [day order](/dayorder) must be executed during the very trading day that the order is placed.
- [Great until canceled (GTC)](/gtc) orders stay in effect until they are filled or canceled.
- On the off chance that an order isn't a day order or a decent until canceled order, the trader commonly sets an expiry for the order.
- [Immediate or cancel (IOC)](/immediateorcancel) means that the order just remaining parts active for an exceptionally short period of time, like several seconds.
- A [all-or-none (AON)](/aon) order indicates that the whole size of the order be filled, and partial fills won't be accepted.
- A [fill-or-kill (FOK)](/fok) order must be completed immediately and completely or not the slightest bit and joins an AON order with an IOC order.

Order types can significantly influence the consequences of a trade. While attempting to buy, for instance, setting a buy limit at a lower price than what the asset is currently trading at may give the trader a better price in the event that the asset drops in value (compared to buying now). Yet, putting it too low might mean the price never arrives at the limit order, and the trader might pass up a major opportunity in the event that the price moves higher.
