The term "deposit in transit" is utilized to sort this cash entry and keep track of timing differences that may some way or another reason difficulty in accommodating the company's cash balance on its [financial statements](/financial-statements) to its month to month [bank statements](/bank-statement).

## Figuring out Deposits In Transit

A transit thing is any check or draft that is issued by an institution other than the bank where it is to be deposited. Transit things are isolated from internal transactions including checks that were written by a bank's own customers. Transit things are submitted to the drawee's bank through either direct show or by means of a neighborhood [clearing house](/clearinghouse).

Most banks will place a [hold](/hold) on a deposited transit check, as permitted by [Federal Reserve Regulation CC](/regulation-cc). Regulation CC permits banks to place a hold of as long as nine days on transit things. Most banks will place a hold on a transit thing long enough for the thing to clear the account on which it's drawn. Since the thing is drawn on an account at an alternate bank from the one where it's been deposited, this can require a couple of days.

Notwithstanding, many banks make funds from deposited transit things accessible the next business day after the deposits, or two business days after the fact, as an issue of policy. This is conceivable on the grounds that electronic check conversion and different forms of electronic bank draft conversion make it conceivable to clear transit things quicker.

## Special Considerations

Assuming that there are [insufficient funds](/nsf) in the account on which it's drawn, the transit thing won't clear. At the point when this occurs, the funds won't be deposited according to plan. At times, a bank might consent to cash a transit thing before it has cleared, however in the event that it doesn't clear, the bank will then debit the amount from the depositor's account to cover the error.

For companies that collect their own payments, to build accurate financial statements, [accountants](/accountant) must frequently accommodate timing differences brought about by factors like deposits in transit.

Since ABC Company needs to report its cash and accounts receivable balances as of the [year-end](/fiscalyearend), it is appropriate to count this $10,000 deposit in transit as being in cash as of the year-end, even however the bank didn't post it to its balance until some other time.
