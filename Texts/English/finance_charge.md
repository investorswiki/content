# Finance Charge
# What is a finance charge?
A finance charge is the cost of borrowing money, including interest and different fees. It tends to be a percentage of the amount borrowed or a flat fee charged by the company. Credit card companies have various approaches to computing finance charges.
## More profound definition
A finance charge is generally added to the amount you borrow, except if you pay the full amount back inside the grace period . In certain examples, for example, credit card cash advances, you really want to pay a finance charge even assuming you pay the amount in full by the due date.
Finance charges shift in view of the type of loan or credit you have and the company. A common approach to working out a finance charge on a credit card is to duplicate the average daily balance by the annual percentage rate (APR) and the days in your billing cycle. The product is then separated by 365 .
Mortgages additionally carry finance charges. At the point when you take out a mortgage, you normally need to pay interest as well as discount points, mortgage insurance and different fees. Anything over the principal on the loan is a finance charge.
To figure out the amount you will pay in finance charges throughout the span of a fixed term mortgage, duplicate the number of payments you'll make by the regularly scheduled payment amount. Then, subtract the amount of the loan's principal.
## Finance charge model
Let's assume you charge $500 on a credit card this month. You pay $250 by the due date yet can't make the full payment. When the due date passes, your card balance is $250. In the event that you don't utilize the card next month and make no payments, your average daily balance remains $250, and you will pay a finance charge on that amount.
At the point when the next billing cycle shuts, the card company duplicates the $250 by your APR and the days in the billing cycle. In the event that you have 25 days in a billing cycle with an APR of 18 percent, the card company multiples 250 by 0.18 and by 25 to get $1,125 and afterward separates by 365 to get $3.08. The $3.08 will be the finance charge on your next statement.
