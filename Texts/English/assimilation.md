# Assimilation
## What Is Assimilation?

Assimilation alludes to the absorption of a new or secondary stock issuance by the public after it has been purchased by the [underwriter](/underwriter).

## Grasping Assimilation

At the point when a company makes shares of its stock available for purchase to the public, either through a [initial public offering (IPO)](/ipo) or through a secondary offering, the shares will initially be allocated to at least one underwriters. It is then the underwriters' job to sell the shares to the public and for those shares to be absorbed. When every one of the shares have been sold by the underwriter, the stock is viewed as absorbed.

When the new shares have a place with investors, they are traded on the [secondary market](/secondarymarket) like some other security. A company that is notable and sets a reasonable share price will be bound to see its new shares immediately acclimatized. Lack of assimilation can be an indication that investors are not certain about the company or think it has overvalued its shares. In some cases lack of assimilation might result from buyers not being completely aware of the stock offering, which would recommend a mistake with respect to the underwriters.

In the event that a company is giving more shares, the new shares will be absorbed into the existing shares. The new shares will be vague from the old ones, carrying similar rights and privileges as the original shares. On account of an IPO, the shares will give the rights and qualifications given by the responsible company.

On account of a [secondary offering](/secondaryoffering) where the shares are not equivalent to formerly issued shares, for example, offering Class B shares rather than Class A shares, the rights and privileges might be not the same as those of the other class of shares formerly issued. One class, for instance, might not have [voting rights](/votingright).

> Regardless of what type of share issuance it is, the goal of the underwriter is to absorb the shares.

## Illustration of Assimilation

In a fairly odd case in Canada, Shaw Communications Inc. (SJR) was a major shareholder in Corus Entertainment Inc. (TSX: CJR.B). Shaw wanted out of their position in May 2019. Rather than basically selling the shares on the open market, Shaw got an underwriter to buy their shares stake, which was in excess of 80 million shares, in a [bought deal](/boughtdeal).

Shaw received $6.80 for their shares from the underwriter, even however the stock closed at $8.06 the day preceding the deal was announced. Shaw was ready to take the marked down share price in exchange for a clean exit from their position and not having to [unwind](/unwind) the large position themselves. Corus stock was averaging daily volume of around 555,600 shares from the outset of January through the hour of the announcement. It would have taken Shaw a lot of opportunity to sell their position themselves.

The $6.80 price tag was likewise a price at which the underwriters felt they could sell the shares, given the price had as of late been above $8. It then turned into the underwriter's job to absorb those shares into the public's hands by finding buyers for those 80 million or more shares.
