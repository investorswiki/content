## What Is the Difference Between a Doji and a Spinning Top?

The size of the doji's tail or wick combined with the size of the confirmation candle can in some cases mean the entry point for a trade is a long way from the stop loss location. This means traders should track down one more location for the stop loss, or they might have to do without the trade since too large of a stop loss may not justify the likely reward of the trade.

Assessing the likely reward of a doji-informed trade can likewise be troublesome since candlestick patterns don't commonly give price targets. Different procedures, for example, other candlestick patterns, indicators, or strategies are required to exit the trade when and if profitable.
