# Bid-Ask Spread
The concept is known as the bid-ask spread since it is the gap between the lowest [asking price](/asking-price) (sell order) and the highest [bid price](/bidprice) (buy order).
Fundamentally, the bid-ask spread might be shaped in two unique ways. In the first place, it very well may be made by a broker (or trading intermediary) as a method for adapting for their service. Second, it very well may be made just by the differences between the limit orders put by traders on an open market.
In traditional markets, the bid-ask spread is a common approach to adapting from trading activities. For instance, many brokers and trading platforms offer without commission services that just monetize by utilizing the bid-ask spread. This is conceivable in light of the fact that they are the ones that provide liquidity to the market, implying that sellers and buyers need to acknowledge the price defined by the broker. Any other way, they can't partake in that market. As such, they set the difference among selling and buying prices and create gains from it, basically buying at a lower price from sellers and selling at a higher price to buyers.
With digital forms of money, most trading activities happen on cryptocurrency exchanges, where buying and selling orders are straightforwardly positioned by the users (traders) into the order book. In this case, the exchange doesn't monetize from the spread, however just from the trading fees.
Normally, high volume markets have a lower spread due to their higher liquidity (more competition among buyers and sellers). Then again, markets that are not sufficiently liquid and present low trading volume will quite often have a more huge spread.

## Highlights
- The spread is the transaction cost. Price takers buy at the ask price and sell at the bid price, yet the market maker buys at the bid price and sells at the ask price.
- The bid addresses demand and the ask addresses supply for an asset.
- The bid-ask spread is the de facto measure of market liquidity.
- A bid-ask spread is the difference between the highest price that a buyer will pay for an asset and the lowest price that a seller will acknowledge.
## FAQ
### What Causes a Bid-Ask Spread to Be High?
Bid-ask spread, otherwise called "spread", can be high due to a number of factors. To start with, liquidity assumes a primary part. At the point when there is a lot of liquidity in a given market for a security, the spread will be more tight. Stocks that are traded vigorously, like Google, Apple, and Microsoft will have a smaller bid-ask spread.Conversely, a bid-ask spread might be high to obscure, or disliked securities on a given day. These could include small-cap stocks, which might have lower trading volumes, and a lower level of demand among investors.
### How Does Bid-Ask Spread Work?
In financial markets, a bid-ask spread is the difference between the asking price and the offering price of a security or other asset. The bid-ask spread is the difference between the highest price a buyer will offer (the bid price) and the lowest price a seller will acknowledge (the ask price). Normally, an asset with a narrow bid-ask spread will have high demand. On the other hand, assets with a wide bid-ask spread might have a low volume of demand, hence impacting wider errors in its price.
### What Is an Example of a Bid-Ask Spread in Stocks?
Consider the following model where a trader is hoping to purchase 100 shares of Apple for $50. The trader sees that 100 shares are being offered at $50.05 in the market. Here, the spread would be $50.00 - $50.05, or $0.05 wide. While this spread might appear to be small or unimportant, on large trades, it can make a significant difference, which is the reason narrow spreads are commonly more ideal. The total value of the bid-ask spread, in this occasion, would be equivalent to 100 shares x $0.05, or $5.
