# Pass-Through Security
## What Is a Pass-Through Security?

A pass-through security is a pool of fixed-income securities backed by a package of [assets](/resource). A servicing intermediary gathers the regularly scheduled payments from issuers and, in the wake of deducting a fee, dispatches or passes them through to the holders of the pass-through security (that is, individuals or entitities who have invested in it). A pass-through security is otherwise called a "pay-through security" or a "[pass-through certificate](/passthroughcertificate)" — however technically the certificate is the evidence of interest or participation in a pool of assets that implies the transfer of payments to investors; it's not the security itself.

## Pass-Through Security Explained

A pass-through security is a derivative in view of certain debt receivables that gives the investor a right to a portion of those profits. Frequently, the debt receivables are from underlying assets, which can incorporate things like mortgages on homes or loans on vehicles. Every security addresses a large number of debts, for example, many home mortgages or great many vehicle loans.

The term "pass-through" connects with the transaction interaction itself, whether it includes a mortgage or other loan product. It begins with the debtor payment, which passes through a [intermediary](/financialintermediary) before being delivered to the investor.

Payments are made to investors consistently, comparing with the standard payment schedules for debt repayment. The payments incorporate a portion of the [accrued interest](/accruedinterest) on the unpaid principal, and another portion that goes toward the [principal ](/principal)itself.

## Risks of Pass-Through Securities

The risk of default on the debts associated with the securities is a consistently present factor, as inability to pay on the debtor's part brings about lower returns. Should an adequate number of debtors default, the securities can basically lose all value.

Another risk is tied straightforwardly to current interest rates. On the off chance that interest rates fall, there is a higher probability that current debts might be renegotiated to make the most of the low-interest rates. This outcomes in more modest interest payments, which mean lower returns for the investors of pass-through securities.

Prepayment with respect to the debtor can likewise influence return. Should a large number of debtors pay more than least payments, the amount of interest accrued on the debt is lower — and of course, it becomes non-existent on the off chance that the debtor completely repays the loan ahead of schedule. At last, these prepayments bring about lower returns for securities investors. In certain occasions, loans will have [prepayment penalties](/prepaymentpenalty) that might offset probably the interest-based losses a prepayment will cause.

## An Example of Pass-Through Securities

The most common type of pass-through is a mortgage-backed certificate or a [mortgage-backed security ](/mbs)(MBS), in which a homeowner's payment passes from the original bank through a government agency or investment bank before arriving at investors. These types of pass-throughs get their value from unpaid mortgages, wherein the owner of the security gets payments in light of a partial claim to the payments being made by the different debtors. Different mortgages are packaged together, shaping a pool, which hence spreads the risk across numerous loans. These securities are generally [self-amortizing](/self-amortizing_loan), meaning the whole mortgage principal is paid off in a predetermined period of time with standard interest and principal payments.

- The most common type of pass-through is a mortgage-backed security(MBS).
