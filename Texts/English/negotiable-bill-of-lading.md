# Negotiable Bill of Lading
## Negotiable Bill of Lading

Lading is the method involved with loading cargo onto a ship or vessel, and a negotiable bill of lading is one sort of [bill of lading](/billoflading). The bill of lading is a legal document between the shipper and carrier, specifying the type, quantity, and objective of goods being carried. The negotiable bill of lading is recognized by the way that a contract of carriage can be transferred to a [third party](/outsider).

## How a Negotiable Bill of Lading Works

The bill of lading fills in as a receipt of shipment when the goods are delivered at the predetermined objective. That is, the beneficiary recognizes that the goods have been delivered by signing the document. Of course, there are various types of bills of lading, each type with unique limitations and conditions. For instance, the [ocean bill of lading](/ocean-bill-of-lading) applies just to cargo that is shipped across international waters.

A negotiable bill of landing can be transferred to an outsider through [consignment](/consignment). This happens when the recipient (the person or entity that is the buyer and is monetarily responsible for the goods) signs or embraces the document and delivers it to the new representative (the outsider). To transfer the negotiable bill of lading, the dispatcher (the person or business shipping the goods) must stamp and sign the bill. Then, at that point, the carrier must deliver it. A negotiable bill of lading must be written to the order of the proctor. It must be a [clean bill of lading](/clean-bill-lading).

## Clean Bills of Lading versus Straight Bill of Lading

A clean bill of lading is issued by a carrier pronouncing that goods have been received in the suitable condition, without deserts. The product carrier issues a clean bill of lading in the wake of reviewing the goods. Assuming the bill of lading is "claused" or "fouled" when it notes that the products or goods are harmed or defective.

A [uniform bill of lading ](/uniform-bill-of-lading)or straight bill of lading was first adopted in 1909 and illuminated how a carrier can limit its liability. It may not be transferred and is simply deliverable to the named agent (beneficiary). Like any bill of lading, the uniform bill of lading likewise records the goods being moved and fills in as a contract of the terms of the shipment.
