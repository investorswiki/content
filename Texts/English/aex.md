## What Is the Amsterdam Stock Exchange (AEX) .AS?

Established in 1602, alongside the creation of the Dutch East India Company (VOC), the Amsterdam Stock Exchange is considered the most seasoned, as yet working stock exchange in the world.

The requirement for a bank developed with the pervasiveness of European trade and with the need to offer lenders a method for profitting in this commerce. The Dutch East India Company was one of the earliest organizations to compete for the exports from the zest and slave trade. It was a [joint-stock company](/jointstockcompany) and would offer shares to investors who might bankroll the journeys. Lenders required a safe and regulated place where buy and sell shares of these early global endeavors.

Before the AEX, numerous locales and towns had independent systems of asset valuation and trade regulation which worked similar as stock exchanges, however the AEX was the primary official stock exchange as far as we might be concerned.

## The Basics of the Amsterdam Stock Exchange (AEX) .AS

Over its very long term history, the Amsterdam Stock Exchange has gone through several ownership changes and governance structures.

Shifting focus over to recent history, in 1997 the Amsterdam Stock Exchange and the European Options Exchange (EOE) merged, and its blue-chip index was renamed AEX for "Amsterdam Exchange."

In September 2000, the Amsterdam Stock Exchange merged with the Brussels Stock Exchange and the Paris Stock Exchange to form Euronext Amsterdam. Euronext is Europe's biggest cash equities market. For quite a while fell under the umbrella of NYSE Euronext, which worked several exchanges, including the New York Stock Exchange, the Liffe in London, and NYSE Arca Options. In 2014, Euronext was veered off to become an independent entity by and by. Starting around 2017, Euronext was the 6th biggest combined stock exchange by market cap.

## Equity Indexes of the AEX

Euronext Amsterdam's three broad equity indexes are the blue-chip AEX, [mid-cap](/midcapstock) AMX, and small-cap AScX. By a long shot, the most traded and powerful index is the AEX, which started in 1983 and is composed of more than 20 of the most often traded Dutch companies which trade on Euronext Amsterdam. These companies incorporate international organizations like Unilever, ING Group, Philips, and Royal Dutch Shell. It is one of the leading national indices of the stock exchange group Euronext alongside Brussels' BEL 20, Paris' CAC 40, and Germany's DAX.

## Real World Example

Survey of the composition of the AEX index is done each quarter, with a comprehensive audit conducted in March and interim surveys in June, September, and December. Any changes made to the index because of these assessments produce results on the third Friday of the month. Before 2008, index changes were made just once yearly in March.

The AEX is a [market capitalization-weighted index](/capitalizationweightedindex), with initial index weightings of any one company capped at 15%. The index loads are calculated concerning the closing prices of the important companies on March 1. During quarterly surveys, weightings after adjustment are left all around as close as conceivable to those of the previous day and are not re-capped.
