# Impulse Wave Pattern
## What Is an Impulse Wave Pattern?

An impulse wave pattern is an indication of a strong move in a financial asset's price harmonizing with the fundamental course of the underlying trend. Impulse waves can allude to up movements in [uptrends](/uptrend) or descending movements in [downtrends](/downtrend).

The term is utilized habitually by disciples of [Elliott Wave theory](/elliottwavetheory), a method for dissecting and foreseeing price movements in the financial markets.

## Understanding Impulse Waves

The fascinating thing about impulse wave patterns comparable to the Elliott Wave theory is that they are not limited to a certain time span. A wave can last for several hours, several years, or many years.

No matter what the time period utilized, impulse waves generally run in a similar heading as the trend however at a one-bigger degree. These impulse waves are displayed in the illustration below as wave 1, wave 3, and wave 5, while all in all waves 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 form a five-wave impulse at a one-bigger degree.

Impulse waves comprise of five sub-waves that make net movement in a similar course as the trend of the following biggest degree. This pattern is the most common motive wave and the simplest to spot in a market. Like every single motive wave, it comprises of five sub-waves: three of them are additionally motive waves, and two are corrective waves.

This is named as a 5-3-5-3-5 structure as displayed previously.

In any case, it has three rules that characterize its formation. These rules are solid. In the event that one of these rules is abused, the structure isn't an impulse wave and one would have to re-name the thought impulse wave. The three rules are:

- Wave 2 can't follow over 100% of wave one
- Wave 3 can never be the most brief of waves one, three, and five
- Wave 4 can't overlap wave one

## Elliott Wave Theory

Elliott Wave theory was formulated by R.N. Elliott during the 1930s in view of his study of 75 years of stock charts covering different time spans. Elliott planned his theory to give experiences into the probable future bearing of bigger price movements in the equity market. The theory can be utilized related to other [technical analysis](/technicalanalysis) methods to pinpoint possible opportunities.

Wave theory tries to ascertain market price course through the study of impulse wave and corrective wave patterns. Impulse waves comprise of five more modest degree waves net moving in a similar heading as a bigger trend, while [corrective waves](/corrective-waves) are made out of three more modest degree waves moving the other way.

To the theory's backers, a bull market comprises of a five-wave impulse, and a bear market comprises of a corrective retracement, paying little mind to estimate.

The number of waves in a five-wave impulse, the number of waves in a three-wave correction, and the number of waves in mixes thereof accord with [Fibonacci numbers](/fibonaccilines), a numeric sequence associated with growth and decay in life forms. Elliott saw that wave retracements frequently conform to Fibonacci ratios, for example, 38.2% and 61.8%, which depend on the golden ratio of 1.618.

Wave patterns are likewise a part of the Elliott Wave oscillator, a device motivated by Elliott Wave theory that portrays price patterns as positive or negative above or below a fixed horizontal hub.

Elliott Wave theory keeps on being a well known trading device, because of Robert Prechter and his partners at Elliott Wave International, a market research firm formed to apply and improve Elliott's original work by incorporating it with such current innovations as artificial intelligence.

## Features
- Impulse waves comprise of five sub-waves that make a net movement in a similar course as the trend of the following biggest degree.
- Elliott Wave Theory is a method of technical analysis that searches for recurrent long-term price patterns that are connected with steady changes in investor sentiment and psychology.
- Impulse waves are trend-confirming patterns distinguished by Elliott Wave theory.
