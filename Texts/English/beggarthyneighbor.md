## What Is Beggar-Thy-Neighbor?

Beggar-thy-neighbor is a term utilized for a set of policies that a country orders to address its economic hardships that, thus, really deteriorate the economic issues of different countries. The term comes from the policy's impact, as it makes a "beggar" out of neighboring countries.

## Grasping Beggar-Thy-Neighbor

Beggar-thy-neighbor frequently alludes to international trade policy that benefits the country that authorized it, while hurting its neighbors or trade partners. [Protectionism](/protectionism) is many times seen as a key illustration of policies that are planned to reinforce a domestic economy, yet which may negatively impact trading partners.

Beggar-thy-neighbor policies came to fruition, initially, as a policy solution to domestic [depression](/depression) and high joblessness rates. The fundamental thought is to increase the demand for a nation's exports, while decreasing dependence on [imports](/import).

This means driving consumption of domestic goods up, rather than consumption of imports. This is normally accomplished with a trade hindrance of some sort — [tariffs](/duty) or [quotas](/quantity) — or [competitive devaluation](/competitive-devaluation) to bring down the price of exports and drive work and the price of imports up.

A currency war is a prime illustration of beggar-thy-neighbor in real life since it adds up to a nation endeavoring to gain an economic advantage without consideration for the ill effects it might have on different countries. Otherwise called competitive devaluation, this is a specific pattern of blow for blow policies where one nation coordinates an unexpected national currency devaluation with another devaluation.

At the end of the day, one nation is matched by a [currency devaluation](/currency-deterioration) of one more in a negative feedback loop. Frequently the country cheapening first plans to help its exports on the global market, and not be guaranteed to truly hurt.

## Beggar-Thy-Neighbor: A Brief History

The term is widely credited to the logician and economist Adam Smith, who involved the term in **The Wealth of Nations,** a critique of mercantilism and protectionist trade policies. Smith saw mercantilism and its [zero-sum](/zero-sumgame) comprehension of the market empowering nations to beggar each other to increase economic gain as misinformed; all things being equal, he accepted that [free trade](/free-trade) would lead to long-term economic growth that was not zero-sum, yet would really increase the wealth of — you got it — all nations.

By and by, many country's have sent [mercantilist](/mercantilism) and protectionist economic policies as the years progressed. A number of countries did as such during the [Great Depression](/great_depression), Japan did after WWII, and China did after the Cold War.

With the rise of globalization during the 1990s, beggar-thy-neighbor dropped off the radar — generally. As of late, however, protectionist policies have been getting back in the game, to some degree in visibility, as confirmed by former President Donald Trump's 'America First' way of talking.
