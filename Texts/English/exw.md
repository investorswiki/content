An ex works agreement is not the same as a [free-on-board](/fob) (FOB) agreement, in which the seller covers the cost of getting its goods to a shipping terminal and pays every one of the customs costs to get the goods ready. In the interim, the buyer actually needs to pay to find, contract, and pay the shipping company, as well as the customs costs incurred when the goods arrive at their country of objective.

In such cases, the [free carrier](/fca) (FCA) term is best. Free Carrier means the seller is responsible for delivering goods to a specific objective.
