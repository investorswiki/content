# Accrued Interest Adjustment
## What Is Accrued Interest Adjustment?

Accrued interest adjustment brings down a [fixed-income security](/fixed-incomesecurity) buyer's taxable interest income by decreasing the extra interest amount that is paid to them.

## Figuring out Accrued Interest Adjustment

A [convertible bond](/convertiblebond) has a [embedded option](/embeddedoption) which gives a bondholder the right to change over their bond into the equity of the responsible company or a subsidiary. An interest-paying convertible bond will make [coupon payments](/coupon) to bondholders for the duration of time the bond is held. [Accrued interest](/accruedinterest) is the total interest that has been amassed since the last coupon payment date and is the amount that is owed to the owner of a convertible bond or other fixed-income security.

After the bond has been changed over completely to shares of the issuer, the bondholder stops getting interest payments. At the time an investor changes over a convertible bond, there will typically be one final partial payment made to the bondholder to cover the amount that has accrued since the last payment date of record. For instance, expect interest on a bond is scheduled to be paid on March 1 and September 1 consistently. Assuming an investor switches their bond holdings over completely to equity on July 1, they will be paid the interest that has accumulated from March 1 to July 1.

While buying bonds in the [secondary market](/secondarymarket), the buyer will as a rule need to pay accrued interest to the seller as part of the total purchase price. An investor that purchases a bond at some point between the last coupon payment and the next coupon payment will receive the full interest on the scheduled coupon payment date, given that they will be the bondholder of record. This last interest payment is the accrued interest.

Nonetheless, since the buyer didn't earn all of the interest accrued over this period, they must pay the bond seller the portion of the interest that the seller earned before selling the bond. For instance, expect a bond has a fixed coupon that will be paid semi-yearly on June 1 and December 1 consistently. On the off chance that a bondholder sells this bond on October 1, the buyer receives the full coupon payment on the next coupon date, which would be December 1. In this case, the buyer must pay the seller the interest accrued from June 1 to October 1. Generally, the price of a bond incorporates the accrued interest and this price is called the full or [dirty price](/dirtyprice).

The accrued interest adjustment diminishes the taxable interest income by deducting the extra amount of interest that is paid to the new owner of the fixed income security. The accrued interest adjustment is subject to similar laws of taxation as is ordinary interest. The amount of the accrued interest adjustment will constantly differ, as per the number of days that slip by between the last payment date of record and the date of conversion.
