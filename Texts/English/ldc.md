# Least-Developed Countries (LDC)
## What Are Least-Developed Countries (LDC)?

Least-developed countries (LDCs) (some of the time alluded to as less-developed countries) are underdeveloped countries that face significant structural difficulties to sustainable development. The UN's rundown of LDCs right now includes 46 countries.

## Seeing Least-Developed Countries

Least-developed countries are highly powerless against economic and environmental shocks and have less [human assets](/humancapital) than different nations. At times, least-developed countries are alluded to as "developing markets." LDCs approach specific international support measures for development assistance and trade that are not accessible to additional developed nations.

The U.N's. Committee for Development Policy (CDP) Secretariat of the Department of Economic and Social Affairs/Department of Economic and Social Affairs (DPAD/DESA) made measures to assist LDCs with gaining access to and benefit from international support. The secretariat is responsible for auditing the situation with LDCs and monitoring their progress after they graduate from the LDC category.

The secretariat's criteria for putting nations on its rundown of least-developed countries incorporate the categories of income, human assets, and economic weakness:

- Income thresholds are $1,018, which is set at the three-year average of [gross national income (GNI)](/gross-national-income-gni) per capita. The graduation threshold is 20% higher at $1,222.
- Human assets are calculated utilizing five markers, gathered into a wellbeing and education subindex.
- The economic weakness index measures structural weakness to economic and environmental shocks, with a high level of weakness, which shows major structural hindrances to sustainable development.
