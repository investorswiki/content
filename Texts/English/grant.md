## What is a grant?
A grant is a type of financial aid to students that they don't need to repay. The absolute most common grants incorporate Pell Grants, Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grants (SEOG) and merit-based grants. Students can apply to the federal government, state government, schools and private organizations for this type of financial aid.
## More profound definition
The U.S. Department of Education offers four grants to students at two-year and four-year colleges, universities and career education schools. College students who have not previously earned a four year certification and show financial need might apply for a Pell Grant.
Students at select schools who exhibit the best financial need might apply for a SEOG with a maximum award of $4,000 each year. Individuals who consent to show in a serious need field at a school that serves low-income families might fit the bill for a Teacher Education Assistance for College and Higher Education Grant worth up to $4,000.
Students who don't meet the criteria for a Pell Grant and have a parent who passed on while serving in Iraq or Afghanistan might fit the bill for an Iraq and Afghanistan Service Grant.
To apply for grants, you must initially complete the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) to decide your economic status for grants and scholarships. When you know this, you can begin applying for grants. Pay thoughtfulness regarding the award requirements, and completely complete every application.
Generally speaking, students don't need to pay back the money they receive from grants. A few grants have obligations that qualifying students must meet.
For instance, students who receive a TEACH Grant must fill in as a profoundly qualified teacher at a certain type of school for a period of four years. On the off chance that they fail to meet these obligations, the Department of Education changes the grant over completely to a student loan, which the student must pay back.
## Grant model
To figure out which grants make up your financial aid package, audit the reward letter you received from your school. It records the grants you receive and the amount of each award. For instance, in the event that you fit the bill for a federal Pell Grant, you perceive how much the government gives you. Assuming that you meet all requirements for the maximum Pell Grant, you receive more than $5,000 for the year.
