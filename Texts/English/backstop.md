# Barrier
## What Is a Back Stop?

In corporate finance and investment banking, a screen (or backstop) is to give final retreat support or to make a bid in a securities [offering](/offering) for the [unsubscribed](/unsubscribed) portion of shares.

At the point when a company is trying to raise capital through an issuance — and needs to guarantee the amount received through the issue — it might get a barrier from an underwriter or a major shareholder, for example, a [investment bank](/investmentbank), to buy any of its unsubscribed shares.

## How a Back Stop Works

A barrier functions as a form of insurance. While not an actual insurance plan, a company can guarantee that a certain amount of its offering will be purchased by specific organizations, for the most part investment banking firms, in the event that the open market doesn't deliver an adequate number of investors and a portion of the offering goes unsold.

Assuming the organization giving the screen is an investment banking firm, sub-underwriters addressing the investment firm will go into an agreement with the company. This agreement is alluded to as a firm-responsibility underwriting deal or contract, and it offers overall help for the offering by resolving to purchase a specific number of unsold shares.

By going into a firm-responsibility underwriting agreement, the associated organization has guaranteed full responsibility for the quantity of shares determined in the event that they initially go unsold, and vows to give the associated capital in exchange for the accessible shares.

This gives assurance to the issuer that the base capital can be raised no matter what the open market activity. Also, all risk associated with the predefined shares is effectively moved to the guaranteed organization.

On the off chance that the offering is all purchased through customary investment vehicles, the contract committing the organization to purchase any unsold shares is delivered void, as the conditions encompassing the guarantee to purchase never again exist.

> The contracts between an issuer and the underwriting organization can take different forms. For instance, the underwriting organization can furnish the issuer with a revolving credit loan to help credit ratings for the issuer. They may likewise issue letters of credit as guarantees to the entity raising capital through offerings.

## Special Considerations

On the off chance that the underwriting organization claims any shares, as determined in the agreement, the shares have a place with the organization to oversee as it sees fit. The shares are dealt with the same way as some other investment purchased through normal market activity. The responsible company can impose no limitations on how the shares are traded.

The underwriting organization may in this way hold or sell the associated securities per the regulations that administer the activity overall.

## Illustration of a Back Stop

In a [rights offering](/rightsoffering), you might see a statement to this effect: "ABC Company will give a 100 percent fence of up to $100 million for any unsubscribed portion of the XYZ Company rights offering." If XYZ is trying to raise $200 million, yet just raises $100 million through investors, then ABC Company purchases the remainder.
