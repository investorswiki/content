## Grasping Jekyll and Hyde

In Robert Louis Stevenson's **The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde,** Dr. Jekyll, a fair and suitable scientist, releases his dark side, Mr. Hyde, through hasty trial and error on himself in a research center. Despite the fact that Jekyll and Hyde have incongruous qualities, they are indeed the very same person.

The exemplification of good and abhorrent in one man is on occasion resembled in the stock market. A quiet and unsurprising market can unexpectedly and mysteriously be destroyed by a furor of pessimism. Like the characters in Stevenson's novel, market participants and eyewitnesses are confused puzzled about this bizarre behavior and to make sense of its underlying causes.

### Development of Behavioral Finance

An economist would agree that that odd market behavior is in conflict with the [efficient market hypothesis](/efficientmarkethypothesis), which keeps up with that the price of any stock at some random time will continuously be equivalent to its fair market value since it will be founded on all of the information then accessible.

A somewhat new field of theory, [behavioral finance](/behavioralfinance), endeavors to make sense of how rational direction, or a lack of it, adds to hyper swings in a market. Collective human behavior associated with greed and fear makes bubbles form and afterward out of nowhere pop.

The Jekyll and Hyde syndrome could show a part of behavioral finance.
