# ZCash (ZEC)
## What Is ZCash (ZEC)?

ZCash arose in 2016 when a group of researchers concluded they wanted to make a cryptocurrency like Bitcoin however for certain extra features. They developed a fork of the Bitcoin blockchain, with enhanced client security and namelessness. The researchers previously concocted Zerocoin, which became Zerocash not too long after its initial release. In the end, the cryptocurrency was renamed ZCash.

## Figuring out ZCash (ZEC)

ZCash is forked from the original Bitcoin codebase. In 2014, Eli Ben-Sasson, Alessandro Chiesa, Christina Garman, Matthew Green, Ian Miers, Eran Tromer, and Madars Virza accepted there were security defects in the manner transactions were followed through Bitcoin's blockchain. In their whitepaper illustrating their thoughts, they called their cryptocurrency Zerocash.

The researchers made Zerocoin (Electric Coin Company) in 2015. In 2016, the name changed to Zcash, by the Electric Coin Company.

ZCash utilizes the [zk-SNARK](/zksnark) security protocol to guarantee the gatherings associated with a transaction are confirmed without uncovering any data to one another or the network.

Zk-Snark considers fully safeguarded transactions in which the shipper, beneficiary, and amount are encoded. This feature is a large deviation from other digital currencies, where transaction transparency is an underlying concept beside getting client data.

## How Is ZCash Different from Bitcoin?

The Bitcoin community prides itself on transparent transactions while keeping up with obscurity. Be that as it may, anyone with any interest or who has a stake in a transaction could trace the gatherings inside it.

ZCash doesn't dispense with transaction data. All things considered, it scrambles it with the goal that it can't be followed. The ZCash blockchain is as yet encoded, yet the security protocol zk-SNARK adds extra client security and namelessness.

Bitcoin utilizes the hashing algorithm SHA-256. ZCash utilizes Equihash, which is inconsistent with hardware and software intended for Bitcoin mining. It likewise has larger blocks and increased hashing times, which expands the network's hash rate. A cryptocurrency's hash rate is the processing power of the network of miners â€” it's a measure of how fast the transactions can be confirmed and approved to open another block.

[Hashing](/hash) is the cycle used to change over data into a string of alphanumeric characters. The string of numbers is unique since it is made from the data in the block. Once hashed, it can't be duplicated. The hashing algorithm is the mathematical method used to make the alphanumeric string, likewise called the hash.

## Objectives of ZCash

ZCash was intended to be efficient, safe, and anonymous. The designers behind ZCash likewise advance consenting to regulatory requirements. Also, you can pick full transparency when you use ZCash, in which case its transparency is like that of Bitcoin when transfers are directed.

## The most effective method to Mine ZCash

New coins are created by mining. You can utilize a [application-specific](/asic) integrated circuit (ASIC) miner or your computer on the off chance that it has a graphics card capable of mining. Operating systems upheld by ZCash are Docker, Debian/Ubuntu, Mac, and other Linux flavors. Nonetheless, ZCash suggests utilizing an ASIC miner and mining pool in light of the fact that the network difficulty has gotten high sufficient that PC mining isn't worth the time and costs.

ZCash utilizes a proof-of-work mining algorithm, which expects miners to contend with one another to deliver another block by hustling to settle the hash. The primary miner to find the solution opens another block and gets the [block reward](/block-reward).

## Highlights
- Zcoin can be mined on gadgets and computers, yet the currency is best mined on dedicated systems called application-specific integrated circuits.
- ZCash began as Zerocash; it was subsequently refined by the Electric Coin Company and rebranded ZCash.
- ZCash confirms ownership of coins and transactions more anonymously than Bitcoin, along these lines giving greater security to users.
- ZCash is a Bitcoin fork with an alternate hashing algorithm and security protocols.
## FAQ
### Is ZCash Safe?
ZCash is safe as in it stows away and safeguards your data.
### Does ZCash Use Proof of Work?
Indeed, it utilizes Equihash, a proof-of-work mining algorithm in view of the Generalized Birthday Problem concept.
### What number of ZCash are Left?
ZCash has a maximum supply of 21 million coins, with 14.6 million in circulation. When there are 21 million ZCash in circulation, no more can be mined, and you'll simply have the option to get them by purchasing them on an exchange or from an individual.
