## What Is the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA)?

The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) is an act made by the U.S. Congress in 1996 that corrects both the [Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA)](/erisa) and the Public Health Service Act (PHSA). HIPAA was enacted with an end goal to safeguard individuals covered by health care coverage and to set standards for the storage and privacy of personal medical data.

## How the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) Works

The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) guarantees that individual medical care plans are open, portable and renewable, and it sets the standards and the methods for how medical data is shared across the U.S. wellbeing system to prevent [fraud](/fraud). It seizes state law (except if the state's regulations are more tough).

Starting around 1996, HIPAA has been modified to incorporate processes for securely putting away and sharing patient medical data electronically. It additionally incorporates administrative improvement provisions, which are pointed toward expanding productivity and diminishing administrative costs by laying out national standards.

In 2009, the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (HITECH) expanded HIPAA privacy and security protections.

During a time of wellness tracking applications and GPS-followed, shareable data on everything from an individual's daily step count to their average pulse, drugs, sensitivities, and, surprisingly, feminine cycles, there are new difficulties for maintaining standards in putting away and protecting personal medical data.

In a video interview, Nan Halstead, wellbeing privacy and security attorney with Reed Smith LLP, said that future laws are probably not going to develop HIPAA. Rather, they will involve HIPAA's system as a model to make new laws overseeing the digital sector. Albeit no such federal laws have yet been passed, states can pass laws that fill the gap meanwhile. In addition, companies tracking consumer data are presently likewise subject to supervision by managing bodies like the [U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)](/fda) and the [Federal Trade Commission (FTC)](/ftc).
