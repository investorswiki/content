# Reinstatement Clause
## What Is a Reinstatement Clause?

A reinstatement clause is a [insurance](/insurance) policy clause that states when coverage terms are reset after the insured individual or business files a claim due to previous loss or damage. Reinstatement clauses don't ordinarily reset a policy's terms, yet they really do allow the policy to restart coverage for future claims.

## Figuring out a Reinstatement Clause

A reinstatement clause states when coverage terms are reset after the insured files a [claim](/insurance_claim). Individuals and businesses purchase insurance policies to cover themselves from damages or losses brought about by specific perils, like flames and floods. Coverage is set off when the damage or loss happens, at which point the insured can file a claim to receive money to cover damages.

The amount that the insured can recover from the insurer is set at a maximum amount, called the coverage limit. This limit might be set on a for every occurrence, per risk basis, or aggregate loss basis.

Insurance companies that are as yet processing a claim might need to limit any further coverage for an insured customer until the current claim is paid out. To be covered from future damages while an existing claim is as yet active, the insured customer would need to ensure that the policy is reset after the primary damage or loss and the coverage is recharged right away. This is finished through a reinstatement clause.

Reinstatement clauses show the place where coverage restarts. The restart might be set off by a claim being filed or by a claim being paid out by the insurer. Also, the clause will demonstrate whether the coverage limit is reset or whether a similar limit applies.

## Insurance Policy Reinstatement

The ability to [reinstate](/reinstatement) a policy isn't guaranteed by law, so the availability of a reinstatement clause might contrast between insurance suppliers and policies while restoring a previously expired policy. It generally relies on how long has elapsed since an insurance policy has expired, the company composing the policy, and the product type being restored. It very well may be more affordable to get another insurance policy than to restore an old policy.

## Illustration of a Reinstatement Clause

For instance, a business purchases a [property insurance](/property-insurance) policy, and the business works in an area that periodically has floods, however the frequency of the floods is normally low. Throughout the late spring, the area receives surprisingly rain, and the business is damaged by floodwaters. After the business filed a claim for this damage — however before the claim was settled — one more tempest went through the area and caused extra damage. Since the policy had a reinstatement clause that reset coverage after the principal claim was filed, the policyholder had the option to make a subsequent claim following this second, separate flood.
