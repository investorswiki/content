# Ask
The ask is the price the seller is (surprise) asking for their stock - - at what price the person in question needs to sell it. The bid is, you speculated accurately, the price a buyer bids for the stock, or how much the buyer will pay for it.

## Features
- An offer price is one more term for ask price.
- The difference between a bid price and ask price is called the spread.
- A bid price is dependably lower than the ask price.
- Various markets have different spread shows, which reflect transaction costs, the value of a single point, and [liquidity](/liquidity).
