# Specialist's Lien
## What is a specialist's lien?
A repairman's lien is a legal claim made against real estate by providers or contractors who have not been paid for the work they have performed or for materials they have been supplied. A repairman's lien can be recorded by contractors, subcontractors or providers, and it's substantial even on the off chance that the primary contractor has been paid in full.
## More profound definition
Albeit the laws with respect to specialist's liens change from one state to another, their principle continues as before. A specialist's lien permits a provider or contractor who has not been paid to place a lien against a property.
The initial step is to record the lien, and this must be trailed by court action to enforce the lien inside a recommended period of time. On the off chance that this isn't finished, the lien will lose its legitimacy. Rules about when and how a specialist's lien ought to be documented change starting with one jurisdiction then onto the next.
In the event that the homeowner doesn't sort out for the payment of the outstanding amount, the lien holder can force foreclosure and sale of the property. Likewise, a lien that hasn't been cleared will prevent the sale of the property as well as make it unthinkable for the homeowner to refinance the property.
While the specialist's lien safeguards subcontractors and providers who have not been paid, they bias a homeowner who has paid the primary contractor and who, thusly, has not paid providers.
Homeowners who can't get the primary contractor to pay up may well think of themselves as paying double and on the off chance that they don't, they could lose their homes. Homeowners can relieve against this risk by:
- Paying contractors with checks made to both contractor and subcontractor.
- Getting a lien waiver.
- Paying subcontractors straightforwardly.

## Specialist's lien model
Paul runs a rooftop repair business and is experiencing issues getting compensated for repairs to the top of the home having a place with a nearby businessman. In spite of the fact that Paul was subcontracted to accomplish the work by the primary contractor, he records a repairman's lien on the property, which prompts the property owner to pay the principal contractor who then, at that point, pays Paul. Whenever he is paid in full, Paul sets up for the lien to be taken out.
