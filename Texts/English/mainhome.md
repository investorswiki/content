# Primary Home
## What Is a Main Home?

Fundamental home is a term the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) uses to show the home a taxpayer has resided in more often than not during a given [taxation year](/taxyear) or the main home a taxpayer claims.

The classification of a taxpayer's principal home is important while considering gains coming about because of selling a primary home. Since the tax code perceives the significance of homeownership, it permits you to limit or partially bar capital gains when you sell your primary home.

## How a Main Home Works

[Capital gains](/capitalgain) on the sale of a primary home up to $250,000 for single filers, and $500,000 for married, joint filers, might be excluded from your income for tax purposes on the off chance that you finish the ownership and use assessments.

You **cannot** bar capital gains from the sale of your home if you:

- Acquired the property through a like-kind exchange (1031 exchange), during the past five years
- Are subject to expatriate tax

The Internal Revenue Code (IRC) is written to boost individuals to reside in one home, and the capital gains tax exclusion is a benefit given with the comprehension that taxpayers reserve a privilege to the [sweat equity](/sweatequity) they put into their primary residing space.

## Determining What Qualifies as a Main Home

In the event that you own or reside in more than one home, you must apply a realities and circumstances test to determine which property is your principal home.

### Time Spent in the Main Home

While the main factor is where you spend the most time, different factors are thought of, for example, what address is listed on your driver's license, elector registration, or other government records.

Time spent on vacation doesn't count as time residing in another home, even on the off chance that you leased your primary home to one more tenant while on vacation. The IRS likewise considers where you work, where you bank, where your family lives, and the location of any sporting clubs or strict organizations of which you are a member.

Assuming over the previous five years you have owned the home for over two years, and it was your fundamental home for beyond what two years, then you can take the capital gains exclusion.

### Home Is Where the Living Is

The capital gains tax exclusion can apply to a wide range of types of homes, including a single-family home, a [condominium](/condominium), a cooperative apartment, a mobile home, or a houseboat. Losses coming about because of the sale of your primary home can't be deducted.

Assuming you become genuinely or intellectually incapable to care for yourself, you just have to show that your house was your residence for a considerable length of time out of the 5 years leading up to the date of sale. "Likewise," as per the IRS, "any time you spent residing in a care facility, (for example, a nursing home) counts toward your residency requirement, inasmuch as the facility has a license from a state or other political entity to care for individuals with your condition."

The IRS likewise has a "think back" requirement that says on the off chance that you did **not** sell one more home during the 2-year period before the date of sale of your principal home (or on the other hand, assuming that you sold one more home during this period, yet didn't take an exclusion of the gain earned from it), you can take the exclusion of the gain from your fundamental home.

## Transfer of a Main Home

In the event that you transferred your home, or share of a jointly owned home, to a spouse or ex-spouse as part of a divorce settlement, any appreciation of the home since its purchase goes untaxed. The one exception to this rule is in the event that your spouse or ex-spouse is a nonresident alien. In this case, you likely will have a gain or loss from the transfer.
