# Manifestation Trigger
## What Is a Manifestation Trigger?

In the [insurance industry](/insurance), the term "manifestation trigger" alludes to the moment on schedule wherein the policyholder becomes aware of a justification for filing a [claim](/insurance_claim). For instance, in the case of home insurance, the manifestation trigger may be the point at which the policyholder discovers that their property was damaged.

Oftentimes, the manifestation trigger will be later than the date on which the event happened, since it can require investment for policyholders to discover the reason for the damage.

## How Manifestation Triggers Work

In spite of the fact that it might appear to be a simple concept, determining the specific date that a [covered event](/insurance-coverage) happened can be confounded. For instance, a homeowner could discover that their property has been infested with shape solely after returning home from a vacation. In that instance, the manifestation trigger would be the date when they discovered the form, even assuming the shape began accumulating numerous days or even weeks in advance.

These subtleties are important to insurance companies since they can determine whether they are responsible for covering the policyholder's claim. Depending on the idea of the policy, an insurer's responsibility probably won't have any significant bearing assuming the manifestation trigger happened after the finish of the coverage term. Then again, a policyholder who discovers such an event after their insurance has expired could possibly contend that the insurer is as yet responsible. In that instance, they would have to show that the problem really developed while they were as yet insured.

To assist with navigating these types of contentions, the insurance industry utilizes particular terms, for example, "manifestation trigger" to allude to a portion of the various types of dates and discoveries that could happen. A [exposure trigger](/exposure-trigger), for instance, is the date when a policyholder previously became presented to hurt, though a [injury-in-fact trigger](/injuryinfact-trigger) is the date on which the injury or illness became known. Continuous triggers, then again, are scopes of time that apply when the damages build up steadily.

This kind of language can turn out to be particularly muddled in circumstances where the policyholder changed policies several times during the significant time span. In those circumstances, it can turn out to be extremely challenging to definitively determine who is responsible for honoring the different claims.

## Certifiable Example of a Manifestation Trigger

To outline, consider the case of Don's Building Supply, a Texas [wholesaler](/wholesaling) of outside insulation and finish systems that were installed on different homes worked between late 1993 and late 1996. While the homes were being developed, Don's was insured by three back to back broad liability policies issued by OneBeacon. Somewhere in the range of 2003 and 2005, different homeowners documented suit against Don's, alleging the insulation was defective and had permitted dampness to leak inside the homes, resulting in decay and other damage.

The homeowners contended that the damage started to happen in six months to a year after installation, while the insurance policies were in effect. Be that as it may, the damage was hidden from view and became apparent solely after the policy period ended. Eventually, this discussion was just settled once it arrived at the Texas Supreme Court. The inquiry, as summarized by the Supreme Court, was whether "an insurer's duty to safeguard [is] triggered where damage is claimed to have happened during the policy period yet was inherently undiscoverable until after the policy period expired?"

Eventually, the Court replied "yes" to this inquiry, ruling that the key date that triggered coverage was the point at which the injury happened, not when the homeowner discovered it. The manifestation trigger, all in all, was found to be the definitive moment in this case.
