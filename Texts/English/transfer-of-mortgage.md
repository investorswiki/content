# Transfer of Mortgage
## What Is a Transfer of Mortgage?

Transfer of mortgage is a transaction where either the borrower or lender doles out an existing mortgage (a loan to purchase a property — typically a residential one — involving the property as collateral) from the current holder to someone else or entity. Homeowners who are unable to keep current on their mortgage payments might look for a transfer so they don't default and go into foreclosure.

## How a Transfer of Mortgage Works

A buyer might need to take on a more seasoned mortgage on the grounds that such a transfer could let them exploit previous [interest rates](/interestrate) that might have been lower than the current market rates. A transfer of the mortgage, whenever completed successfully without challenge or stipulations, wouldn't change the terms or length of the loan, passing on just the excess outstanding balance to be paid off. Through a transfer of the mortgage, a buyer could likewise abstain from paying closing

costs that are associated with buying a home with another mortgage.

Not all mortgages are eligible for transfer. Assuming it is, the mortgage is supposed to be "assumable." In order to transfer a mortgage, the mortgage lender should check that the person or entity that will expect the loan has adequate income and credit history to have the option to make payments as quickly as possibly.

On the off chance that a borrower isn't permitted to transfer a mortgage, due to the loan's underwriting, they might have to investigate different options to keep away from [foreclosure](/foreclosure). For instance, they could work with their lender to check whether it is feasible to add another borrower/proprietor to the mortgage, which would enable him/her to make payments toward the unpaid loan balance. Or on the other hand they could sell the home and have an expected buyer, partner, family member, or another entity consent to compensate for any shortfall between the home's sale price and the unpaid loan balance.

## Special Considerations for Transfer of Mortgage

Lenders who need to discourage a transfer of mortgage could remember a clause for the mortgage that requires the leftover balance of the loan to be due on the sale of the property. This [due on sale clause](/due_on_sale_clause) guarantees that when homeowners sell their houses, they can't transfer the mortgage to the buyer (which could play a key part in a homebuyer's making an offer, especially assuming the mortgage interest was lower than the current market rates). These clauses in effect require the seller to repay the full outstanding balance on the loan, maybe with the sale proceeds, and similarly force the buyer to take out another mortgage to make the purchase.

It is feasible to try not to set off such a "due on sale" clause by transferring the mortgage to an immediate family member, or to a spouse from whom one is legally isolated or separated. Further, the transfer might be a consequence of an inheritance following the death of the borrower, and the family member is moving into the home. In such an example, the lender probably won't have grounds to prevent the transfer of the mortgage. On the off chance that the property is transferred to a living trust and the borrower is the [trust's beneficiary](/beneficiary-of-trust), the mortgage can be transferred too, typically.
