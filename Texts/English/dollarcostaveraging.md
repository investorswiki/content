## What Is Dollar-Cost Averaging?
Dollar-cost averaging is an investment strategy that includes investing a specific amount of money in a specific asset at normal intervals over a timeframe — paying little mind to changes in that asset's price — to reduce the impact of price [volatility](/volatility) on the investor's average cost.
For example, rather than investing $1,000 in Tesla at one time, someone using dollar-cost averaging could invest $50 in Tesla simultaneously consistently for quite a long time. By deciding to invest small, equivalent amounts of the lump sum they've chosen to put into Tesla stock over the long run, this investor can shield their investment from short-term volatility in the price of Tesla stock.
## How Does Dollar-Cost Averaging Work as an Investment Strategy?
With dollar-cost averaging, a similar amount is spent at each interval no matter what a security's current price. This means that when a security's price is lower, more total shares are purchased, and when a security's price is higher, less total shares are purchased. This removes the mystery from periodic investing by ensuring that an investor buys a greater amount of something when it's cheap and less of it when it's costly.
## How Does Dollar-Cost Averaging Protect Against Volatility?
This strategy allows investors to limit the risk associated with a security's short-term volatility. By purchasing in a similar dollar amount consistently, investors can lower their opportunities to unintentionally "overpay" for an asset by putting their lump sum in everything simultaneously at an untimely moment.
Hence, dollar-cost averaging is a decent strategy for passive investors who have a smart thought of where they need their money allocated however don't be guaranteed to have the opportunity or resources to study the market continually and make trades on an incessant and deft basis. Likewise a decent strategy for investors know how to recognize value in businesses yet don't be guaranteed to accept the stock market is predictable in the short term.
## What Kinds of Investors Use Dollar-Cost Averaging?
A wide range of types of investors use dollar-cost averaging as a method for moderating the effects of volatility on their portfolios. That being said, the strategy is most likely best fit to long-term value investors and passive investors who like to limit risk while seeking moderate however generally predictable returns.
Most people who use employer-gave [401(k) accounts](/401kplan) to put something aside for retirement invest utilizing dollar-cost averaging without even knowing it. Whether you pick your own investments or select one of the default options offered by your employer, as long as a similar percentage of your paycheck is allocated to similar basket of securities each pay period, you are dollar-cost averaging basically by adding to your 401(k).
## Dollar-Cost Averaging versus Lump-Sum Investing (AKA Timing the Market or "Buying the Dip")
How could an investor decide to utilize dollar-cost averaging? Isn't it better to buy low and sell high? On the off chance that a [security](/security) became more expensive while an investor was utilizing dollar-cost averaging to purchase it, couldn't they get less cash-flow than if they had just invested their whole lump sum toward the beginning?
In theory, indeed, an investor could get more cash-flow by buying low and selling high than by buying an asset periodically as it gets more expensive. That being said, nobody can be aware without a doubt when a security will go up or down in price — particularly in the short term.
Then again, it is somewhat safe to assume that most large, sound, publically traded organizations' stock prices will go up, generally talking, in the long term (suppose 3+ years). That is the reason DCA is a decent strategy for additional passive investors interested in long-term capital gains.
Neither one of the strategies is innately better than the other, yet each is better fit to an alternate type of investor. Seasoned informal investors and other risk-accommodating, market-watching investors who buy and sell securities daily to exploit short-term price changes might well favor lump-sum investing regardless of the risks it conveys.
Risk-disinclined investors who plan to buy and hold for long-term returns, then again, can utilize dollar-cost averaging to limit the effects of short-term volatility on their portfolios while reliably investing in businesses that are probably going to perform above and beyond time. Maybe above all, they can do this without continually watching the market.
