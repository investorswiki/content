# Stop-Limit Order
## What Is a Stop-Limit Order?

A stop-limit order is a conditional trade throughout a set time period that consolidates the highlights of stop with those of a limit order and is utilized to relieve risk. It is connected with other order types, including limit orders (an order to one or the other buy or sell a predetermined number of shares at a given price or better) and stop-on-quote orders (an order to one or the other buy or sell a security after its price has outperformed a predefined point).

## How Stop-Limit Orders Work

A stop-limit order requires the setting of two price points:

1. Stop: The beginning of the predefined target price for the trade.
1. Limit: The outside of the price target for the trade.

A time period must likewise be set, during which the stop-limit order is viewed as executable.

The primary benefit of a stop-limit order is that the [trader](/trader) has exact control over when the order ought to be filled.

The [downside](/downside), similarly as with all limit orders, is that the trade isn't guaranteed to be executed if the stock/ware doesn't arrive at the stop price during the predefined time span.

The stop-limit order will be executed at a predetermined price, or better, after a given stop price has been reached. When the stop price is reached, the stop-limit order turns into a [limit order](/limitorder) to buy or sell at the limit price or better. This type of order is an accessible option with practically every online broker.

## Elements of Stop and Limit Orders

A [stop order](/stoporder) is an order that becomes executable once a set price has been reached and is then filled at the current market price. A traditional stop order will be filled completely, no matter what any changes in the current market price as the trades are completed.

A limit order is one that is set at a certain price. It is just executable on occasion when the trade can be performed at the limit price or at a price that is viewed as more good than the limit price. Assuming that trading activity makes the price become unfavorable in regards to the limit price, then, at that point, the activity connected with the order will be stopped.

By consolidating the two orders, the [investor](/investor) has a lot greater precision in executing the trade.

A stop order is filled [at the market](/atthemarket) price after the stop price has been hit, whether or not the price changes to an unfavorable position. This can lead to trades being completed at not exactly helpful prices should the market change rapidly. Joining the stop order with the elements of a limit order guarantees that the order won't get filled once the pricing becomes unfavorable, in light of the investor's limit. Hence, in a stop-limit order, after the stop price is set off, the limit order produces results to guarantee that the order isn't completed except if the price is at or better than the limit price that the investor has determined.

## Genuine Example of a Stop-Limit Order

For instance, expect that Apple Inc. (AAPL) is trading at $155 and that an investor needs to buy the stock once it starts to show some serious vertical momentum. The investor has put in a stop-limit order to buy with the stop price at $160 and the limit price at $165. On the off chance that the price of AAPL moves over the $160 stop price, the order is initiated and transforms into a limit order. However long the order can be filled under $165, which is the limit price, the trade will be filled. On the off chance that the stock gaps above $165, the order won't be filled.

Buy stop-limit orders are set over the market price at the hour of the order, while sell stop-limit orders are put below the market price.
