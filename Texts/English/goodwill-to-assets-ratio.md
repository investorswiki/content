# Goodwill to Assets Ratio
## What Is the Goodwill to Assets Ratio?

The goodwill to assets ratio measures the proportion of a company's [goodwill](/goodwill), which is a [intangible asset](/intangibleasset), to its total assets and is a factor in that company's [valuation](/business-valuation). Goodwill addresses the value of a company's brand name, strong customer base, great customer relations, great employee relations, and restrictive innovation, and so forth.

The average goodwill to assets ratio differs from one industry to another. It is best to compare goodwill to assets ratios inside industries to get an inclination for what is commonplace. Then, at that point, industry exceptions can be recognized.

## Figuring out the Goodwill to Assets Ratio

To get a handle on the significance of the goodwill to assets ratio, it is important to recall that goodwill is an immaterial asset which means that it can't be valued as effectively as one could a physical asset. Basically, the goodwill to assets ratio is a method for seeing which percentage of a company's total valuation is due to its reputation rather than its substantial assets.

Goodwill is much of the time created as the consequence of an acquisition. In the event that this ratio begins to increase quickly, it can show the company is on a buying binge. On the off chance that a company is expanding its total assets by getting different companies and goodwill is an inexorably large portion of the recently framed company's assets it might actually lead to future asset-level shakiness for the recently shaped company. Moreover, the amount of goodwill a company keeps up with can be changed rapidly in the event that the company chooses to [write down](/writedown) the amount of goodwill they have on the books.

## Deciphering the Goodwill to Assets Ratio

A small goodwill to assets ratio will demonstrate that a large portion of an association's total assets is contained substantial assets or material things the company can sell for monetary value. Immaterial assets are not handily isolated from the company or liquidated for monetary gain.

A company with a large starting goodwill to assets ratio might experience a critical swing in the value of their total assets — and overall company valuation — in the event that they record a large portion of their goodwill when their asset base was vigorously made out of goodwill, regardless.

## Goodwill to Assets Ratio Calculation and Example

The goodwill to assets ratio is calculated by partitioning goodwill, which is generally found in the no-current assets section of a company's [balance sheet](/balancesheet), by total assets.

>
> **Goodwill To Assets Ratio = Goodwill [Purchase price + (Liabilities - Assets)] \u00f7 Total Assets**
>

For instance, on the off chance that a company is sold for $5,000,000 and its total assets are $3,500,000 and liabilities are $750,000.

>
> **Goodwill To Assets Ratio = [$5,000,000 + ($750,000 - $3,500,000)] \u00f7 $3,500,000 = 64.3%**
