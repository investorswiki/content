Volume will in general draw in more volume. This is on the grounds that with more volume, [spreads](/spread) between the bid and ask price will generally narrow. The major pairs have loads of volume. They consequently will quite often have smaller spreads than [exotic pairs](/exotic_currency) and draw in the most traders to them, which keeps the volume high.

High volume likewise means that traders can enter and exit the market effortlessly, with large position sizes. In lower volume pairs it very well might be more hard to sell or buy a large position without making the price move fundamentally.

High volume means more individuals ready to buy or sell at a given time, too, bringing about a smaller chance of [slippage](/slippage), or smaller slippage when it happens. This shouldn't imply that large slippage can't occur in major pairs. It can, albeit substantially less so than in thinly traded exotic pairs.

## How Are Prices of the Major Pairs Determined?

Central banks might step in to control the price, however commonly just when it is important to keep the price from rising or falling such a lot of that it could truly hurt.

Supply and demand are impacted by economic or fundamental conditions in every country, [interest rates](/interestrate), future expectations for the country/currency, and current positions — positions that should be exited eventually.
