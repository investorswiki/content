# Percentage of Completion Method
## What Is the Percentage of Completion Method?

The percentage of completion method is a [accounting method](/accountingmethod) in which the revenues and expenses of long-term contracts are recognized as a percentage of the work completed during the period. This is rather than the [completed contract method](/completed-contract-method), which concedes the reporting of income and expenses until a project is completed.

## Understanding the Percentage of Completion Method

The [current income](/currentincome) and expenses are compared with the total estimated costs to determine the [tax liability](/taxliability) for the year. For instance, a project that is 20% complete in year one and 35% complete in year two would just have the incremental 15% of the revenue recognized in the subsequent year. The recognition of income and expenses on this work-in-progress basis applies to the income statement, however the balance sheet is taken care of the same way as the completed contract method.

There are two main conditions for the utilization of the percentage of completion method. To start with, collections by the company must be sensibly guaranteed; second, the company must have the option to estimate costs and the rate of project completion sensibly.
