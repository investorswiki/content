# Late Fee
## What Is a Late Fee?

The term late fee alludes to a charge consumers pay when they fail to make a payment on a debt, for example, a [loan](/loan) or a [credit card](/creditcard), or some other type of financial agreement, for example, an insurance or rental contract by the [due date](/paymentdate). At the point when a borrower misses a payment, the lender adds the late fee to the outstanding balance, which increases the next month.

Late fees urge consumers to pay on time and are illustrated in the contract or agreement. Borrowers must be advised about any changes to late fees in advance recorded as a hard copy by the lender.

## How Late Fees Work

[Lenders](/lender) and different creditors bring in money in various ways including by charging borrowers and [debtors](/debtor) fees. Late fees are one of those tolls. Late fees are forced on individuals who don't satisfy their financial obligations by a certain date. For example, a credit card borrower who fails to make their payment — basically the base — by the due date causes a late fee that appears on their next statement. Or on the other hand a [landlord](/landlord) may charge their tenant a late fee for not paying their rent on time.

All late fees must be expressly framed to borrowers, whether or not they're credit card agreements, leases, or some other type of contract. [Creditors](/creditor) legally can't charge extreme late fees, and that means they must be reasonable. By and large, late fees commonly range anyplace somewhere in the range of $25 and $50.

A few creditors might give a [grace period](/grace_period) before the late fee is charged. For example, rent might be due for a condo on the first of each and every month. Be that as it may, the landlord might permit the tenant to pay the rent by the tenth of the month without causing a late fee. Assuming that rent is paid on the 11th or any day from that point forward, the landlord might charge the tenant a late fee notwithstanding the outstanding rent. As noticed, this must be plainly stated in the lease agreement.

A few creditors might defer the late fee whenever a consumer first misses the payment cutoff time while others charge no late fees by any means. In any case, different lenders offer no mercy and charge a late fee even assuming a borrower barely misses the payment cutoff time. Whenever charged, these fees can increase the outstanding [account balance](/accountbalance). For instance, the late fee is added to the next month's credit card statement. Not in the least does this increase the balance by the amount of the late fee, however the borrower is likewise responsible for any extra [interest](/interest) because of that fee, further compounding the amount a borrower owes.

Late fees can impact a person's [credit score](/credit_score) and overall [credit history](/credit-history). That is on the grounds that payment history assumes a big part in credit reports, making up around 35% of a person's [FICO score](/ficoscore). So the more payments a person misses, the more they should pay in late fees and they can likewise hope to see a big hit on their credit report.

## Special Considerations

Late fees are just one of several fees companies charge consumers to bring in money. For example, credit card consumers are additionally subject to annual fees, [balance transfer fees](/balance-transfer-fee), [foreign transaction fees](/foreign-transaction-fee), and [returned payment fees](/returned-payment-fee). These fees are avoidable assuming the cardholder carefully chooses the credit card, follows the terms, and maintains a strategic distance from ways of behaving that trigger such fees.

It's consistently smart to pay a credit card on time and in full every month. Yet, in the event that a borrower can't pay off the full balance, making basically the [minimum regularly scheduled payment](/least regularly scheduled payment) on time means they can try not to be charged a late fee and different charges. Now and again, late fees likewise accompany different charges. For instance, in the event that a borrower's checking account needs more money to cover a credit card payment, not exclusively will the payment actually be viewed as late, the cardholder will likewise cause a returned payment fee from the credit card issuer as well as a [non-adequate funds](/nsf) (NSF) fee from the bank.

Lenders may likewise audit and modify interest rates in light of payment history. This is alluded to as [penalty repricing](/penalty-repricing), and that means the interest rate will increase to the penalty [annual percentage rate](/apr) (APR) on the grounds that the lender believes the borrower to be a high [credit risk](/creditrisk). Making a late payment might be a simple oversight, or it very well may be an indication of financial difficulty.
