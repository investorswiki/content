## Remarkable Accomplishments

Champ of the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economics, Dr. Lucas is generally notable for his contributions to macroeconomics including the development of the New Classical school of macroeconomics and the Lucas Critique.

Lucas has spent quite a bit of his scholastic career exploring the ramifications of the rational expectations theory in macroeconomics. He likewise made important contributions to speculations of [economic growth](/economicgrowth).

### Awards and Honors

In 1995, Lucas was granted the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economics for fostering the theory of rational expectations.

### Theory of Rational Expectations

Lucas assembled his career applying the possibility that individuals in the economy form rational expectations about future occasions and the impact of macroeconomic policies. In a paper in 1972, he incorporated the possibility of rational expectations to broaden the [Friedman](/milton-friedman)- [Phelps](/edmund-s-phelps) theory of long-term vertical [Phillips Curve](/phillipscurve). A vertical Phillips Curve suggests that [expansionary monetary policy](/expansionary_policy) will increase [inflation](/inflation), without helping the economy.

That's what lucas contended on the off chance that (as is assumed in microeconomics) individuals in the economy are rational, just unexpected changes to the money supply will affect output and work; if not individuals will just rationally set their wage and price requests as per their expectations of future inflation when a monetary policy is announced and the policy will just affect prices and inflation rates.

Consequently not just (per Friedman and Phelps) is the Phillips Curve vertical over the long haul, it is additionally vertical in the short run with the exception of when monetary policymakers can make unannounced, eccentric, or really astonishing moves that market participants can't expect.

### The Lucas Critique

Dr. Lucas additionally developed the Lucas Critique of economic policymaking, which holds that relationships between economic factors saw in past data or estimated by large scale econometric models are not dependable for economic policymaking on the grounds that individuals rationally adjust their expectations and behavior in view of how they might interpret the impact of economic policy.

The expectations about economic conditions and policy that formed consumer, business, and investor behavior during the periods from which past data are drawn frequently won't hold once conditions and policies change.

This means that economic policymakers couldn't realistically expect to deal with the economy by fiddling with key factors, for example, money supply or interest rates, in light of the fact that the act of doing so likewise changes the relationship between these factors and the factors that address the targeted results, for example, GDP or unemployment rates. In this manner the Lucas Critique contends against an activist macroeconomic policy pointed toward dealing with the economy.

### Different Contributions

Lucas likewise made contributions to [endogenous growth theory](/endogenousgrowththeory) and to bringing together growth theory (which applied generally to growth in developed economies) with [development economics](/development-economics) (applied to less developed economies).

His contributions incorporate the Lucas-Uzawa model, which makes sense of long-run economic growth as dependent on human capital accumulation, and the Lucas Paradox, which inquires as to why capital doesn't seem to flow to locales of the globe where capital is moderately scant (and subsequently gets a higher rate of return) as neoclassical growth theory would foresee.
