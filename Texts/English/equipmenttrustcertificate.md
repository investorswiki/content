# Equipment Trust Certificate (ETC)
## What Is an Equipment Trust Certificate?

An equipment trust certificate (ETC) alludes to a [debt instrument](/debtinstrument) that permits a company to claim and partake in the utilization of an asset while paying for it after some time. The [debt issue](/debt-issue) is secured by the equipment or [physical asset](/physicalasset). During this time, the title for the equipment is held in trust for the holders of the issue.

ETCs were initially put in place to finance the purchase of railroad cars, yet are currently utilized in the sale and purchase of aircraft and steel trailers.

## Understanding Equipment Trust Certificates

Equipment trust certificates are medium-to long-term debt instruments that permit a company to utilize an asset while they pay for it over the long run. A [trust](/trust) is set up which makes the certificate. Investors can then purchase and hold these certificates. The [capital](/capital) raised from investors permits the trust to purchase the asset, which is then leased to a company. The trust gets payments from the lessee and disperses them among investors or certificate holders. The terms of the agreement are set out toward the beginning of the lease relationship including payment dates, interest payments, and so forth, until such time that the debt is paid off. As such, an equipment trust certificate is a ton like a mortgage or vehicle loan in that it is a debt vehicle secured by an asset.

There are two potential results that might emerge from an ETC, the two of which rely upon the borrower's ability to pay. Assuming the borrower keeps up with payments and pays off the debt, the asset's [title](/title) is moved from the holder to the borrower. In any case, then again, assuming that the borrower defaults, the lender or seller has the privilege to repossess or dispossess the asset.

These certificates were initially used to finance rail line train units and rolling stock, with the cars utilized as collateral. These days, equipment [trust certificates](/trust-certificate) are utilized to finance aircraft purchases and holders utilized for delivery and [offshore](/offshore) organizations.

ETCs are a well known approach to financing equipment due to the tax benefits associated with them. Since the borrower doesn't hold title to the asset during the financing period, it isn't viewed as the owner. This means it will not need to pay taxes on it, essentially until the debt is paid off in full.

## Enhanced Equipment Trust Certificates

An enhanced equipment trust certificate (EETC) is one form of ETC that is issued and managed through [special purpose vehicles](/spv) known as pass-through trusts. These special purpose vehicles (SPEs) permit borrowers to aggregate different equipment purchases into one debt security. While the borrower leases the assets from the trust, the trust issues the debt, acts as a vault for it, while dealing with debt service and payments to investors who hold the certificate.

Airlines ordinarily use EETCs all the time, bringing billions up in financing for their aircraft purchases in view of their high capital spending requirements. As a matter of fact, Northwest Airlines spearheaded the utilization of EETCs for aircraft finance in 1994. In return for greater [liquidity](/liquidity) and a more extensive investor base for these financial instruments, airlines appreciate cost savings and greater flexibility by keeping away from the need to structure different ETCs for individual aircraft purchases. EETCs were additionally enhanced when tranches — or various cuts of debt with various levels of position, security, risks, coupons, and credit appraisals — were presented.

EETCS have gone under examination from the [Securities and Exchange Commission](/sec) (SEC) and [Financial Accounting Standard Board](/fasb) (FASB), which questioned their treatment as separate economic elements for accounting. By utilizing SPEs, borrowers are able to keep their debt obligations as things off their balance sheets, with the outcome that their financial statements frequently don't present a complete image of their borrowings. FASB issued Financial Interpretation Notice (FIN) 46 to frame when companies ought to consolidate or flaunt balance sheet assets and liabilities on their financial statements for these vehicles.

## Benefits of ETCs

As referenced above, there are tax benefits for lessees that utilization ETCs as a method for achieving the assets they need to run their operations. Since they don't possess the asset, lessees aren't required to pay any [property taxes](/propertytax). That might change, however, when the title is moved from the trust to the lessee.

ETCs likewise give a form of protection to the trust and investors. In the event that a company fails or wiped out, it might default on its financial obligation. However, on account of an ETC, the trust has the option to recover the asset. As such, on the off chance that an airline company kicks the bucket yet has payments to make, the trust can reclaim the planes it leased to the company.
