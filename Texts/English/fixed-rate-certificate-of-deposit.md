## What Is a Fixed-Rate Certificate of Deposit (CD)?

A fixed-rate [certificate of deposit (CD)](/certificateofdeposit) is an investment instrument that has a set interest rate over its whole term. CDs generally offer terms in additions of 90 days as long as one year and afterward switch to two-, three-, and five-year terms. The longer the term of the fixed-rate CD, the higher the [fixed interest rate](/fixedinterestrate). Large and small retail banks the same offer fixed-rate CDs.

(FDIC)](/fdic) up to $250,000 (per account holder, per issuer), investors who place their money in these instruments have an agreeable outlook on the safety of the asset value. Fixed-rate CDs may not pay as much interest as other fixed income securities, yet conservative savers acknowledge the tradeoff of lower [interest](/interest) for lower [capital risk](/capitalrisk).

There is commonly a penalty for [early withdrawal](/earlywithdrawal) of funds from a CD, so a CD holder quite often leaves the money in the instrument until it develops. Upon maturity, contingent upon the individual's financial requirements, they might roll over the matured CD into another. The new fixed rate, notwithstanding, is probably going to be not the same as the one that just matured. The general [interest rate](/interestrate) environment in the economy determines how fixed-rate CDs are set by giving banks.

The amount paid out depends on a percentage difference between the beginning index value and the last index value. An investor in a variable-rate CD is less risk-loath than a fixed-rate CD buyer, and the individual, by putting money into a variable-rate CD, may express their conviction that interest rates in the economy will rise over the term of the CD. In the event that that demonstrates right, the CD will have generated more interest than a fixed-rate CD.
