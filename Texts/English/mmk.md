# Myanmar Kyat (MMK)
## What Is the Myanmar Kyat (MMK)?

The Myanmar Kyat (MMK) is the national currency of the Republic of the Union of Myanmar, the country formerly known as Burma. One kyat partitions into 100 pyas. In any case, a pya addresses such a small amount of money that it is rarely utilized. Recorded as a hard copy, the symbol "K" addresses the currency.

The currency floats against the [U.S. dollar (USD)](/usd). As of Dec. 5, 2021, one USD was equivalent to 1,776.500 MMK.

## History of the MMK

Today, the circulation and issuance of kyat are managed exclusively by the Central Bank of Myanmar, the country's official [central bank](/centralbank). At the point when it was first presented in 1852, the kyat comprised of gold and silver coins. Since the British were in control of the country somewhere in the range of 1824 and 1948, silver coins during that period were viewed as equivalent to the [Indian rupee (INR)](/inr), given that India around then was additionally part of the British Empire. In 1942, the Japanese occupied the country and presented their own currency, albeit this currency was immediately abandoned following the departure of Japanese powers in 1945.

In 1948, the Union Bank of Burma went about as the central bank. The Union Bank framed when it assumed the Yangon parts of the [Reserve Bank of India (RBI)](/rbi). Be that as it may, the bank didn't assume on the liability of giving currency until 1952. The Myanmar kyat has dominations of 5, 10, 20, 50, 100, 200, 500, 1000, 5000, and 10,000 kyats. Coins are issued in denominations of 5, 10, 50, and 100 kyats.

The variant of the kyat that keeps on being involved today started circulation in 1952. Initially, it was valued at part with the rupee, in spite of the fact that its value has since declined substantially. In 1962, the government nationalized and merged the country's all's banks into one entity, as it progressed the country into a [socialist](/communism) monetary system. By 1988, the country's economic system progressed once more into a market-based system, and the name of the central bank changed to the Central Bank of Myanmar.

## Insecurity of the MMK

The central bank has gone to lengths to reduce the black market exchange of kyats. Initially, they required sightseers to purchase something like $200 worth of kyats with any exchange. That policy ended in 2003. Official exchange rates for the kyat have now and again fluctuated enormously from the currency's exchange rate on the black market. Between March 2013 and February 2021, the value of the kyat has gone between generally $850 kyat and $1,408 kyat for each 1 USD.

The poor purchasing power of the kyat mirrors the way that Myanmar is perhaps of the poorest country in Southeast Asia. The country's economy relies upon commodity [exports](/trade), with petroleum and opium being among its biggest exports.

The United Nations Conference on Trade and Development named the country among the least developed in the world in its 2020 Handbook of Statistics. This assignment accompanies [tariff](/tariff) reduction and access to the markets of developed countries. Nations might graduate from this rundown by meeting specific requirements, including making higher standards of living for its residents.
