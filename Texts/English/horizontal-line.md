# Horizontal Line
## What Is a Horizontal Line?

In [technical analysis](/technicalanalysis), a horizontal line is many times drawn on a price chart to highlight areas of support or resistance.

In geometric analysis, a horizontal line proceeds parallel to the x-pivot. Put another way, on a perfectly horizontal line, all values on the line will have a similar y-value.

## Figuring out a Horizontal Line

Horizontal lines are normally utilized in technical analysis to highlight areas of support, where the price stopped falling and afterward bounced on prior events, or resistance, which is where the price stopped rising and afterward continued to fall on prior events.

The horizontal line is drawn by interfacing comparative swing lows in price to make a horizontal support line. For a horizontal resistance line, comparable [swing highs](/swinghigh) are associated.

The horizontal line is then utilized for logical or trading purposes. For instance, on the off chance that the price of an asset is moving among support and resistance horizontal lines then the price is viewed as [range-bound](/rangeboundtrading).

A move below the support horizontal line could demonstrate a further price decline, however in the event that support holds and the price bobs higher, prices could be impending. Similar concepts apply to a resistance horizontal line. Assuming that the price moves above resistance, higher prices could be approaching. On the off chance that the price arrives at resistance and, begins to decline, the horizontal line has held and traders will look at lower costs.

In additional simple terms, a horizontal line on any chart is where the y-hub values are equivalent. On the off chance that it has been drawn to show a series of highs in the data, a data point moving over the horizontal line would demonstrate a rise in the y-hub value over recent values in the data sample.

## Fundamental Horizontal Analysis

[Horizontal analysis](/horizontalanalysis) is utilized to compare values or prices after some time. This is a part of [fundamental analysis](/fundamentalanalysis) in which an analyst will compare different earnings reports and statements over the long haul. In this sort of analysis, time capabilities as the horizontal x-pivot and permits analysts to compute percentage changes over the long run, a helpful device for addressing the degree of change.

Horizontal analysis takes a gander at the trend of financial statements over various periods, utilizing a predetermined base period, and commonly shows the changes from the base period in dollars and percentages.

The percentage change is calculated by first partitioning the dollar change between the comparison year and the base year by the thing value in the base year, then, at that point, duplicating the quotient by 100. For instance, when you hear somebody saying that incomes increased by 10% this past quarter, that person is utilizing horizontal analysis.

Horizontal analysis can be involved on any thing in an organization's financials, from incomes to [earnings per share](/eps) (EPS), and is valuable while contrasting the performance of different companies.

## A Horizontal Line as it Relates to Supply and Demand Curves

[Supply and demand curves](/law-of-supply-demand) are drawn with price on the vertical pivot of the graph and quantity demanded on the horizontal hub. While taking a gander at supply and demand bends, a perfectly horizontal line shows that a thing has perfect [elasticity](/priceelasticity), or that its demand is promptly receptive to changes in price. At the point when the price of a perfectly flexible great or service increments over the market price, the [quantity demanded](/quantitydemanded) falls to zero. With perfect elasticity, consumers just are not ready to spend in excess of a specific price for a decent or service.

## Illustration of How to Use the Horizontal Line in Technical Analysis

Defining a horizontal boundary is one of the simplest forms of technical analysis, yet it likewise gives important data. On the chart below, a horizontal line is drawn on the SPDR S&P 500 (SPY) [exchange traded fund](/etf) (ETF).
<!--998D915212ECB92C0319F6024F5CF1B8-->
A [uptrend](/uptrend) is the point at which a price makes higher swing highs and higher swing lows. Consequently, a horizontal line can highlight when price is making another high, in this case, subsequently giving indications of an uptrend. On the SPY chart over, the price is moving over the horizontal line demonstrating an uptrend. Assuming the price falls back below the horizontal line, it could caution that uptrend has failed and lower prices might be impending.

In this sense, the horizontal line acts like a boundary, where moving over the line is [bullish](/bull).

## The Difference Between a Horizontal Line and a Trendline

Both these terms could allude to exactly the same thing: drawn lines on a chart. While a horizontal line is specifically horizontal, a [trendline](/trendline) is commonly calculated and drawn along rising swing lows during a price uptrend or drawn along dropping swing highs during a downtrend.

## Limitations of Using a Horizontal Line in Technical Analysis

A horizontal line is certainly not a genuine barrier for price. It is a technical device which might assist traders with deciding if they ought to be more [bearish](/bear) or bullish.

Where a horizontal line is drawn is subjective. Not all traders might place the horizontal line at a similar price.

At highly important prices, where a horizontal line might be drawn, it is conceivable the price will whipsaw around it. This could create turmoil or some potential losing trades until the price takes a more unequivocal action above or below the line.

## Highlights
- A horizontal line is generally utilized in technical analysis to mark areas of support or resistance.
- In technical analysis, the horizontal line is commonly drawn along a swing high, or a series of them, where every high in the series stopped at a comparative level. A similar concept applies to swing lows.
- A horizontal line runs parallel to the x-pivot.
