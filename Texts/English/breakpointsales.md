# Breakpoint Sale
## What Is a Breakpoint Sale?

A breakpoint sale is the sale of a [mutual fund](/mutualfund) at a set dollar amount that permits the fundholder to move into a lower sales charge bracket. On the off chance that an investor can't give the funds expected to fit the bill for the lower fee at the hour of investment, they can sign a [letter of intent](/letterofintent) promising to arrive at the total amount, or breakpoint, in a set time span.

## How a Breakpoint Sale Works

Breakpoint sales give fee discounts to investors in view of investment [breakpoint]) not entirely set in stone by the fund company. Fund companies are responsible for organizing sales loads and breakpoint schedules. These fees and breakpoints are point by point in a fund's [prospectus](/prospectus) and agreed upon by go-betweens.

## Special Considerations
### Accumulation Privileges

Most mutual funds will incorporate [accumulation privileges](/roa) in their sales load and breakpoint schedules. Accumulation privileges permit an investor's sales charge from a breakpoint schedule to be founded on their total investment in the fund. For instance, assuming the investor from above invests another $15,000 six months after the fact, she would fit the bill for similar sales charge of 3.75% on the $15,000 transaction.

### Letters of Intent

Mutual fund companies with sales loads and breakpoint schedules ordinarily likewise incorporate provisions for a letter of intent. This documentation permits the investor to pledge a predefined investment in the fund and receive the sales load fee for their complete investment.

## Breakpoint Sale versus Breakpoint Schedule

Open-end mutual funds executed through a full-service broker are required to pay [sales loads](/load) to middle people for the service of recognizing, recommending, and executing the fund. Sales loads on mutual funds can be front-end, back-end, or level.

Breakpoint schedules are levels set by the mutual fund that permits an investor to receive a sales load discount. Discounts from breakpoints are regularly applied to funds with a [front-end sales load](/front-endload), yet they could be applicable to all shares of a fund.

Breakpoint discounts frequently start at $25,000, with discounts expanding steadily to a maximum level. Past the mutual fund's maximum breakpoint level, investors will never again cause sales load charges. Financial advisors are required to give full disclosure of breakpoint schedules and guarantee that investors are aware when a negligible extra investment could qualify them for a higher discount.

Below is a sample breakpoint schedule given by the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA):

Investment and Sales Charge

Under $25,000: 5.00%

Something like $25,000, however under $50,000: 4.25%

Something like $50,000, yet under $100,000: 3.75%

Somewhere around $100,000, however under $250,000: 3.25%

Somewhere around $250,000, however under $500,000: 2.75%

No less than $500,000, yet under $1 million: 2.00%

$1 million or more: No sales charge

Following the above breakpoint schedule, an investor planning to invest an initial $40,000 in a front-end load fund would receive a discount and face a charge of 4.25%, or $1,700. In the event that the investor is appropriately prompted she will be informed that adding $10,000 for a total investment of $50,000 would qualify the sale for a lower sales charge of 3.75%.
