# Exchange Traded Product (ETP)
## What Is an Exchange Traded Product (ETP)?

Exchange traded products (ETPs) are types of securities that track [underlying securities](/underlying-security), an index, or other [financial instruments](/financialinstrument). ETPs trade on exchanges like stocks meaning their prices can vacillate from everyday and intraday. Notwithstanding, the prices of ETPs are derived from the underlying investments that they track.

## Types of Exchange Traded Products

Exchange traded products can be benchmarked to heap investments, including commodities, currencies, stocks, and [bonds](/bond). Since prices of ETPs can vacillate, investors can possibly earn gains yet additionally have the risk of market losses. ETPs can contain a couple or many underlying investments.

### Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs)

Like a [mutual fund](/mutualfund), a [exchange traded fund](/etf) contains a basket of investments that can incorporate stocks and bonds. An ETF generally tracks an underlying index like the S&P 500 yet can follow an industry, sector, commodities, or even currency. An exchange-traded fund's price can rise and fall just like different investments. These products trade over the course of the day just as a stock would trade.

The prevalence encompassing ETFs comes from their low fees since they are passively managed. For instance, a passively-managed ETF could follow the [S&P 500 index](/sp500). Here, the ETF possesses each of the 500 stocks contained in the index. Conversely, an actively-managed fund includes an investment manager buying and selling securities, which can lead to higher fees. A few ETFs share a combination of both passive and active credits.

### Exchange Traded Notes (ETNs)

[Exchange traded notes](/etn) (ETNs), like ETFs, additionally track an underlying index of securities and trade on major exchanges. In any case, ETNs are baskets of unsecured debt securities. The ETN pays investors the return received from the index they track at the maturity date, less any fees or commissions.

ETNs are like bonds in that investors receive the return of their original invested sum — the principal — at maturity. In any case, the ETN doesn't pay periodic interest payments. Additionally, investors who buy ETNs don't claim any of the securities in the index they track. Accordingly, the probability that investors will be paid back the principal and the returns from the underlying index is dependent on the creditworthiness of the issuer.

ETPs trade like stocks and can be bought and sold over the course of the day and have prices that move over the course of the day. For instance, an investor can place an order with ETFs to buy or sell at a specific price with a broker. Investors can buy the ETF in the morning and sell it before the day's over, though mutual funds don't have that flexibility. ETPs frequently carry lower expense ratios than their mutual fund counterparts.

ETPs likewise require a brokerage account to trade, so buying and selling ETP shares could bring about a brokerage commission in the event that it isn't one of the ETFs that the brokerage allows to be traded uninhibitedly. Most exceptionally liquid ETPs can be traded without a commission charge in all the major discount brokers. Furthermore, differences in the bid and ask — buy and sell — price could add to the cost of trading ETPs. Some no-load or no-fee mutual funds, then again, can be bought and sold with next to no trading commission, and they don't need a brokerage account.
