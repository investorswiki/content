# Wei
Wei alludes to the smallest denomination of ether (ETH), the currency utilized on the Ethereum network. For example, 1 ether (ETH) is equivalent to 1x10^18^ wei (which may likewise be addressed in exponential documentation: 1e18 wei).
As the price of Ether and other [cryptocurrencies](/cryptocurrency) rises, the size of each [blockchain](/blockchain) transaction will in general decrease. For instance, in the event that ETH is priced at $10, one would require 10 ETH to make a $100 transfer. Be that as it may, assuming that ETH is priced at $150, just 0.67 ETH would be adequate to transfer a similar value in USD. Utilizing ether denomination might be irksome as the transaction size decreases.
In this unique circumstance, wei and different denominations of ether might be helpful for portraying small value transactions, particularly with respect to tiny measures of ETH that are normally utilized for transaction fees or while setting the gas limit of a transaction.
As introduced on the Ethereum technical reports, there are several different denominations of ether, each addressing a various of wei. [Gwei](/gwei-ethereum) and ether are among the most utilized denominations.
