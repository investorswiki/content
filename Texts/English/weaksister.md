# Weak Sister
## What Is a Weak Sister?

"Weak sister" is a shoptalk term for an element that subverts a whole system. The term can either allude to a single individual or a specialized group that is viewed as the weak and unreliable connection in an integrated cycle.

## Grasping Weak Sisters

Hold a person or thing back weak sisters. It very well may be a breaking down part of a team-situated task, for example, the slowest member of an assembly line or a sluggish [marketing](/marketing) team. Then again, it might portray a security, economy, or business unit that performs more regrettable than others.

Weak sister is like the term the "weakest connection in the chain." Both allude to a person or thing that risks single-handedly achieving the disappointment of the system or the group it has a place with. "Weakest connection" came from the saying "a chain is just pretty much as strong as its weakest connection." all in all, one substandard connection might make a chain break, even however the other, stronger connections might hold when put under tension.

This colloquialism can be followed to crafted by Thomas Reid. In **Essays on the Intellectual Powers of Man**, distributed during the 1780s, Reid Wrote: "In each chain of thinking, the evidence of the last end can be no greater than that of the weakest connection of the chain, anything that might be the strength of the rest."

## Illustration of a Weak Sister

Weak sisters can show up in each industry. For example, in a [investment](/investment) [portfolio](/portfolio), there is ordinarily no less than one [laggard](/laggard) that burdens total returns.

For instance, assume there is an investor, Mark, who has invested in five different [stocks](/stock): Company A, Company B, Company C, Company D, and Company E. Throughout recent years, four of the five stocks have done commendably, serenely beating the remainder of the [stock market](/stockmarket) with returns somewhere in the range of 17% and 40%.

Tragically, that amazing performance has been subverted to some degree by the weak sister. Company C returned just 2% in light of the fact that a large piece of the business (its [energy](/energy_sector) arm) experienced lukewarm [demand](/demand) for its products and services because of a fall in the price of oil. Precarious trading conditions in that division ended up burdening the average return of the whole portfolio, aligning it with the market average (or below assuming you factor in fees).

Weak sisters can likewise allude to whole countries. Following the [great recession](/great-recession), Europe battled to pay off all the [debts](/debt) it had accumulated, in what became known as the Eurozone debt crisis.

Five of the locale's countries — Greece, Ireland, Italy, Portugal, and Spain — took the majority of the fault. These nations were blamed for lacking fiscal reasonability, not generating enough [economic growth](/economicgrowth), and being at risk of defaulting on their bonds.

## Special Considerations

Just in light of the fact that a person or thing is alluded to as a weak sister doesn't mean it is past saving. Weak sisters could not be unreliable 100% of the time. By and large, what battled and held all that back one year could bounce back in the next one.

For example, when the oil price bounce back, Company C could probably go from the weak sister to the greatest [outperformer](/beat) in Mark's portfolio. Jumpy [investors](/investor) pushed the valuation down to mirror the difficulties facing the sector. That means the stock will look unbelievably cheap assuming sentiment improves and trading picks up once more.

[Market cycles](/market_cycles) and business trading conditions shift over the long haul, leading different [asset classes](/assetclasses) to fall all through favor. For some investors, there's bunches of money to be produced using distinguishing weak sisters and determining, before the remainder of the market, when they have reached as far down as possible.

Weak sisters can likewise become stronger with a couple of important tweaks produced using the inside. Certain [capital expenditure](/capitalexpenditure) (CAPEX) or [cost-cutting](/cost-cutting) strategies can transform a swelled, fizzling laggard into a much more ready to rock and roll proposition.
