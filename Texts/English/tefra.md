## What Is the Tax Equity and Fiscal Responsibility Act of 1982 (TEFRA)?

The Tax Equity and Fiscal Responsibility Act of 1982 (TEFRA) is a law passed in 1982 that was intended to reduce the federal budget deficit through a combination of tax increases, spending cuts, and tax reform measures.

The legislation switched a few components of the Economic Recovery Tax Act of 1981 (ERTA), otherwise called the Kemp-Roth Act.

The two bits of legislation were passed from the get-go in the administration of Ronald Reagan.

## Understanding the Tax Equity and Fiscal Responsibility Act of 1982 (TEFRA)

Formed by Republican Senator Robert Dole, then chair of the Senate Finance Committee, TEFRA was intended to raise more revenue by closing [loopholes](/escape clause) in the tax system, introducing stricter compliance and tax-assortment measures, expanding [excise taxes](/excisetax) on cigarettes and telephone services, and expanding corporate taxes.

Adjusted for inflation, TEFRA stays the greatest tax increase in U.S. history. It was generally a repudiation of the ERTA, which had spent a year sooner and stays the biggest tax cut in U.S. history.

At the time TEFRA was being bantered in Congress, the U.S. economy was in a recession. Some called it a "two-fer" recession in light of the fact that the economy tumbled to recessionary levels, recuperated, and afterward fell again into recession, all in the single year period between the late spring of 1981 and the late spring of 1982. Government revenues fell by around 6% due to a combination of ERTA tax cuts and normal recessionary effects.

The outcome was a budget deficit that developed to a then-record $110.7 billion of every 1982. (In 2021, the federal budget deficit was $2.8 trillion.)

TEFRA likewise repealed some ERTA reductions in personal income-tax rates that had not yet come full circle.

## Different Elements of TEFRA

TEFRA eventually contacted a huge number of Americans in its efforts to reduce federal spending and increase government revenues.

For instance, a large number of the reimbursement rules for the Medicare and Medicaid programs were updated to get control over their costs. Procedures for payments of Social Security, and Unemployment Compensation were altered.

The bill briefly multiplied the federal cigarette tax and significantly increased the telephone service tax.

It likewise affected businesses and investors. TEFRA annulled a portion of the [tax breaks](/tax-break) businesses received under ERTA, for example, [accelerated depreciation](/accelerateddepreciation). It likewise organized a 10% withholding tax on dividends and interest paid to people who didn't have certified [tax identification numbers](/tax-indentification-number-tin).

## Historic Tax Increase Under TEFRA

President Ronald Reagan had crusaded on tax cuts and limited government. Right off the bat in his initial term, he had won a then-significant $28.3 billion in tax cuts for business through the entry of ERTA.

Many were confused that he would consent to fix a portion of the tax breaks made in ERTA, which had been a huge legislative accomplishment. However, he was unable to disregard the developing deficit.

In fact, Reagan opposed any tax increases for a period however eventually yielded in exchange for a pledge for even greater spending cuts as part of the deal.

At the point when he at long last marked the bill into law on Sept. 3, 1982, Reagan focused on that the measure increased taxes to a great extent by closing escape clauses and that it would raise more than $98 billion north of three years while cutting spending by $280 billion during a similar period.

That figure was questioned. The Heritage Foundation claimed at the time that the bill would actually increase spending by 21 pennies for each dollar brought in through tax increases.
