With a goal of impeding the double-dealing of the American financial system by parties associated with terrorism, psychological militant financing, and money laundering, Title III refers to International Monetary Fund data assessing that laundered money from drug dealing and other pirating activities accounts for 2% to 5% of U.S. [gross domestic product](/gross domestic product).
