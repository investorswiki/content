## Types of Underwriting Agreements

There are several various types of underwriting agreements: the firm commitment agreement, the best efforts agreement, the little maxi agreement, the all or none agreement, and the standby agreement.

- **Firm Commitment**: In a [firm commitment underwriting](/firmcommitment), the underwriter guarantees to purchase every one of the securities offered available to be purchased by the issuer whether or not they can sell them to investors. It is the best agreement since it guarantees the issuer's all's money right away. The more in demand the offering is, the more probable it will be finished on a firm commitment basis. In a firm commitment, the underwriter puts its own money at risk on the off chance that it can't sell the securities to investors. Underwriting a securities offering on a firm commitment basis opens the underwriter to significant risk. Thusly, underwriters frequently demand including a [market out clause](/marketoutclause) in the underwriting agreement. This clause liberates the underwriter from its obligation to purchase the securities in case there is all a development that hinders the quality of the securities. Poor market conditions, however, are not a qualifying condition.

- **Best Efforts**: In a [best-efforts underwriting](/bestefforts) agreement, underwriters put forth a valiant effort to sell every one of the securities offered by the issuer, yet the underwriter isn't committed to purchase the securities for its own account. The lower the demand for an issue, the greater the probability it will be finished on a best efforts basis. Any shares or bonds in a best efforts underwriting that poor person been sold will be returned to the issuer.
- **Smaller than normal Maxi**: A scaled down maxi agreement is a type of best efforts underwriting that doesn't become effective until a base amount of securities is sold. When the base is met, the underwriter may then sell the securities up to the maximum amount determined under the terms of the offering. All funds collected from investors are held in escrow until the underwriting is completed. Assuming the base amount of securities indicated by the offering can't be reached, the offering is canceled and the investors' funds are returned to them.
- **All or None**: With an all or none underwriting, the issuer decides it must receive the proceeds from the sale of the securities in general. Investors' funds are held in escrow until the securities are all sold. Assuming the securities are all sold, the proceeds are delivered to the issuer. On the off chance that the securities are all not sold, the issue is canceled and the investors' funds are returned to them.
- **Standby Underwriting**: A standby underwriting agreement is utilized related to a preemptive rights offering. All [standby underwritings](/standbyunderwriting) are finished on a firm commitment basis. The standby underwriter consents to purchase any shares that current shareholders don't purchase. The standby underwriter will then, at that point, resell the securities to the public.
