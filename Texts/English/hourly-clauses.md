# Hourly Clause
## What Is an Hourly Clause?

An hourly clause, otherwise called an hours clause, is a provision in a [reinsurance](/reinsurance) contract demanding the investment at which a loss happens to be reported, and, some of the time, limiting coverage to a certain time period. Hourly clauses are most normally found in [catastrophe reinsurance](/catastrophe-reinsurance) property policies.

## Grasping an Hourly Clause

An hourly clause is one of the specific contract terms reinsurers use to limit coverage and reduce their exposure to losses. It isn't generally a separate clause in a reinsurance contract, however included as part of the [occurrence](/occurrence-strategy) definition.

In a reinsurance contract, the [reinsurer](/reinsurer) consents to [indemnify](/reimbursement) the insurer up to a loss limit in exchange for a portion of the [premium](/insurance-premium) that the insurer gathers through its [underwriting](/underwriting) activities. Reinsurers look at the expected frequency and seriousness of claims and the probability that a loss will happen and build that into pricing and risk models.

On account of catastrophe reinsurance, the intermittence and capriciousness of natural catastrophes can make modeling troublesome, and in response to this reinsurers frequently incorporate terms that limit the scope of coverage.

These terms narrow the definition of what types of catastrophes are covered by, for instance, characterizing catastrophes as those brought about by natural and not man-made means. In this case, a naturally happening seismic tremor will trigger coverage yet a quake triggered by drilling a well wouldn't.

They may likewise incorporate hourly clauses. Reinsurers utilize hourly clauses to narrow the amount of time after a catastrophe starts that damage will be covered. This limits the amount of time that losses will be accepted relative to the time an insurable event happens.

For instance, an hourly clause might show that main damages supported in something like four hours of a quake are covered by the reinsurance contract. Normally, the time span is fixed at 72 or 168 hours. All the more as of late, hourly clauses have seen an increase in time spans.

## Hourly Clause: Restrictive or Expansive?

Determining the time that a loss happens relative to an insurable event can be troublesome, particularly in the event that losses are far reaching. While reinsurers like to limit their exposure through hourly clauses, insurance companies frequently view such terms as onerous and will search out reinsurers who will prohibit this type of term from a reinsurance treaty.

Yet, an hourly clause isn't restrictive 100% of the time. In certain occasions, it could permit the reinsured to aggregate numerous losses to recuperate from its reinsurers where generally this probably won't have been imaginable due to different reasons, for example, attributable to the particular excess level in a contract. For instance, damages happening due to hurricanes in two separate geographical districts can be aggregated into a single [claim](/insurance_claim) even however they might have been defined in separate contracts.

## Illustration of an Hourly Clause

Expect Reinsurer ABC has an hourly clause in its contract with Insurance Company BDF. The hourly clause is for 72 hours. Throughout the mid year, Hurricane Bilbao strikes the west bank of Florida, destroying numerous towns north of a 120 hour period.

The total payout for insurance claims [ceded](/reinsurance-ceded) to Reinsurer ABC for the 120 hour period is $11 million; notwithstanding, in view of the hourly clause, Reinsurer ABC will just give a payout to claims that happened inside a 72 hour period. Insurance Company BDF chooses which 72 hour period to pick, expanding the payout they will receive, nonetheless, they won't receive a payout for the full amount of $11 million.

Insurance Company BDF chooses to pick the 72 hour period after the second day of Hurricane Bilboa, when the most damage happened, and will receive a payout of $7 million.

In this model, Reinsurer ABC profited from the hourly clause as they were not obligated for the total damages.
