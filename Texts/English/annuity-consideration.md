# Annuity Consideration
## What Is Annuity Consideration?

An annuity consideration or premium is the money an individual pays to an insurance company to fund an annuity or receive a surge of annuity payments. An annuity consideration might be made as a [lump sum](/lump-sum-payment) or as a series of payments, frequently alluded to as contributions.

## How Annuity Considerations Work

Account owners who receive annuity income payments can pick various frequencies of distribution, like month to month, quarterly, semiannually, or annually. Payments depend on several factors, including the accompanying:

- The amount of the annuity consideration or accumulated value of an existing deferred annuity
- The age at which the [annuitant](/annuitant) starts getting payments
- The annuitant's [life expectancy](/lifeexpectancy) or the length of the term
- The annuity's anticipated investment returns
- Whether the annuity is fixed or variable and guaranteed for a predetermined amount of time or the lifetime of the annuitant

Payments guaranteed for a more limited term are frequently higher.

[Annuities](/annuity) can be structured by a wide exhibit of subtleties and factors. Immediate annuities generate a surge of payments after being issued. Deferred annuities are retirement products in which payments are deferred until initiated by the account owner. Account-holders might dispatch contributions into their accounts to earn interest; contingent upon the tax structure (e.g., qualified or non-qualified), considerations or contributions might be limited. Annuitizing the deferred annuity prompts the payout feature, in which a surge of payments is made.

> Payments can be guaranteed for the annuitant's life or a certain period (e.g., 5, 10, or 20 years).

## Types of Annuities

Annuities can be structured generally as either fixed or variable. [Fixed annuities](/fixedannuity) earn fixed rates of interest and frequently have a base guaranteed rate. [Variable annuities](/variableannuity) permit account owners to invest in funds tied to the market. Most variable deferred annuities have a fixed account, which gives a hedge of protection against market vacillations. A few immediate annuities contain a variable account, permitting the owner to invest various funds. Therefore, payments from these annuities frequently change.

Annuities can be made so that, upon [annuitization](/annuitization), payments will go on inasmuch as either the annuitant or their spouse (in the event that survivorship benefit is chosen) is alive. Instances of life guaranteed annuities incorporate the life just annuity (payments are guaranteed for the annuitant's life just) and the life with a guaranteed period annuity (payments are guaranteed for the annuitant's life, yet on the off chance that they decline inside the guaranteed period, the excess guaranteed payments are paid to their beneficiary. On the other hand, annuities can be structured to pay out funds for a specific period, like 20 years.

## Annuities in 401(k)s

Americans might track down greater annuity offerings in their 401k plans due to the passage of the Setting Every Community Up for Retirement Enhancement (SECURE) Act. The new law makes it simpler for employers to offer annuity products inside a representative's [401(k)](/401kplan) account. Before the passage of the bill, employers were responsible for products offered to their employees in a retirement portfolio. In any case, under the new law, the responsibility will lie with the insurance companies offering the annuity options to the employees. Specialists accept employers will feel more open to offering annuity products under the new law.

For the people who have retirement savings in a 401(k), they can transfer a portion of those funds and purchase a [qualified longevity annuity contract](/qualified-longevity-annuity-contract-qlac) (QLAC). A QLAC is a [deferred annuity](/deferredannuity), which is funded from a [individual retirement account](/ira) (IRA) or a [qualified retirement plan](/qrp).

A QLAC annuity gives guaranteed regularly scheduled payments until the beneficiary's death and is exempt from the [required least distribution](/requiredminimumdistribution) (RMD) rules associated with IRAs. An annual RMD is generally required by the age of 72, while payouts with a QLAC can start after a preset starting date. The IRS has laid out a limit on how much money can be transferred from an IRA to a QLAC. In 2020 and 2021, an individual can spend 25% or $135,000 (whichever is less) of their savings in an IRA or retirement plan to purchase a QLAC.

## Special Considerations

These instruments are not ideal for everybody, especially the people who might require access to their money. Deferred annuities frequently have surrender plans, in which all or a portion of removed money is subject to a penalty. Fees during the [surrender period](/surrender-period) can be high, more so in the early long stretches of ownership.

These surrender periods can last somewhere in the range of two to over decade, contingent upon the specific product. Surrender fees can begin at 10% or more, however the penalty regularly declines annually over the surrender period. For a few immediate annuities, surrenders are impractical after payments start.

A few advisors contend that investors searching for a flood of payments can structure their annuity-like instrument with a combination of [dividend-paying stocks](/stockdividend), [bond ladders](/bondladder), and [money markets](/moneymarket). Among the advantages of this approach are low fees and ready access to your cash.
