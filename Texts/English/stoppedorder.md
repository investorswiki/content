# Stopped Order
## What Is Stopped Order?

A stopped order was a special order condition formerly conceivable just on the [New York Stock Exchange](/nyse) (NYSE) that permitted specialists to defer the execution of an order with the intent to further develop its price a short while later. They were prohibited in 2016.

## Grasping Stopped Order

A stopped order isn't equivalent to a [stop order](/stoporder), which is a type of order set off when a stock's price moves past a specific point.

A stock exchange member known as a [specialist](/specialist) was permitted to stop or hold onto a NYSE market order in the event that the person in question accepted a better price would open up. The specialist, filling in as a [designated market maker](/designated-market-maker-dmm) (DMM) to facilitate and regulate the trading of a specific stock, would post the market order as a limit order and it would be filled. They would do this if it could assist them with taking care of a larger request coming into their rundown of mentioned trades.

The practice was ended as the specialist's job developed. Most trading is presently electronic and scarcely any specialists work on the NYSE trading floor.

A stopped order was kept from being promptly executed by a specialist in light of the fact that the specialist had tact in taking care of requests. Specifically, an order could be stopped on the off chance that the specialist felt that an order would get a better price assuming that they held on to it. The purpose was to limit unpredictable price moves brought about by large or different orders.

As per former NYSE rules, when the order was stopped, it would be recognized and the specialist was required to guarantee the market price around then (should the specialist be fruitless in getting a better price). Orders could be stopped for quite a while yet must be filled before the finish of the trading day.

A specialist would stop an order for quite a few reasons, however they could do so on the off chance that they likewise guaranteed the market price at the time the order was stopped. For instance, a market order came in to buy 1,000 shares and the [offer](/ask) was at $10.25 with 2,000 shares offered. Since that buy order could be filled immediately at $10.25, assuming the specialist held or stopped that buy order from executing, they must give the buying client the $10.25 price or lower.

The specialist could revise the market buy order as a limit order (bid) to narrow the spread, or they could fill the buy order with their own shares that they need to sell, giving a better price than 10.25.

Specialists could have made such moves to forestall whimsical price developments in the stock or to safeguard themselves. Specialists are required to be actively engaged with a stock and give liquidity. They will try to stay away from large losses by buying and selling their share inventory to give liquidity while limiting risk.

Specialists never again exist on the NYSE trading floor in the job that they used to play. Electronic trading step by step decreased the specialist's job, and by 2008 the specialist job failed to be. Specialists on the floor presently play the job of designated market makers (DMMs) presently assist with keeping everything under control in NYSE-[listed](/listed) stocks. These days, by far most of market maker trading is automated.

## Stopped Order Example

Expect that a specialist shows on the order book a bid of 1,000 at $125.50 and 3,000 shares offered at $125.70. A market order comes in to sell 500 shares. This order could be executed at $125.50, yet all things considered, the specialist stops the order. They post the 500 share sell order at $125.60, narrowing the [spread](/bid-askspread).

This might draw a few buyers into the stock, or it might push the price down. Regardless, in light of the fact that the specialist stopped the order they must satisfy the sell order at $125.50 or higher since that is where the sell order would have been filled had it not been stopped.

The specialist could likewise choose to take care of the request from their own pool of shares. They could, for instance, take care of the request at $125.53, giving the sell order a bit better price than the current bid.
