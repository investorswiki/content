# Call Price
## What Is a Call Price?

The call price (otherwise called "reclamation price") is the price at which the issuer of a callable security has the privilege to buy back that security from an investor or creditor. Call prices are commonly found in [callable bonds](/callablebond) or [callable preferred stock](/callablepreferredstock). The call price is set at the time the security is issued and is known by perusing the issue's prospectus.

## Understanding the Call Price

[Callable securities](/callable-security) are commonly found in the fixed-income markets and permit the issuer to shield itself from overpaying for debt by permitting it to buy back the issue at a pre-decided price in the event that interest rates or market prices change. This pre-decided price is the call price. For example, in the event that a company issues a bond paying a fixed coupon of 5% when interest rates are likewise 5%, they can utilize a call option to reclaim that bond assuming that interest rates drop to, express, 3% to have the option to refinance their debt.

Since the call option benefits the issuer and not investors, these securities trade at higher prices to repay callable security holders for the [reinvestment risk](/reinvestmentrisk) they are presented to and for denying them of future interest income. Issuers thusly will pay a [call premium](/callpremium). The call premium is an amount over the face value of the security and is paid if the security is reclaimed before the scheduled maturity date. Put another way, the call premium is the difference between the call price of the bond and its stated par value. For noncallable securities or for a bond reclaimed right on time during its call protection period, the call premium is a penalty paid by the issuer to the bondholders.

### Callable Bonds

The foundation of a call price and the time span when it very well might be set off are normally enumerating in a bond's indenture agreement. This permits the issuer of the bond to demand the holder to sell back the bond, ordinarily for its face value, alongside any agreed upon percentage due. This premium could be set at interest for one year. Contingent upon how the terms are structure, that premium might shrink as the bond develops due to the amortization of the premium.

Typically, a call will happen before a bond arrives at its maturity, particularly in occasions where the issuer has an opportunity to refinance the debt the bond covers at a lower rate. The terms of the call price might specify a time span when the issuer can exercise it, alongside periods when the security is non-callable, and the [bondholder](/bondholder) can't be constrained to sell it back.

A few bonds are non-callable for an initial period of time, and afterward they become callable. At the point when a company calls a bond issue, it is quite often the case that the company makes substantial economic savings in terms of future interest payments, to the detriment of the bond investor who will be forced to reinvest their money at a lower interest rate. When a bond has been called, the issuer has no legal obligation to make any interest payments after the call date.

### Callable Preferreds

A company may likewise exercise its right to call preferred stock on the off chance that it wishes to stop payment of the dividend associated with the shares. It might decide to do this to increase earnings for common shareholders.

## Model

For instance, suppose the TSJ Sports Conglomerate issues 100,000 [preferred shares](/inclination shares) with a face value of $100 with a [call provision](/callprovision) worked in at $110. This means that if TSJ somehow managed to exercise its right to call the stock, the call price would be $110.
