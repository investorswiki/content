# Recharacterization
## What Is Recharacterization?

Recharacterization alludes to two separate [individual retirement account (IRA)](/ira) strategies:

1. A [contribution](/retirement-contribution) to an IRA can be recharacterized as a contribution to an alternate IRA. This strategy is at present permissible, and you can recharacterize your Roth IRA contribution into a traditional IRA contribution and vice versa, however specific cutoff times apply.
1. A [Roth IRA conversion](/iraconversion) could be recharacterized (or "scattered") into a traditional IRA. In any case, this strategy is not generally permitted under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. Today, in the event that you do a Roth IRA conversion, it's a permanent, irrevocable move.

## How Recharacterization Works

A recharacterization allows you to treat a normal contribution that you made to a Roth IRA or a traditional IRA as one that you made to one more type of IRA. For instance, on the off chance that you contributed $6,000 to your Roth IRA (the "first" IRA), you could recharacterize it as a $6,000 contribution made to your traditional IRA (the "second" IRA).

> You can't recharacterize employer contributions under a [simplified employee pension (SEP) IRA](/sep) or [Savings Incentive Match Plan for Employees (SIMPLE) IRA](/simple-ira) plan as contributions to another IRA.

Recharacterizing a contribution starting with one type of IRA then onto the next offers you the chance to change your psyche or right a slip-up — say, you contributed to a Roth even however your income was too high.

You have until the due date for your federal income [tax return](/taxreturn) (counting any extensions) for the year when you made the first contribution to recharacterize your contribution. However long you recharacterize your contribution by this cutoff time, you can regard the contribution as made to the second IRA for that year. This means that you can actually disregard the contribution you made to the first IRA.

> The year when you made the first contribution is the [tax year](/taxyear) to which that contribution relates — not really the year when you actually made the contribution. Recall that you generally have until April 15 (April 18 or 19 of every 2022) to make an earlier year contribution.

To recharacterize a contribution, ask your IRA custodian (the financial institution holding your IRA) to transfer the amount — including the contribution and related earnings — to an alternate type of IRA. The recharacterization can happen either inside a similar institution (on the off chance that you utilize one custodian for the two IRAs) or by means of a [trustee-to-legal administrator transfer](/direct-transfer) on the off chance that various providers keep up with the IRAs.

## Highlights
- Before the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, you could recharacterize — or "fix" — a Roth IRA conversion back to a traditional IRA.
- An individual retirement account (IRA) contribution can be recharacterized as a contribution to an alternate IRA, however specific cutoff times apply.
- Roth IRA conversions are presently irrevocable. When you convert to a Roth, pressing forward is the only option.
## FAQ
### What amount might I at any point add to an IRA?
For 2021 and 2022, you can contribute up to $6,000 to your Roth and traditional IRAs. Assuming that you're age 50 or more established, you can make an extra $1,000 [catch-up contribution](/catchupcontribution), bringing the annual contribution limit to $7,000. Note that the limit is the combined total for your IRAs in general. Thus, for instance, assuming you contribute $4,000 to a traditional IRA, the most that you could add to a Roth during a similar tax year would be $2,000.Roth IRAs have an extra restriction: Whether you're permitted to contribute the full amount — or anything by any means — relies upon your [modified adjusted gross income (MAGI)](/magi) and filing status. For instance, in the event that you're married and file jointly, you can't add to a Roth IRA assuming your MAGI is $214,000 or something else for the 2022 tax year.
### How would you allot earnings when recharacterizing IRA contributions?
Assuming you opt to recharacterize an IRA contribution, you need to transfer the contribution plus any earnings connected with those funds — or less any losses. In the event that the IRA is made completely out of the contribution and earnings that you need to recharacterize — for example, it's another IRA to which you've made just a single contribution — then, at that point, you can transfer the whole IRA. This is called a full recharacterization.Conversely, if you need to transfer part of your IRA, it's viewed as a partial recharacterization. In this case, you need to decide the amount of the IRA's earnings are owing to your desired contribution to recharacterize. You can skip the math by asking your IRA provider to compute this amount for you.
### How would you recharacterize an individual retirement account (IRA) contribution?
To recharacterize an individual retirement account (IRA) contribution, you'll have to utilize an existing IRA or open another one to acknowledge the removed funds. Next, inform your financial institution(s) that you need to recharacterize a contribution. Assuming a similar IRA provider keeps up with the two IRAs, you can just inform that one institution. In any case, inform the custodian holding the IRA contribution being referred to and the institution that will acknowledge the recharacterized contribution.You can generally do the recharacterization online or with your IRA custodian's standard form. You must report the recharacterization on your tax return for the year when you made the original contribution utilizing Internal Revenue Service (IRS) [Form 8606](/form-8606).
