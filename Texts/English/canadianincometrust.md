## What Is a Canadian Income Trust?

A Canadian [income trust](/incometrust) is a type of investment trust that holds stable, income-delivering assets and disseminates payments to [unitholders](/unitholder), or shareholders, on a periodic (month to month or quarterly) basis.

## Understanding Canadian Income Trusts

The units of a Canadian income trust are traded on a stock exchange, yet they give the majority of their income to unitholders through distributions. These trusts generally hold assets that have reliable demand and generate consistent incomes, like oil, coal, natural gas, or other natural resources.

Canadian income trusts are run by financial institutions and generally have no management or employees. Since a portion of their distributions are viewed as returns of capital, Canadian income trusts generate less tax liability for investors and reduce their cost basis. By paying out the majority of their cash flows, these trusts are able to stay away from taxation, accordingly making this business structure extremely engaging.

These trusts can raise funds by giving shares or borrowing money. They frequently utilize this capital to buy new reserves or foster existing properties, and this ability to increase their distributions over the long run makes Canadian income trusts interesting to numerous investors. Notwithstanding, their values are affected by [exchange rates](/exchangerate).

## Benefits and Disadvantages of a Canadian Income Trust
