# Signum (SIGNA) — Formerly Burstcoin (BURST)
## What Is Signum (SIGNA)?

Signum (SIGNA), formerly known as Burstcoin (BURST), is a cryptocurrency that is intended to be exceptionally energy-proficient and a model for green mining. Signum/Burstcoin's blockchain operates utilizing a [proof-of-capacity](/verification capacity-cryptocurrency) (PoC) algorithm, which utilizes a mining gadget's accessible plate space as opposed to following other energy-serious [mining](/bitcoin-mining) methodologies.

Burstcoin was the main coin to utilize the PoC algorithm and uses the vacant space on a miner's hard drive for mining. Other cryptocurrencies that utilization PoC are Storj, Chia, and SpaceMint. The mining system for most virtual currencies requires particular, costly, energy-escalated machines; for Signum/Burstcoin, participants just have to have a normal hard drive. Participants could actually mine on Android telephones, truth be told.

Starting from the entry into Signum/Burstcoin mining is so natural, the technology is more decentralized than other cryptocurrencies. For instance, bitcoin requires a gigantic financial commitment to

Signum/Burstcoin is accessible for trading on exchanges different various exchanges, including Bittrex, Upbit, and Eterbase. Burstcoin experienced a huge price decline after it was delisted from Poloniex in May 2019. Due to this, in part, Burstcoin formally changed its name to Signum, under the symbol SIGNA, on June 24, 2021. This was the consequence of a hard fork that basically delivered the original Burstcoin void.

As of October 2021, 1 SIGNA is worth roughly USD $0.01, with an overall market cap of $21.7 million.

## Figuring out Signum/Burstcoin

Signum/Burstcoin is operated by Burst-coin.org. An anonymous client presented Burstcoin on bitcointalk.org in 2014. The technology was developed in view of the Nxt platform and shares large numbers of similar elements as the cryptocurrency. Like the creator of Bitcoin, Satoshi Nakamoto, the creator of Burstcoin stayed anonymous. A team called the Proof-of-Capacity Consortium (PoC Consortium) is presently fostering the project.

Signum/Burstcoin upholds smart contracts in view of [blockchain](/blockchain) technology, offering similar standard elements of other virtual currencies: obscurity, decentralization, and high-security cryptography. Burstcoin's tokens are alluded to as Bursts. There was no [initial coin offering](/initial-coin-offering-ico) (ICO), no pre-mining allocations to early adopters, and no [airdrops](/airdrop-cryptocurrency) for any advancements of the cryptocurrency during the send off.

Signum/Burstcoin is mined through the confirmation of-capacity (PoC) process. (PoC is likewise at times alluded to as evidence of-room.) Whereas [proof-of-work](/confirmation work) (PoW) mining requires a great deal of computing power, the PoC method permits the computing to be performed ahead of time and every one of the responses to be stored on a hard drive.

For each new block in the blockchain, the miner has under five minutes to peruse the tackled conditions (likewise called "plots") on their hard drive and return the right response. The main right response wins the block and is rewarded with transaction fees and the Signum/Burstcoin block reward. The computational resources for mining Signum/Burstcoin are limited to the time it takes the miner to peruse the plot documents stored on mass storage.

The Burst engineers pre-mined zero coins. The Signum/Burstcoin blockchain operates with a [block time](/block-time-cryptocurrency) of four minutes. The block reward size lessens at a fixed rate of 5% every month and contains a limited token supply of 2,158,812,800 Burst tokens. The Signum/Burstcoin network likewise offers a dedicated digital wallet, called the Burst Wallet.

Other important Signum/Burstcoin highlights incorporate the Burst Asset Exchange, a peer-to-peer exchange that is integrated into the Burst Wallet and offers a consistent, quick, secure, and decentralized exchange of different Burst assets. The Burst Asset Exchange takes into consideration Signum/Burst assets to be utilized as a token of ownership for whatever has a value, which might incorporate retirement funds, mining homesteads and pools, companies, and casino locales. It's a helpful method for making investments, gain [dividend](/dividend) profits or capital growth, and guarantee [liquidity](/liquidity) in trading assets.

In June 2018, the creators of Signum/Burstcoin executed a hard fork that made both dynamic block sizes and dynamic transaction fees. In June of 2021, another hard fork changed over Burstcoin into Signum.

## Objectives of Signum/Burstcoin

Signum/Burstcoin likewise upholds [crowdfunding](/crowdfunding), [smart contracts](/smart-contracts), and a dedicated marketplace that permits blockchain participants to rundown, buy, and sell everything without exception utilizing these tokens on a marketplace free of commissions.

Signum/Burstcoin's highlights incorporate secure scrambled informing. This can be utilized to discuss securely with other network participants, and the messages can be connected to the different transactions happening on the network that works with description as well as simple bookkeeping.

## Features
- Signum is accessible for trading on different various exchanges, including Bittrex, Upbit, and Eterbase; it experienced a critical price decline after it was delisted from Poloniex.
- Signum (SIGNA), formerly Burstcoin (BURST), is a cryptocurrency that is intended to be profoundly energy-productive and a model for green mining.
- Signum/Burstcoin's blockchain operates utilizing a proof-of-space (PoS) algorithm, which utilizes a mining gadget's accessible plate space as opposed to following other energy-escalated mining methodologies.
- PoS is a less energy-escalated method of mining cryptocurrencies, however has its own issues.
