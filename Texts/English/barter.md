## Instructions to Barter

It very well may be an expertise or an ability, or even a hobby, like photography.

To value a service, call around for nearby estimates from professionals to figure out how seriously you can price your abilities.

**Look for bartering partners:** After you understand what you bring to the table and exactly what you want/need in a barter situation, find a barter partner. In the event that you don't have a specific person or business as a main priority, try verbal. Let your friends, partners, and social network have some familiarity with your specific need and what you need in a barter situation. Use Facebook, LinkedIn, and Twitter.

Check online swap markets and online [auctions](/closeout) that have a bartering part, like Craigslist.com (check under "Available to be purchased" for the Bartering category), Swapace.com, and BarterQuest.com.
