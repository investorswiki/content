# Caribbean Single Market and Economy (CSME)
## What Is the Caribbean Single Market and Economy (CSME)?

The Caribbean Single Market and Economy (CSME) is an initiative of the [Caribbean Community and Common Market](/caribbean-community-and-common-market-caricom) (CARICOM) that would incorporate member-states into a single economic unit. The final product would be the free movement of capital, services, technology and skilled professionals inside the region.

The more extensive goal of Caribbean economic unification is help member economies — a considerable lot of which are small despite everything creating — contend with bigger opponents in the global market.

## Understanding the Caribbean Single Market and Economy (CSME)

The Caribbean Free Trade Association formed in 1965 gave a structure to the removal of [tariffs](/duty) and different barriers to trade inside the region. In 1989, the CARICOM heads of government agreed to additional economic integration among Caribbean nations as a common market that could end up being useful to the region flourish in the midst of [globalization](/globalization).

As the world developed more interconnected, a significant number of the Caribbean's small island nations found themselves progressively contending among themselves. By consolidating into a single firm economic unit, member countries could zero in on their competitive benefits in view of the resources they have, as opposed to contending among themselves to be the market leader on certain products.

Likewise, the CSME intends to reduce trade and professional limitations among member nations. The fundamental parts of the Caribbean Single Market and Economy include:

1. Consumer Affairs
1. Competition Policy
1. Social Security
1. Contingent Rights
1. Migration Arrangements for Free Movement of Persons
1. Administrative Arrangements for Commercial Establishment
1. Government Procurement
1. Trade and Competitiveness in CARICOM

CARICOM began implementation of the Caribbean Single Market and Economy in 2006. The 2007-08 Financial Crisis eased back progress toward full implementation, however authorities in 2011 denied ideas the program had been put "on stop" due to a lack of political will. Meanwhile, CARICOM members have made progress toward orchestrating their tax systems, regulatory conditions, and other general government policies.

- Trinidad and Tobago
- Anguilla (associate member)
- Bermuda (associate member)
- British Virgin Islands (associate member)

When fully completed, the CSME will succeed CARICOM and will take into account free intra-regional movement of capital and labor among member-states. Moreover, member-states will share [monetary](/monetarypolicy) and [fiscal policies](/fiscalpolicy), and organizations operating in the economic union will approach a bigger market.

This will assist with amplifying the useful capacity of the nations of the Caribbean as well as help to differentiate the scope of markets wherein goods and services will be traded.
