# Annual Addition
## What Is the Annual Addition?

The annual expansion is the total dollar amount that a participant adds to their retirement account under a [defined-contribution](/definedcontributionplan) (DC) retirement plan, for example, a [401(k)](/401kplan). The annual expansion is subject to a maximum limit, which is generally the lesser of 100% of a [plan participant's](/planparticipant) compensation for the year, or the dollar amount of the limit that is in effect for a specific year. The annual expansion is the total contribution limit for both the employer's matching and the employee's contributions.

## Grasping the Annual Addition

The term annual expansion is one more approach to saying "total contribution." The [Internal Revenue Service](/irs) (IRS) limits the amount you might add to your defined-contribution retirement account in any one year. This limit applies to the total annual contributions (augmentations) to each of your accounts in plans kept up with by one employer (and any connected employer). In some 401(k)s, for instance, employers could match the employee's contributions by adding to the employee's 401(k) up to a specific percentage of the employee's salary.

The limit applies to the total of:

- Elective deferrals (yet no [catch-up contributions](/catchupcontribution))
- Employer matching contributions
- Employer nonelective contributions
- Allocations of relinquishments

The following are the IRS limits for total contributions to a defined contribution retirement plan for 2021 and 2022. The annual increments paid to a participant's account can't surpass the lesser of:

- 100% of the participant's compensation, or
- $58,000 ($64,500 incorporating $6,500 in permitted catch-up contributions for those employees aged 50 and over) for 2021
- $61,000 ($67,500 including catch-up contributions) for 2022

## Annual Additions and Defined-Contribution Plans

Annual augmentations apply to defined-contribution plans. These types of retirement plans are normally [tax-deferred](/taxdeferred), yet withdrawals are taxable. The [tax-advantaged](/tax-advantaged) status of defined-contribution plans generally permits balances to develop bigger over the long run compared to taxable accounts. There are a wide range of types of defined-contribution plans, including the 401(k) and the 403(b) plans, in which employees contribute a fixed amount or a percentage of their checks.

To help hold and draw in top ability, a sponsor company will generally match a portion of an employee's contributions in a DC plan. Defined-contribution plans confine when and how every employee can pull out funds without punishments. Different elements of defined-contribution plans incorporate automatic participant enrollment, automatic contribution increments, [hardship withdrawals](/hardship_withdrawal), loan provisions, and catch-up contributions for employees aged 50 and more seasoned.

## Annual Additions and Vesting Periods

While beginning with another employer, an employee must frequently trust that years will start getting annual augmentations to their retirement plan. Albeit an employee ordinarily can begin adding to a DC plan sooner, this benefit is as often as possible delayed to guarantee that the employee stays in the position sufficiently long to start adding value to the company and that it's worth the employer's chance to invest in them. [Vesting](/vesting) periods, or a vesting schedule, are generally determined while arranging the terms of the job.

This type of negotiation is common in many beginning up conditions, where vesting with stock [bonuses](/reward) can assist with improving the pot for a valued employee to stay with the company. For instance, an employee's stock could become 25% vested in the first year, 25% in the subsequent year, 25% in the third year, and completely vested following four years. Assuming that the employee leaves after just two years, they could relinquish half of their vesting capacities.

At times, vesting is immediate, likewise with employees' own salary-deferral contributions to their retirement plans. Further, [individual retirement account](/ira) (IRA) plans like the SEP and [SIMPLE](/simple) expect that all contributions to the plan are dependably 100% vested.
