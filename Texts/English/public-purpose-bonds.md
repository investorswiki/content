# Public Purpose Bond
## What Is a Public Purpose Bond?

A public purpose bond is a type of debt security that municipalities use to finance public works facilities and improvements. A public purpose bond must fund a project that benefits the public at large and not private individuals.

Public purpose bonds appreciate generally tax-exempt status. Their income is tax-free at the federal level, and frequently at the state level in the event that the individual lives in the state of bond issuance.

## How a Public Purpose Bond Works

A public purpose bond is a specific sort of [municipal bond](/municipalbond) that funds a public project. They finance public work projects that don't attract private investment or produce revenue. These bonds are generally employed to fund such projects as road construction and maintenance, libraries, pools, and other municipal facilities.

Public purpose bonds are exempt from federal income taxes and were first defined by the Tax Reform Act of 1986 which requires the arrangement as either public purpose or private purpose bonds. To issue a public purpose bond, a municipality must have the option to tax its inhabitants, plus can apply [eminent domain](/eminent-domain) or police power.

Public purpose bonds are a sort of municipal bond classified as a [general obligation bond](/generalobligationbond) (GO). GO bonds receive backing from the credit and taxing power of the responsible jurisdiction instead of a bond backed by the revenue derived from some random project. As broad obligation bonds, public purpose bonds don't need assets for guarantee; all things being equal, the municipalities issue the bonds with the conviction that they will actually want to repay their debt obligation through taxation or revenue from projects.

## Oversight of Public Purpose Bond Issues

The [Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board](/msrb), (MSRB), is a managing body that makes rules and policies for investment firms and banks in the giving and sale of municipal bonds, notes, and other municipal securities. States, urban communities, and counties issue municipal securities for various reasons. MSRB is the official source of data and disclosure statements for all available municipal debt securities. Issuers consent to give specific data to MSRB. This data incorporates annual financial reports and notification about occasions, for example, delinquencies, defaults, unscheduled draws on debt service reserves, and any activities that would influence the tax-exempt status of the security.

## Public Purpose versus Private Purpose Bonds

Public purpose bonds require the majority of the funded project to benefit the public at large. Conversely, a [private purpose bond](/ppb) finances a project for which something like 10% of the benefit will go to a private sector entity.

For instance, a city is expecting to attract economic investment and believes a corporation should open a new settle in the town. To tempt the corporation the city issues a municipal bond loaning the corporation the funds to build its new headquarters. The municipality trusts the office will make occupations and invigorate the city's economy.

By giving the bonds, the corporation can borrow funds at a lower interest rate than a bank would offer. The city benefits from economic growth. The income any investors make off of this bond, in any case, is taxable in light of the fact that a private entity generates the revenue.

## Features
- A public purpose bond is a municipal bond issued by a state, municipality, or province to fund projects that benefit the public, like schools, parks, or public roads.
- For a buyer of these bonds, any interest earned is exempt from federal income tax and might be exempt from state income tax in the event that the buyer lives in the state in which the bond has been issued.
- This sort of bond stands out from a private purpose bond, a type of bond that gives financing to a project for which no less than 10% of the benefit goes to the private sector.
- A public purpose bond is a sort of broad obligation bond (GO); in that capacity, municipalities are not required to give assets to guarantee; all things considered, they hope to repay the debt through taxation and any revenue from the project.
