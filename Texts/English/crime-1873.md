# Crime of 1873
## What Was the Crime of 1873?

The "Crime of 1873" was the notable exclusion of the standard silver dollar from the coinage law passed by Congress on February 12, 1873, and endorsed into law by President Ulysses S. Grant. This oversight subsequently prepared for the United States' adoption of the [gold standard](/goldstandard), which was profoundly dubious at that point, particularly for those presently not able to transform their silver into [legal tender](/legal-tender).

## History of Coinage Law and Reasons for Abandoning Silver

Coinage law regulates the coinage and legal tender that circles in the United States and sets the standard for the relative worth of each form of tender being used. The primary [Coinage Act, passed in 1792](/the-coinage-act-of-1972), laid out the [U.S. Mint](/mint) and set the dollar as the official standard unit of money in America and legal tender.

The Coinage Act of 1873 overhauled the laws of its ancestor to pivot the country toward the gold standard and away from silver. Section fifteen of the Act determined the exact silver coins to be minted from here on out and their separate loads, yet the standard silver dollar was excluded. Section seventeen stated that "no coins, both of gold, silver, or minor coinage, will henceforth be issued from the mint other than those of the groups, standards, and loads thus set forward." This implied that main the coins unequivocally remembered for the Coinage Act would be legal tender from there on out.

Prior in the century, the United States had basically stuck to a [silver standard](/silver-standard), however gold surges like the scandalous California Gold Rush brought gold back into the equation. Subsequent silver surges in spots, for example, South Africa increased silver production during the 1860s and took steps to push gold out of circulation. The United States saw the gold standard as the main rational economic approach and pushed through the Coinage Act in 1873. The gold standard was officially adopted in 1900.

## Analysis of the Coinage Law and Reasons for Calling It a Crime

Until 1873, the United States utilized a system of bimetallism, which involved both gold and silver as comparison points for the relative value of legal tender and set a [fixed exchange rate](/fixedexchangerate) between the two. At the point when the Coinage Act of 1873 eliminated silver from the equation, individuals who owned large amounts of silver were presently not able to transform that silver into money.

Numerous pundits contended that this monometallism would have negative ramifications for the [economy](/economy), including unstable prices and a lower amount of money circulating in the economy. They likewise guaranteed that the law was pushed through corruptly, albeit no evidence affirms this. Notwithstanding, industrial advances and a couple of gold surges, including the South African and the Klondike surges, siphoned more gold into circulation and gave economic consolation.

## The Modern Economic World

The gold standard was officially abrogated in 1971. From that point forward, most modern economies depend on [fiat money](/fiatmoney) — or money whose value and the [inflation rate](/inflation) is assigned by a government as opposed to an inherent worth — rather than depending on gold or silver. One illustration of fiat money is the U.S. dollar.

## Features
- The gold standard is a fixed monetary system under which the government's currency is fixed and might be uninhibitedly changed over into gold, however this law prominently left out the conversion of silver coins.
- The Crime of 1873 alludes to dropping silver dollars from official coinage by act of Congress in that year, setting the stage for the adoption of the gold standard in the U.S.
- The law was named a "crime" by the people who were left holding relatively worthless silver coins, as well as the individuals who went against the gold standard as monetary rule.
