Russians were in despair over the toll that World War I was taking on the country and wanted change, and that war-exhaustion permitted Lenin and his Red Guards, a secretly organized multitude of laborers, workers, and estranged Russian military men, to hold onto control of the government in an almost bloodless rebellion in November 1917.

### The Russian Civil War

Once in power, Lenin pulled out Russia from WWI, however his Red Army ended up fighting a three-year civil war with the White Army, a coalition of monarchists, [capitalists](/capitalism), and popularity based [socialists](/socialism).
