## What Is Netfile?

Netfile is an online service that permits Canadians to file their taxes to the [Canada Revenue Agency](/ccra) (CRA). Canadians selecting Netfile must utilize software certified by the CRA. Filers prepare and transfer their [tax returns](/taxreturn) to the CRA's website. Users might file up to 20 returns for every computer or online account.

## Grasping Netfile

Netfile doesn't permit filers to make changes to personal data like name, address, date of birth, or direct deposit data. Changes to personal data require a traditional paper return or contact with the CRA.

After an individual files taxes, the CRA sends this person a [notice of assessment](/noa) through customary mail. Be that as it may, on the off chance that a person registers online, they receive this notice electronically.

The CRA likewise works a service called ReFILE. This service permits taxpayers to file an amended income tax and benefit return electronically. The service is simply accessible to alter previously filed returns by means of Netfile.

## Benefits of Netfile

Other than getting rid of the need to file a paper return, Netfile offers several different benefits. As a rule, individual filers receive their tax [refunds](/tax-discount) more rapidly than with paper returns. Refunds regularly advance toward filers' accounts in just fourteen days assuming that they pick [direct deposit](/directdeposit).

As indicated by the CRA, utilizing Netfile produces a more accurate return in light of the fact that the CRA doesn't re-key data submitted electronically, cutting down on the chance of errors. Netfile likewise doesn't expect filers to mail in receipts except if the CRA demands them later on. Likewise, the service gives immediate confirmation the CRA really received a filer's return.

## Ineligibility From Using Netfile

The CRA permits most Canadian taxpayers to utilize Netfile, with a couple of special cases. Netfile is simply accessible to occupants of Canada, and just to those filing for themselves. For spousal and family returns, every individual must file separately. Individuals who declared bankruptcy in the current or previous year can't utilize Netfile. There are other, more uncommon prohibitions for utilizing Netfile. The full rundown is accessible on the public authority's official website.
