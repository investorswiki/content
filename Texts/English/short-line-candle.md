# Short Line Candle
## What Is a Short Line Candle?

Short line candles — otherwise called short candles — are candles on a [candlestick](/candlestick) chart that have a short real body. This one-bar pattern happens when there is just a small difference between the opening price and the closing price over a given period. The length of the upper and lower shadows — addressing the high and low for the period — don't have an effect in characterizing a short line candle.

At the end of the day, a short line candle might have a wide or narrow high and low reach for the period yet will continuously have a narrow open and close reach.

## Seeing Short Line Candles

Candlestick charts are frequently used to evaluate positive or negative market sentiment initially. Short line candles generally signal that the market is [consolidating](/consolidation) with little price movement. Be that as it may, they might have various implications, contingent upon where they happen in a price chart. For instance, a short line candle might appear as a [hammer](/hammer) in which there is a lower tail with no upper tail. This is a bullish reversal pattern and could show the finish of a downtrend. Then again, a series of short line candles could just propose hesitation and give traders few clues about where future prices are going.

A series of short line candles with narrow high and low reach demonstrates a period of low volatility. At the point when these candles are situated close to more extensive support or resistance, the cluster of candles frequently predicts the beginning of high volatility, for example a series of more extensive territory and directional candles steady with a creating trend. While these clusters will more often than not be bullish close to resistance and bearish close to support, their directional value is limited. Nonetheless, since they foresee that high volatility will supplant low volatility, traders can apply a basket of possibly productive strategies.

For instance, buying a security in a cluster at resistance will allow a tight stop loss due to the narrow reach candles and even narrower real bodies. Reward to risk is great in this scenario on the grounds that, if right, the trader benefits from the new uptrend and if off-base, the incurred loss is somewhat small. The cluster likewise benefits option traders who execute non-directional strategies that will produce profits from trend movement in one or the other bearing. This is conceivable due to the assumption that a high volatility directional move will result from the non-directional low volatility cluster.

## Short Line Candles in Practice

A hammer is a short-line price pattern in candlestick charting that happens when a security trades fundamentally lower than its opening, yet revitalizes inside the period to [close](/closingprice) close to opening price. This pattern forms a hammer-molded candlestick, in which the lower shadow is no less than two times the size of the real body. The body of the candlestick addresses the difference between the open and closing prices, while the shadow shows the high and low prices for the period.

The [hanging man](/hangingman) and the hammer candlesticks appear to be indistinguishable. The main difference is the unique situation. The hammer is a lining pattern that forms after a price decline. The hammer-shape shows strong selling during the period, however by the close the purchasers have recaptured control. This signals a potential base is close and the price could start heading higher whenever confirmed by up movement on the following candle. The hanging man happens after a price advance and cautions of possibly lower prices to come.

The inverted hammer and the [shooting star](/shootingstar) appear to be identical. The two of them have long upper shadows and small real bodies close to the low of the candle, with next to zero lower shadow. The difference is setting. A shooting star happens after a price advance and denotes a potential defining moment lower. An inverted hammer happens after a price decline and denotes a potential defining moment higher.

A [doji](/doji) is one more type of candlestick with a small real body. A doji means uncertainty since it is has both an upper and lower shadow. Dojis might signal a price reversal or trend continuation, contingent upon the confirmation that follows This varies from the hammer which happens after a price decline, signals a potential upside reversal (whenever followed by confirmation), and just has a long lower shadow.

## Highlights

- Short-lines, or short candles, are candlesticks that have short bodies.
- This short-body shape demonstrates that the open and close prices of the security were very close to another.
