# Bitcoin Core
Bitcoin Core is the leading implementation of the product empowering users to collaborate with the [Bitcoin](/bitcoin) network. It isn't owned by any single business or organization yet is rather refreshed and explored by a community of worldwide engineers.
The product was initially delivered by [Satoshi Nakamoto](/satoshi-nakamoto) (under the name Bitcoin), just to be subsequently renamed to Bitcoin Core to stay away from any confusion.

## How can it respond?
By running the Bitcoin Core code, a client successfully acts as a node on the network. They can freely confirm the legitimacy of [blocks](/block) received, as well as transactions sent by different users. This holds excavators in check and means that the client needs not trust anybody (like a wallet provider) to display the right perspective on the blockchain.
Packaged into the product is a [wallet](/bitcoin-wallet). Users can utilize this straightforwardly from inside the application, or tether outside wallets to their node to approve received transactions.

## Would it be advisable for me to run Bitcoin Core?
Users that habitually execute in Bitcoin ought to consider running a node to partake in the different privacy and security benefits. A regular programming wallet (one that doesn't interface with the client's node) questions third-party servers for the client's balance.
This practice can be an issue, as it permits the server to tie the client's balance to their IP address. The third party can sensibly surmise that the client claims the public addresses they ask about.
Along these lines, total dependence on a [block explorer](/block-explorer) is dangerous from a transparency standpoint. As users have just a single point of reference for their balances, it is simple for the server to send false data to them.
