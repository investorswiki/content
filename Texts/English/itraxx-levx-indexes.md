# The iTraxx LevX Indexes
## What Are the iTraxx LevX Indexes?

The iTraxx LevX are a pair of two tradable indexes that hold credit default swaps ([CDSs](/creditdefaultswap)) addressing a diversified basket of the 40 (formerly 35) most liquid European companies that have tradable debt offerings in the secondary market.

The LevX indices track what are known as leveraged loan credit default swaps ([LCDS](/loan-credit-default-swap)). A [leveraged loan](/leveragedloan) is a type of loan that is extended to companies that as of now have significant amounts of debt or poor credit history.

## Figuring out the iTraxx LevX Indexes

The [iTraxx](/itraxx) is a group of international credit derivative indices that investors can use to gain or hedge exposure to the [credit markets](/credit_market) underlying the [credit derivatives](/creditderivative). The credit derivatives market that iTraxx gives allows gatherings to transfer the risk and return of underlying assets starting with one party then onto the next without really transferring the assets. The iTraxx indices cover credit derivatives markets in Europe, Japan, non-Japan Asia and Australia. The iTraxx indices are additionally normally alluded to as Markit iTraxx indices.

The iTraxx LevX track liquid loan credit default swaps (LCDSs), with every one of the two indices trading on a 5-year maturity that are moved semi-yearly in March and September. The iTraxx LevX Senior Index addresses just [senior](/seniordebt) loans, while the iTraxx LevX Subordinated Index addresses [subordinated](/subordinateddebt) debt including second-and third-lien loans.

A loan credit default swap is a type of credit derivative wherein the credit exposure of an underlying loan is traded between two gatherings. A loan credit default swap's structure has equivalent to a normal credit default swap, then again, actually the underlying reference obligation is limited stringently to syndicated secured loans, instead of any corporate debt.

Loan credit default swaps are additionally alluded to as "loan-just credit default swaps." The LecX indices, specifically, check out at leveraged loans in their portfolios. Banks consider leveraged loans to carry a higher risk of [default](/default2), and thus, a leveraged loan is more expensive to the borrower.

## How the iTraxx LevX Indices Work

The index pair offers two pricing sets every day: a noontime price and end-of-day price. Prices are kept up with by a consortium of investment banks, including Morgan Stanley, Barclays Capital, and UBS. The two indexes start with an initial coupon rate, then, at that point, trade up or down to reflect market activity. New LevX indexes are delivered periodically to reflect new debt offerings or new company participation in the leveraged loan markets.

The iTraxx LevX indexes have been accessible for trading since late 2006, and keeping in mind that trade volume is still generally low, the average dollar amount traded is developing. The contracts are primarily utilized by examiners and large commercial banks as a [hedge](/hedge) against on balance sheet assets or different portfolios. Demand for indexes like the iTraxx group increased enormously with the spike in leveraged buyouts in the 2004-2007 period, as [LBOs](/leveragedbuyout) ordinarily make a large amount of low-rated corporate debt.

Assuming that the market sees that overall credit quality is falling, the price of the iTraxx indexes will likewise fall, and subsequently pay a higher [coupon rate](/coupon-rate). Since the greater part of the debt covered is leverage loans (lower credit ratings), the index might end up being more unpredictable than a speculative LCDS based index that covers investment-grade debt offerings.
