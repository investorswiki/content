## The History of Universal Banking in the U.S.

Due to severe regulation, the universal banking system was delayed to fill in the United States. During the Great Depression, Congress passed the Glass-Steagall Act as part of the Banking Act of 1933. In a measure to prevent further bank disappointments, the act disallowed universal banking. Commercial banks were not permitted to give investment banking services, for example, securities trading and brokerage services. Moreover, the act laid out the [Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation](/fdic) (FDIC), an independent federal agency that guarantees U.S. bank deposits against bank disappointment.

In 1999, the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLBA) partially revoked the Glass-Steagall Act, in this manner making it legal for commercial banks to offer investment banking services. The goal of the GLBA was to modernize the financial services industry by permitting financial institutions to extend the products and services they could offer their customers.

### Financial Crisis and Changing Regulations

Regulations impacting universal banking in the U.S. have proceeded to develop and change, particularly during times of economic commotion. For instance, the 2008 financial crisis caused a number of disappointments inside the investment banking system in the United States. This prompted the acquisition or bankruptcy of different institutions. A few eminent models incorporate [Lehman Brothers](/lehman-brothers) and Merrill Lynch.

In response, Congress enacted the [Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act](/dodd-frank-financial-regulatory-reform-bill) in 2010, which restricted the manners by which banks could invest by restricting speculative trading and precluding contribution with hedge funds and private equity firms. Opponents of Dodd-Frank scrutinized the act for overdoing it in diminishing the market-production activities of banks. In 2018, Congress enacted the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act (otherwise called the [Crapo Bill](/crapo-bill)), which moved back a portion of the Dodd-Frank limitations.

In spite of the developing rules in regards to universal banking, numerous financial service suppliers in the U.S. today offer a scope of services from banking, loans, mortgages, insurance, and investments either under one rooftop or through an affiliate network with partner firms. While improvements have eliminated a number of the barriers to the creation of universal banks in the U.S., they are as yet not however pervasive as they seem to be across numerous European countries. The United States has banks that emphasis simply on investments, which is uncommon in the remainder of the world.
