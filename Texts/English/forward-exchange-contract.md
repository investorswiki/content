These are the U.S. dollar and euros; the U.S. dollar and Japanese yen; the U.S. dollar and the British pound authentic; and the U.S. dollar and the Swiss franc. For these four pairs, exchange rates for a time span of as long as 10 years can be gotten.

Contract times however short as a couple of days seem to be likewise accessible from numerous suppliers. Albeit a contract can be modified, most elements won't see the full benefit of a FEC except if setting a base contract amount at $30,000.

## Special Considerations

The biggest forward exchange markets are in the Chinese yuan ([CNY](/cny-china-yuan-renminbi)), Indian rupee ([INR](/inr)), South Korean won ([KRW](/krw-korean-won)), New Taiwan dollar ([TWD](/twd-taiwan-dollar)), Brazilian real ([BRL](/brl-brazilian-real)), and Russian ruble ([RUB](/rub-russian-ruble)).

## Forward Exchange Calculation and Example

The forward exchange rate for a contract can be calculated utilizing four factors:

- S = the current spot rate of the currency pair
- r(d) = the domestic currency [interest rate](/interestrate)
- r(f) = the foreign currency interest rate
- t = season of contract in days

The formula for the forward exchange rate would be:

>
> Forward rate = S x (1 + r(d) x (t/360))/(1 + r(f) x (t/360))
>

For instance, accept that the U.S. dollar (USD) and Canadian dollar ([CAD](/cad-canadian-dollar)) spot rate is 1 CAD purchases $0.80 USD. The U.S. three-month rate is 0.75%, and the Canadian three-month rate is 0.25%. In this case, the three-month USD/CAD FEC rate would be calculated as:

>
> Three-month forward rate = 0.80 x (1 + 0.75% * (90/360))/(1 + 0.25% * (90/360)) = 0.80 x (1.0019/1.0006) = 0.801
>

The difference due to the rates over 90 days is one 100th 100th of a penny.
