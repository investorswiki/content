## What is a Standing Loan?

Standing loan alludes to a type of interest-only loan in which the repayment of principal is expected toward the finish of the loan term.

## How a Standing Loan Works

With a standing loan, the borrower is required to make only interest payments during the life of the loan. Toward the finish of the loan's term, the borrower must pay back the whole [principal](/principal) amount in a single lump sum. This approach to organizing a loan implies increased risk for the lender as a result of the possibility that the borrower will not have the option to think of the money to make that last principal payment. Therefore, a standing loan generally charges a higher interest rate than a traditional amortized loan, like a run of the mill home mortgage.

Standing loans are somewhat rare and will generally be utilized most frequently for home or automobile purchases. They are just one type of interest-only loan. More normal interest-only loans incorporate adjustable rate loans with a [balloon payment](/balloon-payment) toward the finish of a basic period or a 30-year mortgage that is interest-only for the first 10 years.

## Upsides and downsides of a Standing Loan

According to the borrower's viewpoint, a standing loan can be a method for getting into a home or buy a vehicle that the borrower could not in any case have the option to manage. The regularly scheduled payments will be lower than on a loan that requires the ordinary repayment of principal.

Assuming borrowers have motivation to accept that they will actually want to make that last principal payment, the standing loan structure permits them to invest that money elsewhere over the life of the loan. Furthermore, on the grounds that the interest payments on home mortgages are generally tax deductible up to certain IRS limits, on account of a [standing mortgage](/standing-mortgage) the borrower's whole payment could be tax deductible.

A standing loan can, notwithstanding, be a risky proposition for borrowers. There are a number of provisos to keep at the top of the priority list. First of all, standing loans are frequently offered with an adjustable interest rate. Adjustable rates might be appealing and appear to be affordable initially, however they can move from now on and lead to higher regularly scheduled payments that might be far off. A standing loan may likewise urge borrowers to buy more costly homes or cars than they can truly manage, particularly if an unexpected financial crisis, for example, a job loss, goes along.

Borrowers shouldn't consent to a standing loan except if they have strong motivation to accept that they will actually want to make the last principal payment. Consequently, borrowers are savvy to bring in certain the money they are not paying out as principal every month is being put to great use. The impulse to spend those savings instead of set them to the side for the future can cause a borrower problems down the line.

At long last, a home purchased with a standing loan may not appreciate as fast as the borrower anticipates. It may, truth be told, lose value, as many homes did in the 2008-2009 financial crisis. That means the borrower could be unable to refinance the loan or recover sufficient money from selling the home to make that last principal payment.
