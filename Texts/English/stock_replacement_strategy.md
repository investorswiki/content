# Stock Replacement Strategy
## What is a Stock Replacement Strategy?

Stock replacement is a trading strategy that substitutes deep in the money call options for outright shares of stock. The initial cost is lower yet the holder can partake in the gains of the underlying stock nearly dollar for dollar since the calls are almost +1.00 delta.

## How a Stock Replacement Strategy Works

An investor or trader who needs to utilize options to capture the equivalent, or better, gains in stocks while tying up less capital, will buy call option contracts that are [deep in the money.](/deepinthemoney) This means they will pay for an option contract that gains or loses value at a comparative rate to the equivalent value of stock shares.

The measurement of how closely an option's value tracks the value of the underlying shares is known as the delta value of the option. Option contracts with a value of 1.00 will follow the share price to the penny. Such options are typically something like at least four strikes deep in the money.

The fundamental goal of a stock replacement strategy is to take part in the gains of a stock with less overall cost. Since it utilizes less capital to start, the investor has the decision to either free up capital for hedging or different investments or to leverage a greater number of shares. Consequently, the investor has the decision to utilize the extra capital to either reduce risk or acknowledge more in anticipation of greater likely gain.

## Call Option Basics

Traders use options to gain exposure to the upside capability of the underlying assets for a fraction of the cost. Be that as it may, not all options act similarly. For a legitimate stock replacement strategy, the options really should have a high [delta](/delta) value. The options with the highest delta values are deep in the money, or have strike prices well below the current price of the underlying. They additionally will more often than not have more limited times to expiration.

The delta is a ratio looking at the change in the price of an asset to the comparing change in the price of its derivative. For instance, assuming a stock option has a delta value of 0.65, this means that if the underlying stock increases in price by $1 per share, the option on it will rise by $0.65 per share, all else being equivalent.

Accordingly, the higher the delta, the more the option will move in lockstep with the underlying stock. Obviously, a delta of 1.00, which isn't probable, would make the perfect stock replacement.

## Special Considerations

Traders likewise use options for their leverage. For instance, in a perfect world, an option with a delta of 1.00 priced at $10 would move higher by $1 in the event that its underlying stock, trading at $100, moves higher by $1. In this case, the stock took a 1% action however the option took a 10% action.

Keep as a main priority that consolidating leverage makes another set of risks, especially assuming that the underlying asset moves lower in price. The percentage losses can be large, even however losses are limited to the price paid for the actual options.

## Illustration of a Stock Replacement Strategy

Suppose a trader buys 100 shares of XYZ at $50 per share or $5,000 (commissions precluded). On the off chance that the stock climbed to $55 per share, the total value of the investment rises by $500 to $5,500. That is a 10% gain.

On the other hand, the trader can buy one deep in the money XYZ options contract with a strike price of $40 for $12. Since each contract controls 100 shares of stock, the value of the options contract toward the beginning is $1,200.

Assuming the delta of the option is .80, when the underlying stock climbs by $5, the option climbs by $4 to carry the value of the contract to $1,600 ($1,200 + ($4*100)). That is a gain of 33.3% or multiple times the return of claiming the stock itself.
