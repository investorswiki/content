## What Is a Soft Landing?

A soft landing, in economics, is a cyclical stoppage in economic growth that maintains a strategic distance from [recession](/recession). A soft landing is the goal of a central bank when it tries to raise interest rates sufficiently just to stop an economy from overheating and encountering high [inflation](/inflation), without causing a serious downturn. Soft landing may likewise allude to a progressive, moderately easy stoppage in a specific industry or economic sector.

## Seeing Soft Landings

While airline travelers can underestimate soft landings nowadays, the Federal Reserve's past interest-rate climbing cycles don't have a similar history of normal achievement.

The term "soft landing" acquired currency during the tenure of former Federal Reserve chair [Alan Greenspan](/alangreenspan), widely credited with engineering one out of 1994-1995. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell has additionally suggested the Fed accomplished soft landings in 1965 and 1984, and was on course for another in 2020 before the COVID-19 pandemic mediated.

Conversely, a recession followed the last five occurrences when inflation topped above 5%, in 1970, 1974, 1980, 1990 and 2008.

The Fed's soft landings record is, best case scenario, mixed on the grounds that the central bank doesn't exercise anywhere near a similar control throughout the span of the economy as a pilot has over aircraft. The Fed's fundamental policy devices, interest rates and asset holdings, are obtuse contrivances not intended to address supply chain disturbances or pandemics.

In excusing another vehicular similarity, former Fed chair [Ben Bernanke](/benbernanke) when said that "on the off chance that making monetary policy resembles driving a vehicle, the vehicle is one that has a temperamental speedometer, a hazy windshield, and a propensity to answer erratically and with a deferral to the accelerator or the brake." Nothing that is occurred since has made the Fed's job look any more straightforward.

## The Bottom Line

The Fed's endeavors to achieve a soft landing are confounded by the policy lags Bernanke and numerous others have noted. Since the economy carves out opportunity to answer changes in monetary policy, the Fed must determine the pace of rate hikes without the benefit of seeing the full effect of prior ones, or of its policy signaling.

For signaling to make a difference, the Fed's policy must be viewed as in some measure fairly unsurprising, restricting the central bank's flexibility in answering economic turns of events. Such imperatives mean karma actually assumes as big a part as expertise with regards to soft economic landings.
