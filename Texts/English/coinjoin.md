# CoinJoin
## What Is CoinJoin?

CoinJoin is an anonymization strategy that safeguards the privacy of Bitcoin users when they conduct transactions with one another, obscuring the sources and objections of BTC utilized in transactions.

CoinJoin requires multiple gatherings to jointly sign a digital [smart contract](/smart-contracts) to mix their coins in another Bitcoin transaction, where the output of the transaction leaves the participants with similar number of coins, yet the addresses have been mixed to make outer tracking troublesome.

The cycle is otherwise called coin mixing.

## How Does CoinJoin Work?

CoinJoin was developed to acquaint a layer of privacy with in any case public Bitcoin transactions. The phrase was coined by Bitcoin designer Gregory Maxwell in an announcement string on the Bitcoin Forum.

### Why Bitcoin Is Not Exactly Private

However Bitcoin in its initial days had gained notoriety for being anonymous as was utilized for transactions on darknet destinations like Silk Road, the [cryptocurrency](/cryptocurrency) really gives almost no privacy. Bitcoin addresses don't list users' names and addresses, however they are effectively traceable and somebody could possibly associate your IP address with your Bitcoin transaction.

When one client has been distinguished, scientists can utilize common digital forensic methods to trace every one of the contacts in the network. This isn't a bug of Bitcoin, it is the foundation of its "trustless" system: all transactions are public to forestall client fraud.

Different coins have been developed to integrate client privacy into the code of the coin. Monero, [ZCash](/zcash), and Dash are noticeable models. Monero's privacy technology is like CoinJoin, in that it utilizes ring signatures to mix the high-roller's signature with the signatures of different users to make following addresses almost unthinkable.

### CoinJoin Is the First-Generation Privacy Measure for Bitcoin

A client that needs to execute CoinJoin in their Bitcoin transaction requirements to find another client who likewise needs to mix coins, and together they start a joint transaction. The address a bitcoin is sent from is alluded to as an input.

Consider the accompanying transactions made simultaneously: A purchases a thing from B, C purchases a thing from D, and E purchases a thing from F. Without CoinJoin, the public [blockchain](/blockchain) ledger would record three separate transactions for each input-output match. With CoinJoin, just a single transaction is recorded. The ledger would show that bitcoins were paid from A, C, and E addresses to B, D, and F. By veiling the arrangements made by all gatherings, a spectator can't with full certainty figure out who sent bitcoins to whom.

## CoinJoin Tools

However the cycle appears to be clear in theory, in practice joining transactions is difficult in light of multiple factors. For the participants in the joining to stay anonymous, they need to associate over a Tor network, they need to know a lot about coding, and they need to trust one another.

To conquer these obstacles, CoinJoin designers began ahead of schedule to make devices that would make the interaction automatic for most users. The primary endeavors at a CoinJoin instrument were incorporated into wallets. The earliest models were Dark Wallet, JoinMarket, and SharedCoins. These platforms expected to give an extra level of data covering for users executing in Bitcoin.

Later efforts incorporate Wasabi Wallet and Whirlpool from Samourai Wallet. There is some contention, be that as it may, with respect to how trustworthy and secure these wallets are and how well they [anonymize](/data-anonymization) Bitcoin holdings.

## Features
- CoinJoin includes a multi-party Bitcoin transaction where all gatherings to the transaction put in and get out a similar amount of Bitcoin, yet the addresses are mixed in the transaction making the beginning of the coins hard to trace.
- CoinJoin is ordinarily performed automatically by dedicated services that carry it out. Playing out a CoinJoin without such a device is troublesome and requires advanced coding skills.
- CoinJoin is an interaction used to anonymize Bitcoin transactions online.
