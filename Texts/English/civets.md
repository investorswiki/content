## Analysis of Acronym Investing

Regardless, in spite of the fact that CIVETS are as commendable an investment apparatus as any, depending solely on [demographics](/demographics) to pursue investment choices will continuously be hazardous in light of the fact that demographics change; that is their temperament.
