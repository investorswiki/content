## What Is a Drawing Account?

A drawing account is an accounting record kept up with to follow money removed from a business by its owners. A drawing account is utilized principally for businesses that are taxed as [sole proprietorships](/soleproprietorship) or [partnerships](/partnership).

## How a Drawing Account Works

A drawing account is a [contra account](/contraaccount) to the owner's equity. The drawing account's debit balance is contrary to the expected credit balance of an owner's equity account since owner withdrawals address a reduction of the owner's equity in a business. In keeping with [double-entry](/twofold entry) bookkeeping, every [journal](/journal) entry requires both a debit and a credit. Since a cash withdrawal requires a credit to the cash account, an entry that debits the drawing account will have an offsetting credit to the cash account for a similar amount.

Since the drawing account tracks distributions to owners in a given year, it must be closed out toward the end of the year with a credit (addressing the total removed) and the balance is moved to the really owner's equity account with a debit. The drawing account is then re-opened and involved again the next year for tracking distributions. Since taxes on withdrawals are paid by the individual partners, there is no tax impact to the business associated with the removed funds.
