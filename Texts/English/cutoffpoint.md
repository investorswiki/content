# Cutoff Point
## What Is a Cutoff Point?

The cutoff point is the place where a [investor](/investor) concludes whether a specific security is worth purchasing. The cutoff point is extremely subjective and will be founded on the personal characteristics of the individual investor. A few instances of personal characteristics that might decide the cutoff point incorporate the investor's required rate of return and their [risk aversion](/riskaverse) level.

## Understanding a Cutoff Point

Since cutoff points are to a great extent subjective, they will change widely among investors. For instance, on the off chance that an investor has a lower [required rate of return](/requiredrateofreturn), they will probably pay something else for the equivalent [security](/security) than a person with a higher required rate of return. This converts into a higher cutoff point for the main investor.

A cutoff point may likewise be viewed as a decent "general guideline" while thinking about specific securities, as it might assist the investor with settling on more reliable investment choices. Understanding and setting their personal cutoff points while purchasing securities can assist investors with safeguarding their profits or limit their losses on the off chance that the price of the security falls.

## Cutoff Points and Stop-Loss Orders

Cutoff points are much of the time acted on by an investor by utilizing a [stop-loss order](/stop-lossorder). Except if a trader or investor has remarkable discipline, utilizing a stop-loss is the most straightforward method for acting on a severe cutoff point. An investor places a stop-loss order on a trade before they go into it.

In the event that the stock declines past this cutoff point, a stop-loss order trains the investor's broker to quickly sell. By utilizing a stop-loss, investors can limit their losses and be more disciplined in their trading methodology.

On the off chance that an investor keeps holding a stock on its way down without executing a stop-loss to uphold the cutoff point, the value could proceed to fall, and the pain could be extreme for that investor.

## Types of Stop-Loss Orders

The percentage an investor sets as their stop-loss is their effective cutoff point. There is more than one type of stop-loss order. A standard stop-loss is set as a percentage below the price paid for the stock. For instance, an investor might purchase a stock and place a stop-loss at 15% below the purchase price. In the event that the stock price falls 15%, the stop-loss will trigger and the stock will sell as a [market order](/marketorder).

A [trailing stop-loss](/trailingstop), on the other hand, is laid out against the previous day's closing price. The trailing stop can be communicated as a percentage of the stock's current price. Since trailing stops consequently conform to the current market price of a stock, they give the investor a method for locking in gains or limit a loss.

## Special Considerations

Investing specialists recommend setting a stop-loss percentage at 15% to 20%. Any less would make a stock be sold on impermanent dips. In the case of trading on more modest, more [volatile stocks](/unpredictability), a stop-loss is suggested to be set at 30% to 40%.

A few traders will set two trailing stop-losses. On the off chance that the stock hits the lower percentage stop-loss, it very well may be a warning, and a stop-loss could maybe be set to sell half a position. At the higher percentage stop-loss, such a strategy would [liquidate](/liquidate) the whole position.
