## What Is a Smart Beta ETF?

A smart Beta ETF is a type of [exchange-traded fund](/etf) (ETF) that utilizes a rules-based system for choosing investments to be remembered for the fund portfolio. An exchange-traded fund or ETF is a type of fund that tracks an index, for example, the [S&P 500](/sp500). Smart beta ETFs build on traditional ETFs and designer the components of the fund's holdings based on foreordained financial metrics.

## Figuring out Smart Beta ETFs

The rules administering what stocks make up exchange-traded funds differ contingent upon the rules laid out at the fund's beginning. Likewise, there are various weightings for each stock in a fund. [Weighting](/weighted) means a fund could have more shares of one stock versus one more based on an underlying perspective like value. A few ETFs could follow a stock index that contains just bank stocks, large companies, or technology stocks.

Market-cap weighting is quite possibly of the most common method in choosing the number of shares of a company's that's stock comprise an index or fund. A market-cap weighting means that a company is picked based on its market capitalization or its share price duplicated by the number of outstanding shares. A company that has many shares outstanding, and whose stock has risen essentially, will have a huge weighting in a market-cap index.

Smart Beta doesn't utilize the average cap-weighted index strategy. All things being equal, it considers granular factors that are specific to a particular company or industry. A smart Beta ETF could pick companies that main display certain behaviors or metrics. These metrics incorporate factors like earnings growth, the momentum of a stock — the degree a stock maneuvers up or down — or profitability. Every ETF has its own rules that are part of an overall systematic approach to picking stocks to be remembered for the fund.

## Types of Smart Beta ETFs

A smart Beta ETF could screen and pick its holdings based on a company's dividend growth. [Dividends](/dividend) are distributions paid to shareholders from the company's earnings as a reward for investing in the company. Companies that pay dividends will quite often be large, deep rooted, and profitable companies.

Risk-weighted approaches consider expected volatility in stocks. Funds could limit the holdings to stocks with low [volatility](/volatility) to reduce risk in the fund. Volatility is a measure of how much a security's price varies, or to the degree, it does or doesn't vacillate in price. Conversely, a few investors welcome risk and should invest in a fund that spotlights on companies that have high-growth potential.

In spite of the fact that there are many types of Smart Beta ETF strategies, a couple of the most common include:

- Similarly weighted: Instead of weighting the fund based on stock price and market capitalization, this strategy similarly loads the factors and each holding.
- Fundamentally weighted: Companies are chosen and weighted by such factors as total earnings, profits, revenue, or financially driven fundamentals and metrics.
- Factor-based: Stocks are weighted based on specific factors, for example, balance sheet components, underpriced valuations, or smaller companies that are developing.
- Low volatility: This method centers around stocks and indexes with low volatility or small price changes over a historical period.

## Passive and Active Management

Smart Beta ETFs utilize a combination of both passive and active methods of investing. Active investing is much the same as having a [investment manager](/investment-manager) pick stocks to remember for a portfolio. An actively-managed fund buys and sells stocks depending on the situation based on different fundamental metrics like earnings or financial ratios.

A fund is passive since it tracks an index without having an investment manager picking the stocks. Passive funds will more often than not have lower fees accordingly. For instance, a fund could follow every one of the stocks in the S&P 500 with the goal that it copies or tracks each move precisely as the S&P.

Smart Beta is a blend of active and passive investing. It follows an index making it passive, yet it additionally considers alternative factors in picking the stocks or investments from inside the index. As such, a smart beta fund that tracks the S&P 500 index wouldn't choose each stock on the index. All things considered, it could choose just the ones that show a specific behavior, for example, a certain percentage amount of revenue growth.

## Benefits Associated With Smart Beta ETFs

Many smart Beta ETFs are intended to increase portfolio returns, boost dividends, and lower portfolio risks.

Some could contend that one of the benefits of Smart Beta strategies is the utilization of similarly weighted indexing. This boundary eliminates the accentuation on stocks in the index with the largest market-cap weightings. With market-cap weightings, if the largest stocks or holdings [underperform](/underperform), they will sizably affect the performance of the index relative to the smallest components of the index.

Smart beta is certainly not a passive strategy like the traditional market capitalization-weighted index funds. While many Smart Beta ETFs have higher expense ratios than passive index products, they are more affordable than most actively managed funds.

Smart Beta ETFs are great for investors wanting to boost their income and returns while likewise allowing for the possibility to limit risk.

## Risks Associated With Smart Beta ETFs

Smart Beta ETFs are as yet a relatively new method of investing and can display low trading volumes. Low trading volume or liquidity can bring about investors not having the option to effortlessly sell or exit their positions.

Trading costs can be high to restore the original index weighting. This increase in price comes from the fund purchasing stocks from the index that will be remembered for the fund. Thus, the fees charged for smart Beta may be lower than actively managed funds, however the savings probably won't be critical.

Smart Beta ETFs can underperform traditional indexes, for example, the [S&P 500](/sp500) since they should be constantly straightened out to the indexes. As such, holdings are added and sold based on the rules of the fund. Since smart Beta ETFs have such countless variables to consider, trading them can be more troublesome than trading with traditional indexes. Thus, the prices of smart Beta ETFs can differ from the fund's underlying value.
