# Domestic Production Activities Deduction
## What Is the Domestic Production Activities Deduction?

Passed by Congress in 2004, the domestic production activities deduction was expected to offer tax relief for businesses that produce the majority of their goods or work inside the U.S. instead of overseas. This deduction is as of now not being used as it was replaced in 2017 by the qualified business income deduction that was presented by means of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) of 2017.

## Figuring out the Domestic Production Activities Deduction

Otherwise called the Section 199 [deduction](/deduction), the domestic production activities deduction was in effect from 2005 through 2017. This deduction applied to both small and large businesses that manufactured, developed, extracted, delivered, developed, or further developed goods inside the U.S. Utilizing Form 8903, qualifying companies had the option to claim the domestic production activities deduction in light of a complex formula and set of rules.

## Domestic Production Activities Deduction versus the Qualified Business Income Deduction

At the point when the legislation known as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 was enacted on Dec. 22, 2017, the Section 199 domestic production activities deduction was at this point not available. In its place, Congress made the Section 199A deduction (note the "A"), otherwise called the qualified business income deduction, which as of now not just applies to domestic manufacturing companies.

The recently passed qualified business income deduction likewise permits owners of [sole proprietorships](/soleproprietorship), [S corporations](/subchapters), or partnerships to deduct up to 20% of qualified business income earned in a qualified trade or business, subject to limitations. The motivation of this deduction is to permit this category of business owners to keep pace with the huge corporate tax deductions likewise given by the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017.

While the purpose of the new Section 199A qualified business income deduction is clear, its statutory construction and legislative text are to some degree uncertain. Therefore, this deduction has made more than adequate contention since its enactment. At the point when it was enacted, many tax advisers anticipated that until additional guidance is issued, the vulnerability encompassing the provision could lead to endless debates among taxpayers and the IRS.

This more current rendition of the deduction is closely connected with the deduction for [Qualified Production Activities Income](/qualified-production-activities-income) (QPAI), which is the portion of income derived from domestic manufacturing and production that meets all requirements for diminished taxation. All the more explicitly, qualified production activities income is the difference between the manufacturer's domestic gross receipts and the aggregate cost of goods and services connected with creating domestic goods. The tax-deductibility of QPAI is expected to reward manufacturers for creating goods domestically rather than overseas.
