# Dual-Purpose Fund
## What Is a Dual-Purpose Fund?

A dual-purpose fund is a [closed-end fund](/closed-endinvestment) that holds both common shares and preferred stock shares. Investors in such funds look for the best of the two universes:

- Common stock shares are generally picked by investors seeking growth in the value of their shares after some time. They could conceivably pay dividends to their shareholders.
- Preferred shares are for investors who need the standard dividend payments that these shares guarantee. This type of stock normally holds its value yet doesn't increase a lot of in price.

Dual-purpose funds become undesirable in the late 1980s when tax rules made them unattractive compared to different types of funds.

## Understanding Dual-Purpose Funds

Dual-purpose funds could all the more precisely be called parted purpose funds. Most stock investors center either around price growth or customary income. They are either risk-lenient or risk-unwilling. An investor can be some place in the middle, however it's not possible for anyone to be both simultaneously. Dual-purpose funds attempted to serve the two objectives immediately.

Dual-purpose funds were famous in the late 1970s and mid 1980s. The present investors have a lot more extensive scope of [mutual funds](/mutualfund), [exchange-traded funds](/etf) (ETFs), and other investment options to browse.

There are as yet many closed-end funds. These, by definition, are issued in a fixed number of shares that are set to lapse at a fixed date.

## How a Closed-End Fund Works

Closed-end funds, similar to ETFs, have ticker images and trade over the course of the day on a public exchange.

In most different regards, they are like mutual funds from the perspective of the investor. They sell shares in a portfolio of securities run by an active manager. Most are intended to take advantage of opportunities in specific industry sectors, districts, or markets. Most can be described by their investment style and the degree of risk they endure, from conservative to exceptionally aggressive. They additionally charge an annual [expense ratio](/expenseratio) and make income and capital gain distributions to their [shareholders](/shareholder).

## Open-End versus Closed-End Mutual Funds

Nonetheless, [open-end](/open-endfund) mutual funds, by a long shot the most common type, price just a single time toward the day's end. Closed-end funds trade over the course of the day. Moreover, closed-end funds require a brokerage account to buy and sell, not at all like most open-end funds.

The stock prices of all closed-end funds vary in light of supply and demand for the fund itself, as well as the changing values of the fund holdings. Exchanges distribute the [net asset value](/nav) (NAV) of the funds routinely. Notwithstanding, closed-end funds frequently trade at a premium or a discount to NAV. The reputation of the fund's manager as a stockpicker and the prevalence of the underlying holdings assist with deciding this discount or premium.

A downside to closed-end funds is that they can be decently illiquid. That is, their shares probably won't be accessible in that frame of mind to guarantee that a seller can escape the investment rapidly without the risk of a substantial loss.

One of the biggest and most liquid closed-end funds is the Eaton Vance Tax-Managed Global Diversified Equity Income Fund.

## Dual-Purpose Funds versus STRIPS

The common shares of dual-income funds have a parallel in the fixed income investment known as [Treasury STRIPS.](/treasurystrips) These zero-coupon bonds separate the bond's coupons from the bond or note. An investor's return depends on the difference between the purchase price and the bond's trading value, or face value assuming it is held to maturity. In this way, income doesn't matter to return.

Likewise, common shares of dual-income funds strip out the income portion of the return. This payment stream is sold separately and is gotten to by buying the preferred shares.
