## What is a Gulf Opportunity Zone

The Gulf Opportunity Zone is the area that was largely [impacted](/windstorm-protection) by the tempests encompassing Hurricane Katrina in 2005. This remembers areas for Alabama, Louisiana and Mississippi.

## BREAKING DOWN Gulf Opportunity Zone

The Gulf Opportunity Zone is an area that is eligible for [credits](/taxcredit), deductions and incentives given by the proclaiming of a disaster area in the areas that were hit hardest by the catastrophic 2005 hurricane season. The properties in this zone must meet certain capabilities to receive these deductions and credits. Some business types, for example, rub parlors and liquor stores, and property types, for example, fairways, might be excluded from any credits. Likewise, any property that can be eliminated from the area won't qualify. Certain services, for example, anything connected with remediation from the tempest damages, may likewise qualify.

The purpose of the deduction was to animate the economy that deteriorated after the disaster. At the point when Hurricane Katrina hit the gulf coast toward the finish of August in 2005, numerous residential and commercial areas were hit hard. Due to the faltering of levees in New Orleans, a large portion of the city was lowered under flood waters. A gigantic loss of life and property happened during the tempest, and the name Katrina was retired from the named hurricane list.

## What is a Hurricane

Hurricanes are typhoons that create out at sea. When a typhoon's supported breezes arrive at a certain speed they are moved up to tropical depressions. Assuming that the breeze speeds increase further, they become tropical depressions. When a tropical depression arrives at a supported breeze speed of 74 miles each hour, it turns into a hurricane. The World Meteorological Organization keeps a rotating rundown of names, and when a typhoon arrives at hurricane strength, it gets named. These named hurricanes can happen from one side of the planet to the other, yet they most generally foster in the Atlantic Ocean and impact the gulf coast or southern United States. While it is unusual for a hurricane to venture up into the northern states, it isn't incomprehensible. In recent years, many named storms have made landfall in the northeastern United States, remembering the record-breaking Super Storm Sandy for 2012.

Every hurricane is positioned on a scale from one to five, with one being the mildest and five being the most serious. These rankings have more to do with wind speeds and less to cause with harm, as a few low-level tempests have incurred just as much destruction and fiscal loss as their higher category partners.

In 2017, the United States saw many named storms that brought about catastrophic loss of life and property. Hurricanes Maria and Harvey were particularly harming, and a portion of the death tolls were all the while being adjusted nearly 12 months after they happened as new data opened up.
