# Kappa
## What Is Kappa?

Kappa is the measurement of an option agreement's price sensitivity to changes in the volatility of the [underlying asset](/underlying-asset). Volatility accounts for recent changes in price, historical changes in price, and future price moves. For a trading instrument, similar to a [option](/option), volatility is expected to capture the amount and speed at which the price goes all over.

## Figuring out Kappa

Kappa, likewise called vega, is one of the four primary Greek risk measures, so-named after the Greek letters that mean them. Since vega isn't really a Greek letter, (the "v" in vega means "volatility" just as the "t" in "theta" means "time") it is once in a while alluded to as kappa.

The prices of options contracts are influenced by a number of various factors. The option Greeks are four different ways of measuring factors that influence the price of options; traders utilize these measures while examining options. This set of risk measures — kappa, [theta](/theta), [gamma](/gamma), [delta](/delta) — shows how sensitive an option is to time-esteem decay, changes in implied volatility, and developments in the price of its underlying security.

Kappa measures risk by computing the amount that an option agreement's price changes in reaction to a 1% change in the [implied volatility](/iv) of the underlying asset. Kappa is higher the further away an option's expiration date is. Kappa falls as the expiration date approaches on the grounds that the price of an option turns out to be more sensitive to the price volatility of the underlying asset as its expiration date draws nearer. (Options that are terminating quickly have negative kappa.) This is on the grounds that options that are lapsing in the future have greater premiums assigned to them than those options that lapse right away.

At the point when there are large price developments (that show volatility) in the underlying asset, kappa changes. Kappa falls as the option draws nearer to its expiration date. Kappa measures the price change for every percentage point change in implied volatility. Implied volatility is a forecast; it might change from the real future volatility. Implied volatility is calculated utilizing a [model](/optionpricingtheory) that figures out what the current market prices are assessing an underlying asset's future volatility will be.

Kappa can be calculated for individual options, as well as an options portfolio. At the point when not entirely settled for an options portfolio, it is alluded to as net kappa. Net not entirely settled by adding up the kappas of every individual position.

The other three options Greek are delta, gamma, and theta. Delta measures the impact of a change in the underlying asset's price. The ratio compares the change in the price of an asset, normally marketable securities, to the relating change in the price of its derivative. Gamma measures the rate of change of delta; it is the rate of change in an option's delta for every 1-point move in the underlying asset's price. Theta measures the impact on the price over the long haul (its time decay).
