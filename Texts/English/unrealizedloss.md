An investor might like to let a loss go unrealized in the hope that the asset will eventually recover in price, in this manner basically breaking even or posting a marginal profit. For tax purposes, a loss should be realized before balancing capital gains can be utilized.

[Unrealized gains](/unrealizedgain) and losses can be contrasted with [realized](/realizedloss) gains and losses.

## Grasping Unrealized Losses

An unrealized loss originates from a decline in value on a transaction that has not yet been completed. The entity or investor wouldn't bring about the loss except if they decided to close the deal or transaction while it is still in this state. For example, while the shares in the above model stay unsold, the loss makes not taken difference. It is solely after the assets are moved does that loss become validated. Waiting for the investment to recoup those declines could bring about the unrealized loss being deleted, or becoming a profit.

An unrealized loss can be calculated for a while. This might span from the date the assets were acquired to their latest market value. An unrealized loss can likewise be calculated for specific periods to compare when the shares saw declines that brought their value below a prior valuation.

The decision to sell an unprofitable asset, which transforms an unrealized loss into a realized loss, might be a decision to prevent continued erosion of the [shareholder's](/shareholder) overall [portfolio](/portfolio). Such a decision may be made in the event that there is no perceived possibility of the shares recovering.

On the off chance that a portfolio is more diversified, this might moderate the impact in the event that the unrealized gains from different assets surpass the accumulated unrealized losses.

This type of increase happens when an investor clutches a triumphant investment, for example, a stock that has ascended in value since the position was opened. Like an unrealized loss, a gain just becomes realized once the position is closed for a profit.

## Unrealized Losses in Accounting

While unrealized losses are hypothetical, they might be subject to various types of treatment relying upon the type of security. Securities that are held to maturity affect a firm's finances and are, in this manner, not recorded in its financial statements. The firm might choose to incorporate a commentary referencing them in the statements. Trading securities, be that as it may, are recorded in a balance sheet or income statement at their [fair value](/fairvalue). This is essentially on the grounds that their value can increase or diminish a firm's profits or losses. Consequently, unrealized losses can straightforwardly affect a firm's earnings for every share. Yet, their effect on a firm's cash flow is neutral. Securities that are ready to move are likewise recorded in a firm's financial statement at fair value as assets.

### Tax Consequences

A capital loss can likewise be utilized to reduce the tax burden of future capital gains. Even on the off chance that you don't have capital gains, you can utilize a capital loss to offset ordinary income up to the allowed amount.

If the stock accordingly [rallies](/rally) to $8, at which point the investor sells it, the [realized loss](/realizedloss) would be $2,000.

For tax purposes, the unrealized loss of $4,000 is of minimal immediate significance, since it is only a "paper" or hypothetical loss; what makes a difference is the realized loss of $2,000.
