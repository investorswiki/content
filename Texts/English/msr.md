## Instance of Selling a MSR

Sarah takes out a $500,000 mortgage from Lender A. She sends the lender a regularly scheduled payment of principal and interest. After three years Lender A chooses to transfer its MSR on Sarah's mortgage to Company B. All under the terms of the contract, Company B is paid a fee by Lender A for [processing](/loan_servicing) Sarah's excess mortgage payments. The mortgage lender can then spend additional time and money giving new mortgages while the company expecting the MSR forwards the mortgage payments to the lender.

## Special Considerations

A lender will frequently sell MSRs for the purpose of opening up lines of credit for lending money to extra borrowers. The majority of mortgages are in effect for 15 to 30 years, and the bank needs billions of dollars to loan money to different consumers mentioning mortgages during this time. Indirectly, selling MSRs means that more individuals can become homeowners, in light of the fact that the sale of these rights produces revenue.

Lenders additionally bring in money by charging fees for [originating mortgages](/mortgage_originator) and earning month to month interest from payments. Mortgages are essentially extra assets that acquire more revenue for banks.

## History of MSRs

The market for MSRs was strong in recent years due to a further developing economy, higher quality mortgage beginnings, and less defaults. Hedge funds, banks, and [real estate investment trusts](/reit) (REITs) find these assets appealing in light of the fact that MSRs can yield high amounts of interest. For instance, SunTrust purchased $8 billion in MSRs in the primary quarter of 2016 for the purpose of earning a strong [return on investment](/returnoninvestment) (ROI), and inside the space of months its MSR portfolio contained $1.123 billion in unpaid principal balances of loans that the bank was servicing for lenders.

National Mortgage News reported in June 2019 that MSRs "have been one of the most mind-blowing performing fixed-income asset classes throughout the course of recent years." However, it likewise reported that "since October 2018, as medium-and long-term interest rates have fallen, projected and genuine [mortgage prepayment](/prepayment) suspicions have accelerated, making the expected average life of MSRs abbreviate extensively." This has brought about the way that "MSR values from April to May were down reliably (by a half) various." That said, reports National Mortgage News, "the demand from MSR purchasers is still exceptionally strong, and there is general consensus around MSR values."
