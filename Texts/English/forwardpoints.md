# Forward Points
## What are Forward Points?

In currency trading, forward points are the number of [basis points](/basispoint) added to or deducted from the current [spot rate](/spot_rate) of a currency pair to decide the forward rate for delivery on a specific value date. Whenever points are added to the spot rate this is called a forward premium; when points are deducted from the spot rate it is a forward discount. The [forward rate](/forwardrate) depends on the difference between the interest rates of the two currencies (currency deals always include two currencies) and the time until the maturity of the deal.

Forward points are otherwise called the [forward spread](/forward-spread).

Basis points can be either added or detracted from the spot rate. Assuming they are added, they are forward points. Whenever deducted, they are discount points.

## The Basics of Forward Points

Forward points are utilized to work out the price for both an outright [forward contract](/forwardcontract) and a [foreign currency swap](/foreign-currency-swaps). Points can be calculated and transactions executed for any date that is a substantial business day in the two currencies. The most regularly traded forward currencies are the U.S. dollar, the euro, Japanese yen, British pound and Swiss franc.

Forwards are most normally finished for periods of as long as one year. Prices for farther dates are accessible, yet [liquidity](/liquidity) is by and large lower. In an outright forward foreign exchange contract, one currency is bought against one more for delivery on any date past spot. The price is the spot rate plus or minus the forward points to the value date. No money changes hands until the [value date](/valuedate).

In a foreign exchange swap, a currency is bought for the close to date (generally spot) against another currency, and a similar amount is sold back for the forward date. The rate for the forward leg of the swap is the close to date rate plus or minus the forward points to the far date. Money changes hands on both value dates.

### Discount Spreads

As opposed to the forward spread, a [discount spread](/discount-spread) is the currency forward points that are deducted from the spot rate, to get a forward rate for a currency. In the currency markets, forward spreads, or points, are introduced as two-way cites; that is, they have a bid price and an offer price. In a discount spread, the bid price will be higher than the offer price, while in a premium spread, the bid price will be lower than the offer price.

## Instances of Forward Points

Forward points are many times quoted in numbers, for example, +13.2 or minus - 270.68. These address 1/10,000, so +13.2 implies 0.00132 when added to a currency spot price.

For instance, in the event that the euro can be bought versus the dollar at the rate of 1.1350 for spot, and the forward points are +13.2, the forward rate is 1.13632 (or 1.1350 + 0.00132).

Just in light of this data we can verify that the interest rate in the US is higher than in the Eurozone. The positive forward points while buying the EUR/USD let us know that the rate goes up the farther into the future we go. This is on the grounds that the forward points make up for the difference in interest rates between the two currencies.

Considering it an alternate way in the event that the euro interest rate is 1% and the U.S. interest rate is 2%, you could have the 1% effect by holding U.S. dollars rather than euros. So while trading or securing in currency exchange rates for the future (forward rate) this should be considered in.
