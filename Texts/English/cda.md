# Capital Dividend Account (CDA)
## What Is a Capital Dividend Account (CDA)?

The capital dividend account (CDA) is a special corporate tax account that gives shareholders designated capital dividends, tax-free. This account is normally utilized in Canada and isn't kept in the corporation's taxable accounting passages or financial statements.

## Understanding Capital Dividend Accounts (CDA)

A [capital dividend](/capital-dividend) is a type of payment a firm makes to its shareholders. The payment is taken out from [paid-in capital](/paidincapital), and not from the company's [retained earnings](/retainedearnings) similarly as with normal dividends. At the point when capital dividends are paid out to shareholders, these are not taxable in light of the fact that the dividends are seen as a return of the capital that investors pay in.

At the point when a company generates a [capital gain](/capitalgain) from the sale or disposal of an asset, half of the gain is subject to a [capital gains tax](/capital_gains_tax). The non-taxable portion of the total gain realized by the company is added to the capital dividend account (CDA). The capital dividend account is part of a tax provision whose goal it is to empower tax-free money received by a company to be given to its shareholders, tax-free. Accordingly, shareholders are not required to pay taxes on these distributions. However long the company has this notional account, they can assign a suitable amount of dividends as a capital dividend.

The balance in the CDA increases by half of any capital gains a company makes and diminishes by half of any [capital losses](/capitalloss) incurred by the company. A business' CDA likewise increases when different companies pay capital dividends to the business. A company that gets [life insurance](/lifeinsurance) proceeds in excess of the [cost basis](/costbasis) of the life insurance, will have the excess amount added to the CDA balance. In conclusion, certain distributions made by a [trust](/trust) to a corporation toward the finish of the trust's taxation year increase the balance in a firm's capital dividend account.

A capital dividend must be declared in the event that the CDA balance is positive. A company that pays dividends to shareholders in an amount that is more than whatever is accessible in the CDA will be subject to a precarious tax penalty of 60% of the excess dividend. The CDA balance isn't found in a business' financial statements however might be reported in the [notes to financial statements](/reference) for information purposes as it were.

The capital dividend account is all the more generally utilized in Canada. A shareholder who is a [non-resident](/nonresident) of Canada must pay a 25% flat [withholding tax](/withholdingtax) on any capital dividends received. The withholding tax rate might be diminished in the event that the dividend is paid to a their shareholder residence in a country that has a [tax treaty](/taxtreaty) with Canada. For instance, a U.S. shareholder who gets a capital dividend from a Canadian corporation will be subject to a withholding tax of just 5% (25% minus 20% U.S. tax owed on [qualified dividends](/qualifieddividend)). What's more, non-resident investors would probably be taxed under the tax laws of their country of residence.
