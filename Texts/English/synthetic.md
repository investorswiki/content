## What Is Synthetic?

Synthetic is the term given to financial instruments that are designed to mimic different instruments while modifying key characteristics, similar to duration and cash flow.

## Figuring out Synthetic

Frequently synthetics will offer investors tailored cash flow designs, maturities, risk profiles, etc. Synthetic products are structured to suit the necessities of the investor. There are a wide range of explanations for the creation of synthetic positions:

- A trader might decide to make a synthetic short position utilizing options since it is more straightforward than borrowing stock and selling it short. This likewise applies to long positions, as traders can imitate a long position in a stock utilizing options without having to spread out the capital to purchase the stock actually.

For instance, you can make a synthetic option position by purchasing a [call option](/calloption) and all the while selling ([writing](/composing an-option)) a put option on a similar stock. In the event that the two options have the equivalent [strike price](/strikeprice), suppose $45, this strategy would have a similar outcome as purchasing the underlying security at $45 when the options terminate or are exercised. The call option gives the buyer the right to purchase the underlying security at the strike, and the [put option](/putoption) commits the seller to purchase the underlying security from the put buyer.

Assuming that the market price of the underlying security increments over the strike price, the call buyer will exercise their option to purchase the security at $45, understanding the profit. Then again, assuming that the price falls below the strike, the put buyer will exercise their right to sell to the put seller who is committed to buy the underlying security at $45. So the synthetic option position would have a similar destiny as a true investment in the stock, however without the capital outlay. This is, of course, a bullish trade; the bearish trade is finished by switching the two options (selling a call and buying a put).

Various highlights can be added to the convertible bond to improve the offer. A few convertible bonds offer principal protection. Other convertible bonds offer increased income in exchange for a lower conversion factor. These elements act as incentives for bondholders.
