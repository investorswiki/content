Basically, a weak dollar means that a U.S. dollar can be traded for more modest measures of foreign currency. The effect of this is that goods priced in U.S. dollars, as well as goods created in non-US countries, become more costly to U.S. consumers.

Thusly, the bond market energized, which pushed interest rates in the U.S. to record lows. As interest rates fell, the U.S. dollar weakened substantially. Over a period of two years (mid-2009 to mid-2011) the U.S. dollar index ([USDX](/usdx)) fell 17 percent.

In any case, after four years as the Fed left on lifting interest without precedent for eight years, the situation of the dollar turned and it strengthened to make a very long term high. In December 2016, when the Fed moved interest rates to 0.25 percent, the USDX traded at 100 interestingly beginning around 2003.

All the more fundamentally, a weak U.S. dollar can effectively reduce the nation's trade deficit. At the point when U.S. exports become more competitive on the foreign market, then U.S. producers redirect more resources to creating those things foreign purchasers need from the U.S. Be that as it may, policy producers and business leaders have no consensus on what course, a weaker or stronger currency, is best to seek after. The weak-dollar banter has turned into a political consistent in the 21st century.
