## What Is Trade Resumption?

Trade resumption normally alludes to the initiation of trading activities after they have been closed down or [halted](/tradinghalt) for some period of time, yet may likewise allude to the resumption of trade between nations.

## Grasping Trade Resumption

Trade resumption is a term used to signal the resumption of open-market trading in a security like a common stock or even a whole exchange. Trade resumption happens after circumstances while security trading is halted due to material information that necessities time to disperse, or fundamental inquiries that have been raised about the reliability of recently delivered information. Frequently, a trading halt happens as a result of the anticipation of a news announcement, to address a [order imbalance](/order-imbalance), or for other regulatory reasons.

As per the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority ([FINRA](/finra)), while a trading halt is put into place, the listing exchange cautions the market that trading is suspended for that specific stock, and different markets trading in it likewise need to follow the halt. While it's in effect, brokers are disallowed from trading the stock and from distributing [quotations](/citation) and [indications of interest](/ioi).

When the suspension closes, trade resumption happens. Nonetheless, as FINRA makes sense of: "the finish of a trading suspension doesn't mean that citing and trading naturally start again for [OTC](/otc) stocks. All things considered, certain requirements in [SEC](/sec) Rule 15c2-11 must be met."

A broker must likewise file a form with FINRA that should be approved before citing can resume. As indicated by FINRA:

>
> "The broker can file the form after it gets and audits current information about the company, including: the company's organization, operations and certain control subsidiaries; the title and class of securities outstanding and being traded; and the company's latest balance sheet and profit and loss and retained earnings statement."
>
>
> "The broker filing the form must have a reasonable basis for accepting the information is accurate and that it comes from solid sources. A broker generally can't quote the stock or request or prescribe the stock to any investor until the form is approved. After endorsement, the broker can start citing â€” and different brokers may likewise quote the stock depending, or 'piggybacking,' on the main broker's quote without filing the form or auditing the company information all alone."

FINRA notes that the SEC has a limited ability to proceed with suspensions, so a trade resumption "doesn't mean that the SEC's interests have been tended to and never again apply. Investors should be careful before purchasing a stock after a SEC trading suspension has ended."
