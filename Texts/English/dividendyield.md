## What Is Dividend Yield?
Dividend yield is the percentage of a company's current stock price that they pay to their stockholders (per share) in dividends every year. All in all, it is the ratio of dividends paid to stock price.
Since stock price fills in as the divisor in this measurement, and stock price changes continually, dividend yield is dynamic — it changes constantly. As a stock's price goes up, its dividend yield goes down, and as a stock's price goes down, its dividend yield goes up.
## How Is Dividend Yield Calculated?
Dividend yield is calculated by adding up the total [dividends](/dividend) a company paid per share throughout the span of the last year, then, at that point, partitioning this sum by its current stock price. The subsequent number is a decimal that is ordinarily communicated as a percentage.

### Dividend Yield Formula
> DY = All Dividends Paid in the Last Year/Current Stock Price

### Dividend Yield Example: AT&T (NYSE: T)
Throughout the span of 2020, AT&T paid dividends of $0.52 to its shareholders quarterly. This means that altogether, they paid $2.08 per share that year. As of December 31st, 2020, AT&T's stock closed at $28.76. So what was AT&T's dividend yield as of December 31st, 2020?
> Dividend Yield = Dividends Paid Over Last Year/Stock Price
>
> DY = (0.52 * 4)/28.76
>
> DY = 2.08/28.76
>
> DY = 0.072
>
> DY = 7.2%
