# Fixed-for-Floating Swap
## What Is a Fixed-for-Floating Swap?

A fixed-for-floating swap is a contractual arrangement between two gatherings wherein one party swaps the interest cash flows of [fixed-rate loan(s)](/fixedinterestrate) with those of [floating-rate loan(s)](/floatinginterestrate) held by another party. The principal of the underlying loans isn't exchanged.

## Understanding Fixed-for-Floating Swap

There are a couple of principal inspirations for a loan holder to execute a fixed-for-floating swap:

- Reduce interest expense by swapping for a floating rate on the off chance that it is lower than the fixed-rate as of now being paid;
- Better match assets and liabilities that are sensitive to interest rate developments;
- Enhance risks in a total loan portfolio by trading a portion of a fixed rate to floating rate; as well as
- Perform a financial hedge with an expectation that market interest rates will decline.

## Illustration of a Fixed-for-Floating Swap

Assume Company X conveys a $100 million loan at a fixed rate of 6.5%. Company X expects that the overall heading of interest rates over the close or middle of the road term is down. Company Y, carrying a $100 million loan at [London Interbank Offered Rate](/libor) (LIBOR) + 3.50% (floating rate loan), has the contrary view; it accepts interest rates are on the rise. Company X and Company Y wish to swap. With the fixed-for-floating swap Company X will pay the floating rate, and subsequently benefit on the off chance that interest rates drop, and Company Y will expect payments for the fixed-rate loan. Company Y will remain to benefit assuming that interest rates rise. Swap transactions are worked with by a [swap dealer](/swap-dealer), who will act as the required [counterparty](/counterparty) for a fee.

## Features

- Doing the swap reduces interest expense by swapping for a floating rate on the off chance that it is lower than the fixed-rate at present being paid.
