# Market Discipline
## What Is Market Discipline?

Market discipline is the onus on banks, [financial institutions](/financialinstitution), sovereigns, and other major parts in the financial industry to conduct business while considering the risks to their [stakeholders](/partner). Market discipline is a market-based promotion of the transparency and [disclosure](/disclosure) of the risks associated with a business or entity. It works working together with regulatory systems to increase the safety and sufficiency of the market.

Without direct government intervention in a free market economy, market discipline gives both internal and outside governance components.

## Understanding Market Discipline

Through the support of disclosures and clear [financial reporting](/financial-proclamations) systems, market discipline increases the data accessible to the public and empowers the release of convenient data on an organization's assets, liabilities, income, net profit or loss, cash flows, and other financial data. Likewise, qualitative data encompassing an organization's objectives, management, and any legal tensions additionally turns out to be all the more promptly accessible. This data decreases uncertainty, increase accountability, and advance the function of the market as an exchange among lenders and borrowers.

For market discipline to work really, market participants must have the data, the means, and, above all, the incentives to monitor and influence banks. Government interventions in the private market to bail out large financial institutions have altogether reduced the long-term incentives to monitor and discipline these banks.

An illustration of market discipline is public support for raising [capital requirements](/capitalrequirement). Banks and other depository institutions must have [liquidity](/liquidity) for a certain level of assets. While regulatory agencies like the [Bank for International Settlements](/bis), the [Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation](/fdic) (FDIC), or the [Federal Reserve Board](/frb) set standards for capital requirements, market discipline pushes banks to uphold and even grow them. Thusly, this can increase the public's confidence in their banks.

## Market Discipline and Lessons From the 2008 Financial Crisis

The 2007-08 financial crisis was a credit crunch that went wild, due to uncertainty encompassing securitized loans and [mortgage-backed securities](/mbs) (MBS). These loans had structural defects, including a lack of legitimate vetting of lenders and that's what teaser rates, by and large, guaranteed default. [Rating agencies](/bond-rating-agencies) like Moody's Investors Service and Fitch Ratings were liberal in giving strong ratings to low quality products. Those that developed the products didn't as expected price in their risks. At the point when the requirement for liquid capital was high inside the global financial system, this mortgage meltdown froze the economy. The situation was desperate to such an extent that the Federal Reserve needed to pump billions into the system to save it; even then, the United States ended up in [the Great Recession](/great-recession).

From that point forward, new market discipline systems have flourished, including enhanced reporting measures, reviews, better internal governance (counting a different mix of independent board individuals), higher collateral and margin requirements, and more extreme supervisory actions.
