# Accreting Principal Swap
## What Is an Accreting Principal Swap?

An accreting principal swap is a [derivative](/derivative) contract in which two [counterparties](/counterparty) consent to exchange [cash flows](/cashflow) â€” typically a fixed rate for a variable rate, likewise with most other types of interest rate or cross-currency swap contracts. Nonetheless, in this case, the notional principal amount increases over time on a schedule to which the two players concur in advance. Swaps are traded [over-the-counter](/otc) (OTC) so the terms can be tailored to the gatherings in question.

The product may likewise be called an accreting swap, accumulation swap, construction loan swap, drawdown swap, and step-up swap.

## Understanding an Accreting Principal Swap

Predominantly businesses and financial institutions, along for certain large investors, may utilize an accreting principal [swap](/swap).

In a customary or [plain vanilla swap](/plain-vanilla-swap), one party diminishes exposure to risk while the other acknowledges that risk for the capability of a higher return. Ordinarily, the [notional principal amount](/notionalprincipalamount) of the swap contract stays steady. Be that as it may, in an accreting principal swap, the notional principal develops over time until the swap contract matures.

Parties in a vanilla swap could exchange the payments of a [fixed-rate](/fixedinterestrate) investment, for example, a Treasury bond, for the payments of [variable rate](/variableinterestrate) investment, like a mortgage, where the rate goes up and down. The mortgage could be founded on the [prime rate](/primerate) plus 2%, so as the prime rate fluctuates, so will the mortgage payment.

The justification behind the exchange is for one party to fix the payments of their variable rate investment basically. The other party could have a view that [interest rates](/interestrate) will move in a good course and will face the challenge, through the swap, that they will.

Rather than bond or mortgage investments, the cash flows may be from a business. Or on the other hand the cash flows may be expected to fund a business. In either case, the requirement for fixed cash flow or a [hedge](/hedge) against rising costs is a factor.

## Utilizing an Accreting Principal Swap

An accreting principal swap can assist youthful companies that will with requiring expanding amounts of [capital](/capital). It is in many cases utilized in construction, where long-term projects have inflating costs over time.

For instance, a construction company needs to make an anticipated structure for the interest costs of projects. They know costs for [labor](/cost-of-labor), materials, and regulations will increase over time and need to make arrangements for that at this point. They favor a series of unsurprising, expanding, future payments. An accreting principal swap can characterize these costs in predetermined [tranches](/tranches) as they continue on toward each stage of the project.

It could likewise be utilized when two gatherings need to add further to the investments or obligations they are swapping. For instance, assuming an investor realizes they are expanding their contribution to an asset by 10% every year, they could go into an accreting principal swap so the swap amount matches the investment amount.

## Illustration of an Accreting Principal Swap

Expect there are two investors that are adding to interest-bearing assets.

- John is getting the [fed funds rate](/federalfundsrate) plus 1% on his investment of $1 million.
- Judy is getting a fixed rate of 3% on her $1 million investment.
- The fed funds rate is currently 2%, so John and Judy are both getting a similar amount of interest right at this point.

John is stressed interest rates might go down, which would drop his return below 3%. Judy, then again, will face the challenge that interest rates will remain something similar or go up. Therefore, she will go into a swap with John.

John will pay Judy the fed funds rate plus 1% (which is what he gets from his investment), and Judy will pay John 3% (which is what she gets from her investment).

That would be a normal vanilla swap. Yet, presently accept that John and Judy are both adding $50,000 to their investment every year. They believe the swap should apply to those extra contributions too. This is where the accreting viewpoint comes in. The notional amount during the current year will be $1 million, however next year it will be $1,050,000. The next year $1.1 million, then 1.15 million the next year.

The swap will lapse out on the town agreed to in advance, for example, when the investments mature, say in five years. Over those five years, the notional amount will develop by $50,000 every year.

> The notional amount isn't exchanged. Assuming that the interest rates are something very similar, there is no exchange of cash. Assuming the interest rates end up various (rates go up or down from the current level) then the party that owes pays the other the difference in the interest rate on the notional amount.
