## What Is it to Make a Market?

Making a market is an action by which a [dealer](/dealer) or [market maker](/marketmaker) holds on, ready to make a [two-sided quote](/twowayquote). This quote demonstrates they are willing and able to one or the other buy or sell a specific security at the quoted [bid](/bidprice) and [ask](/ask) price.

Having the option to make a market in this manner considers liquid and efficient markets. Markets can be made on whatever is exchanged, from stocks and different securities to currency exchange rates, interest rates, commodities, etc.

## Figuring out Make a Market

To make a market is to display a bid (where you will buy) and an ask or offer (where you will sell). On the off chance that you were a food merchant, for example, and were asked to make a market on the price of an apple, you could show $0.10 - $0.50 ("ten pennies bid at fifty pennies"). This means you'd buy an apple for a dime, and sell an apple for half a dollar. The key point is that when asked to make a market, you don't be guaranteed to be aware in advance on the off chance that the requester is an interested buyer or seller.

Market makers and dealers are the ones that make markets on securities exchanges. Market makers are market participants or [member firms](/memberfirm) of an exchange that buy and sell securities against other counterparties at prices displayed in an exchange's trading system for their own accounts (called chief trades) and for customer accounts (called agency trades). Market makers can enter and change quotes to buy or sell, enter, and execute orders, and clear those orders.

Market makers exist under rules made by stock exchanges approved by a securities regulator. In the U.S., the [Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)](/sec) is the fundamental regulator of the exchanges. Market maker rights and obligations change by exchange and the market inside an exchange, like values or options.

> Market makers bring in money through the spread on every security they cover — in particular, the difference between the bid and ask price; they additionally regularly charge investors fees to utilize their services.

## How a Market Maker Works

To make a market, a brokerage firm must hold a lopsidedly large amount of a given security so it can fulfill a high volume of market orders in practically no time at competitive prices. As opposed to a conventional brokerage, being a market maker requires a higher risk tolerance in view of the high amounts of a given security that a market maker must hold.

Market makers advance market effectiveness by keeping markets liquid. To guarantee unbiasedness for their clients, brokerage houses that function as market makers are legally required to separate their market-production activities from their brokerage deals tasks.

> Market makers smooth out the method involved with trading by making it more straightforward for investors and traders to buy and sell securities; on the off chance that there were no market makers, it could mean insufficient transactions and insufficient trading proceeding to keep the cycle liquid.

## Market Makers Facilitate Liquidity

In the event that investors are selling, market makers are committed to keep buying, and vice versa. They should accept the contrary side of anything that trades are being led at some random point in time. Accordingly, market makers fulfill the market demand for securities and work with their circulation. The [Nasdaq](/nasdaq), for instance, depends on market makers inside its network to guarantee efficient trading.

Market makers benefit through the [market-maker spread](/marketmakerspread), not from whether a security goes up or down. They should buy or sell securities as per what sort of trades are being set, not as per whether they think prices will go up or down.
