# Anti-Dilution Provision
## What Is an Anti-Dilution Provision?

Anti-dilution provisions are provisos incorporated into [convertible preferred stocks](/convertiblepreferredstock) and some [options](/choice) to assist with shielding investors from their investment possibly losing value. At the point when new issues of a stock hit the market at a less expensive price than that paid by before investors in a similar stock, then, at that point, equity [dilution](/dilution) can happen. Anti-dilution provisions are additionally alluded to as anti-dilution conditions, subscription rights, subscription privileges, or preemptive rights.

## Understanding Anti-Dilution Provisions

Anti-dilution provisions act as a buffer to safeguard investors against their equity ownership positions becoming diluted or less important. This can happen when the percentage of a proprietor's stake in a company diminishes in view of an increase in the total number of [shares outstanding](/outstandingshares). Total shares outstanding may increase due to new share issuance in light of a round of equity financing. Dilution can likewise happen when holders of [stock options](/stockoption), like company employees, or holders of other optionable securities [exercise](/exercise) their options.

> At the point when the number of shares outstanding increases, each existing stockholder claims a more modest, or diluted, percentage of the company, making each share less significant.
>

Now and again the company gets sufficient cash in exchange for the shares that the increase in the value of the shares counterbalances the effects of dilution; however frequently this isn't the case.

## Anti-Dilution Provisions at Work

Dilution can be especially vexing to preferred shareholders of [venture capital](/venturecapital) bargains, whose stock ownership might become diluted when later issues of a similar stock hit the market at a less expensive price. Anti-dilution provisions can deter this from occurring by tweaking the [conversion price](/conversionprice) between convertible securities, like corporate bonds or [preferred shares](/preferredstock), and common stocks. Along these lines, anti-dilution statements can keep an investor's original ownership percentage intact.

### Dilution in real life
- As a simple illustration of dilution, expect that an investor claims 200,000 shares of a company that has a million shares outstanding. The price per share is $5, implying that the investor has a $1,000,000 stake in a company valued at $5,000,000. The investor possesses 20% of the company.
- Next, expect that the company enters another round of financing and issues a million additional shares, bringing the total shares outstanding to 2,000,000. Presently, at that equivalent $5 per share price, the investor claims a $1,000,000 stake in a $10,000,000 company. In a split second, the investors' ownership has been diluted to 10%.

### Types of Anti-Dilution Provisions

The two common types of anti-dilution provisos are known as "full ratchet" and "weighted average."

With a [full ratchet](/fullratchet) provision, the conversion price of the existing preferred shares is adjusted descending to the price at which new shares are issued in later rounds. Basically, on the off chance that the original conversion price was $5 and in a later round the conversion price is $2.50, the investor's original conversion price would conform to $2.50.

The [weighted average](/weightedaverage) provision utilizes the accompanying formula to decide new conversion prices:

- C2 = C1 x (A + B)/(A + C)

Where:

- C2 = new conversion price
- C1 = old conversion price
- A = number of outstanding shares before another issue
- B = total consideration received by the company for the new issue
- C = number of new shares issued
