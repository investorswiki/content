# Denomination
## What Is a Denomination?

A denomination alludes to the units classification for the stated or [face value](/facevalue) of financial instruments, for example, currency notes or coins, as well concerning securities, bonds, and different investments.

The denomination can in this way be utilized to quote the [base currency](/basecurrency) in a [forex](/forex) transaction, or the quoted currency in a financial asset. This utilization of the term characterizes the acceptable payment in trades and the monetary unit wherein it is priced, for instance while demonstrating U.S. [dollar-designated bonds](/eurodollarbond) issued by a foreign government.

## Figuring out Denomination

Most frequently, a denomination is a unit of value, or [numeraire](/numeraire), given to money or currencies like coins and notes, as well as other financial instruments that keep up with set values, for example, government-issued [bonds](/bond). The denomination value of such a fixed-income security is frequently alluded to as its "face value" since it shows up on the front, or face, of the financial instrument.

In the United States, currency notes apportioned by most [automated teller machines](/atm) (ATMs) are just accessible in certain denominations. For instance, a few ATMs offer $20 bills and $100 bills, while others could give $10 and $50 notes. In a trade transaction, an exporter based in Europe might invoice the buyer in U.S. dollars, making the transaction U.S. dollar-designated. While most commodities were quoted in terms of the dollar, beginning in 2011, commodities, for example, crude oil could receive quotes in other currency denominations, for example, the [euro](/euro).

A few foreign substances will issue securities named in an alternate currency from their own. For example, the government of Argentina has issued U.S.- dollar named sovereign debt, and certain non-U.S. corporations issue shares named in dollars.

## Par Values as Denominations

The denomination affixed to a bond or other fixed-income investment is equivalent to the bond's [par value](/parvalue), which is the amount paid upon maturity. One might purchase bonds in various denominations, going from $50 to $10,000. At the point when one purchases a shared bond, it is sold for an amount below the undeniable denomination on the grounds that the difference between the sales price and the value at maturity serves a function like the interest earned in other investment vehicles.

Different types of securities are likewise issued with par values; nonetheless, the actual par value on a share of stock, for example, is certainly not an accurate assessment of the security's significance in the marketplace. The par value here rather addresses a base value for the holding. While giving common stock, corporations actually issue them with a face value just zero or one penny. This pricing convention permits them to keep away from legal liabilities they might open themselves to in the event that they listed the stock at a higher price.

## Denominations and Nomenclature

Classification is the act of applying a name to a thing, and numerous currencies carry the official denomination as well as a moniker. For instance, the [Canadian dollar](/cad-canadian-dollar) (CAD) conveys the moniker of the "[loonie](/loonie)" since it has the picture of a nut case bird on one side. The American $100 bill is known as a "Benjamin" since it conveys the image of Benjamin Franklin.

## Real World Example

A few individual bits of currency have a higher retail market value than their officially checked denomination. These currencies are collectible and pursued by specialists and those searching for an alternative investment.

For instance, some U.S. quarters created somewhere in the range of 1932 and 1964 contained 90% silver substance. Thusly, albeit the face value keeps up with their worth at 25 pennies, the market value might be higher, based on the price of silver, the dissolve value of silver, the condition of a specific coin, and the date and mint included. This difference between the denomination and the liquefy value eventually prompted a change in the materials used to deliver quarters.
