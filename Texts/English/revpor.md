# Revenue Per Occupied Room (RevPOR)
## What Does Revenue Per Occupied Room Mean?

Revenue per occupied room (RevPOR) is a performance metric in the inn and lodging industry. RevPOR is calculated by partitioning total revenue by the number of rooms really sold to visitors. The calculation considers services and different things a visitor might buy, for example, spa services and scaled down bar sales.

## Figuring out Revenue Per Occupied Room (RevPOR)

The formula for ascertaining revenue per occupied room is:

**RevPOR = Total Revenue/Occupied Rooms**

The time span utilized can be daily, week after week, month to month, or every year relying upon what type of bits of knowledge the company is searching for. Revenue per occupied room is meant to show how much profit a hotelier is making from visitors who stay at a specific property.

The measurement can be extremely valuable in assessing a lodging's performance through seasonal downtrends. Seasonal visiting trends will impact other inn [key performance indicators](/kpi), yet RevPOR disregards the overall number of visitors for measuring how much an average visitor spends on the lodging's products and services. A few hoteliers feel this is a better measure of the management of an inn than seasonally influenced [occupancy rates](/occupancy-rate).

Revenue per occupied room considers things, for example, room service, dry cleaning, and spa sales to show how effective a lodging is in selling something beyond a room to visitors. Other industry metrics rise and fall with occupancy rates, which might express less about how the inn is managed and more about [seasonal trends](/seasonality).

## RevPOR versus RevPAR

RevPOR frequently assumes a lower priority in relation to [revenue per accessible room](/revpar) (RevPAR), which thinks about unoccupied rooms by duplicating the overall occupancy rate by the [average daily rate](/average-daily-rate) (ADR). This is essentially on the grounds that occupancy rates impact the reality than visitor spending on the miscellaneous items.

Frequently the room is the highest priced part of the transaction, so selling more rooms to additional individuals makes an interpretation of rapidly into more profit. RevPOR won't ever dislodge RevPAR as the primary profitability performance measure. Improvements in RevPOR truly do convert into higher profits, yet the effect is more steady than the immediate impact of expanding the occupancy rate.

All things considered, RevPOR is a better measurement of the direct management of a particular property than RevPAR. Hoteliers operating organizations across the country might handle marketing and advancements at a level over the individual inn, so it tends to be challenging for the direct managers of the lodging to influence occupancy personally. What they frequently control is the manner by which and when in-inn purchases are showcased to visitors as well as the quality of those products and services.

By zeroing in on RevPOR, lodging management can capture additional revenue from their visitors and mellow the blow of regional or seasonal occupancy declines. All the more critically, a decent RevPOR in the down season recommends that total profitability will be even higher when the pinnacle season shows up.
