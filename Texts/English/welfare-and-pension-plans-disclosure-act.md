## What Was the Welfare and Pension Plans Disclosure Act (WPPDA)?

With an end goal to increase transparency, the WPPDA commanded that employers and [labor unions](/labor-association) give plan depictions and financial reports to the government. It was expected to make arrangement supports more accountable to participants and beneficiaries for the financial strength of the plans.

## Understanding the Welfare and Pension Plans Disclosure Act

The Welfare and Pension Plans Disclosure Act required the U.S. Labor Department to file data pretty much all [pension plans](/pensionplan) with in excess of 25 employees participating. It likewise required pension plans that added up to somewhere in the range of 25 and 100 employees to file point by point depictions about [plan administration](/plan_administrator). Plans that had an excess to file financial reports on an annual basis, as well as giving pertinent insights regarding their plan.

A 1962 amendment to the Welfare and Pension Plans Disclosure Act increased regulatory authority over the plans by giving the government enforcement, interpretative, and investigatory powers. The WPPDA was a forerunner to the a lot more extensive [Employee Retirement Income Security Act](/erisa) (ERISA), which supplanted it in 1974.

## How ERISA Expanded on the WPPDA

The Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 safeguards Americans' retirement assets by carrying out rules that [qualified retirement plans](/qrp) must follow to guarantee plan trustees use plan assets suitably. As framed by ERISA, plans must give [participants](/planparticipant) with data about plan elements and funding, and routinely produce pertinent data for nothing.

ERISA adds to the requirements under the Welfare and Pension Plans Disclosure Act by laying out standards of [fiduciary duty](/fiduciary), protecting the plans from mismanagement, and expanding the rights of participants and beneficiaries. ERISA characterizes a fiduciary as any individual who practices discretionary authority or control over a plan's management or assets, including any individual who gives [investment advice](/investment-exhortation) to the plan.

Trustees who don't follow the principles of legitimate conduct might be held responsible for making up losses to the plan. Likewise, ERISA tends to fiduciary provisions and boycotts the abuse of assets through this specific set of provisions.

As well as keeping participants educated regarding their legal rights, ERISA awards participants the right to sue for benefits and breaks of fiduciary duty. To guarantee participants don't lose their [retirement contributions](/retirement-commitment) in the event that a defined plan is ended, ERISA guarantees payment of certain benefits through the [Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation](/pbgc), a federally graphed corporation.
