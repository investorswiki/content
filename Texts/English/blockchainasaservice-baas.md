# Blockchain-as-a-Service (BaaS)
## What Is Blockchain-as-a-Service (BaaS)?

Blockchain-as-a-service (BaaS) is the third-party creation and management of cloud-based networks for companies in the business of building blockchain applications. These third-party services are a relatively new development in the developing field of blockchain technology. The application of blockchain technology has moved well past its most popular use in cryptocurrency transactions and has broadened to address secure transactions, everything being equal. Subsequently, there is a demand for facilitating services.

## Understanding Blockchain-as-a-Service (BaaS)

BaaS is based on the [software as a service (SaaS)](/software-as-a-service-saas) model and works in a similar fashion. It allows customers to leverage cloud-based answers for build, have, and operate their own [blockchain](/blockchain) apps and related capabilities on the blockchain. At the same time, the cloud-based service provider keeps the infrastructure agile and operational.

As a development in the greater blockchain ecosystem, BaaS is viewed as supporting blockchain adoption across businesses.

Major players in the BaaS space include:

- Microsoft, which partnered with ConsenSys to present Ethereum blockchain-as-a-service on Microsoft Azure in 2015.
- Amazon, which has presented Amazon Managed Blockchain, a service that "makes it easy to create and manage scalable blockchain networks" utilizing open source frameworks including Ethereum and Hyperledger Fabric.
- R3, a consortium of global financial institutions that delivered a distributed financial ledger called Corda.
- PayStand, which specializes in sending and getting payments between companies.

Shoppers and businesses are increasingly able to adapt to blockchain technology. Be that as it may, the technical complexities and operational overhead engaged with creating, designing, and operating a blockchain and maintaining its infrastructure frequently act as a barrier.

BaaS offers an external service provider to set up all the necessary blockchain technology and infrastructure for a fee. When created, the provider keeps on handling the complex back-end operations for the client.

The BaaS operator typically offers support activities, like bandwidth management, suitable allocation of resources, facilitating requirements, and data security features. The BaaS operator liberates the client to zero in on the core job: the functionality of the blockchain.

## Example of Blockchain-as-a-Service (BaaS)

Below is a graphic demonstrating the working model of Blockchain-as-a-Service [Hyperledger Cello](/blockchain), a BaaS-like blockchain module tool compartment and utility system under the Hyperledger project.

In fact, a BaaS' provider's job is similar to that of a web facilitating provider. The website creators create and run all the website content on their very own PCs. They may hire support staff or sign up with an external facilitating provider like Amazon Web Services or HostGator. These third-party companies take care of the infrastructure and maintenance issues.

BaaS may be the catalyst that leads to a more extensive and more profound penetration of blockchain technology across various industry sectors and businesses. Instead of creating and running their own blockchains, a business, large or small, can now just outsource the technically complex work and spotlight on its core activities.

## Features
