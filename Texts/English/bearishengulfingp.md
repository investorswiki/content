# Bearish Engulfing Pattern
## What is a Bearish Engulfing Pattern?

A bearish engulfing pattern is a technical chart pattern that signals lower prices to come. The pattern comprises of an up (white or green) [candlestick](/candlestick) trailed by a large down (black or red) candlestick that obscurations or "overwhelms" the smaller up candle. The pattern can be important on the grounds that it shows dealers have surpassed the purchasers and are pushing the price all the more forcefully down (down candle) than the purchasers had the option to push it up (up candle).

## What Does the Bearish Engulfing Pattern Tell You?

A bearish engulfing pattern is seen toward the finish of some vertical price moves. It is set apart by the primary candle of up momentum being surpassed, or inundated, by a larger second candle demonstrating a shift toward lower prices. The pattern has greater unwavering quality when the open price of the engulfing candle is well over the close of the primary candle, and when the close of the engulfing candle is well below the open of the main candle. A lot larger down candle shows more strength than if the down candle is just marginally larger than the up candle.

The pattern is likewise more reliable when it follows a clean move higher. Assuming that the price action is [choppy](/choppymarket) or going, many engulfing patterns will happen however they are probably not going to bring about major price moves since the overall price trend is choppy or running.

Before following up on the pattern, traders normally trust that the subsequent candle will close, and afterward make a move on the accompanying candle. Actions incorporate selling a [long](/long) position once a bearish engulfing pattern happens, or possibly entering a [short](/short) position.

If entering another short position, a [stop loss](/stop-lossorder) can be put over the high of the two-bar pattern.

Adroit traders consider the overall picture while using bearish engulfing patterns. For instance, taking a short trade may not be insightful if the uptrend is extremely. Even the formation of a bearish engulfing pattern may not be sufficient to halt the advance for a really long time. Yet, in the event that the overall trend is down, and the price has just seen a [pullback](/pullback) to the upside, a bearish engulfing pattern might give a decent shorting opportunity since the trade lines up with the longer-term downtrend.

## Illustration of How to Use a Bearish Engulfing Pattern

The chart model shows three bearish engulfing patterns that occurred in the [forex market](/forex). The primary bearish engulfing pattern happens during a pullback to the upside inside a larger downtrend. The price proceeds lower following the pattern.

The next two engulfing patterns are less critical thinking about the overall picture. The price scope of the [forex pair](/currencypair) is starting to narrow, demonstrating choppy trading, and there is almost no vertical price movement prior to the patterns framing. A reversal pattern has little use in the event that there is practically nothing to reverse. Inside ranges and choppy markets engulfing patterns will happen habitually yet are not typically great trading signals.

## The Difference Between a Bearish Engulfing Pattern and a Bullish Engulfing Pattern

These two patterns are contrary energies. A [bullish engulfing pattern](/bullishengulfingpattern) happens after a price move lower and demonstrates higher prices to come. The main candle, in the two-candle pattern, is a down candle. The subsequent candle is a larger up candle, with a real body that completely immerses the smaller down candle.

## Limitations of Using a Bearish Engulfing Pattern

Engulfing patterns are most helpful following a clean vertical price move as the pattern plainly shows the shift in momentum to the downside. Assuming the price action is choppy, even on the off chance that the price is rising overall, the significance of the engulfing pattern is reduced since it is a genuinely normal signal.

The engulfing or second candle may likewise be gigantic. This can leave a trader with an exceptionally large stop loss in the event that they opt to trade the pattern. The likely reward from the trade may not justify the risk.

Laying out the potential reward can likewise be troublesome with engulfing patterns, as candlesticks don't give a [price target](/pricetarget). All things being equal, traders should utilize different methods, like indicators or [trend analysis](/trendanalysis), for choosing a price target or deciding when to escape a profitable trade.

## Highlights
- A [bearish](/bear) engulfing pattern can happen anyplace, yet it is more huge in the event that it happens after a price advance. This could be an uptrend or a pullback to the upside with a larger downtrend.
- In a perfect world, the two candles are of substantial size relative to the price bars around them. Two tiny bars might make an engulfing pattern, yet it is undeniably less critical than if the two candles are large.
- The pattern has undeniably less significance in choppy markets.
- The real body — the difference between the open and [close price](/closingprice) — of the candlesticks matters. The real body of the down candle must overwhelm the up candle.
