# Calculated Intangible Value (CIV)
## What Is Calculated Intangible Value (CIV)?

Calculated elusive value is a method of esteeming a company's [intangible assets](/intangibleasset). This calculation endeavors to designate a fixed value to elusive assets that won't change as indicated by the company's market value. A theoretical asset is a non-physical asset. Instances of theoretical assets incorporate licenses, brand names, copyrights, [goodwill](/goodwill), brand recognition, customer records, and proprietary technology.

Since an elusive asset has no physical form and isn't effortlessly changed over completely to cash, working out its value can challenge. Nonetheless, there are times while ascertaining the value of elusive assets becomes critical. For instance, owners hoping to sell their company might hire a business appraiser to value the company's elusive assets explicitly.

## Grasping Calculated Intangible Value (CIV)

Habitually, a company's theoretical assets are valued by deducting a company's [book value](/bookvalue) from its [market value](/marketvalue). Nonetheless, adversaries of this method contend that since market value continually changes, the value of immaterial assets likewise changes, making it an inferior measure.

Then again, the calculated immaterial value thinks about extra factors, for example, the company's pretax earnings, the company's average return on unmistakable assets, and the industry's average return on substantial assets.

## Deciding the Calculated Intangible Value (CIV)

Finding a company's CIV includes seven steps:

1. Work out the average [pretax earnings](/pretax-earnings) for the past three years.
1. Compute the average year-end [tangible assets](/tangibleasset) for the past three years.
1. Ascertain the company's [return on assets](/returnonassets) (ROA).
1. Compute the industry average ROA for a similar three-year period as in Step 2.
1. Ascertain excess ROA by duplicating the industry average ROA by the average unmistakable assets calculated in Step 2. Deduct the excess return from the pretax earnings from Step 1.
1. Ascertain the three-year average [corporate tax](/corporatetax) rate and increase it by the excess return. Deduct the outcome from the excess return.
1. Ascertain the [net present value](/npv) (NPV) of the after-tax excess return. Utilize the company's [cost of capital](/costofcapital) as a discount rate.

## The Bottom Line

Working out an accurate value for substantial assets than immaterial assets is a lot simpler. Unmistakable assets —, for example, product inventory, structures, land, and gear — are noticeable and simple to comprehend. Since elusive assets are more challenging to value, companies might decide to hire a third-party business evaluator or appraiser to perform the perplexing task of recognizing the company's unique assets and putting a value on them. At the point when a company is available to be purchased, this interaction turns out to be more critical as questions with respect to asset value can lead to debates among buyer and seller.

Regardless of the valuation troubles presented by elusive assets, these assets can play an enormous job in a company's prosperity. Apple Inc. (AAPL), for instance, has invested impressive money and energy to foster its proprietary technology and [brand recognition](/brand-recognition) — which should be visible in the company's product design, logos, bundling, and trademarks — which impact Apple's all's ability to generate profits and sales.
