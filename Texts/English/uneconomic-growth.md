# Uneconomic Growth
## What is Uneconomic Growth

Uneconomic growth will be growth that produces negative [externalities](/externality) which reduce the overall quality of life. This is otherwise called unsustainable growth, where the negative social and environmental outcomes offset the short-term value of an extra unit of growth, making it uneconomic.

## Figuring out Uneconomic Growth

Uneconomic growth happens when the marginal benefits of manufacturing more goods and a developing economy are offset by the negative social and environmental effects. It has turned into a statement of belief in [environmental](/environmental-economics) and [ecological economics](/greeneconomics) — albeit the possibility of unproductive growth has been around for some time.

A portion of its philosophy has likewise been adopted by climate-change conscious investors in the [environmental, social, and governance](/environmental-social-and-governance-esg-criteria) (ESG) space, where large wealth funds and establishments have been stripping themselves of fuel stocks. Socially conscious investors have been keeping away from petroleum derivative stocks and pursuing other ethical investment choices, to adjust the core of their investment strategy with their values.

## Greens Champion the Cause of Uneconomics

The concept of uneconomic growth and the [steady state economy](/consistent state-economy) was promoted by World Bank economist Herman Daly in the late 1990s. Biologists, as environmental activist David Suzuki, contend that the global economy is presently huge to such an extent that society can at this point not securely imagine it operates inside a limitless ecosystem.

At the point when one nation increments production by harming the environment, it makes negative outcomes that are felt by the whole planet, in terms of lost ecosystem services. A similar principle can be applied to the level of a city, company or even one's own home.

## A Grim Prognosis for the Future of Global Economic Growth?

Worries about conceivable negative effects of growth on the environment and society have driven environmentalists and climate activists to advocate lower levels of economic growth and non-renewable energy source use to limit the damage to the environment and climate. Biological economists think the world has previously passed the point when growth costs more than it is worth, and that we really want to zero in on protecting natural territories.

The United Nations has adopted a progressive plan to accomplish "supported economic growth." But even that doesn't go far enough for green economists who need to move "past growth" and track down alternative global indicators to [gross domestic product](/gdp) (GDP) — which since it is a monetary valuation doesn't recognize market transactions that contribute decidedly to sustainable prosperity (like buying bikes, sunlight based chargers or new food) and those that lessen it (like buying gas chuggers, weapons, or cigarettes).

The emphasis on GDP means that economic policies consequently have a supportive of growth bias and that there is no qualification between economies that are sabotaging critical ecosystems and those that are not.
