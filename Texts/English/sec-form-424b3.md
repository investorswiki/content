# SEC Form 424B3
## What Is SEC Form 424B3?

SEC Form 424B3 is an amendment form that the [Securities and Exchange Commission](/sec) (SEC) requires companies to file assuming they wish to change, revise, or add information to their registration [prospectus](/prospectus) without adjusting the prospectus in original form.

There are eight distinct types of prospectus amendment forms under Rule 424 inside Regulation C of the [Securities Act of 1933](/securitiesact1933), Title 17, Part 230. Companies are required to file prospectus form 424B3 as per Rule 424(b)(3).

## Understanding SEC Form 424B3

The Securities Act of 1933 was made to give a regulatory structure to the creation, registration, and [issuance](/issue) of investment securities to investors. This structure provides regulatory protocols for issuers and furthermore creates transparency for investors.

Companies seeking to send off a [initial public offering](/ipo) (IPO) must register with the SEC as directed by Title 17, Part 230, Rules 400 to 498 of the Securities Act of 1933. Rules 400 to 498, also known as Regulation C, apply to the IPO process for most new issuers, despite the fact that there are some alternative filing protocols as well.

Regulation C of the Securities Act of 1933 mandates the filing of the [Form S-1 registration statement](/sec-form-s-1), which includes an issuer's prospectus. Regulation C and Form S-1 also give clear details on other information that a registering company must incorporate, such as financial reports and material information.

> Any person who tenaciously violates legitimate filings and disclosure protocols can be subject to five years in prison, a $10,000 fine, or both. This is inclusive of company directors, attorneys, accountants, the whole [underwriting syndicate](/guarantor syndicate), and all persons who signed the Form S-1.
>

After the Form S-1 is submitted, it is inspected by the SEC, who either accepts or rejects the registration request. In some cases, companies may not wish to straightforwardly correct their initially approved Form S-1 prospectus after it has been approved. This leads to Rule 424 of Regulation C, which lays out eight distinct options for giving information also tied to the Form S-1 prospectus.
