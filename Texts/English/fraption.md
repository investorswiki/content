# Fraption
## What Is a Fraption?

A fraption is a type of option that offers the holder the chance to go into a [forward rate agreement](/fra) (FRA) with foreordained conditions and inside a certain amount of time. Forward rate agreements are contracts to exchange a pre-decide interest rate to be paid on a future date on some notional amount. Along these lines, a fraption is otherwise called an "interest rate guarantee."

Like [vanilla options](/vanillaoption), fraptions have an expiry date. Buyers use fraptions to safeguard against interest rate changes at the cost of a premium before that contract lapses.

## How Fraptions Work

Fraptions give the holder the right to go into a forward rate agreement in the event that they so decide. Like vanilla options, a fraption offers rights however isn't an obligation to the buyer.

The buyer pays a [premium](/premium) for the fraption to lock in the interest rate. On the off chance that the fraption isn't [exercised](/exercise) (transformed into a forward rate agreement) since interest rates remain somewhat stable or even drop, the buyer loses the premium yet isn't committed to go into the forward rate agreement.

In the event that the buyer decides to exercise the option, they will go into the forward rate agreement per the terms of the fraption. Fraptions are just traded [over-the-counter](/otc) (OTC), permitting the two gatherings associated with the transaction to indicate the specific terms they need. Terms incorporate the notional amount of the forward, the expiry of the options portion of the fraption, the premium on the option, the [settlement date](/settlementdate), maturity date, and rates of the forward. Assuming that the two players concur, the fraption is made.

When the forward rate agreement is in place, the options portion of the transaction quits existing. The seller of the fraption keeps the premium paid and the forward assumes the option's position as an obligation to the two players.

## Utilizing a Fraption

Fraptions are essentially utilized by corporations and establishments to oversee [interest rate risk](/interestraterisk). The buyer of the fraption and forward rate agreement normally needs to safeguard against a rise in interest rates. In this way, the buyer of the forward pays a fixed interest rate on a [notional amount](/notionalprincipalamount) of money.

In the mean time, the seller of the fraption and the forward rate agreement needs to safeguard against a decline in interest rates. The seller pays a drifting interest rate, ordinarily linked to [LIBOR](/libor).

The notional amount of the forward, say $1 million, isn't exchanged between the two gatherings. Rather, just the monetary difference made by the two interest rates is exchanged on the effective date of the forward.

Since forward rate agreements don't need an exchange of the notional amount between the two gatherings, they are thought of "shaky sheet" agreements, meaning the corporations don't have to report the agreement on their [balance sheet](/balancesheet).

## Features

- A fraption is the right yet not the obligation to go into a forward rate agreement (FRA) eventually, effectively laying out an interest rate guarantee.
- Fraptions are involved by corporations and establishments as a cost-effective method for overseeing interest rate risk.
