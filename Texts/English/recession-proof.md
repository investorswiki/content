# Recession Proof
## What is Recession Proof?

Recession proof is a term used to depict an asset, company, industry or other entity that is accepted to be economically resistant to the effects of a recession. Recession-proof stocks are added to investment portfolios to safeguard them against times of economic decline, which might be the beginning of a recession. Securities that are accepted to be recession proof frequently have negative[ beta](/beta) values (like gold), which would demonstrate an inverse relationship to the greater market.

## Understanding Recession Proof

Albeit numerous things have been marked as recession proof, not very many end up being so. Regularly, the long-arriving at outcomes of a recessionary period are too much for even the most recession-proof organizations or assets to endure. Even equities, which are evidently the most sensitive assets during a recession, are not unsurprising 100% of the time. Several recessions (1945, 1949, 1980, among others) saw price increments for the[ S&P 500](/sp500).

## Negative Beta

Securities that are accepted to be recession proof frequently have negative beta values, which show an inverse relationship to the greater market. It was once trusted that gold and gold stocks, for instance, were recession proof due to gold's negative beta value. Physical gold has performed well in a few economic slumps, yet ordinarily under specific conditions, including expected high inflation. Securitized gold (gold shares and exchange-traded funds) will generally have a positive beta. Likewise, holding assets with negative beta during non-recessionary times lessens the[ expected return](/expectedreturn) of the portfolio.

An asset with a negative beta has an expected return below the[ risk-free rate](/risk-freerate) during normal times. Recession-proof investments frequently underperform during normal times, as well as during the recovery period following a recession.

## Defensive Industries

[Defensive stocks](/defensivestock), like medical care or utilities, are frequently refered to as recession-proof investments. The thinking being that consumers actually need to purchase medical care and electricity, no matter what the economic situation. Numerous defensive industries address a small percentage of consumer spending, notwithstanding, restricting their recession-proofing value.

## Recession Proofing an Overall Portfolio

Several factors can be utilized to safeguard an overall portfolio against a recession, including asset diversification, rebalancing, and a long investment timetable. Expanding the amount of cash holdings in a portfolio is likewise an effective method for watching it against a recession, at the opportunity cost of done without returns. This empowers investors to access liquidity rapidly to exploit a falling stock market. Cash benefits from deflation in a recessionary environment, as the purchasing power of every dollar rises. U.S. Treasury Bonds are viewed as recession proof since they are backed by the government of the world's greatest economy.

## Illustration of Recession-Proof Assets

In the stock market, several companies and sectors are viewed as recession proof since they buck the descending slide of the market or have a relatively lower percentage decline as compared to different sectors or indices.

An illustration of the former is retailing behemoth Walmart. The Arkansas-based monster reported growth in profits and revenues in the three years following the[ Great Recession](/great-recession). Consumers cut back on their spending and shopped at discount retailers, who increased their game by involving their economies of scale to drive lower prices for products.

Utility stocks are an illustration of the last option. The thinking for looking at utilities as a safe bet during a recession is that individuals will in any case have to pay their water and electric bills during a recession. Normally investors and traders are not keen on utility stocks since they are less unstable as compared to the remainder of the market and offer less opportunities for bringing in money in a short time.

In any case, they are among the two or three sectors to park money safely during a recession. While different sectors dunked into a negative area or fell by twofold digit figures, utility stocks remained relatively stable.
