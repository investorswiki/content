# Vanilla Option
## What is a Vanilla Option

A vanilla option is a financial instrument that gives the holder the right, however not the obligation, to buy or sell a [underlying asset](/underlying-asset) at a foreordained price inside a given time period. A vanilla option is a [call option](/calloption) or [put option](/putoption) that has no special or unusual elements. Such options are normalized whenever traded on an exchange, for example, the [Chicago Board Options Exchange](/cboe).

## Fundamentals of a Vanilla Option

Vanilla options are utilized by people, companies, and institutional investors to [hedge](/hedge) their openness in a specific asset or to guess on the price movement of a financial instrument.

On the off chance that a vanilla option isn't the right fit, [exotic options](/exoticoption, for example, [barrier options](/barrieroption), [Asian options](/asianoption), and [digital options](/binary-option) are more customizable. Exotic options have more complex highlights and are generally traded over the counter. They can be combined into complex designs to reduce the net cost or increase leverage.

## Calls and Puts

There are two types of vanilla options: calls and puts. The owner of a call has the right, yet not the obligation, to buy the underlying instrument at the [strike price](/strikeprice). The owner of a put has the right, yet not the obligation, to sell the instrument at the strike price. The seller of the option is alluded to as its [writer](/composing an-option). Shorting or composing an option makes an obligation to buy or sell the instrument in the event that the option is exercised by its owner.

Calls and puts both have a [expiry date](/expirationdate). This puts a period limit on how long the underlying asset needs to move.

For instance, stock XYZ might be trading at $30. A call option that terminates in one month has a strike price or $31. The cost of this option, called the [premium](/premium), is $0.35. Every option contract controls 100 shares, so buying one option costs $0.35 x 100 shares, or $35.

Assuming the price of XYZ stock moves above $31, that option is [in the money](/inthemoney). However, the underlying asset needs to move above $31.35 for the buyer to begin seeing a profit on the trade. The most the option buyer can lose is the amount they paid for the option. The profit potential is unlimited and relies heavily on how far the underlying moves over the strike price.

The option writer gathers $35 ($0.35 x 100 shares) for composing the option. Assuming the price of XYZ stock stays below $31, the option is supposed to be [out of the money](/outofthemoney) and the writer keeps the premium. Nonetheless, assuming the price transcends $31, the option writer has an obligation to sell that stock to the option buyer at $31. For instance, if the stock ascents to $33, this would address a loss of $165, or ($35 - $31) x 100 = $200, then deduct the $35 premium previously collected for a loss of $165.

## Vanilla Option Features

Each option has a strike price. On the off chance that the strike price is better than the price in the underlying market at maturity, the option is considered "in the money" and can be [exercised](/exercise) by its owner. A [European style](/europeanoption) option requires the option be in the money on the expiration date for it to be exercised. A [American style](/americanoption) option can be exercised assuming it is in the money at the latest the expiration date.

The premium is the price paid to claim the option. The premium depends on how close the strike is to the price of the underlying (in the money, out of the money, or [at the money](/atthemoney)), the volatility of the underlying asset, and the time until expiration. Higher volatility and a longer maturity increase the premium.

An option gains [intrinsic value](/intrinsicvalue), or moves into the money, as the underlying outperforms the strike price â€” over the strike for a call and below the strike for a put.

Option traders don't have to hold on until expiry to close out an options trade, nor do they need to exercise the option. They can take an offsetting position whenever to close the options trade and understand their profit or loss on the option.

## Exotic and Binary Options

Two different types of options can be combined with vanilla options to make tailored outcomes. The main type are exotic options, which have conditions or estimations connected to their execution. For instance, barrier options incorporate a level that, whenever came to, makes the option start to exist or cease to exist. Digital options pay the owner on the off chance that the underlying is above or below a specific price level. An Asian option's payoff relies upon the average traded price of the underlying instrument during the life of the option.

The second type of options which can be combined with vanilla options are [binary options](/binary-option). The outcome of such options is typically restricted to just two potential outcomes, implying that the payouts are additionally restricted. They are typically used to conjecture on price movements of an asset. A potential combination among binary and vanilla options would be the purchase of a call/put vanilla option and a binary option the other way of the former.
