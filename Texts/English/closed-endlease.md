# Closed-End Lease
## What Is a Closed-End Lease?

A closed-end lease is a rental agreement that puts no obligation on the [lessee](/lessee) (the person making periodic [lease](/lease) payments) to purchase the leased asset toward the end of the agreement. A closed-end lease is likewise called a "genuine lease," "walkaway lease," or "net lease."

## Closed-End versus Open-End Lease

There are commonly two types of leases: an open-end lease and a closed-end lease. An open-end lease has more flexible terms and the lessee assumes the depreciation risk of the asset. In a closed-end lease, the [lessor](/lessor) takes on the [depreciation](/depreciation) risk, yet the terms are more tough. Both of these leases typically apply to vehicle leases.

Since the lessee has no obligation to purchase the leased asset upon lease expiration and doesn't need to worry about whether the asset will devalue more than expected all through the lease, it is contended that closed-end leases are better for the average person.

Most consumer leases are closed-end leases and give consistency in regularly scheduled payments over the term of the lease, in the event that you stick to the terms, for example, mileage limits for a vehicle lease. Open-end leases are more normal with organizations that depend on a large fleet of vehicles that put up a ton of miles and need more flexible terms.

## Upsides and downsides of a Closed-End Lease

Here are the great parts of a closed-end lease:

**No obligation:** Under this rental agreement the lessee isn't committed to pursue a purchase when the agreement ends.

**Predictability:** A closed-end lease generally conveys a fixed rate and a set term.

**Less anxiety:** The lessee doesn't have to worry about the asset devaluing more than expected over the span of the lease.

What's more, here are the drawbacks:

**Layered fees:** Fees might be structured on a graduated scale where the lessee pays a lump charge for the initial not many hundred miles past the limit, then a pennies for each mile fee after that.

**Unexpected expenses:** The lessee is responsible for any excess wear and tear that happens with the asset.

**Exit fees:** Ending the agreement early frequently means extra fees.

## How Closed-End Leases Are Structured

Regularly, a closed-end lease accompanies a [fixed rate](/fixedinterestrate) and a term that might run 12 months to 48 months. The lessee should terminate the agreement early, a move that frequently causes extra fees for the early exit. For vehicles secured through such an agreement, there are in many cases annual mileage limits that tend to go from 12,000 miles to 15,000 miles. In the event that the utilization of the vehicle surpasses those limits, the lessee is responsible to pay extra fees. Those fees can be founded on a set pennies for every mile penalty over.

Such fees may likewise be layered or structured on a graduated scale where the lessee pays one lump charge that covers the initial not many hundred miles past the limit, then a pennies for every mile fee past that. Besides, the lessee is responsible for any excess wear and tear that happens with the asset.

At the determination of a closed-end lease, the lessor could hope to sell the asset at its depreciated value. It is conceivable that the lessee could in any case try to purchase the asset at this new rate, and there might even be incentives offered to complete such a deal at a marked down price compared with other likely buyers.

## Illustration of a Closed-End Lease

In an open-end lease, assume your [lease payments](/lease-payments) depend on the assumption that the $20,000 new vehicle that you are leasing will be worth just $10,000 toward the end of your lease agreement. In the event that the vehicle ends up being worth just $4,000 at the time your lease is finished, you must remunerate the lessor (the company who leased the vehicle to you) for the lost $6,000 since your month to month lease payment was calculated on the basis of the vehicle having a salvage value of $10,000.

Essentially, since you are buying the vehicle, you must bear the loss of that extra depreciation. However, in the event that you have a closed-end lease, you don't need to buy the vehicle so you don't bear the risk of depreciation. Then again, likewise in a closed-end lease, on the off chance that the market value of the vehicle is worth more than $10,000 (the [residual value](/residual-value) that you would pay for buying the vehicle) it could be a wise investment to buy the vehicle in fact. For instance, in the event that the market value of the vehicle is $14,000 rather than $4,000 in the above model, you could purchase the vehicle for the $10,000 residual value, and sell it at the market price of $14,000 and make a $4,000 profit.

On the off chance that you're thinking about applying for a new line of credit to purchase a vehicle as opposed to leasing it, then, at that point, you should initially utilize a car loan calculator to determine what sort of loan term and interest rate you'll probably be confronted with in view of the price of the vehicle.
