# Imputed Interest
## What Is Imputed Interest?

The IRS utilizes imputed interest to collect tax revenues on loans or securities that pay next to zero interest. Imputed interest is important for discount bonds, for example, zero-coupon bonds and different securities sold below face value and mature [at par](/at-par). The IRS utilizes a [accretive](/accretive) method while working out the imputed interest on Treasury bonds and has [applicable federal rates](/applicablefederalrate) that set a base interest rate corresponding to imputed interest and original issue discount rules.

## Figuring out Imputed Interest

Imputed interest might apply to loans among family and friends. For instance, a mother loans her child $50,000 with no interest charges. The applicable short-term federal rate is 2 percent, so the child ought to pay his mom $1,000 yearly in interest. The IRS assumes the mother collects this amount from her child and records it on her tax return as interest income even however she didn't collect the funds.

## Applicable Federal Rates

Since there were some low-interest or without interest loans that went untaxed, the IRS laid out applicable federal rates through the Tax Act of 1984. The [AFR](/applicablefederalrate) determines the most minimal interest that one might charge on loans below a specific interest rate threshold and considers the amount of potential income generated from the interest rate as imputed income. Due to the creation of AFR, the IRS might collect tax revenue from loans that generally untaxed.

## Computing Imputed Interest on a Zero-Coupon Bond

While computing imputed interest on a [zero-coupon bond](/zero-couponbond), an investor first determines the bond's [yield to maturity](/yieldtomaturity). Assuming the accrual period is one year, the investor separates the face value of the bond by the price paid when it, he, or she purchased it. The investor then, at that point, expands the value by a power equivalent to one separated by the number of accrual periods before the bond matures. The investor lessens the number by one and duplicates by the number of accrual periods in a single year to determine the zero-coupon bond's YTM.

Since the adjusted purchase price of a zero-coupon bond is initially equivalent to its purchase price when issued, the accrued interest acquired over every accrual period adds to the adjusted purchase price. The accrued interest is the initial adjusted purchase price increased by the YTM. This value is the imputed interest for the period.

## An Example of Imputed Interest

Imputed interest is important for determining pension payouts. For instance, when an employee resigns from a company where they were a member of a pension plan, the company might offer the retired person a lump sum of the $500,000 set to the side for them under the plan, or they might receive $5,000 a year in benefits. Assuming the applicable short-term federal rate is 2 percent, the retired person needs to determine whether they could find better imputed interest in one more market by taking the lump sum and purchasing a better return annuity.
