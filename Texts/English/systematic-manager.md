# Systematic Manager
## What Is a Systematic Manager?

A systematic manager changes a portfolio's long-and short-term positions on a particular security as indicated by price [trends](/trend). Systematic managers permit a security to remain part of the [portfolio](/portfolio) as long as the price of that security stays over a predetermined level.

## Figuring out a Systematic Manager

Systematic managers endeavor to eliminate the behavioral part of investing, as certain investors accept this can cause [portfolio managers](/portfoliomanager) to become joined to [securities](/security) or trading thoughts that are presently not profitable.

The portfolio manager adopts a systematic strategy to whether a security will stay in the portfolio, and will sell the security or close the position in the event that its price no longer fits inside the laid out rules. This totally eliminates the emotional part of investing and permits the portfolio manager to go with choices in light of predetermined rules.

This investment approach is like the macro approach taken by [investment managers](/investment-manager) however is applied across numerous markets. The systematic manager may, for instance, choose to keep on holding a position as long as the [spread](/spread) between the current [market price](/market-price) and the predetermined [stop-loss](/stop-lossorder) price is positive. The longer a particular price trend has been going, the greater the difference between the market price and the stop-loss price will in general be.

## The Opposite of Discretion

Systematic managers have practically the contrary approach to investing than discretionary managers. Systematic managers stick with a trend no matter what the [fundamentals](/fundamentals) of the security, as the manager is zeroing in on the price of the security. [Discretionary managers](/discretionary-investment-the executives), then again, may inspect the fundamentals of the security to determine whether the long-term price trend seems OK.

While systematic managers basically center around long-term price trends, they might take [short-term](/shortterm) positions in securities that might conflict with the long-term trends they stick to. This is on the grounds that short-term factors, for example, a sudden [price change](/price-change), may introduce an opportunity. For instance, the manager might have a bullish perspective on oil in the [long term](/longterm) yet may take short-term positions with the expectation that the price of oil might fall.

Most [quantitative trading](/quantitative-trading) procedures are systematic in that boundaries are laid out and computer programs are put in place to consequently make trades when certain targets are reached.

## Illustration of a Systematic Manager

For instance, in its least complex form, a systematic manager might choose to buy XYZ shares at $10, and afterward set predetermined levels at which they would sell the [stock](/stock). For instance, on the off chance that the price falls to $8.50 the manager would sell and understand a loss of $1.50 or on the other hand assuming that the price ascends to $12, the manager would sell and understand a profit of $2.

Here, the portfolio manager is settling on their choice in light of the price trend. The manager isn't taking a gander at the fundamentals of the stock to check whether the price changes seem OK, by which it could bring about them holding the stock longer, notwithstanding the price developments.

For instance, on the off chance that the fundamental analysis of the stock determines the price will go to $14, however it has dropped from $10 to $8 to $7, a systematic manager would have sold it at their price level of $8.50 while a discretionary manager will hold on to it even as it has fallen to $7 in light of the fact that they accept it will go to $14.

The reality is more muddled, be that as it may. The price targets might be determined by [backtesting](/backtesting) and [technical analysis](/technicalanalysis), taking a gander at key [support levels](/support) for the shares. Trade sizes, profit targets, and a large group of different measures might become an integral factor.
