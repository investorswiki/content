## What Is Electronic Currency Trading?

Electronic currency trading is a method of trading currencies through an online broker or by means of a [online currency exchange](/online-forex-currency-exchange). Trading electronically essentially expands access to markets, lowers trading costs, smoothes out confirmation and settlement times, and guarantees [forex](/forex) markets can operate globally on a 24/7 basis without interruption.

## Understanding Electronic Currency Trading

Electronic currency traders utilize technical and fundamental analysis to forecast the movement of the currency pair being traded. Since execution speeds are incredibly fast with electronic currency trading, a trader can rapidly buy and sell to cut losses or take profits immediately.

Electronic currency trading happens 24 hours every day and is just closed in certain markets from Friday evening to Sunday evening. The 24-hour trading session is really contained three sessions in Europe, Asia and United States. Albeit the sessions overlap some, the fundamental currencies in each market are traded for the most part during their separate market hours. This means certain currency pairs will have more volume during certain sessions. Traders who stay with pairs in view of the [greenback](/greenback) will track down the most volume in the U.S. [trading session](/tradingsession).

Not long later, several other important markets started electronic trading in earnest, for example, the NASDAQ stock exchange. Today, practically all trading in forex and somewhere else is electronic. Forex traders approach several software platforms for [charting](/forex-charting-software), [forecasting](/forex-forecast-and-forecasting-software), and robotizing trades placed electronically through quite a few [currency trading platforms](/currency-trading-platforms).

## Electronic Currency Trading Pairs

Electronic currency trading happens in pairs. In contrast to the stock market, where you buy or sell single stops all at once, in the forex market you buy one currency while selling another. Most currencies are priced out to the fourth decimal point. A [pip](/pip) (or percentage in point) is the smallest augmentation of trade. One pip equals 1/100^th^ of 1 percent.

Beginning currency traders frequently trade [micro lots](/micro-part), since one pip in a micro parcel addresses just a dime move in price. Accordingly, these low stakes make losses simpler to make due. In a mini part, one pip equals $1 and that equivalent one pip in a standard parcel equals $10. A few currencies move as much as 100 pips or more in a single trading session, making expected losses to the small investor more reasonable by trading in micro or mini parts.

The majority of the volume in currency trading occurs in 18 currency pairs, compared to the a large number of stocks accessible in the global value markets. In spite of the fact that there are other traded pairs outside of these 18, the eight currencies most frequently traded are the U.S. dollar (USD), Canadian dollar (CAD), euro (EUR), British pound (GBP), Swiss franc (CHF), New Zealand dollar (NZD), Australian dollar (AUD) and the Japanese yen (JPY). In spite of the fact that no one would agree that that currency trading is simple, having less trading options makes trade and portfolio the executives more straightforward.

## Special Considerations

Not all currencies can be exchanged or changed over into another. A few countries have monetary policies that limit the convertibility of their currency. These currencies are supposed to be [nonconvertible](/nonconvertiblecurrency) or blocked. A few brokers may not handle the exchange of currencies for a [contract for differences](/contractfordifferences) (CFD). During the settlement in a CFD futures contract arrangement, cash payments substitute for the delivery of the asset.
