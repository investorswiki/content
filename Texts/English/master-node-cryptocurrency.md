# Master Node
## What Is a Master Node?

Master nodes are part of the infrastructure that supports cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Dash. Dissimilar to normal nodes, master nodes don't add new blocks of transactions to the blockchain. All things being equal, they confirm new blocks and perform special jobs in overseeing the blockchain.

## Grasping Master Nodes

There are several types of nodes that together form the infrastructure of a decentralized blockchain, all in all giving transparency and security and running the software that executes a cryptocurrency's rules and usefulness. Nodes keep up with the gigantic ledger of public transactions in a given cryptocurrency and confirm new transactions. Master nodes likewise play a special job in the management and governance of the blockchain's protocol.

Operating a master node requires a critical financial investment and running costs, remembering a huge stake for the actual cryptocurrency and computer hardware that is undeniably more costly than your average PC. It likewise requires skill. As an incentive for individuals to keep up with master nodes, administrators are compensated with cryptocurrency earnings, typically a share of block rewards.

Dash, a fork of [Bitcoin](/bitcoin), was the principal virtual currency to embrace the master node model yet numerous other cryptocurrencies have adopted the model.

## Master Nodes versus Full Nodes

Full nodes play critical jobs in keeping a cryptocurrency working. Each full node contains a whole copy of the blockchain's history of transactions and submits new blocks of transactions for verification by different nodes. Each time another block of transactions is presented, the wide range of various nodes must check the transactions before they are added to the permanent ledger. This incorporates master nodes. The difference is, master nodes generally don't submit transactions for verification â€” they just confirm those put together by different modes.

Master nodes additionally have different obligations that full nodes don't. This remembers administering voting occasions for changes to the ecosystem and executing protocol operations.

## Profitability of Master Nodes

Master nodes are viewed as a generally simple alternative to mining, expecting undeniably less skill and causing lower operating costs. In any case, it can in any case be trying to create an appealing gain from operating a master node, particularly given the generally high initial investments, including the currency stake and equipment, and running costs, for example, power charges and facilitating fees.

## Highlights
- Master nodes operate on a security based system, meaning the administrators need to possess a lot of the cryptocurrency.
- In exchange for their investment in time and money, master node administrators are compensated with guaranteed crypto earnings, normally a percentage of their stake.
- Master nodes confirm new blocks of transactions in a cryptocurrency yet dissimilar to different nodes don't submit new blocks to the network for verification.
