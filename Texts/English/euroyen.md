The "euro-" prefix in the term emerged on the grounds that initially such overseas currencies were held fundamentally in Europe, however that is not true anymore and an eurocurrency can now include any domestic currency that is held elsewhere in the world that nearby banking regulations permit.

Euroyen can likewise be alluded to as "offshore yen," and alludes to japanese yen held overseas. The offshore yen market was initially settled in December 1986 as part of the liberalization and internationalization of Japanese financial markets and increased the country's height in terms of global trade.

There are two euroyen benchmark rates: Euroyen [TIBOR](/tibor) (distributed at 1 p.m. Tokyo time, with a panel overwhelmed by Tokyo banks) and the Yen [LIBOR](/libor) (London Interbank Offered Rate, distributed at 11:55 a.m. London time with a panel overwhelmed by non-Japanese banks in London).

Both domestic JPY and euroyen TIBOR rates are distributed by the Japanese Bankers Association (JBA), yet after the LIBOR manipulation scandal broke in 2012 they have been distributed by an engaged entity called the JBA TIBOR Administration (JBATA) with an end goal to upgrade the credibility of the distributed rates.

Both Yen LIBOR and Euroyen TIBOR rates were up to speed in the [LIBOR scandal](/libor-scandal). A number of large banks, both Japanese and foreign, paid countless dollars in settlement of euroyen-related claims and associated punishments emerging from the case.
