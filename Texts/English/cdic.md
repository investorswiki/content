Insured categories incorporate checking and savings accounts, certain [investments](/investment), and foreign currency accounts. The CDIC furnishes consumers with protection against losses if financial institutions fail.

## Grasping the Canadian Deposit Insurance Corporation (CDIC)

The Canadian Deposit Insurance Corporation was framed by Parliament under the Financial Administration Act and Canada Deposit Insurance Corporation Act in 1967 to add to the stability of Canada's financial system. It furnishes consumers with insurance against the loss of [deposits](/deposit) in the event of financial institution failure. A [bank failure](/bank-failure) happens when a bank can't meet its financial obligations in light of insolvency or illiquidity.

The CDIC is like the [Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation](/fdic) (FDIC) in the U.S. It is funded by premiums paid by member institutions. All things considered, it receives no public funds to operate. Canadians don't need to apply for coverage at CDIC member banks, nor do they need to file a claim on the off chance that there is a bank failure. CDIC insurance pays out members naturally if a member institution [defaults](/default2).

The agency safeguards eligible deposits as well as interest inside the space of days that are held in member banks, including:

- Checking accounts
- Savings accounts
- [Tax-free savings accounts](/tax-free-savings-account-tfsa) (TFSAs)
- [Guaranteed investment certificates](/gic) (GICs) and other term deposits that mature in five years or less
- Money orders, bank drafts, and checks certified issued by CDIC members
- Foreign currency accounts, for example, those held in U.S. dollars
- Deposits held in certain retirement accounts, for example, [registered retirement savings plans](/rrsp) (RRSPs) and [registered retirement income funds](/rrif) (RRIFs)
- Deposits held in [registered education savings plans](/resp) (RESPs) and registered disability savings plans up to $100,000 per [beneficiary](/beneficiary) as of April 2022

Financial products that aren't eligible for coverage incorporate [mutual funds](/mutualfund), money market funds, stocks, bonds, [exchange-traded funds](/etf) (ETFs), digital and [cryptocurrencies](/cryptocurrency), voyagers' checks, treasury bills, bankers' acknowledgments, principal-protected notes, debentures issued by banks, governments and corporations, and deposits held at non-member institutions.
