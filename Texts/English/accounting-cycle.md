Electronic accounting systems and the uniform course of the accounting cycle have assisted with diminishing mathematical errors. Today, most software completely mechanizes the accounting cycle, which brings about less human exertion and errors associated with manual processing.

### Steps of the Accounting Cycle

There are eight steps to the accounting cycle.

1. **Unadjusted Trial Balance**: After the company posts journal sections to individual general ledger accounts, an unadjusted trial balance is prepared. The [trial balance](/trial_balance) guarantees that total debits equivalent the total credits in the financial records.
1. **Worksheet**: Analyzing a worksheet and distinguishing adjusting sections make up the fifth step in the cycle. A worksheet is made and used to guarantee that debits and credits are equivalent. On the off chance that there are errors, changes should be made.
1. **Adjusting Journal Entries:** At the finish of the period, [adjusting entries](/adjusting-journal-entry) are made. These are the aftereffect of revisions made on the worksheet and the outcomes from the progression of time. For instance, an adjusting entry might accrue interest revenue that has been earned in view of the progression of time.
1. **Financial Statements**: Upon the posting of adjusting sections, a company prepares an adjusted trial balance followed by the genuine formalized financial statements.
