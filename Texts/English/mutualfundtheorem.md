# Mutual Fund Theorem
## What Is the Mutual Fund Theorem?

The mutual fund theorem is an investing strategy by which [mutual funds](/mutualfund) are utilized solely in a portfolio for diversification and [mean-variance](/meanvariance-analysis) optimization. The last option term can be defined as the gauging of risk against the expected return from an investment.

## Grasping the Mutual Fund Theorem

The mutual fund theorem is the utilization of mutual fund investments in the building of a complete portfolio. The mutual fund theorem was presented by [James Tobin](/james-tobin), who worked alongside [Harry Markowitz](/harrymarkowitz) from 1955 to 1956 at the Cowles Foundation at Yale University. The mutual fund theorem follows the principles of modern portfolio theory, which Markowitz learned at the Cowles Foundation. Markowitz got the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences in 1990 for his work on modern portfolio theory.

## Modern Portfolio Theory

The mutual fund theorem makes sense of the significance of diversification in a portfolio and depicts how remembering mutual funds for a portfolio can limit its risk. The concept of mean-variance optimization introduced by Harry Markowitz — gauging the risk against the expected return — forms the basis for the theorem. Given [mean-variance](/meanvariance-analysis) optimization from modern portfolio theory methods, an investor can recognize the optimal allocations in a portfolio.

Utilizing a universe of investments, an investor can chart a [efficient frontier](/efficientfrontier) and distinguish optimal allocations directed by the [capital market line](/cml) for investing. The capital market line is an aide as a charted line along which investors can pick their risk tolerance and invest optimally as indicated by designated allocations at every interval.

Modern portfolio theory shows substantial scope in the investments that can be utilized to build an efficient frontier. The assets utilized in the development of the efficient frontier form the basis for the capital market line. Subsequently, investors can generally shift the capital market line higher by utilizing a universe of higher-performing investments at different risk levels.

## Mutual Fund Portfolio Construction

Given modern portfolio theory technical analysis, an investor can utilize modern portfolio theory to make similar graphical portrayals and directions utilizing a universe of mutual funds. An efficient frontier is built utilizing mutual funds, and a [capital market line](/cml) is made that gives the allocations to diversification.

Like modern portfolio theory, investments in risk-free assets are addressed by Treasury bills. Farther up the capital market line an investor can incorporate greater measures of higher risk assets like emerging market equity mutual funds. At the lower end of the range, an investor might invest in short-term, top caliber obligation mutual funds.

Overall, the mutual fund theorem recommends that investors can build an optimal portfolio utilizing mutual funds. This type of portfolio can increase diversification. It might likewise enjoy different benefits, like operational trading efficiencies.

## Scoring Mutual Funds

Investors seeking the best mutual funds, or the best funds for them, ought to zero in on a couple of key criteria. A standard measure used to score mutual funds is the fund investment-quality scorecard (FIQS). This measure assists investors with collect keying data in an organized manner to make informed decisions regarding the quality of a mutual fund. A FIQS does exclude every quantitative datum and may incorporate qualitative information, however all information ought to be quantifiable, for instance, the risk-return profile and return and expense information.

The key criteria for the FIQS incorporate the investment [style](/style) of the fund, for example, what the mutual fund invests in and the manager's ability to deal with the assets as per the investments' objectives. Different criteria to consider concerning the mutual fund quality are the [risk-return](/riskreturntradeoff) profile, fund size and similarity, manager tenure and structure, portfolio turnover, mutual fund expenses, total returns, and research analyst reports.

## Features
- The mutual fund theorem permits investors to chart an efficient frontier to recognize an optimal allocation.
- The theorem buys into the modern portfolio theory, where diversification can limit portfolio risk.
- Mutual fund theorem is a strategy used to develop a diversified portfolio with just mutual funds.
