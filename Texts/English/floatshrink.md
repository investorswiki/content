# Float Shrink
## What is Float Shrink

A float shrink is a reduction in the number of a company's shares available for trading. Float shrink can happen in a number of ways: through a buyback or repurchase of a company's shares; an investor procuring a large stake in a company; or even through a reverse split or share consolidation.

The term "float shrink," however, is generally usually associated with share buybacks, as this is a popular way for companies to return cash to shareholders. A float shrink achieved through a share buyback likewise reduces the total number of shares outstanding for a company, which decidedly affects [earnings per share](/eps) (EPS) and [cash flow per share](/cashflowpershare).

## Understanding Float Shrink

Share buybacks and dividend payments are favored avenues for companies to reward shareholders, yet the two are not mutually exclusive, and best companies try to reward shareholders through consistent dividend increases and regular share buybacks. A company may likewise repurchase shares to consolidate its holdings and achieve greater independence over its strategic direction, free from the control of investors clamoring for profits.

## Float Shrink Can Help Companies Outperform the Markets

Float shrink through share buybacks can help the performance of investment portfolios, as companies with consistent buybacks might outperform the broader market over longer periods of time. For example, in the fifteen years ending December 31, 2019, the S&P Buyback Index has returned an average of 11.5% yearly, compared with 9% yearly for the S&P 500 Index. This outperformance has led to renewed investor center around float shrink and the presentation of a few float shrink [exchange-traded funds](/etf) (ETFs).

Note that while float shrink can likewise be achieved through a strategic investor's acquisition of a large stake in a company, this does not have the same positive impact as a buyback, because the total number of shares outstanding remains the same.

## Example of Float Shrink

A recent example of float shrink is Apple (AAPL), which executed several share buybacks in 2018 and 2019. During the quarter ending December 28, 2019, Apple bought 70.4 million shares from investors at an average price of $284. Altogether, the Cupertino company spent $20 billion on the repurchase program. In January 2020, it reported results that exceeded analyst expectations. By then its stock price had jumped by 12% to $327 (before a 4-to-1 share split).

As an example of what float shrink can mean for EPS, consider a company that has 50 million shares outstanding, with a float of 35 million shares. The shares are trading at $15, for a market capitalization of $750 million. The company reports net income of $50 million in a given year for an EPS of $1. In the next year, it repurchases 5 million of its shares on the open market. This buyback adds up to 10 percent of its total outstanding shares, or 14.3 percent of the float (i.e. 5 million \u00f7 35 million). As a result, it currently has 45 million shares outstanding toward the end of the second year.

Assume the company achieves net income of $55 million in the second year. While [net income](/netincome) has increased 10 percent because of the share buyback, EPS is currently at $1.22 (i.e. $55 million \u00f7 $45 million), an increase of 22 percent.

Recall that shares were trading at $15 toward the end of the main year, for a [price-earnings ratio](/price-earningsratio) (P/E) of 15. Accepting that the P/E ratio is unchanged toward the end of the second year, the shares ought to be trading at $18.30 (i.e. P/E of 15 x EPS of $1.22).
