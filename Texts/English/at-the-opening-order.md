# At-the-Opening Order
## What Is an At-the-Opening Order?

An at-the-opening order is an investor's directive to her broker or brokerage firm to buy or sell a specific security in their account at the earliest reference point of the trading day. In the event that the order can't be executed at the opening of the stock market, it will be canceled.

## How At-the-Opening Orders Work

An investor could place an at-the-opening order in light of something that occurred after the market closed on the previous trading day that is expected to influence the stock's opening price on the accompanying trading day. An indication of the opening price of a stock might be given by [pre-market trading](/premarket) activity, if applicable, especially in the event that important news, for example, a quarterly earnings report or announcement of a huge [corporate action](/corporateaction) raises a ruckus around town before the market formally opens in the morning.

An at-the-opening order may not be executed at the security's careful opening price, however it ought to be inside the opening reach.

The normal trading hours for the two biggest stock exchanges in the U.S., the [New York Stock Exchange](/nyse) (NYSE) and the [Nasdaq](/nasdaq) are from 9:30 a.m. to 4 p.m. Eastern time, Monday through Friday. This prohibits stock market occasions. In this manner, at-the-opening orders are executed right at 9:30 a.m. the next day.

## Presenting an At-the-Opening Order
