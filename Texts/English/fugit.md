# Fugit
## What Is Fugit?

Fugit, from the latin **tempus fugit,** is the amount of time that an investor accepts is left until it would as of now not be beneficial to exercise a [option](/option) early, or the probability that an American-style option will be exercised before it expires.

The fugit concept was named and made by the economist Mark Garman, a Berkeley teacher who read up the optimal time for exercising an American option priced utilizing [binomial trees](/binomial_tree).

## Grasping Fugit

Fugit is a term utilized in options trading, borrowed from Latin. Specifically, it starts from a refrain in the legendary sonnet **Georgica,** which was written by the Roman poet Virgil: "**sed fugit interea fugit irreparabile tempus.**" In English, this means: "however it escapes in the mean time" or "hopeless time escapes." It alludes to the early exercise feature given to holders of American-style options (and which is missing from [European](/europeanoption)- style options).

Except if an option is [deep in the money,](/deepinthemoney) it ought to typically not be exercised early on the grounds that this causes a loss of inherent value. It would be more financially savvy to keep the option as opposed to changing over it into a [long](/long) or [short position](/short) in the underlying security. A few investors find it beneficial to exercise call options early when they are in the money right before a [ex-dividend](/ex-dividend) date, or deep in the money puts that have close to a 100 [delta](/delta).

Given an option that is a possible candidate for early exercise, the holder of the option will process its fugit to check whether it ought to for sure be exercised or not. Fugit is registered as the expected time staying to exercise an American option, or alternatively, as the risk-neutral expected life of an option during which it can in any case be actually [hedged](/fence). The calculation for the most part requires a binomial tree model and may not necessarily in every case show up at one unique value.

## Special Considerations

Fugit calculations are additionally utilized with [Bermudian](/bermuda) options, contracts that must be exercised on predetermined dates, frequently on one day every month. The concept is likewise utilized for determining if and when to use the feature to change debt over completely to equity for [convertible bonds](/convertiblebond).

Nassim Taleb, options trader and the writer of the book **The Black Swan: The Impact of the Highly Improbable**, proposes an alternative to the fugit calculation, which he calls a "rho fudge," or the option's **Omega** = **Nominal Duration x (Rho2 of an American option/Rho2 of an European option).** Note that Taleb utilizes various purposes of the words rho (generally connected with interest rate sensitivity) and omega (customarily connected with price sensitivity and furthermore known as the lambda). Here the omega is much the same as fugit, and the rho2 is an option's price sensitivity to dividend payments.

### Ascertaining Fugit

The calculation for an option's fugit is as per the following: where **n** is the number of time-steps in the binomial tree; **t** is the time staying to the option's expiration, and **i** is the current time-step in the binomial tree.

To start with, set the fugit value of every one of the nodes toward the finish of the binomial tree equivalent to **i = n.** Then, working backward: in the event that the option ought to be exercised at a specific node, set the fugit at that node equivalent to its period; or the consequences will be severe in the event that the option ought not be exercised at a specific node, set the fugit to the risk-neutral expected fugit throughout the next period. The value showed up at in this fashion toward the beginning of the main period (I = 0) is the current fugit. At last, to annualize the fugit, increase the subsequent value by **t/n**.

## Features
- The concept was formalized by Mark Garman, a Berkeley economist, involving binomial tree models to recognize the optimal conditions for early exercise.
- Fugit calculations are likewise utilized for timing Bermudian options and convertible bonds.
- Fugit is time staying for an American option until it is as of now not beneficial for early exercise.
- Fugit can likewise be deciphered as the likelihood that such an option's exercise feature will be utilized prior to expiration.
