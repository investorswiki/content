## What Is the National Securities Markets Improvement Act (NSMIA)?

The National Securities Markets Improvement Act is a law passed in 1996 that tried to work on securities regulation in the U.S. by allocating more regulatory power to the federal government.

## Understanding National Securities Markets Improvement Act (NSMIA)

The National Securities Markets Improvement Act (NSMIA) amended the Investment Company Act of 1940 and the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and came full circle on Jan. 1, 1997. Its fundamental result was to increase the authority of federal regulators to the detriment of their state-level partners, a change that was expected to increase the productivity of the financial services industry.

Prior to the NSMIA, state-level [Blue Sky laws](/blueskylaws), which were passed to shield retail investors from scams, were impressively more powerful. Be that as it may, in light of the fact that the securities subject to this regulation were at that point subject to heavy federal regulation, it's reasonable these laws pumped the brakes in the market. The NSMIA decreased the amount of interaction between contending regulatory agencies by transferring the vast majority of the state's regulatory power to the federal government, specifically the [Securities and Exchange Commission](/sec) (SEC).

The law states that ["covered" securities](/coveredsecurity) are exempt from being required to go through the state's regulatory agencies. Today, most stocks traded in the U.S. are viewed as covered securities. Notwithstanding the offers and sales of certain exempt securities, the NSMIA characterizes "covered" securities as securities that:

- Are listed on national securities exchanges, for example, the [New York Stock Exchange](/nyse) and the [Nasdaq](/nasdaq)
- Are issued by an "investment company that is registered, or that has documented a registration statement, under the Investment Company Act of 1940"

## History of the National Securities Markets Improvement Act (NSMIA)

Before the NSMIA was enacted in 1996, the states' blue sky laws had huge regulatory power over capital formation in the securities market. The term "blue sky law" is said to have originated in the mid 1900s, acquiring far and wide use when a Kansas Supreme Court justice declared his craving to shield investors from speculative endeavors that had "no more basis than such countless feet of 'blue sky.'"

This law proved to be especially fundamental after the [stock market crash in 1929](/stock-market-crash-1929). There was a lot of uncertainty during this time and investors didn't have full trust that the stocks they were investing in were genuine. In fact, many companies issued stock, advanced real estate, and other investment bargains while making grandiose, unconfirmed cases of greater profits to come. As of now, the SEC didn't yet exist and there was minimal regulatory oversight of the investment and financial industry as a whole.

Notwithstanding, starting from the creation of the SEC and headways in technology and [ledger](/generalledger) systems, blue sky laws basically copy the regulatory measures forced by the SEC which can dial back capital formation, especially among more modest organizations.

## Features
- The NSMIA provisions just exempt "covered" securities (nationally traded stocks and mutual funds) from state-level regulation.
- The National Securities Markets Improvement Act looked to increase proficiency in the securities market by making not so much difficult but rather more effective regulation.
- The NSMIA advanced proficiency by diminishing the amount of interaction between contending regulatory agencies, specifically among states and the SEC.
