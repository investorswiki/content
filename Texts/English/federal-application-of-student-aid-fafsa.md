- **Grants**, sometimes alluded to as scholarships, are intended for students with "outstanding financial need" and don't need to be repaid. The present most common federal awards for education are known as [Pell Grants](/pell-award).

Notwithstanding, federal loans will generally have low interest rates compared with those available from private lenders, notwithstanding better repayment terms. There are several types of federal loans for higher education, sometimes alluded to as [Stafford Loans](/stafford-credit). Direct sponsored loans have the best terms and are available just to families with financial need. Direct unsubsidized loans are available to families paying little heed to financial need. Direct PLUS loans, are available to parents and graduate or professional students, paying little heed to financial need, in spite of the fact that borrowers must have an acceptable credit history.

The FAFSA, which is administered by the office of Federal Student Aid, is the entryway to these types of aid.
