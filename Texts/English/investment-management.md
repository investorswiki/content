This figure was more than US $100 Trillion by year end 2019.

## Running an Investment Management Firm

Running an investment management business includes numerous obligations. The firm must hire professional managers to deal, market, settle, and prepare reports for clients. Different duties incorporate leading internal reviews and researching individual assets — or asset classes and industrial sectors.

Beside hiring marketers and training managers who direct the flow of investments, the individuals who head investment management firms must guarantee they move inside legislative and regulatory limitations, inspect internal systems and controls, account for cash flow and appropriately history transactions and fund valuations.

As a general rule, investment managers who have no less than $25 million in assets under management (AUM) or who give counsel to investment companies offering mutual funds are required to be [registered investment advisors](/ria) (RIA).

Since the mid-2000s, the industry has likewise faced difficulties from two different sources.

1. The increase of robo-advisors — advanced platforms that give automated, algorithm-driven investment strategies and asset allocation
1. The availability of exchange-traded funds, whose portfolios mirror that of a benchmark list

The last hinderance embodies passive management since few investment choices must be made by human fund managers. The former test doesn't utilize human creatures by any means — other than the developer composing the algorithm. Subsequently, both can charge far lower fees than human fund managers can charge. Nonetheless, as per some reviews, these cheaper alternatives will frequently outperform actively managed funds — either outright or in terms of overall return — basically due to them not having heavy fees hauling them down.

However a few clients take a gander at the performance of individual investment managers, others check out the overall performance of the firm. One key indication of an investment management company's ability isn't just how much money their clients make in great times — yet the way in which little they lose in the terrible.
