# Market Capitalization
Within the blockchain industry, the term market capitalization (or market cap) alludes to a metric that measures the relative size of a cryptocurrency. It is calculated by duplicating the current market price of a specific [coin](/coin) or token with the total number of coins in circulation.
Market Cap = Current Price x Circulating Supply
For instance, in the event that every unit of a cryptocurrency is being traded at $10.00, and the [circulating supply](/circulating-supply) is equivalent to 50,000,000 coins, the market capitalization for this cryptocurrency would be $500,000,000.
While the market cap might offer a few experiences about the size and performance of a company or [cryptocurrency](/cryptocurrency) project, it is important to note that it isn't equivalent to money inflow. In this way, it doesn't address how much money is in the market. This is a common misguided judgment on the grounds that the calculation of market cap is straightforwardly dependent on price, yet truth be told, a relatively small variation in price might influence the market cap fundamentally.
Taking into account the previous model, two or three great many dollars might actually pump the cryptocurrency price from $10.00 to $15.00, which would cause the market cap to increase from $500,000,000 to $750,000,000. Notwithstanding, this doesn't mean there was an inflow of $250,000,000 in the market. As a matter of fact, the amount of money expected to cause such an increase in price is dependent on volume and [liquidity](/liquidity), which are distinct however related concepts.
While volume connects with the number of assets traded within a certain period, liquidity is fundamentally the degree to which the asset can be immediately bought or sold without causing too much impact on the price.
Basically, a high-volume and liquid market won't be quickly controlled in light of the fact that there are many orders in the order book and perhaps a big volume of orders within the various scopes of price. This would result in a less [volatile](/unpredictability) market, meaning that a whale would require large chunk of change to control the price fundamentally.
Interestingly, a thin order book of a low-volume market could be effectively overpassed with a relatively small amount of money, causing a critical impact on both the price and market cap.
