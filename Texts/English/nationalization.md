## What Is Nationalization?

Nationalization alludes to the action of a government assuming command over a company or industry, which generally happens without compensation for the loss of the [net worth](/networth) of held onto assets and possible income. The action might be the consequence of a country's endeavor to [consolidate power](/consolidate), hatred of foreign ownership of industries addressing huge significance to nearby economies or to prop up bombing industries.

## Grasping Nationalization

Nationalization is more normal in emerging nations. [Privatization](/privatization), which is the transfer of government-run operations [into the private business sector](/private-sector), happens all the more every now and again in developed countries.

Nationalization is one of the primary risks for companies carrying on with work in foreign countries due to the capability of having huge assets seized without compensation. This risk is amplified in countries with unsteady political leadership and stale or contracting economies. The key outcome of nationalization is the redirection of incomes to the country's government rather than private administrators who might export funds with no benefit to the host country.

## Nationalization and Oil

The oil industry has encountered nationalization actions for quite a long time, dating back to Mexico's nationalization of the assets of foreign producers, for example, Royal Dutch and Standard Oil in 1938 and Iran's nationalization of the assets of Anglo-Iranian 1951. The consequence of Mexico's nationalization of foreigners' oil assets was the creation of PEMEX, which is one of the biggest oil producers in the world. After the nationalization of Anglo-Iranian, Iran's economy fell into confusion, and Britain was permitted back in as a half partner a couple of years after the fact. In 1954, Anglo-Iranian was renamed the British Petroleum Company.

In 2007, Venezuela nationalized Exxon Mobil's Cerro Negro Project and different assets. Seeking $16.6 billion in compensation, Exxon Mobil was granted roughly 10% of that amount by a World Bank arbitration panel in 2014.

## Nationalization in the United States

The United States has technically nationalized several companies, generally as a bailout in which the government claims a controlling interest. The bailouts of AIG in 2008 and General Motors Company in 2009 amounted to nationalization, yet the U.S. government applied almost no control over these companies. The government additionally nationalized the weak Continental Illinois Bank and Trust in 1984, at long last selling it to Bank of America in 1994.

Notwithstanding the brief idea of most nationalization actions in the United States, there are exemptions. Amtrak was transferred to government ownership after several railroad companies failed in 1971. After the dread assaults of Sept. 11, 2001, the airport security industry was nationalized under the [Transportation Security Administration (TSA)](/tsa-pre).
