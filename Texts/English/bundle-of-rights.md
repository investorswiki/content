South Carolina Coastal Commission, it was laid out that in view of the bundle of rights, removing a property owner's right to foster the property is the same as removing the property through and through. David Lucas, the owner of ocean facing land in South Carolina, was denied formative rights in light of the state's mission to save the land and give ocean side access to the public. The state didn't give compensation to Lucas' loss until after the case went to the U.S. High Court. This court case reinforced the bundle of rights laws that property ownership reaches out past just the physical possession of real estate.
