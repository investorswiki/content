# Sweep-To-Fill Order
## What is a Sweep-To-Fill Order?

A sweep-to-fill order is a type of [market order](/marketorder) in which a broker splits the order into various parts to exploit the order sizes at the best prices as of now offered on the market. A sweep-to-fill order is executed quickly founded on the best conceivable price and permits the investor to enter a trade at the earliest opportunity. Sweep-to-fill orders can have limits ([limit order](/limitorder)) joined to them, which controls the highest price paid to buy, or the least price sold at.

## Figuring out the Sweep-To-Fill Order

The order takes a gander at price and afterward at the available [liquidity](/liquidity) at each price. Assuming a trader needs to sell 100,000 shares and needs to utilize a sweep-to-fill order, the order will search at the highest available cost (typically the best bid price) across every single available exchange, and the amount shares available costing that much. On the off chance that 100,000 are not available to be purchased, it will focus on the next highest price and the shares available there, and repeat this interaction until the full order size can be filled.

In a few vigorously traded stocks such an order wouldn't essentially change the price by its execution. Anyway in thinly traded stocks, those that trade under 100,000 shares each day on average, such an order could make a substantial drop down in the stock's price. Thus brokers and traders are careful about the utilization of such an order.

It does this until the whole order ought to be filled, and afterward conveys individual orders at each cost and share amount.

While this is like a market order in that the order is attempting to take all liquidity until the order is [filled](/fill), a sweep-to-fill order can have a limit connected to it, controlling how far the order looks for liquidity. For instance, to buy, they might need to buy however much they can yet up to a certain price. They could utilize a sweep-to-fill order to do this.

Sweep-to-fill order processing is more normal with large orders. Retail investors need to determine the utilization of a sweep-to-fill order on the off chance that they wish to execute along these lines, and not all brokers offer this order type.

## Sweep-To-Fill Order Processing

Sweep-to-fill orders are worked with by broker-dealers with technology for accessing a broad scope of exchanges and trading scenes called [electronic communication networks](/ecn) (ECNs). In a sweep-to-fill order, a broker-dealer will fill the order at different market prices giving the investor an average buying price.

Most broker-dealers have technology systems linked to every one of the major exchanges, electronic communication networks (ECNs), and some might access [dark pools](/dark-pool) also. At the point when an order is set, it is shipped off the exchanges in the broker's all's network to snatch all the available liquidity, starting at the best price, and taking liquidity at progressively more regrettable prices until the order is filled. On the other hand, the order will do the above until the limit price set on the order is reached.

## Presently not a Necessary Order

This order type isn't utilized much by retail traders. The exchanges are so interlinked, and any exchange or ECN in the U.S. posting a noticeable order will appear on the order book for that stock. [An order can't be filled at a price outside the best bid or offer](/guideline nms). While the bid or offer can change, another will be shown, and afterward transactions can't happen outside those levels until that multitude of shares are gone and afterward another bid/ask price is revealed.

Along these lines, any limit or market order will sweep the book, since it takes all shares at the best available price, and afterward moves to take every one of the shares at the next best price, etc, until the order is filled.

All things considered, a few brokers actually offer this order type. While most retail investors will find little benefit to it well beyond utilizing traditional limit or market orders, a few institutional investors might find it gradually further develops their execution price however that is in no way, shape or form guaranteed. Institutional investors will regularly try out order types to see which gives the better execution rate over many trades, and afterward will incline toward the more efficient types.

## Illustration of a Sweep-to-Fill Order

Expect a trader is keen on buying Ali Baba Inc. (BABA), and needs to get into the trade right at this point. They need to buy 10,000 shares. The price is swaying around $160.60, however there is something like 500 shares typically appearing on the order book at each price level. However, greater, or more modest, liquidity might pop up at various prices. A sweep-to-fill order will take a gander at all available liquidity and afterward convey orders to get all the available liquidity at the different price levels until the order is filled.

Accept the trader includes the extra expectation that they need to limit their buying to $160.70.

There are 500 shares posted at $160.61, 1,200 shares at $160.62, 900 at $160.63, 200 at $160.64, 5,000 at $160.65, 500 at $160.66, 1,000 at $160.67, and 2,000 at $161.68.

The sweep-to-fill order takes a gander at this multitude of prices and volumes and afterward conveys an order at each cost and volume amount. It will take every one of the shares at every one of the prices until it fills, so it will just take 700 at $161.68 rather than the full 2,000 available. This is since, supposing that it gets the wide range of various shares prior, it will arrive at the 10,000 required shares with just taking 700 at $161.68.

Another simple model uncovers why this order type isn't utilized regularly in modern markets. The sweep-to-fill is breaking an order up, however orders can't be filled outside the best bid/offer. Accept that somebody is just showing they are offering 500 shares at $161.61, yet they are truth be told utilizing a [iceberg order](/icebergorder) and have 50,000 shares offered there.

The sweep-to-fill hits a barrier in that that multitude of orders at various prices are futile until the prices of those orders are reached. In this way, most brokerage software will acknowledge there is liquidity at the $160.61 and keep on filling the order at the best price available ($160.61 right now) until it is filled. This is likewise the way that a limit order works. The trader might have set a [buy limit](/buy-limit-order) up to $160.70 and the order would have taken all liquidity at the best price available until the 10,000 shares were filled.

## Features
- It does this by breaking the order up into different pieces at each cost and volume amount.
- A sweep-to-fill order is a type of market order that fills by taking all liquidity at the best price, then all liquidity at the next best price, etc, until the order is filled.
- Since exchanges and ECNs in the U.S. are so interconnected and are completely used to make the best bid and offer available on the [order book](/order-book), traditional limit orders are regularly just as effective for executing quick trades for the retail trader.
