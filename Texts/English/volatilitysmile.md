# Volatility Smile
## What Is a Volatility Smile?

A volatility smile is a common graph shape that results from plotting the strike price and [implied volatility](/iv) of a group of options with a similar underlying asset and [expiration date](/expiration-date). The volatility smile is so named because it seems to be a smiling mouth. Implied volatility rises when the underlying asset of an option is further [out of the money](/outofthemoney) (OTM), or [in the money](/inthemoney) (ITM), compared to [at the money](/atthemoney) (ATM). The volatility smile doesn't have any significant bearing to all options.

## What Does a Volatility Smile Tell You?

Volatility smiles are made by implied volatility changing as the underlying asset moves more ITM or OTM. The more an option is ITM or OTM, the greater its implied volatility becomes. Implied volatility will in general be least with ATM options.

The volatility smile isn't anticipated by the [Black-Scholes](/blackscholes) model, which is one of the primary formulas used to price options and different derivatives. The Black-Scholes model predicts that the implied volatility curve is flat when plotted against changing strike prices. In view of the model, it would be expected that the implied volatility would be no different for all options terminating on a similar date with a similar underlying asset, no matter what the strike price. Yet, in reality, this isn't the case.

Volatility smiles began occurring in options pricing after the [1987 stock market crash](/stock-market-crash-1987). They were absent in U.S. markets beforehand, demonstrating a market structure more in accordance with what the Black-Scholes model predicts. After 1987, traders realized that extreme occasions could occur and that markets have a huge skew. The possibility for extreme occasions should have been factored into options pricing. Accordingly, in reality, implied volatility increments or diminishes as options move more ITM or OTM.

Additionally, the volatility smile's presence shows that ITM and OTM options will generally be more in demand than ATM options. Demand drives prices, which influences implied volatility. This could be somewhat due to the explanation referenced previously. Extreme occasions can occur, causing huge price shifts in options. The potential for large moves is factored into implied volatility.

## Illustration of How to Use the Volatility Smile

Volatility smiles should be visible while contrasting various options and a similar underlying asset and same expiration date but unique strike prices. In the event that the implied volatility is plotted for every one of the different strike prices, then, at that point, there might be a U-shape. The U-shape isn't generally basically as impeccably framed as portrayed in the graph above.

For a rough estimate of whether an option has a U-shape, pull up a [options chain](/optionchain) that rundowns the implied volatility of the various strike prices. On the off chance that the option has a U-shape, options that are ITM and OTM by an equal amount should have roughly a similar implied volatility. The further ITM or OTM, the greater the implied volatility, with the most minimal implied volatilities close to the ATM options. In the event that this isn't the case, then the option doesn't line up with a volatility smile.

The implied volatility of a single option likewise could be plotted over the long run relative to the price of the underlying asset. As the price moves in or out of the money, the implied volatility might take on some type of a U-shape.

This can be useful assuming seeking an option that has lower implied volatility. In this case, pick an option close to the money. If searching for greater implied volatility, pick an option that is further ITM or OTM. Keep in mind, though, as the underlying asset draws nearer to or farther from the strike price, this will influence the implied volatility. Thusly, keeping a portfolio of options with a specific implied volatility will require continual reshuffling.

Not all options line up with the volatility smile. Before using the volatility smile to aid in settling on trading choices, check to ensure that the option's implied volatility actually follows the smile model.

## The Difference Between a Volatility Smile and a Volatility Skew/Smirk

While close term equity options and [forex](/forex) options lean more toward lining up with a volatility smile, index options and long-term equity options will quite often adjust more to a [volatility skew](/volatility-skew). The skew/grin shows that implied volatility might be higher for ITM or OTM options.

## Limitations of Using the Volatility Smile

In the first place, it is important to determine in the event that the option being traded actually lines up with a volatility smile. The volatility smile is one model that an option might line up with, but implied volatility could adjust more to a [reverse or forward skew](/skewness)/grin.

Likewise, due to other market factors, such as supply and demand, the volatility smile (if applicable) may not be a clean U-shape (or grin). It might have a fundamental U-shape but could be choppy, with certain options showing pretty much implied volatility than would be expected in view of the model.

The volatility smile features where traders should look in the event that they need pretty much implied volatility, yet there are numerous different factors to consider while settling on an options-trading choice.

## Features
- Options with the most reduced implied volatility have strike prices at the money (ATM) or close to the money.
- A single option's implied volatility may likewise follow the volatility smile as it moves more ITM or OTM.
- The smile shows that the options that are furthest in the money (ITM) or out of the money (OTM) have the highest implied volatility.
- Not all options will have an implied volatility smile. Close term equity options and currency-related options are bound to have a volatility smile.
- At the point when options with a similar expiration date and a similar underlying asset, but with various strike prices, are graphed for implied volatility, the inclination is for that graph to show a smile.
- While implied volatility is one factor in options pricing, it isn't the main factor. A trader must know about the thing different factors are driving an option's price and volatility.
