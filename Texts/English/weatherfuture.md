# Weather Future
## What Is Weather Future?

Weather future is a type of [weather derivative](/weatherderivative) where the settlements depend on the aggregate difference in the measured weather variable, generally the recorded temperature, over a fixed period.

## Figuring out Weather Futures

Weather [futures](/futurescontract) enable organizations to safeguard themselves against losses brought about by unexpected changes in weather conditions. While organizations might have property-setback insurance policies to cover physical damage brought about by relatively rare weather-related occasions, for example, a windstorm or hail, these insurance policies won't cover economic losses in the event that customers aren't able to appear due to heavy rain, or on the other hand assuming harvests fail to flourish in hot weather.

Weather futures jumped up in the mid 1990s as a way for firms to hedge their weather exposure in view of changes to indexes that measure changes in average daily temperatures.

Basically, a weather future commits the buyer to purchase the cash value of the underlying weather index. The most common weather future contract applies to the recorded temperature, measured in [heating degree days](/heatingdegreeday) (HDD) or [cooling degree days](/colddegreeday) (CDD), sometime not too far off. The settlement price of the underlying weather index is normally equivalent to the value of the applicable month's HDD/CDD increased by $20.

A HDD is defined as the number of degrees that daily's average temperature is below 65^o^ Fahrenheit (18^o^ Celsius). On the other hand, a CDD is the number of degrees that daily's average temperature is above 65^o^ Fahrenheit (18^o^ Celsius). 65^0^ was picked as a [benchmark](/benchmark) by the energy sector to portray the temperature where negligible heating or cooling happens in office structures. Payout is dependent on the cumulative difference in the daily temperatures relative to the benchmark (65^0^) over a fixed period.

The buyer of a HDD weather futures contract will remain to gain in the event that the cumulative temperature is below the predetermined level as heating happens when temperatures are lower. The inverse would be true for the buyer of a CDD weather futures contract, where they will remain to gain on the off chance that the cumulative temperature is over the predetermined level as cooling happens when temperatures are higher.

The prevalence of weather futures is developing quickly and turning into a more normal method for energy companies or agricultural producers to [hedge](/hedge) against a change in demand due to changes in temperature. For instance, in the event that the long stretch of October is surprisingly warm, customers won't use as much intensity. This will cause a loss for the energy company. If, notwithstanding, the energy company has sold a weather future for the period of October, the energy company will receive the value of October's HDD, giving compensation to its losses.

It has been estimated that generally 20% of the American economy is inclined to be impacted straight by the weather and that the profitability for basically every industry sector — e.g., agriculture, energy, travel and diversion, and construction, to give some examples — rely upon variances in temperature, wind, and precipitation. During sworn declaration to Congress in 1998, former commerce secretary William Daley suggested, "Weather isn't just an environmental issue, it is a major economic factor. Something like $1 trillion of our economy is weather-touchy."

## Weather Futures and CME

In 1999, the [Chicago Mercantile Exchange](/cme) (CME) presented exchange-traded weather futures, as well as [options](/choice) on those futures, interestingly. Beforehand, [over-the-counter](/otc) (OTC) weather derivatives were privately negotiated, individualized agreements made between two gatherings.

The CME weather futures and options on futures are normalized contracts traded publicly on the open market in an electronic auction type of environment, with continuous negotiation of prices and complete price transparency, measured in heating degree days (HDD) or cooling degree days (CDD).

CME listed weather futures utilize such indexes to reflect month to month and seasonal average temperatures for 15 U.S. what's more, five European urban communities, and they are [cash-settled](/cashsettlement) futures. These contracts' settlement not set in stone by the last month to month or seasonal index value as calculated by the Earth Satellite (EarthSat) Corp, a global corporation having some expertise in geographic data systems (GIS). Other firms will decide values for non-CME traded futures contracts.
