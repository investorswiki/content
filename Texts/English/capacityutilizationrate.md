Capacity utilization rate is a key measurement for a business or a national economy. It shows the slack in the organization at a given point in time.

A company that has a utilization rate of under 100% can, hypothetically, increase its production without causing the extra costly overhead costs that are associated with purchasing new equipment or property.

A national economy with a ratio of under 100% can pinpoint areas in which its production levels can be increased without massive costs or disruption.

## Corporate Capacity Utilization Rates

The capacity utilization rate is utilized by companies to evaluate their current operating effectiveness.

It additionally gives understanding into the cost structure of the business in the short term or long term since it tends to be utilized to determine the place where unit costs will rise as it increases production.

In this case, company executives might reason that they can securely increase production to 15,000 without investing in extra equipment.

> Capacity utilization rates for the U.S. economy have been distributed by the Federal Reserve since the 1960s. Its deepest decline happened in 2009 when capacity utilization tumbled to 66.7%. In the fourth quarter of 2020, it was at 73.4%.

## Historical Capacity Utilization Rates

The Federal Reserve accumulates and distributes data on capacity utilization in the U.S. economy.

As a matter of fact, the Fed calculates capacity utilization rates for 89 industry sub-sectors incorporating 71 in manufacturing, 16 in mining, and two in gas and electric utilities.

## Capacity Utilization Rate FAQs

Here are the responses to a few normally posed inquiries about the capacity utilization rate.

### How Is Capacity Utilization Measured?
