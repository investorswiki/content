# Activity-Based Budgeting (ABB)
## What is Activity-Based Budgeting (ABB)?

Activity-based budgeting (ABB) is a system that records, investigates, and breaks down [activities](/business-activities) that lead to costs for a company. Each activity in an organization that causes a cost is examined for expected ways of making [efficiencies](/proficiency). [Budgets](/budget) are then developed based on these outcomes.

Activity-based budgeting (ABB) is more thorough than traditional budgeting processes, which will generally just change previous budgets to account for [inflation](/inflation) or business development.

## How Activity-Based Budgeting (ABB) Works

[Keeping costs to a minimum](/cost-control) is a urgent part of business management. When done actually and not too exorbitantly, companies ought to have the option to keep up with and keep becoming their [revenues](/revenue), while crushing out higher [profits](/benefit) from them.

Utilizing activity-based budgeting (ABB) can assist companies with lessening the activity levels required to generate sales. Wiping out superfluous costs ought to help profitability.

The activity-based budgeting (ABB) process is broken down into three stages.

1. Recognize significant activities. These [cost drivers](/activity-cost-driver) are the things responsible for bringing about revenue or expenses for the company.
1. Decide the number of units connected with every activity. This number is the baseline for computations.
1. Portray the [cost per unit](/unitcost) of activity and increase that outcome by the activity level.

## Activity-Based Budgeting (ABB) Vs. Traditional Budgeting Processes

Activity-based budgeting (ABB) is an alternative budgeting practice. Traditional methods are more oversimplified, adjusting prior period budgets to account for inflation or revenue growth. As opposed to utilizing past budgets to work out how much a firm will spend in the current year, activity-based budgeting (ABB) digs further.

Activity-based budgeting (ABB) isn't required for all companies. For instance, laid out firms that experience negligible change normally track down that applying a flat rate to data from the previous year to reflect business growth and inflation is adequate.

Conversely, more up to date companies without access to historical budgeting data can't look at this as an option. Activity-based budgeting (ABB) is likewise liable to be carried out by firms going through material changes, for example, those with new [subsidiaries](/auxiliary), huge customers, business areas, or products. In these types of cases, historical data may as of now not be a valuable basis for future budgeting.

## Illustration of Activity-Based Budgeting

Company An expects to get 50,000 sales orders in the impending year, with each single order costing $2 to process. Hence, the activity-based budget (ABB) for the expenses connecting with processing sales orders for the impending year is $100,000 ($50,000 * $2).

This figure might be compared to a traditional approach to budgeting. Assuming last year's budget called for $80,000 of sales order processing expenses and sales were expected to become 10%, just $88,000 ($80,000 + ($80,000 * 10%)) is budgeted.

## Benefits and Disadvantages of Activity-Based Budgeting

Activity-based budgeting (ABB) systems consider more control over the budgeting system. Revenue and expense planning happens at an exact level that gives helpful insights about projections. ABB considers management to have increased control over the budgeting system and to adjust the budget to overall company objectives.

Sadly, these benefits include some significant downfalls. Activity-based budgeting (ABB) is more costly to carry out and keep up with than traditional budgeting procedures and additional tedious too. Also, ABB systems need extra suspicions and knowledge from management, which can, every so often, bring about potential budgeting errors.
