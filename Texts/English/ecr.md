# Earnings Credit Rate (ECR)
## What Is the Earnings Credit Rate (ECR)?

The earnings credit rate (ECR) is a daily calculation of interest that a bank pays on customer [deposits](/deposit). The earnings credit rate is frequently associated with the U.S. [Treasury bill (T-bill)](/treasurybill) rate.

ECRs are rates that banks ascribe to offset service charges. Since depositors leave balances in non-interest bearing accounts, the bank will apply an ECR on those balances and utilize that as a credit for services. For instance, a corporate treasurer with a $250,000 collected balance getting a 2% ECR would earn $5,000 to offset services. ECR is frequently credited consequently.

## Understanding the Earnings Credit Rate

Banks might utilize ECRs to reduce fees customers pay for other banking services. These could incorporate checking and savings accounts, debit and credit cards, business loans, extra merchant services, (for example, credit card processing and check assortment, reconciliation, and reporting), and cash management services (e.g., [payroll](/payroll)).

ECRs are paid on [idle funds](/idlefunds), which reduce bank [service charges](/service-charge). Customers with bigger deposits and balances will generally pay lower bank fees. ECRs are apparent on almost the majority of U.S. commercial account examinations and billing statements.

Banks might have great caution for deciding the earnings allowance. While the earnings credit rate can offset fees, depositors need to note that they are just being charged for services you use, not in blend with others.

## History of the Earnings Credit Rate

The idea of an earnings credit rate originated with [Regulation Q (Reg Q)](/regulationq), which precluded banks from paying interest on deposits in checking accounts (set up for transactional purposes). Following the 1933 Glass-Steagall Act, many trusted this practice would restrict advance sharking and other such predatory actions.

The act in this manner upheld consumers in letting funds out of checking accounts and shifting them to money market funds. Following Regulation Q, many banks chose to offer "delicate dollar" credits on these non-interest bearing accounts to offset banking services.

Normally, the ECR is applied against "collected" balances, not "record" or "floating" balances. Lockbox accounts and other depository accounts possess float since it takes energy for the deposits to clear. While these things are "floating," the funds are not accessible. Collected balances are what you have cleared and accessible to transfer or invest.

## Special Considerations

At the point when money market funds yield close to zero (e.g., during the 2008 financial crisis), deposit accounts offering ECRs, can turn out to be more attractive to corporate treasurers. Yet, in times of rising rates, these treasurers might search for [financial instruments](/financialinstrument) with a higher yield than ECRs. Yet again these could incorporate money-market funds or even generally safe and liquid [bond funds](/bondfund).

## Features
- ECRs are calculated consistently and are frequently tied to the price of generally safe government bonds.
- ECRs are frequently involved by banks to credit customers for services, reduce fees, or offer incentives for new depositors.
- The earnings credit rate (ECR) is the imputed interest rate calculated by banks to account for money that they hold in non-interest bearing accounts.
