# Credit Score
## What is a credit score?
A credit score is a number that addresses an individual's creditworthiness. Credit scores depend on various individual financial data. Higher credit scores associate with better creditworthiness. Financial institutions judge individuals with higher credit scores to have lower [credit risk](/creditrisk), and grant them a more extensive selection of credit products at lower interest rates. Fair Issac Corp. (FICO) and VantageScore Solutions are the two leading U.S. credit scoring companies.
## More profound definition
Fair Isaac Corp. begun the concept of the credit score — what it calls a [FICO score](/ficoscore) — during the 1950s. Fair Isaac's understanding was to offer financial institutions a perspective on the creditworthiness of their customers through a simple mathematical grade, with 300 the most reduced credit score and 850 the best. The company claims that 90 percent of top U.S. lenders use FICO scores to pursue their choices.
VantageScore Solutions is a joint venture between three leading [credit bureaus](/creditbureau): TransUnion, Experian, and Equifax. Every borrower's VantageScore credit score is created utilizing data about credit payment history (35 percent of the weighting), total debt load (30 percent of the score), length of credit history (15 percent), new credit (10 percent), and mix of credit, for example, revolving credit or fixed-payment loans like a vehicle payment (10 percent).
Various lenders have various requirements for data about the credit risk and creditworthiness of their customers. Credit bureaus issue different credit scores utilizing just certain parts of an individual's financial history to assess risks for explicit necessities, like a vehicle dealer or mortgage lender. Companies like Fair Isaac and VantageScore Solutions offer more than one score for you.
A credit score can change consistently as individuals pay down a credit cards, pay off loans, and open new lines of credit. Individuals who need to follow their credit scores frequently pursue credit reporting administrations; a portion of these administrations update credit scores month to month, while others update them all the more much of the time.
