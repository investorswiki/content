# Buy Wall
A buy wall is the consequence of a single enormous buy order or the creation of various large buy orders that are put at a similar price in the order book of a specific market. Buy walls can be made by a rich individual, group of traders or institutions.
In cryptocurrency exchanges, trading is made through an order book, where buyers demonstrate their buying prices (offers) and seller show their selling prices (inquires). Basically, buy walls keeps market prices from dropping in light of the fact that they make an enormous amount of orders at a similar price which requires large amounts of money to be executed and ignored.
Buy or [sell walls](/sell-wall) typically happen when large holders (whales) of any cryptocurrency need to control the prices to the best of their interest. In this way, [whale](/bitcoin-whale) traders consistently make buy and sell walls trying to control the markets.
When big buy or sell orders show up in the order book, different traders will generally place their orders right after the walls. For example, assuming a big buy wall for Bitcoin is placed at $5,000.00, different traders that will buy will more often than not place their order at $5,000.01 or above. They do so in light of the fact that they accept there is a tiny likelihood of their orders being filled whenever placed together or behind the wall (at $4,999.99 or less).
In practice, nonetheless, most buy and sell walls just show up for a short period of time, and their orders are not filled totally. It is additionally considered normal to see buy and sell walls moving up or down relying upon the developments of the market. Automated trading [algorithms](/calculation) (trading bots) are probably going to be responsible for that.
Albeit more uncommon, when a bearish market downtrend is truly strong, buy walls can be rapidly "eaten up," having every one of their orders filled in no time flat.
