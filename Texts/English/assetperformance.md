# Asset Performance
## What Is Asset Performance?

Asset performance alludes to a business' ability to take operational resources, oversee them, and produce profitable returns. A business can cajole a positive performance out of its assets bringing about positive company performance.

Ratios like return on assets (ROA), and different metrics that track how efficiently a firm purposes its assets to generate revenue and how efficiently operations are being run, are measures of asset performance.

## Figuring out Asset Performance

Asset performance alludes to the manner in which a business can deal with the utilization of its operational resources. Certain metrics and ratios can measure the utilization of resources. Analysts depend on these metrics and ratios to compare the asset performance of many companies across a similar industry. Analysts use metrics like the cash conversion cycle, the return on assets ratio, and the fixed asset turnover ratio to compare and evaluate a company's annual asset performance.

Commonly, an improvement in asset performance means that a company can either earn a higher return utilizing similar amount of assets or is sufficiently efficient to make a similar amount of return utilizing less assets.

## Return on Assets (ROA)

The most common method for deciding a firm's asset performance is to take a gander at its [return on assets](/returnonassets) (ROA). ROA takes a gander at the [net income](/netincome) reported for a period and partitions that by total [assets](/asset). To measure total assets, ascertain the average of the beginning and ending asset values for a similar time span.

A few analysts take [earnings before interest and taxation](/ebit) (EBIT) and separation them by total assets:

> Return on Assets (ROA) = EBIT/Total Assets

This is a pure measure of the ability of a company to generate returns from its assets without being impacted by management financing choices.

### What Is a Good ROA?

Whichever method you use, the outcome is reported as a percentage [rate of return](/rateofreturn). A return on assets of 20% means that the company produces $1 of profit for each $5 it has invested in its assets. You can see that ROA gives a quick indication of whether the business is continuing to earn a rising profit on every dollar of investment. Investors expect that great management will endeavor to increase the ROA â€” to remove a greater profit from each dollar of assets at its disposal.

A falling ROA is a certain difficult situation around the corner, particularly for [growth companies](/growthstock). Taking a stab at sales growth frequently means major upfront investments in assets, including [accounts receivables](/accountsreceivable), inventories, production equipment, and facilities. A decline in demand can leave an organization high and dry and over-invested in assets it can't sell to pay its bills. The outcome can be a financial disaster.
