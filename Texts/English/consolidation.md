## What Is Consolidation?

Consolidation in [technical analysis](/technicalanalysis) alludes to a [asset](/asset) swaying between a clear cut pattern of trading levels. Consolidation is generally deciphered as market uncertainty, which closes when the asset's price moves above or below the trading pattern. In financial accounting, consolidation is defined as a set of statements that presents (merges) a parent and subsidiary company as one company.

## Grasping Consolidation

Periods of consolidation can be found in price charts for any time interval, and these periods can last for days, weeks, or months. Technical traders search for [support](/support) and [resistance](/resistance) levels in price charts and afterward utilize these levels to pursue buy and sell choices. A consolidation pattern could be broken in light of multiple factors, for example, the release of really important news or the triggering of a succession of limit orders.

## Consolidation: Support versus Resistance

The lower and upper limits of an asset's price make the support and resistance levels inside a consolidation pattern. A resistance level is the top finish of the price pattern, while the support level is the lower end.

When the price breaks through the distinguished areas of support or resistance, [volatility](/volatility) rapidly increments, thus does the opportunity for short-term traders to create a profit. Technical traders accept a breakout above resistance means the price will climb further, so the trader buys. Then again, a breakout below the support level demonstrates the price is falling even lower, and the trader sells.

## Accounting Consolidation

In financial accounting, [consolidated financial statements](/consolidatedfinancialstatement) are utilized to introduce a parent and subsidiary company as one combined company. A parent company might possess a majority percentage of a subsidiary, with a [non-controlling interest](/noncontrolling_interest) (NCI) claiming the remainder. Or on the other hand the parent might possess the whole subsidiary, with no other firm holding ownership.

To make consolidated financial statements, the assets and liabilities of the subsidiary are adjusted to fair market value, and those values are utilized in the combined financial statements.

While an accounting firm puts together the consolidated financial statements, ABC's net assets are listed with a value of $700,000, and the $300,000 amount paid over the fair market value is posted to a goodwill asset account.
