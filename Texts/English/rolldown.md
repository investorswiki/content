# Roll Down
## What Is a Roll Down?

A roll down is an adjustment strategy in options trading that permits a trader to work on the opportunities for profit by bringing down the [strike price](/strikeprice) to a better position.

## Understanding Roll Down

A roll down is achieved by closing the initial contract and opening another contract for the equivalent [underlying asset](/underlying-asset) at a lower strike price. Since it is a single trade, there is just a single commission charge.

Option traders might find that they can get more cash-flow by holding their position at a lower strike price. It is sufficiently simple to close their former trade and resume a similar position on a lower strike price, in this way making a roll down somewhat more efficient. To roll the option down, a trader must put in an order that closes their current position and opens a similar sort of position yet with a lower strike price. This should be possible just by opening a trade for an option spread that achieves what may be required.

Suppose, for instance, that an investor owned 100 shares of a stock priced close $200. The investor needs to hold the shares as far as might be feasible, yet additionally needs to make some income from holding on to the shares. The investor sells a [covered call](/coveredcall) and opens the option trade with a strike price of $210 with a month before expiration. After fourteen days, the price of the stock is presently down below $195. The investor understands that they could create more gain on the off chance that they had the option to switch from a $210 strike price down to a $200 strike price.

In this scenario the investor could either close the $210 covered call position (buy it back at a lower price), and afterward sell one more covered call at $200, or they could essentially open a short call vertical spread trade (otherwise called a bear call spread) that incorporates the $210 and $200 strike prices. The action of starting this trade breaks down along these lines:

- Purchase a contract at the $210 strike price.
- Sell a contract at the $200 strike price.
- Since the initial position was open by selling a contract at the $210 strike price, this action presently closes that position, leaving the new contract at the $200 strike price to be the last contract open.
- Subsequently, the position is really rolled down from $210 to $200 in a single trade.

## Different Types of Rolls

Roll downs can occur as part of any option strategy where the trader needs to benefit from a lower strike price. A roll down can occur with calls, puts, or existing spread trades. A roll down, whether on a [call option](/calloption) or a [put option](/putoption), is normally a bearish strategy, benefiting from prices falling further.

While rolling calls, the new position will be more costly than the old position, due to the lower strike. New put contracts will cost less in a roll down than the old put contracts. Contingent upon whether the old and new positions are long or short, the consequence of a roll up could be a [debit](/debit) or a [credit](/credit) to the account. How much relies upon the price differential of the rolled options.

There are several justifications for why a trader would roll down a position. They incorporate staying away from exercise on short put positions. Or on the other hand, it just could be a statement of increased bearishness for a long put position and needing to roll the contract to a later [expiration date](/expirationdate). Recollect that a [in-the-money (ITM)](/inthemoney) long put loses the vast majority of its time value, so rolling to a [out-of-the money (OTM)](/outofthemoney) put would give the trader partial profits and conceivably more bang for the buck, on account of the lower price of the new puts.

A long call position could roll to a lower strike price on the off chance that the underlying asset moved lower in price however the trader actually accepts it will ultimately rise. Along these lines, the position stays in place with losses cut to some degree.

In the event that the new contract includes a higher strike price and a later expiration date, the strategy is called a "roll-up and forward." If the new contract is unified with a lower strike price and later expiration date, it is called a "roll-down and forward."

Options traders utilize rolling strategies to answer changing market conditions and to secure profits, limit losses, and [manage risk](/riskmanagement).

## Features
- This strategy permits traders to change an option contract to a lower strike price.
- This action is normally acted related to an expectation of kept falling prices.
- Traders execute a spread order to efficiently close one contract and open one more at a lower strike.
