# Short (Short Position)
## What is a Short (or Short Position)

A short, or a short position, is made when a trader sells a security first fully intent on repurchasing it or covering it later at a lower price. A trader might choose to short a security when she accepts that the price of that security is probably going to diminish soon. There are two types of short positions: naked and covered. A [naked short](/nakedshorting) is the point at which a trader sells a security without having possession of it.

Nonetheless, that practice is unlawful in the U.S. for equities. A covered short is the point at which a trader borrows the shares from a stock loan department; in return, the trader pays a borrow-rate during the time the short position is in place.

In the futures or foreign exchange markets, short positions can be made whenever.

## Seeing Short Positions

While making a short position, one must comprehend that the trader has a finite potential to earn a profit and infinite potential for losses. That is on the grounds that the potential for a profit is limited to the stock's distance to zero. Nonetheless, a stock might actually rise for a really long time, making a series of higher highs. One of the most dangerous parts of being short is the potential for a short-press.

A short-press is the point at which a vigorously shorted stock unexpectedly starts to increase in price as traders that are short start to cover the stock. One popular short-press happened in October 2008 when the shares of Volkswagen flooded higher as short-merchants scrambled to cover their shares. During the short-crush, the stock rose from generally \u20ac200 to \u20ac1000 in barely a month.

## A Real World Example

A trader feels that Amazon's stock is ready to fall after it reports quarterly outcomes. To exploit this possibility, the trader borrows 1,000 shares of the stock from his stock loan department with the intent to short the stock. The trader then, at that point, goes out and undercuts the 1,000 shares for $1,500. Before long, the company reports surprisingly powerless revenue and guides for a surprisingly frail forward quarter. Subsequently, the stock dives to $1,300, the trader then, at that point, buys to cover the short position. The trade brings about a gain of $200 per share or $200,000.
