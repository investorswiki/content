# Long-Short Equity
## What Is Long-Short Equity?

Long-short equity is an investing strategy that takes long positions in stocks that are expected to appreciate and [short](/shortsale) positions in stocks that are expected to decline. A long-short equity strategy looks to limit [market exposure](/marketexposure) while profiting from stock gains in the long positions, along with price declines in the short positions. Albeit this may not generally be the case, the strategy ought to be profitable on a net basis.

The long-short equity strategy is well known with hedge funds, large numbers of which utilize a market-neutral strategy, where dollar measures of both long and short positions are equivalent.

## How Long-Short Equity Works

Long-short equity works by taking advantage of profit opportunities in both potential upside **and** downside expected price moves. This strategy distinguishes and takes long positions in stocks recognized as being relatively underpriced while selling short stocks that are considered to be overpriced.

While many hedge funds likewise utilize a long-short equity strategy with a long bias, (for example, 130/30, where long exposure is 130% and short exposure is 30%), similarly less hedge funds utilize a short bias to their long-short strategy. Uncovering profitable short thoughts than long ideas is generally more troublesome.

Long-short equity strategies can be separated from each other in a number of ways — by market geology (advanced economies, emerging markets, Europe, and so forth), sector (energy, technology, and so on), [investment philosophy](/investment-philosophy) (value or growth, etc.

An illustration of a long-short equity strategy with a broad command would be a global equity growth fund, while an illustration of a relatively narrow order would be an emerging markets healthcare fund.

## Long-Short Equity versus Equity Market Neutral

A long-short equity fund contrasts from a [equity market neutral](/equitymarketneutral) (EMN) fund in that the last option endeavors to take advantage of differences in stock prices by being long and short in closely related stocks that have comparative qualities.

An EMN strategy endeavors to keep the total value of their long and short holdings generally equivalent, as this assists with bringing down the overall risk. To keep up with this equivalency among long and short, equity market neutral funds must [rebalance](/rebalancing) as market trends lay out and fortify.

So as other long-short hedge funds let profits run on market trends and even leverage up to enhance them, equity market neutral funds are actively staunching returns and expanding the size of the contrary position. At the point when the market unavoidably turns once more, equity market neutral funds again trim down the position that ought to profit to move more into the portfolio that is languishing.

A hedge fund with an equity market neutral strategy is generally pointing itself at [institutional investors](/institutionalinvestor) who are shopping for a hedge fund that can outperform bonds without carrying the high risk and high reward profile of additional aggressive funds.

## Long-Short Equity Example: The Pair Trade

A famous variation of the long-short model is that of the "pair trade," which includes offsetting a [long position](/long) on a stock with a [short position](/short) on one more stock in a similar sector.

For instance, an investor in the technology space might take a long position in Microsoft and offset that with a short position in Intel. Assuming the investor purchases 1,000 shares of Microsoft at $33 each, and Intel is trading at $22, the [short leg](/short-leg) of this paired trade would include purchasing 1,500 Intel shares with the goal that the dollar measures of the long and short positions are equivalent.

The very smart arrangement for this long-short strategy would be for Microsoft to appreciate and for Intel to decline. Assuming Microsoft ascends to $35 and Intel tumbles to $21, the overall profit on this strategy would be $3,500. Even on the off chance that Intel advances to $23 — since similar factors regularly drive stocks up or down in a specific sector — the strategy would in any case be profitable at $500, albeit significantly less so.

To get around the way that stocks inside a sector generally will more often than not go up or down as one, long-short strategies habitually will quite often involve various sectors for the long and short legs. For instance, in the event that interest rates are rising, a [hedge fund](/hedgefund) may short interest-sensitive sectors, for example, [utilities](/utility), and go long on defensive sectors, like healthcare.
