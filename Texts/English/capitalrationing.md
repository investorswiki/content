# Capital Rationing
## What Is Capital Rationing?

Capital rationing is the act of putting limitations on the amount of new investments or projects embraced by a company. This is achieved by forcing a higher [cost of capital](/costofcapital) for investment consideration or by setting a ceiling on specific bits of a budget.

Companies might need to execute capital [rationing](/rationing) in circumstances where past returns of an investment were lower than expected.

## Grasping Capital Rationing

By and large, is the practice of controlling the distribution or consumption of a decent or service to cope with [scarcity](/scarcity).

Capital rationing is basically a management approach to designating accessible funds across various investment opportunities, expanding a company's primary concern. The company acknowledges the combination of projects with the highest total [net present value](/npv) (NPV). The number one goal of capital rationing is to guarantee that a company doesn't over-invest in assets. Without adequate rationing, a company could begin acknowledging decreasingly low returns on investments and may even face financial insolvency.

## Two Types of Capital Rationing

As a general rule, there are two primary methods for capital rationing:

1. The main type of capital, rationing, is alluded to as "hard capital rationing." This happens when a company has issues raising extra funds, either through equity or debt. The rationing emerges from an outer need to reduce spending and can lead to a shortage of capital to finance future projects.
1. The second type of rationing is called "soft capital rationing," or internal rationing. This type of rationing happens due to the internal policies of a company. A monetarily conservative company, for instance, may have a high required return on capital to acknowledge a project, self-forcing its own capital rationing.

## Instances of Capital Rationing

For instance, assume ABC Corp. has a cost of capital of 10% however that the company has embraced too many projects, a considerable lot of which are incomplete. This causes the company's actual [return on investment](/returnoninvestment) to drop well below the 10% level. Subsequently, management chooses to place a cap on the number of new projects by raising the cost of capital for these new projects to 15%. Starting less new projects would give the company additional time and resources to complete existing projects.

Capital rationing influences a company's primary concern and directs the amount it can pay out in dividends and reward shareholders. Utilizing a genuine model, Cummins, Inc., a public corporation that gives natural gas motors and related innovations, should be extremely insightful of its capital rationing and what it means for its share price. As of March 2016, the company's board of directors has chosen to designate its capital so that it furnishes investors with a dividend yield close 4%.

The company has apportioned its capital so that its existing investments allow it to pay out expanding dividends to its shareholders over the long-term. In any case, shareholders have generally expected expanding dividend payouts, and any reduction in dividends can hurt its share price. Thusly, the company needs to proportion its capital and invest in projects proficiently, so it increases its primary concern, allowing it to either increase its dividend yield or increase its actual dividend per share.
