# Pro-Forma Forecast
## What Is a Pro-Forma Forecast?

A pro-forma forecast is a financial [forecast](/forecasting) in light of [pro-forma](/proforma) income statements, balance sheets, and cash flow statements. Pro-forma forecasts are normally made from pro-forma financial statements and are forecasted utilizing essential forecasting procedures. While making these forecasts, revenues will for the most part provide the initial basis for the forecast, and expenses and different things are calculated as a percentage of future sales.

## Grasping a Pro-Forma Forecast

Pro-forma financials utilized in the pro-forma forecast will generally mirror the anticipated state of the business after a large or important transaction has occurred. The inclusion of anticipated future events in the pro-forma financial statements permits the company a unique opportunity to shape the introduction of the company's financial situation in a manner that normally wouldn't be permitted under [generally accepted accounting principles](/gaap) (GAAP) rules.

Frequently, events portrayed in the pro-forma financial statements still can't seem to happen, so the genuine financial image of the company might be altogether different from the image introduced. Forecasts produced using these financial statements could possibly contain an even higher degree of deviation from the real state of the company.

A pro-forma forecast, like any kind of pro-forma report, isn't required to keep GAAP. Thus, they frequently mirror the most ideal situation, which the firm might want to depict to investors. It takes a skilled [analyst](/analyst) to unload the marketing from the genuine numbers. Of course, the analyst can constantly just utilize the evaluated financial statements in their analysis rather than pro-forma statements and forecasts; be that as it may, these forecasts can be a significant clue with regards to how the company plans to increase its value and what type of growth they are holding back nothing.

## Illustration of a Pro-Forma Forecast

For instance, XYZ Company is a public maker of gadget presses. After numerous long periods of [research and development](/randd) (R&D), they have applied for a [patent](/patent) on another type of gadget press technology. Assuming they are allowed the patent, they will be the main company that can involve this new technology for quite some time. This new technology will permit XYZ Company to fabricate gadget presses at half their current cost and several times all the more rapidly. This might actually make them the preferred provider in the space and assist them with gaining market share.

To exhibit this expected good fortune on the company's financial statements, XYZ Company might draw up pro-forma financial statements that show the anticipated effects of lower costs and increased sales on the company's financial situation. Pro-forma forecasts made off of the assumption that this [patent](/patent) will be conceded could show larger than normal yearly sales increases as XYZ Company takes [market share](/marketshare) from its less innovatively advanced and more costly contenders. Of course, in the event that the patent isn't conceded, this sounds all exceptionally wrong.
