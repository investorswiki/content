One drachma is separated into 100 lepta. Somewhere in the range of 1917 and 1920, the Greek central bank printed paper drachma notes in denominations of 10 lepta, 50 lepta, 1 drachma, 2 drachmae, and 5 drachmae. Large denominations followed, with the 1000-drachma note showing up in 1901, and the 5000-drachma note in 1928.
