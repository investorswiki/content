# Called Away
## What Is Called Away?

Called away portrays an event where a financial contract is wiped out or terminated on the grounds that delivery or redemption is required. Called away situations ordinarily occur with [options](/option) contracts and [callable bonds](/callablebond). In an investing case, this frequently alludes to the forced sale of securities wherein the investor doesn't have a say on the specific [security](/security) being called away.

## Understanding Called Away

Calling away a financial contract due to the obligation of delivery means the elimination of the contract. This activity might happen on option [exercising](/work out) when the stocks that an investor holds are sold due to a short [call option](/calloption) or a long [put option](/putoption). This likewise applies to when the issuer of a bond chooses to call back the bonds they issued before maturity. The two transactions can impact an investor as the decision to call away is none of their concern, with the exception of a long put option, consequently conceivably impacting their returns negatively.

For instance, on the off chance that an investor has written a [short position](/short) call option and the holder of the option practices it, then, at that point, the option has been called away, and the writer needs to complete their obligation to the contract. To satisfy their responsibility, they must give the hidden asset.

This happens when an investor holds shares of an entity and sells a call option against those shares, gathering the options [premium](/option-premium). Assuming the share price of the stock closes over the [strike price](/strikeprice) of the option, then, at that point, the investor's shares will be called away and sold to the individual that bought and practiced the option.

Called away likewise applies to callable bonds when an issuer calls a redeemable bond before maturity. A callable bond is one in which the responsible bank or institution reserves the right to call away, or buy back from the holder, the bond before the maturity date. In this case, the issuer returns the buyer's principal before the maturity date and stops paying interest as of that point.

Calling back bonds is known as "yield to call" rather than [yield to maturity](/yieldtomaturity) (YTM). Some bond issues might be called away out of the blue, while others must be called away at or after specific dates.

## Called Away and Investor Instability

The primary drawback of [callable securities](/callable-security) for investors is the lack of control and consistency. At the point when securities are called away, it isn't the decision of the investor, however one that impacts them financially. The interest pay the investor planned for is as of now not accessible. Presently, they must go to the open market to reinvest their principal and may not receive terms that are as ideal.

Arranging the specific return accessible on a callable investment can challenge. It is basically impossible to be aware, with certainty, in the event that a callable issue will be called away on the call date listed. Calling can bring about an investor missing out on possible gains in the basic asset.

While investing in callable securities, a safe, conservative approach is to plan just on getting the lower of the call-to-yield or call-to-maturity amounts. This amount is alluded to as the [yield to worst](/yieldtoworst) (YTW) amount.

With called away options, the investor knows that the option might be called relying upon the movement of the share price, as they composed the options, so they can plan appropriately assuming this situation were to emerge.
