# Flow Derivative
## What Is a Flow Derivative?

A flow derivative is a [securitized](/securitize) product that means to give maximum leverage to profit from small movements in the market value of the [underlying](/underlying). Flow derivatives are typically founded on the value of currencies, indexes, commodities, and at times individual stocks. Some famous flow derivatives incorporate [vanilla options](/vanillaoption), leveraged synthetic spot positions, and [synthetic structured forwards](/synthetic-forward-contract). Flow derivatives are traded on exchanges or other electronic platforms.

## Grasping the Flow Derivative

Flow derivatives are intended to permit investors to make [directional bets](/directionaltrading) on the prices of currencies, a basket of currencies, a commodity, or an index. Flow derivatives can imitate the payouts of [over-the-counter](/otc) (OTC) products while offering the straightforwardness and transparency of being exchange-traded. Since flow derivatives are traded on electronic platforms, traders can access real-time prices and place trades automatically.

## Flow Derivatives and the World of Synthetics

Flow derivatives are part of the world of [synthetics](/synthetic). These are products that are intended to improve on trading and make directional or pattern driven trading more straightforward. Flow derivatives do this by consolidating the elements of at least two trades into one product. For instance, a synthetic structured forward can consolidate a long [call option](/calloption) and a short [put option](/putoption) into a single product with a redid time period.

While synthetics endeavor to make directional wagers simpler to make, that doesn't mean they are simple products to comprehend or to bring in money on. These products can be very complex, and that means issues can emerge in terms of precisely pricing the product in unstable market conditions.

The real-time nature of synthetics can be hazardous when a trader is off-base on the directional trade, or they are right on the heading however enter the trade at some unacceptable time. This is on the grounds that the money/futures positions in a flow derivative lose money in real-time rather than at a settlement date from now on. How this happens is made sense of in the model below.

## The Components of Flow Derivatives

Flow derivatives trade all by themselves, yet their parts drive the relationship to the underlying assets. For instance, a WAVE XXL, which is a leveraged synthetic spot position, is sometimes called a perpetual future since it has no set maturity and an inherent [stop-loss](/stop-lossorder) feature. This means that investors are typically protected from losing every one of the capital they invested, and can't lose more than they invested.

WAVE XXL calls are flow derivatives that permit [bullish](/bull) traders to make a leveraged bet on increases in the underlying with an implicit stop-loss. The contrary product for a [bearish](/bear) trader, a WAVE XXL put, positions the trader to profit from a drop in the underlying with an implicit stop-loss.

The leverage is incorporated right into the product and can take a small increase in the underlying and duplicate it several times for a lot greater gain or loss. This is on the grounds that the derivatives are utilizing leveraged products like futures or options, where the investor isn't required to buy the underlying asset, yet rather pay a small [premium](/premium) or put up margin to gain access to the full price movement of the underlying.

## Illustration of a Real Flow Derivative

Flow derivatives are a directional wagered yet they can get somewhat complex relying upon the products underlying them and how the product is structured. Take for instance a WAVE XXL. These products are offered by Deutsche Bank.

On the off chance that a trader accepts the [S&P 500](/sp500), expecting it currently trades at 3,000, will move higher over time they could buy a WAVE XXL call. An index certificate would cost $3,000, yet a Wave XXL call could be purchased for just $4.

This is conceivable in light of the fact that the product utilizes a "funding level" for the S&P 500 of 2,600. The difference between the funding level and the current level is 400 points. A cover ratio of 0.01 is utilized, which gives the $4 cost (400 * 0.01). A stop loss is set 6% over the funding level of 2,600, at 2,756. The price of the product will move point-for-point with the S&P 500, however there is a trick.

Every day the product charges [interest](/interest), yet the interest is attached onto the funding level. At 5% interest, the funding level ascents to 2600.36 following one day (2600/365 days * 5%) + 2600). The call is presently worth just $3.9964 ((3000 - 2600.36) * 0.01). As the funding level price rises every day due to interest, so does the stop loss, remaining around 6% over the funding level.

On the off chance that the S&P 500 doesn't move, eventually the position will be stopped out in light of the fact that the stop loss price will eventually reach 3,000. On the off chance that the S&P 500 drops, it will be stopped out by arriving at the stop loss. On the off chance that the S&P rises, the trader creates a possible gain.

Expect briefly the S&P 500 ascents to 3,300 over 60 days. Interest costs are 21.6 points (0.36 * 60 days). The funding level is presently 2,621.6 (2,600 + 21.6). The value of the call is presently $6.784 ((3300 - 2621.6) * 0.01). The call initially cost $4, and is presently worth 69.6% more, even however the index just rose 10%.
