# Aggressor
## What Is an Aggressor?

Aggressors are traders that take [liquidity](/liquidity) out of the markets. As opposed to entering bids for shares, aggressors buy at-market at the current ask price. They will likewise sell at the current at-market bid prices instead of determining a selling price. By purchasing accessible shares or contracts at the [current at-market price](/atthemarket), aggressors place orders which have immediate execution.

Different traders are passive since they add liquidity to markets by entering bids and offers, which might not have an immediate filling or execution. In the present electronic markets, traders might be human or they might be PCs running automated [algorithmic trading](/algorithmictrading) programs.

## Grasping Aggressors

Aggressors survey pricing in markets, for example, [futures exchanges](/futuresexchange), which have a basis on a scope of orders at different prices. The best bid-to-buy and best offer-to-sell will set the [bid-ask spread](/bid-askspread). The difference between those two prices will change contingent upon the overall market conditions. The number of contracts accessible for purchase or sale may likewise be unique.

For instance, if the bid-ask spread for a specific crude oil contract is ten contracts at $60.01 bid/15 contracts at $60.11 ask, an aggressor would immediately buy 15 contracts at the best asking price of $60.11 or in a flash sell ten contracts at the best bid of $60.01.

A passive trader propelled to buy a contract could offer a bit more, for instance, $60.05. The passive trader leaned to sell could recommend less. Passive trading will in general narrow [spreads](/spread) and add liquidity to markets, while aggressive trading eliminates liquidity.

## What Aggressors Mean for Market Liquidity

Market participants approach the [order book](/order-book), which shows a rundown of every current bid and offers, some of which may not be close to the current market price. Utilizing our model over, the best proposal for a crude oil contract is ten contracts at $60.01. Different bids might rest below that price, for example, 15 contracts for $60.00 or 20 contracts at $59.99.

Likewise, other ask offers might be over the [best current asking price](/bestask). On the off chance that the best offer is currently $60.11, higher offerings may be 12 contracts available to be purchased at $60.12 or 15 contracts at $60.13.

By making an immediate move at the current bid or asking price, aggressors keep on selling at endlessly lower costs or buy at increasingly high prices. This crushing causes [volatility](/volatility), which will turn out to be more normal as markets get [thin](/thinmarket) and imbalanced as different traders are pushed out.

> Volatility in the stock market is associated with big swings in prices; regularly, an unpredictable market is the point at which the stock market rises or falls more than one percent throughout a supported time.

## Special Considerations

[Liquid markets](/liquidmarket) enjoy many benefits, including the ability for investors to transfer their investments into cash in an accessible and ideal fashion. Anything that decreases market liquidity can lead to volatility, which might drive investors from a specific market.

Along these lines, a few electronic marketplaces presently offer fee credits for traders who sit tight for order fills and add liquidity to the markets. Generally, they are compensating the passive trading strategy. On the other hand, they might charge extra fees to aggressors who eliminate liquidity by immediately taking the best bid or offer.
