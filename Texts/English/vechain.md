# VeChain
## What Is VeChain?

VeChain is a blockchain platform intended to improve supply chain management and business processes. Its goal is to streamline these processes and information flow for complex supply chains using [distributed ledger technology](/distributed-ledger-technology-dlt) (DLT).

The Vechain platform contains two distinct tokens: VeChain Token (VET) and VeChainThor Energy (VTHO). The former is utilized to transfer value across VeChain's network, and the last option is utilized as energy or "gas" to power [smart contract](/smart-contracts) transactions.

## Figuring out VeChain

VeChain states that its goal is "to build a sans trust and distributed [business ecosystem](/business-ecosystem) platform to empower transparent information flow, efficient cooperation, and high-speed value transfers.

[Supply chain](/supplychain) data for business processes are currently compartmentalized in storehouses among different partners. This influences information flow, which is again split between partners.

As per VeChain's white paper, blockchain technology can break "this asymmetric information problem and permit ownership of data to return to and empower its owner." The VeChain platform claims to give a 360-degree perspective on important information linked to a product and its business processes — like storage, transportation, and supply — to authorized partners and make greater market transparency.

### Instances of How VeChain Can Be Used

For instance, the platform can be utilized to follow quality, validness, storage temperature, transportation medium, and last-mile delivery of a medication pack or a liquor bottle right from the manufacturing facility through to the last delivery to the end customer. To achieve this goal, VeChain utilizes smart chips or [Radio Frequency Identification](/radio-frequency-identification-rfid) (RFID) labels and sensors that broadcast key information onto the blockchain network that can be gotten to in [real-time](/real_time) by authorized partners.

The application of sensors means that all boundaries connected with the product can be continually checked and problems, if any, can be imparted back to the significant partners. Manufacturers and customers are informed on the off chance that a medication packet is stored outside an endorsed temperature range, considering service improvements and better quality control.

In another model, the VeChain platform can empower automobile owners to claim their data and use it to haggle better terms and policies with their [insurance](/insurance) companies.

## History of VeChain

VeChain was established in 2015 by Sunny Lu, the former [chief information officer](/cio) (CIO) of Louis Vuitton China. It began as a [subsidiary](/subsidiary) of Bitse, one of China's biggest blockchain companies, and is among the couple of blockchains that as of now have a substantial customer base among laid out companies.

Initially, the VEN token worked on the [Ethereum](/ethereum) blockchain. VeChain progressed onto its own blockchain and rebranded itself in 2018. As part of the rebrand, the VEN blockchain turned into the VeChainThor (VET) blockchain.

Goals for the VeChain blockchain platform are framed in its white paper. Its initial target was to disturb the supply chain industry by making data actionable and transparent. It likewise plans to be a leader in [dApps](/decentralized-applications-dapps) and [initial coin offerings](/initial-coin-offering-ico) (ICOs) made involving VeChain as well similar to a [Internet of Things](/internet-things) (IoT) intermediary.

VeChain has inked strategic partnerships over the course of the years with several companies to assist with accomplishing this goal. Among them is an agreement with PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) for VeChain's blockchain-powered answers for be utilized by the accounting company's client base to further develop product verification and discernibility.

VeChain has likewise partnered with Renault, making, related to Microsoft and Viseo, a digital vehicle maintenance book that can't be altered and is the government technology partner for Gui'an, an economic development zone for the Central Chinese Government.

## VeChain's Blockchain Platform

The VeChainThor blockchain platform is a public blockchain planned for "mass business adoption." It has two tokens: VET and VTHO. VET is the VeChain token that is utilized to carry value or "smart cash" from smart contracts. As such, transactions on decentralized applications happening on VeChain's blockchain will utilize VET. It is accessible for investing by the overall population.

The VTHO token represents VeChainThor Energy and is otherwise called VeThor Energy. It is utilized to power transactions on VeChain and is equivalent to the cost of conducting transactions on its blockchain.

The concept is like that of Ethereum's ether and NEO's "gas" in that engineers need to budget for a certain number of underlying tokens (which are not presented to the public) to conduct transactions for their decentralized applications. Per VeChain's white paper, the two-token system was concocted for effective governance and to have an anticipated economic model for decentralized applications designers.

In its current form, Ethereum needs such a model on the grounds that the price of ether, its native gas token, is unstable. Thusly, designers need to estimate the amount of ether required for a transaction. The transaction fizzles on the off chance that their estimate ends up being mistaken. VeChain's white paper frames several technical upgrades that its platform has made to beat this problem.

For instance, the VET blockchain permits [Proof of Work](/proof-work) (PoW) to be conducted for each transaction. This means that individuals conducting a transaction can mine more VTHO in the event that their initial estimate was off-base.

### Governance Protocol

The VeChainThor blockchain involves Proof of Authority as a consensus protocol. Per this protocol, votes are dispensed based on VET holdings and disclosure. VET holders without [know-your customer](/knowyourclient) (KYC) credentials and with 1 million tokens in their account are assigned 20% of all votes while VET holders with KYC and similar amount in their accounts are responsible for 30%.

There are 101 [master nodes](/master-node-cryptographic money) responsible for arriving at consensus on transactions in VeChain's blockchain. This system is not quite the same as [Bitcoin](/bitcoin), which requires all nodes to vote on a transaction before arriving at consensus.

Anonymous nodes are not permitted, and disclosure of identity is an essential pre-imperative to turning into an authority master node. As indicated by VeChain's white paper, this system utilizes less power and doesn't need a base number of validators to arrive at consensus.

The other type of master node in VeChain is the economic master node. These don't deliver blocks or ledger records and are utilized as a check on power. This is finished by dispensing a certain number of votes to each economic master node based on their VET holdings. Each 10,000 VET held by an economic master node gets it a single vote.

The system of master nodes centralizes voting rights in a decentralized system. In any case, the founders of VeChain have said that their aim in planning this protocol is to accomplish a balance among centralization and decentralization.

## Highlights
- VeChain likewise plans to turn into a leading platform for initial coin offerings (ICOs) and for conducting transactions between Internet of Things (IoT) associated gadgets.
- VeChain is an enterprise blockchain platform that aims to give a full perspective on an organization by disintermediating information from data storehouses.
- VeChain utilizes two tokens: VeChain token (VET) as a value layer and VeChain Thor Energy (VTHO) as a smart contract layer.
