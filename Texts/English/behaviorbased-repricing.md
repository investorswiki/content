# Behavior-Based Repricing
## What Is Behavior-Based Repricing?

Behavior-based repricing is the credit card industry's practice of expanding or decreasing a card holder's [interest rate](/interestrate) in response to their payment history. This most frequently includes an increase in a customer's interest rate after an inability to make a base regularly scheduled payment on time.

A single late payment can trigger a substantial increase in the [annual percentage rate](/apr) (APR) in interest that the customer must pay.

Behavior-based repricing can be a positive for credit cardholders who lay out a history of on-time payments and give the credit card company motivation to lower the interest rate charged.

## Understanding Behavior-Based Repricing

Credit card issuers can, and do, quickly increase a cardholder's rate when a single payment is no less than 60 days late. This is called a penalty rate or default rate, and may likewise be imposed in the event that a payment is returned for lacking funds or on the other hand assuming the cardholder surpasses the limit on the account.

The issuers can increase a cardholder's rate in the event that a payment is just 30 days late. In any case, the increased rate must be charged on new purchases, not on the whole balance.

The average penalty rate is 28.58%, however a rate as high as 29.99% isn't uncommon. There is no federal law limiting the interest rate that credit card issuers can charge, albeit a few states impose limits.

### At the point when Your Rate Will Decrease

### A Measurement of Risk

The concept of behavior-based repricing is unique to the debt industry. That is on the grounds that the business of lending money adds default risk to the standard rundown of the hazards of carrying on with work.

In fact, credit card issuers face more risk than most lenders on the grounds that the balance on a credit card implies unsecured danger. On the off chance that a customer defaults on a car loan, the lender can hold onto the vehicle and sell it to bring in back the money. A credit card issuer can't repossess the miscellaneous goods and services paid for with a credit card.

Behavior-based pricing is a tactic utilized with credit card issuers to measure the [credit risk](/creditrisk) of their customers. Customers who generally pay on time receive the standard APR. Customers who commit an error pay the default APR, essentially until they pay on time consistently for a long time.

### Check the Issuer's Policy

Each credit card issuer has its own policies with respect to behavior-based pricing. Some are more open minded than others. It is shrewd to perform a bit of due diligence before opening a credit card account. The impact of behavior-based pricing can be heavy.

For instance, a card issuer might give its best customers a 15% APR. Assuming that a customer has a $500 balance, that means paying $75 each year in interest fees. However, a single late payment could trigger a doubling of the interest rate. The annual interest paid on that $500 in debt will rise to a heavy $150 each year.

The credit card issuer's strategy on behavior-based pricing ought to be indicated in its Disclosures section in a separate section named Penalty APR.

Specifically, they are not allowed to apply a penalty APR to an existing balance until delinquency of the [minimum payment](/least regularly scheduled payment) arrives at 60 days.

The law doesn't keep the issuers from raising the APR on new purchases on the off chance that the customer is one day late in paying the base due or for different reasons, for example, a lessening in the customer's credit rating.
