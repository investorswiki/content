# Nonresident Alien
## What is a nonresident alien?
A nonresident alien is a person who isn't a U.S. citizen and doesn't pass the green card or substantial presence tests used to determine tax status. Nonresident aliens must pay taxes on income they earn in the U.S.
## More profound definition
The U.S. requires each and every individual who earns an income win the U.S. to pay taxes on that income, including foreign nationals. In that capacity, the IRS classifies foreign nationals as resident or nonresident aliens.
To classify taxpayers as nonresident aliens, the IRS works out how long they spend in the U.S. The people who don't have or meet all requirements for a green card, or who have been in the U.S. less than 31 days in the calendar year and 183 days during the last three years file tax returns as nonresident aliens.
An exception to this rule is a foreign national married to a U.S. citizen or permanent resident, who might file with a spouse as "married filing jointly."
Not at all like resident aliens, who follow a similar tax rules as U.S. citizens, nonresident aliens just pay taxes on the income they earn in the U.S., as long as it surpasses the annual personal exemption amount. For the 2017 tax year, the personal exemption was $4,050, so nonresident aliens who earned not exactly that amount don't need to file a tax return, except if they need to claim an accessible refund.
Nonresident aliens use form 1040NR or 1040NR-EZ to file taxes, and can file under an individual taxpayer identification number rather than a Social Security number in the event that they don't meet all requirements for a Social Security number.
## Nonresident alien model
One illustration of a nonresident alien is a meeting teacher from another country who shows a class at a university for a semester. Assuming that the teacher shows up without precedent for the U.S. before the beginning of the term in August and leaves toward the finish of the term in December, the person doesn't meet the substantial presence test.
Nonetheless, the tax status changes, assuming that the teacher chooses to return every year to show the class. Following three years, this person gathers over 183 days in the U.S. what's more, meets the criteria for a resident alien tax status.

## Features
- Whenever somebody has been in the U.S. for something like 31 days and dwelled in the country for north of 183 days in a three-year period, they might qualify as a resident alien.
- Nonresident aliens are noncitizens of the U.S. who breeze through the substantial presence assessments or are exempt from a Green Card.
- Nonresident aliens possibly need to pay taxes on the off chance that the income is successfully associated with a trade or business in the U.S.
- Foreign nationals are classified as one or the other resident or nonresident aliens for tax purposes.
