# Voluntary Bankruptcy
## What Is Voluntary Bankruptcy?

Voluntary bankruptcy is a type of [bankruptcy](/bankruptcy) where a [insolvent](/indebtedness) debtor carries the petition to a court to declare bankruptcy since they are unable to pay off their debts. The two individuals and businesses are able to utilize this approach.

A simple definition of voluntary bankruptcy is just when a debtor decides to go to court over bankruptcy versus being forced to do as such. A voluntary bankruptcy is expected to make an orderly and equitable settlement of the debtor's obligations.

## How Voluntary Bankruptcy Works

Voluntary bankruptcy is a bankruptcy continuing that a [debtor](/debtor), who can say for sure that they can't fulfill the debt requirements of its [creditors](/creditor), starts with a court.

Voluntary bankruptcy commonly begins when and in the event that a debtor tracks down no other solution to their desperate financial situation. Filing for voluntary bankruptcy varies from filing for [involuntary bankruptcy](/involuntary-bankruptcy), which happens when at least one creditors petitions a court to judge the debtor as ruined (unable to pay).

## Voluntary Bankruptcy and Other Forms of Bankruptcy

Notwithstanding voluntary bankruptcy, different forms of bankruptcy exist, including involuntary bankruptcy, and technical bankruptcy.

Creditors request involuntary bankruptcy of debtors when they won't be paid without bankruptcy procedures and need a legal requirement to force the debtor to pay. A debtor must have attained a certain level of debt for a creditor to request an involuntary bankruptcy. This level will differ, in the event that assuming the debtor is an individual or corporation.

In a [technical bankruptcy](/technicalbankruptcy), an individual or company has defaulted on their financial obligations, yet this has not been declared in court.

## Voluntary Bankruptcy and Corporations

At the point when a corporation fails, either deliberately or automatically, there is a specific series of occasions that happen for all partners to receive due payments. This starts with distributing assets to [secured creditors](/secured-creditor), who have collateral on loan to the business.

In the event that they can't get a market price for the collateral (which has likely depreciated over the long run), secured creditors can recover a portion of the balance from the company's excess liquid assets.

Secured creditors are trailed by [unsecured creditors](/unsecuredcreditor) â€” the individuals who have loaned funds to the company (i.e., bondholders, employees who are owed unpaid wages, and the government, on the off chance that taxes are owed). Preferred and common shareholders, in a specific order, receive any remaining assets, on the off chance that any remain.

Different types of bankruptcy that a corporation can declare incorporate Chapter 7 bankruptcy, which includes liquidation of assets; Chapter 11, which manages corporate redesigns; and Chapter 13, which is debt repayment with brought down debt [covenants](/contract) or payment terms.

Of the multitude of types of bankruptcy, voluntary bankruptcy is the most common.
