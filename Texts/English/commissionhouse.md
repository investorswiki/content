# Brokerage Commission House
## What Is a Brokerage Commission House?

A brokerage commission house is a company that buys and sells various financial assets like stocks, bonds, and mutual funds, in return for fees.

The fee paid by clients of a brokerage commission house averages 1% to 2% of the amount being traded. The brokerage house may also receive commissions from sponsors of financial assets that they buy on behalf of their clients.

These firms are normally full-service brokerages that give their clients investment advice and research as well as trading services.

## How Brokerage Commission Houses Work

The clients of brokerage commission houses are paying for the services of a financial professional. This may incorporate personalized financial advice, investment research, and regular contact with the client.

Discount brokerages, which offer less services, generally charge a flat fee for every trade that ranges from under $5 to $30 or seriously depending on the type of transaction.

Online brokerages generally change no fee for stock trades and exchange-traded funds (ETFs) while trades in a few different types of assets like bonds, mutual funds, and options may carry a small flat fee. They may offer layered premium services for clients who want them, however their core services are totally self-directed by the client.

### House Services

Brokerage commission houses are paid for executing orders, arranging settlements, and servicing margin accounts on behalf of their clients. Dissimilar to self-directed brokerages that allow their customers to place trades all alone for nominal fees, full-service suppliers including brokerage commission houses charge substantial commissions.

They typically use [omnibus accounts](/omnibusaccount) to do this. These accounts permit trades to be packaged for at least two individuals. As such, transactions are satisfied in the broker's name rather than the investors'.

Commissions and different fees, however, are charged straightforwardly to the investors. Trade confirmations and [account statements](/account-statement) are shipped off each investor whose trades take place through an omnibus account.

> Brokerage commission houses generally are utilized by high-net-worth individuals who demand more personalized services than they can traverse a discount or online brokerage.

## Special Considerations

The various fees charged by brokerage commission houses can eat into an investor's principal.

For example, two [mutual funds](/mutualfund) with nearly identical holdings may charge two distinct [expense ratios](/expenseratio) — one with 0.6% offered by a traditional brokerage firm and the other with 1.6% through a commission house. The 1% returns to the commission house.

This means a $10,000 investment in the lower-fee fund develops 10% more than 20 years for a total of $60,300. The same investment in the fund bought through the commission house will develop to $50,200 given the same time span and [interest rate](/interestrate).

The impact is even greater with regards to load-mutual funds and annuities — two products that accompany high fees anyway. Adding a commission of up to 10% on the principal means investors in these products pay a robust piece of their earnings in commissions and fees.

### Annuities

Annuities are financial contracts that are intended to give individuals a regular stream of income during retirement.

The annual cost for a variable annuity can range somewhere in the range of 1% and 3%. A few annuities accompany a back-end [surrender charge](/surrendercharge) for early withdrawals. That means assuming you cash out the annuity, you pay a [exit fee](/exit_fee), usually for a very long time after the annuity is purchased.

### Load Mutual Funds

Load mutual funds accompany commissions or sales charges that are paid to the intermediary, for example, the commission house. These funds come in three variations:

- A-load fund incorporates a transaction fee paid upfront at the hour of its purchase. For example, in the event that you invest $10,000 in one with a 5% front-end load, $500 goes to pay the commission, leaving $9,500 to be invested.
- A B-load fund penalizes you in the event that you sell it inside a certain period. A 6% back-end load may be required in the event that you sell the fund in the principal year. The fee decreases each year until it reaches zero.
- A C-load fund has no back-load or front-load except for it incorporates a sales charge. This is reflected in the expense ratio, which is a lot higher than that of a no-load fund.

## Examples of Brokerage Commission House Trades

Here is a hypothetical example of how brokerage commission houses work. We should assume an investor wants to buy a U.S. [growth stock](/growthstock) mutual fund. The amount included is humble, say $10,000.

The investor could buy A-, B-, or C-fund, and settles on the B-fund, having no aim of selling it for certain years. After about six years, the B-fund converts to A-fund.

In the event that the same investor had $250,000 to invest, the A-fund would be a better decision because it has lower load fees.
