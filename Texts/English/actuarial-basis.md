# Actuarial Basis of Accounting
## What Is the Actuarial Basis of Accounting?

The actuarial basis of accounting is a method frequently utilized in computing the periodic payments that a company must make to fund its [employee pension](/employer_sponsored_plan) benefits. The actuarial basis specifies that total contributions from the company plus investment returns on pension assets must match the required annual contribution from the pension fund.

## Understanding the Actuarial Basis of Accounting

The actuarial basis of accounting follows the essential reason of any[ actuarial process](/actuarial-science) in that costs and benefits must be equivalent. Accounting for pensions includes suppositions on the two sides of the equation.

Suspicions must be made for the accompanying factors:

- The estimated number of years that employees are probably going to work.
- The rate at which salaries are expected to increase from here on out.
- The rate of return on plan assets.
- The [discount rate](/discountrate) utilized for future benefits.

While evaluating a company's financial statements, investors ought to note whether the company is being aggressive or conservative in these suppositions.

For instance, in the event that a company utilizes an exceptionally high [rate of return](/rateofreturn) on its plan assets, this will reduce the current costs to fund its [pension plan](/pensionplan). Data on pension contributions and assets can be found in the company's quarterly and annual reports to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).

The actuarial basis of accounting method is carried out by [actuarial accountants](/statistician); analysts who use recipes that are applied to statistical data as per [generally accepted accounting principles](/gaap) (GAAP) to decide the probability of a specific [event risk](/eventrisk) happening during a given period of time.

These accountants gather and evaluate data, including financial and lifestyle data, and afterward give guidance that permits the company to settle on investment choices that will preferably keep the account all around funded and the company in great financial standing.

## Illustration of the Actuarial Basis of Accounting

Instances of the actuarial basis of accounting method put to work in a fund could incorporate a [trust fund](/trust-fund), set up for a public employee retirement system, or a pension fund.

While making ideas for these funds, actuaries need to evaluate the four factors recognized previously:

- Years an employee is probably going to work.
- What they are probably going to earn.
- The rate of return on plan assets.
- The discount rate for future benefits.

To carry out these means, an accountant would take a gander at the current periods of the plan participants and the estimates for how long they could function until retirement, considering participants who take exiting the workforce and those that concede cashing out benefits for resigning later.

The actuaries would likewise take a gander at the projected last salary for every employee, taking into account potential legitimacy raises, bonuses, and different sorts of compensation, as well as at the plan funding, market conditions, [economic conditions](/economic-conditions), and different factors that might impact the rate of return for the plan assets.

At last, the accountant would take a gander at the impact of the discount rate for benefits down the line. In light of this data, the accountant can estimate how much should be funded for the employees to receive an equivalent retirement distribution every year that they are qualified for, and afterward make proposals to the company for achieving this amount.

The company would then decide the contribution amounts it necessities to make to the account as well as the rate of return it must accomplish on its investments to guarantee that the pension account is [fully funded](/completely funded). The account is completely funded when it can meet payment requirements to both current and prospective pensioners.
