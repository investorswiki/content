# Variable Interest Entity (VIE)
## What Is a Variable Interest Entity (VIE)?

A variable interest entity (VIE) alludes to a legal business structure in which an investor has a controlling interest regardless of not having a majority of voting rights. This is on the grounds that the controlling interest is organized through a contractual relationship as opposed to direct ownership. Qualities incorporate a structure where equity investors don't have adequate resources to support the continuous operating requirements of the business. Much of the time, the VIE is utilized to safeguard the business from creditors or legal action.

A business that is the [primary beneficiary](/primary-beneficiary) of a VIE must unveil the holdings of that entity as part of its consolidated balance sheet.

## How a Variable Interest Entity (VIE) Works

Variable interest elements (VIEs) are frequently settled as [special purpose vehicles](/spv) (SPVs) to inactively hold financial assets or to actively conduct [research and development](/randd). For instance, a company might lay out a VIE to finance a project without seriously endangering the whole enterprise. In any case, just as other SPVs have been abused in the past, these structures are oftentimes used to keep securitized assets off corporate balance sheets.

VIEs are set up with a unique structure where investors don't have a direct ownership stake in the entity yet rather have special contracts, which determine the terms and rules and pledge a percentage of profits. Consequently, in a VIE, the investor doesn't participate in residual profits or losses that generally accompanied ownership. The contracts don't accommodate voting rights by the same token.

Reforms in the wake of the global financial crisis were intended to get rid of a portion of the asset-backed security industry's pre-crisis rehearses. In any case, thanks to campaigning efforts by the banks, which had cautioned of desperate outcomes would it be advisable for them they need to bring [subprime mortgage](/subprime_mortgage)- backed securities back onto their books, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) loosened up the rules for VIEs, empowering banks to keep reserving loans in shaky sheet elements.

## Directing VIEs

Under the Federal securities laws, public companies need to unveil their relationships to VIEs when they file their [10-K](/10-k) forms. FASB Interpretation Number 46, which is the Financial Accounting Standards Board's interpretation of the [Accounting Research Bulletin](/accounting-research-bulletin) (ARB) 51, frames the accounting rules that corporations must follow with respect to VIEs. Several amendments to the original 2003 FASB Rule 46 have taken place, with the latest happening in 2009 in response to the 2008 financial crisis.

In particular, a large number of these regulations are set on a mission to figure out who the genuine beneficiary of a VIE is to further develop transparency and financial reporting. As indicated by the latest standards, the beneficiary firm would meet both of the following:

- It has the power to direct the activities of a variable interest entity that most fundamentally impact the entity's economic performance
- It has the obligation to assimilate losses of the entity that might actually be influential for the variable interest entity or the right to receive benefits from the entity that might actually be vital for the variable interest entity.

Furthermore, a beneficiary firm is required to evaluate whether it has an implicit financial responsibility to guarantee that a VIE works as planned while deciding if it has the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most fundamentally impact the entity's economic performance.

## Special Considerations

In the event that a company is the primary beneficiary of such an entity — to be specific has a majority interest in the VIE — then the holdings of that entity must be revealed on the company's consolidated balance sheet. However, on the off chance that a company isn't the primary beneficiary, consolidation isn't required.

Be that as it may, companies are required to uncover information concerning VIEs in which they have a critical interest. This disclosure incorporates how the entity works, how much and what kind of financial support it receives, contractual commitments, as well as the potential losses the VIE could cause.
