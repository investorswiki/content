# Limit Order Book
## What Is a Limit Order Book?

A limit order book is a record of outstanding limit orders kept up with by the security specialist who works at the exchange. A [limit order](/limitorder) is a type of order to buy or sell a security at a specific price or better. A buy limit order is an order to buy at a preset price or lower while a sell limit order is an order to sell a security at a pre-indicated price or higher.

At the point when a limit order for a security is placed, it is kept on record by the security specialist. As buy and sell limit orders for the security are given, the specialist tracks these orders in the order book. The specialist executes the orders at or better than the given limit price when the market moves to the pre-indicated price.

## Understanding a Limit Order Book

The specialist running the limit order book has the responsibility to guarantee that the main concern order is executed before different orders in the book, and before different orders at an equivalent or more terrible price held or presented by different traders on the floor, for example, floor brokers and [market makers](/marketmaker).

The specialist procures a profit off of the spread between the difference in prices between the [bid and ask orders](/bid-and-ask) on their book as they execute the orders. With the progressions in trading system advancements, the cycle has moved from a manual cycle to one that is generally automated.

## Tracking Limit Orders

In 2000, the [Securities and Exchange Commission](/sec) (SEC) started to make a centralized limit order book that monitors limit orders on exchanges electronically. This electronic order tracking system consequently matches for the execution of the best conceivable pair of orders in the system. The best pair is comprised of the highest bid, and the most reduced ask orders.

The bid is the price the specialist or exchange will sell a security or the price at which an investor can buy the security. The ask or offer is the price at which the specialist or exchange will buy a security or the price at which the investor can sell the security.

At the point when a limit order is placed into a trading system and handled by either a specialist working the book or an electronic database of orders, it will remain on the books until it very well may be matched with a suitable trade and executed. Buy limit orders are set with an upper price threshold. The investor would agree "I would rather not pay more than $X for this share." Sell limit orders are put with a lower price threshold. The investor would agree "I would rather not sell this share for not exactly $X."

## Limit Order Qualifiers

A limit order might incorporate "qualifiers." Without qualifiers on an order, the request will be substantial just for the market day, considered a "day order," and may terminate with next to no purchase, or with just a partial satisfaction of shares.

On the off chance that an investor's order states, "buy 10,000 shares of XYZ common @32," they have requested to buy 10,000 shares at $32 or a better price, the qualifier for this order.

On the off chance that the investor's strategy requires 10,000 to be filled whenever at the requested price or better, it very well might be placed as "buy 10,000 shares XYZ @32 GTC." A "Great Until Cancelled" order trains the market to get those shares until the order is canceled, even assuming the purchase is completed 100 shares all at once and more than a long time. The investor needs the order completed paying little mind to what amount of time the market requires to take care of the request.

Another qualifier is the AON, or "All of None." Investors probably shouldn't risk just partially finishing the order, so they utilize this qualifier to train the market to take care of this request with each of the 10,000 shares as requested or buy none.

There are different types of order qualifiers that permit an investor to guarantee the transaction is executed precisely in the way that suits their specific investment objective, and in each case, characterize the "limits" the investor is putting on the market to make the trade.

## Special Considerations

Investors are guaranteed to get the price in the event that the order is set off after the market moves to the predefined level. In any case, there is no guarantee that the limit order will be executed. At the end of the day, the order must be filled assuming the price raises a ruckus around town level. Limit orders are useful to investors since they assist with guaranteeing that they don't pay more for a security than the pre-set price initially settled with the order.
