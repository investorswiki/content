# Termination Event
## What Is a Termination Event?

A termination event is an occurrence that will cause all or part of a [swap agreement](/swap) to be ended early. Conceivable termination events incorporate legal or regulatory changes that prevent one or the two players from satisfying the contract terms ("illegality"), the placement of a withholding tax on the transaction ("tax event" or "tax event upon consolidation"), or a reduction in one counterparty's creditworthiness ("credit event").

A termination even can likewise connect with business agreements between various parties. Assuming one of the individuals goes in a direction which is considered improper, that could act as a termination event for the partnership.

On the off chance that a swap is ended early, the two players will cease to make the settled upon payments, and the counterparty who is responsible for the termination event might be required to pay damages to the next counterparty. [Default](/default2) events, for example, inability to pay or declaration of bankruptcy can likewise cause a swap contract to early end.
