# Complete Retention
## What Is Complete Retention?

Complete retention is a risk management technique where a company facing a risk or risks chooses to retain, or acknowledge, all potential loss instead of transfer that risk to an insurer or other party. Complete retention is an aggressive form of self-insurance.

## Figuring out Complete Retention

Complete retention means that no outside financing option is searched out. The business would be responsible for all costs and damages that happen as the consequence of a crisis, accident, or other unanticipated incidents that can bring about losses.

Retention alludes to the assumption of risk of loss or damages. This communicates how a party, generally a business, handles or deals with its risk. At the point when a business holds risk, they retain it themselves, rather than transferring it to an insurer. A business or individual might assume this risk through [deductibles](/deductible) or [self-insurance](/selfinsurance), or by having no insurance by any means.

Choosing whether to utilize an insurer to cover expected losses or to fund losses itself requires a business or organization to estimate the degree of losses that it might face. A company might search out a [third-party](/third-party-insurance), like an insurer, to cover claims that might be substantial or unusual, for example, for damages brought about by floods, while additionally holding a few different types of risk for self-coverage.

## Complete Retention Example and Alternatives

An illustration of a risk that a company might hold could be damage to an outside metal rooftop over a shed. The company may rather choose to set to the side funds for the eventual replacement of the shed's rooftop as opposed to purchase an insurance policy to pay for its replacement.

As opposed to assume the responsibility for a whole risk, a company might pick a partial retention approach to the risks that it faces. In this case, the company will transfer part of the risk to an insurer in exchange for a premium, yet might be responsible for a [deductible](/deductible). On the other hand, it could be responsible for any losses in excess of the coverage offered by an insurance policy. On the off chance that the company accepts that the risks are slight, it might pick a policy that has a high deductible, since that commonly brings about a lower premium and subsequently more cost savings.

A company may likewise accidentally assume complete retention in the event that it doesn't recognize that it faces a risk, and hence, doesn't be aware to seek after a risk transfer strategy. In this case, the company is viewed as uninsured naturally, since it didn't purchase insurance and didn't realize that it would be able.

In sum, there are a couple of ways of approaching and treat risk in risk management. They include:

- [Avoidance](/lament avoidance): This involves changing plans to kill a risk. This strategy is really great for risks that might actually essentially affect a business or project.
- [Transfer](/transferofrisk): Applicable to projects with different parties. Not regularly utilized. Frequently incorporates insurance. Otherwise called "risk sharing," insurance policies actually shift risk from the insured to the insurer.
- Relief: Limiting the impact of a risk so that assuming a problem happens it will be more straightforward to fix. This is the most common. Otherwise called "improving risk" or "decrease," [hedging](/support) strategies are common forms of risk relief.
- **Exploitation**: Some risks are great, for example, in the event that a product is so well known there are insufficient staff to keep up with sales. In such a case, the risk can be taken advantage of by adding more sales staff.

## Highlights
- Accepting risk should be visible as a form of self-insurance, where all possible risks that are not accepted, transferred, or kept away from are supposed to be "held."
- Complete retention is a strategy by which all potential risks are accepted by an entity with next to no form of risk transfer through hedging or insurance.
- While complete retention maintains a strategic distance from the costs associated with insurance or other risk transfer measures, it can demonstrate terrible assuming a serious event happens that is uninsured.
