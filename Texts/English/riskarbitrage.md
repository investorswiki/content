# Risk Arbitrage
## What Is Risk Arbitrage?

Risk arbitrage, otherwise called [merger arbitrage](/mergerarbitrage), is an investment strategy to profit from the limiting of a gap of the trading price of a target's stock and the acquirer's valuation of that stock in an expected takeover deal. In a [stock-for-stock](/stockforstock) merger, risk arbitrage implies buying the shares of the target and selling short the shares of the acquirer. This [investment strategy](/investmentstrategy) will be profitable assuming the deal is culminated. On the off chance that it isn't, the investor will lose money.

## Understanding Risk Arbitrage

When a [merger and acquisition](/mergersandacquisitions) (M&A) deal is announced, the target company's stock price bounces toward the valuation set by the acquirer. The acquirer will propose to finance the transaction in one of three ways: all cash, all stock, or a combination of cash and stock.

On account of all cash, the target's stock price will trade close or at the acquirer's valuation price. In certain occasions, the target's stock price will outperform the offer price in light of the fact that the market might accept that the target will be put in play to a higher bidder, or the market might accept that the cash offer price is too low for the shareholders and [board of directors](/boardofdirectors) of the target company to acknowledge.

By and large, be that as it may, there is a [spread](/spread) between the trading price of the target just after the deal announcement and the buyer's offer price. This spread will create on the off chance that the market thinks that the deal won't close at the offer price or may not close by any means. Perfectionists don't think this is risk arbitrage in light of the fact that the investor is essentially going long the target stock with the hope or expectation that it will rise toward or meet the all-cash offer price. Those with an expanded definition of "[arbitrage](/arbitrage)" would point out that the investor is endeavoring to exploit a short-term price error.

## Risk Arbitrage and All-Stock Offers

In an all-stock offer, by which a fixed ratio of the acquirer's shares is offered in exchange for [outstanding shares](/outstandingshares) of the target, there is no question that risk arbitrage would be working. At the point when a company declares its intent to secure another company, the acquirer's stock price typically declines, while the target company's stock price generally rises.

Be that as it may, the target company's stock price frequently stays below the announced acquisition valuation. In an all-stock offer, a "risk arb" (as such an investor is known colloquially) buys shares of the target company and at the same time [short sells](/shortselling) shares of the acquirer. In the event that the deal is completed, and the target company's stock is changed over into the gaining company's stock, the risk arb can utilize the switched stock over completely to cover his [short position](/short). The risk arb's play turns out to be somewhat more confounded for a deal that includes cash and stock, yet the mechanics are to a great extent the equivalent.

> Risk arbitrage can likewise be achieved with [options](/choice). The investor would purchase shares of the target company's stock and put options on the getting company's stock.

## Analysis of Risk Arbitrage

The investor in risk arbitrage is presented to the major risk that the deal is called off or dismissed by regulators. The deal might be called off for different reasons, for example, financial shakiness of one or the other company or a tax situation that the securing company considers unfavorable. On the off chance that the deal doesn't occur for reasons unknown, the typical outcome would be a drop — potentially sharp — in the stock price of the target and a rise in the stock price of the eventual acquirer. An investor who is [long the target's shares](/long) and short the acquirer's shares will endure losses.

## Features
