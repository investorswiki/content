## What Is a Certificate of Need (CON)?

A certificate of need (CON) is a legal document that is required to construct another healthcare facility. To get a CON, engineers of healthcare facilities must apply to the neighborhood legislative specialists by presenting the defense for why the community being referred to would benefit from that new development. Notwithstanding, the exact criteria used to determine whether an application is approved can vary widely between states. CONs are required in 35 U.S. states and Washington D.C.

Pundits of the CON program contend that the system represents a superfluous [barrier to entry](/barrierstoentry) in the healthcare market, effectively protecting laid out wellbeing facilities from competition.

The earliest CON laws appeared during the 1960s, with New York embracing the first such statute in 1964. In 1974, the Federal Health Planning Resources Development Act was passed, and in this way, many CON laws came full circle. Today, most states have some form of CON law, program, or agency in place.

Customarily, advocates for the CON structure have contended that the systems assist with preventing superfluous spending on healthcare infrastructure and services, and that they can assist states with directing such infrastructure toward underserved regions.

Pundits, then again, contend that the CON structure safeguards the interests of laid out facilities. These pundits likewise contend that, by permitting political influence to conclude which facilities can be assembled, the CON system welcomes corruption, manipulation, and abuse.
