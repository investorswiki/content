# Barrels Per Day (B/D)
At the point when oil was discovered in Titusville, Pa., in 1859, it was loaded into the main large compartments available - - bourbon barrels. Throughout the long term the industry standard came to be the 42-gallon barrel, which is as yet the standard paper measurement for pricing and pumping purposes, in spite of the fact that oil seldom sees the inside of a barrel any longer. But in an odd forecasting of today's equipment shortage, the primary shortage in Titusville's 1859 oil boom was barrels in which to store oil.

## Features
- Different measurements of oil production include 1,000,000 barrels each day (MMB/D), a thousand barrels each day (KBPD), and for other energy products, a barrel of oil equivalent (BOE).
- Barrels each day (B/D) alludes to the number of barrels of oil produced in a single day.
- Countries or companies frequently don't produce oil at their full barrels each day (B/D) capacity as a means to control the price of oil.
- The price of oil and barrels each day (B/D) regularly have an inverse correlation.
- Barrels each day (B/D) can allude to an amount globally, a single country, a single production field, and so on.
