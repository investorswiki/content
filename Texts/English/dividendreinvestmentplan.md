## Extra Considerations for DRIPs

Through DRIPs, investors can likewise buy fractional shares, so every dividend dollar is truly going to work.

Long term, the greatest advantage is the effect of automatic reinvestment on the [compounding](/compounding) of returns. At the point when dividends are increased, shareholders receive a rising amount on each share they own, which can likewise purchase a bigger number of shares.

Mostly that is on the grounds that participants tend to be long-term investors and perceive the job their dividends play in the [long-term growth](/longtermgrowth) of their portfolios. Of course, another factor is that DRIP-purchased shares are not so liquid as shares purchased on the open market â€” they must be reclaimed by means of the company.

> Most DRIPs, like the one examined here, are sponsored by a company (issue-sponsored) through their transfer agent, who holds the shares.
