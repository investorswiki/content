# Default Probability
## What Is Default Probability?

Default probability is the probability over a predetermined period, typically one year, that a borrower can not make scheduled repayments. It tends to be applied to a wide range of [risk management](/riskmanagement) or credit analysis situations. Likewise called the probability of default (PD), it depends, on the borrower's qualities as well as on the economic environment.

Creditors ordinarily need a higher interest rate to make up for bearing higher default risk. Financial measurements —, for example, cash flows relative to debt, incomes or operating margin trends, and the utilization of [leverage](/leverage) — are common contemplations while assessing the risk. An organization's ability to execute a business plan and a borrower's eagerness to pay are in some cases figured into the analysis too.

## Figuring out Default Probability

Individuals in some cases experience the concept of default probability when they purchase a residence. When a homebuyer applies for a mortgage on a piece of [real estate](/realestate), the lender makes an assessment of the buyer's [default risk](/defaultrisk), in light of their credit score and financial resources. The higher the estimated probability of default, the greater the interest rate that will be offered to the borrower. For consumers, a FICO score suggests a specific probability of default.

For businesses, a probability of default is implied by their credit rating. PDs may likewise be estimated utilizing historical data and statistical strategies. PD is utilized alongside "[loss given default](/lossgivendefault)" (LGD) and "[exposure at default](/exposure_at_default)" (EAD) in an assortment of risk management models to estimate potential losses looked by lenders. Generally, the higher the default probability, the higher the interest rate the lender will charge the borrower.

## High-Yield versus Low-Yield Debt

A similar logic becomes an integral factor when investors buy and sell [fixed-income securities](/fixed-incomesecurity) on the [open market](/open-market). Companies that are cash-flush and have a low default probability will actually want to issue debt at lower interest rates. Investors trading these bonds on the open market will price them at a premium compared to riskier debt. At the end of the day, more secure bonds will have a lower yield.

In the event that an organization's financial wellbeing deteriorates over the long run, investors in the bond market will conform to the increased risk and trade the bonds at lower prices and in this way higher yields (since bond prices move inverse to yields). High-yield bonds have the highest probability of default and in this way pay a high yield or interest rate. At the opposite finish of the range are government bonds like U.S. Treasury securities, which normally pay the lowest yields and have the lowest risk of default; governments can continuously print more money to pay back debt.

## Highlights
- In the fixed-income market, high-yield securities carry the most serious risk of default, and government bonds are at the low-risk end of the range.
- For businesses, probability of default is reflected in credit ratings.
- For people, a [FICO score](/ficoscore) is utilized to measure credit risk.
- Default probability, or probability of default (PD), is the probability that a borrower will fail to pay back a debt.
- Lenders will ordinarily charge higher interest rates when default probability is greater.
