## What Does a Bullish Engulfing Pattern Tell You?

A bullish engulfing pattern isn't to be deciphered as essentially a white candlestick, addressing up price movement, following a black candlestick, addressing downward price movement. For a bullish engulfing pattern to form, the stock must open at a lower price on Day 2 than it closed at on Day 1. In the event that the price didn't gap down, the body of the white candlestick wouldn't get an opportunity to overwhelm the body of the previous day's black candlestick.

Since the stock the two opens lower than it closed on Day 1 and closes higher than it opened on Day 1, the white candlestick in a bullish engulfing pattern addresses a day in which [bears](/bear) controlled the price of the stock in the morning just to have [bulls](/bull) unequivocally take over before the day's over.

The white candlestick of a bullish engulfing pattern commonly has a small upper [wick](/shadow), if any. That means the stock closed at or close to its highest price, recommending that the day ended while the price was all the while flooding up.

This lack of an upper wick makes it more probable that the next day will create another white candlestick that will close higher than the bullish engulfing pattern closed, however it's likewise conceivable that the next day will deliver a black candlestick in the wake of gapping up at the opening. Since bullish engulfing patterns will more often than not mean [trend reversals](/reversal), analysts pay specific regard for them.

## Bullish Engulfing Pattern versus Bearish Engulfing Pattern

These two patterns are alternate extremes of each other. A bearish engulfing pattern happens after a price moves higher and shows lower prices to come. Here, the primary candle, in the two-candle pattern, is an up candle. The subsequent candle is a larger down candle, with a real body that completely overwhelms the smaller up candle.

## Illustration of a Bullish Engulfing Pattern

As a historical model, we should think about Philip Morris (PM) stock. The organization's shares were a great long in 2011 and stayed in a [uptrend](/uptrend). In 2012, however, the stock was withdrawing.

On January 13, 2012, a bullish engulfing pattern happened; the price hopped from an open of $76.22 to close out the day at $77.32. This bullish day predominated the prior day's [intraday](/intraday) range where the stock completed down barely. The move showed that the bulls were as yet alive and one more wave in the uptrend could happen.

## Bullish Engulfing Candle Reversals

Investors ought to look not exclusively to the two [candlesticks](/candlestick) which form the bullish engulfing pattern yet additionally to the first candlesticks. This larger setting will give a clearer image of whether the bullish engulfing pattern denotes a true trend reversal.

Bullish engulfing patterns are bound to signal [reversals](/reversal) when they are gone before by at least four black candlesticks. The really going before black candlesticks the bullish engulfing candle overwhelms, the greater the chance a trend reversal is forming, confirmed by a second white candlestick closing higher than the bullish engulfing candle.

## Following up on a Bullish Engulfing Pattern

In the event that [volume](/volume) increments along with price, aggressive traders might decide to buy close to the furthest limit of the day of the bullish engulfing candle, expecting to go on vertical movement the following day. More conservative traders might hold on until the following day, trading expected gains for greater certainty that a trend reversal has started.

Engulfing patterns are most valuable following a clean downward price move as the pattern plainly shows the shift in momentum to the [upside](/upside). Assuming that the price action is choppy, even in the event that the price is rising overall, the significance of the engulfing pattern is reduced since it is a genuinely considered normal signal.

The engulfing or second candle may likewise be enormous. This can leave a trader with an exceptionally large [stop loss](/stop-lossorder) in the event that they opt to trade the pattern. The possible reward from the trade may not legitimize the risk.
