# One-Touch Option
## What Is a One-Touch Option?

A one-touch option pays a [premium](/option-premium) to the holder of the [option](/option) if the [spot rate](/spot_rate) comes to the [strike price](/strikeprice) whenever prior to option [expiration](/expirationdate).

## Grasping One-Touch Option

One-touch option permits investors to pick the target price, time to expiration, and the premium to be received when the target price is reached. Compared to vanilla [calls](/calloption) and [puts](/putoption), one-touch options permit investors to profit from a simplified yes-or-no market forecast. Just two outcomes are conceivable with a one-touch option on the off chance that an investor holds the contract the entire way through expiration:

1. The target price is reached and the trader gathers the premium paid plus the negotiated payout
1. The target price isn't reached and the trader loses the premium paid to open the trade

Like customary call and put options, most one-touch option trades can be closed before expiration for a profit or a loss relying upon how close the underlying market or asset is to the target price.

One-touch options are valuable for traders who accept that the price of an underlying market or asset will meet or breach a certain price level from now on, yet who are not certain that price level is sustainable. Since a one-touch option has just a yes-or-no outcome by expiration, it is generally more affordable than other exotic [binary options](/binary-option) like [double one-touch](/doublebarrieroption) or [barrier options](/barrieroption).

[Derivatives](/subsidiary), like one-touch options, are not oftentimes traded by small investors. There are some trading settings where they are accessible, yet regulators in Europe and the U.S. have frequently cautioned investors that they might be overpriced. Generally speaking exploiting that mispricing by turning into an option writer or seller is unimaginable.

> Binary or exotic derivatives are typically traded by institutions that can haggle with one more for better pricing.

## Outcome #1: Price Approaches Target Price

A trader accepts the [S&P 500](/sp500) will rise by 5% sooner or later over the course of the next 90 days, yet isn't as certain about how long the index will stay at or over that price. The trader pays $45 per contract to buy one-touch options that pay $100 per contract, if the S&P 500 meets or surpasses that target price anytime throughout the next 90 days. Expect that fourteen days after the fact the S&P 500 has risen 2%, which has increased the value of the position since almost certainly, the index will arrive at that target price. The trader could decide to sell their one-touch option contracts for a profit or keep on holding the trade through expiration.

## Outcome #2: Price Remains Flat or Moves Away From Target Price

Expect that a trader accepted the S&P 500 would rise 5% over the course of the next 90 days and opened a one-touch option trade to profit from that forecast. The trader paid $45 for one-touch option contracts that will pay $100 per contract assuming the target price is reached. Rather than rising, the index drops 3% on surprising news seven days after the fact, which makes it doubtful that the target price would be arrived at before the options lapse. This trader may then choose to either sell the options and close the trade at a lower price for a loss or hold it in the expectations that the market recuperates.
