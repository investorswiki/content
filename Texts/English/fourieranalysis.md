# Fourier Analysis
## What Is Fourier Analysis?

Fourier analysis is a type of mathematical analysis that endeavors to recognize examples or cycles in a period series data set which has proactively been normalized. Specifically, it looks to work on complex or uproarious data by breaking down it into a series of geometrical or exponential capabilities, for example, [sine waves](/sinewave). Every one of these sine waves would have a specific cycle length, amplitude, and phase relationship with the other sine waves, which then could be added back together to recreate the noticed data.

By first recognizing and eliminating any effects of spurious [trends](/trendanalysis) or other muddling factors from the data set, the effects of periodic cycles or examples can be distinguished all the more accurately, leaving the analyst with a better estimate of where that the data under analysis will take from now on.

## Figuring out Fourier Analysis

Named after the nineteenth-century French mathematician and physicist Jean Baptiste Joseph Fourier (1768-1830), Fourier analysis might sound complex, yet it really seems OK. Basically it guesses that confounded [time series](/timeseries) data can be construed as the sum of easier capabilities, for example, those portrayed by geometry.

Various studies have investigated Fourier analysis for commonsense value in forecasting stock market price. Since Fourier analysis looks to break down dreary waveforms into harmonic parts and the stock market doesn't move in a distinct and redundant way, results are mixed, as most comparable strategies are.

Fourier analysis methods are often executed in [algorithmic trading](/algorithmictrading) as a [technical analysis](/technicalanalysis) device for forecasting market course and trends. Recent research that has looked to overwhelmingly inspect the value of Fourier analysis in foreseeing stock prices has, in any case, demonstrated the method to be a disappointment.

## Reasonable Example

For instance, assume a manufacturing company wanted to understand what stage of its price cycle its super raw material was in. Since inflation would continually be expanding the dollar price of the commodity over the long haul, an analyst would eliminate the effects of inflation from the commodity's historical prices first.

[Inflation](/inflation) is regularly kept up with between indicated rates and in the event that inflation meets or surpasses a pre-set limit, interest rates will be adjusted by central bankers to one or the other increase or diminishing inflation so it is brought inside a [target range](/inflation_targeting). Subsequently, as the rate of inflation increases, diminishes, or remains something very similar, interest rates will waver all over to control an undesired rate of inflation.

On the off chance that our analyst hence accepts that inflation rates are cyclical, they can deduct a sine wave that matches the inflation cycle from the time series. Whenever inflation has been controlled for, the analyst would then have a substantially more accurate image of the true price cycles experienced by the commodity.

## Features
- The thought is to have the option to eliminate noise or confounding factors from the data set to distinguish true examples or trends.
- Fourier analysis has been applied to stock trading, however research looking at the technique has found next to zero evidence that it is helpful in practice.
- Fourier analysis is a mathematical technique that decays complex time series data into parts that are less difficult geometrical capabilities.
