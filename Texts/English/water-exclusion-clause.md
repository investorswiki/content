# Water Exclusion Clause
## What Is a Water Exclusion Clause?

A water exclusion clause is a restriction in [homeowners](/homeowners-insurance) and [renter's](/renters-insurance) insurance policies that denies coverage for some water-related claims. Events that are probably going to fall under a water exclusion clause incorporate damage brought about by flood, tidal waves, standing water, groundwater, and drain or sewage reinforcements.

Homeowners and renters might have the option to add a few types of [water damage coverage](/water-damage-insurance) excluded in the standard contract by purchasing a [rider](/rider) or separate, specialized insurance.

## Understanding a Water Exclusion Clause

A water exclusion clause is common in most property [insurance policies](/insurance-coverage). The thinking is that main specific areas are inclined to water-related natural disaster events, like floods, tsunamis, or waves. Water exclusion is one of several types of exclusion clauses found in homeowners and renter insurance contracts. Other standard exclusions incorporate developments of the earth (shudders, avalanches), wars and certain other government activities, and nuclear hazards and events.

Notwithstanding, water-related perils aren't completely excluded by homeowners insurance. Most policies regularly cover [water damage](/water-damage-insurance) that happens for specific reasons — generally a sudden or accidental event that happens inside the structure, like a burst pipe or failing dishwasher or other pipes/water supply-related issues. However, steady damage or wear and tear that occurs over the long haul generally isn't covered.

Destruction arising out of certain climate events —, for example, rainstorms that send a tree crashing through a wall, or snow that implodes a rooftop, permitting water to pour in — generally are covered (at any rate, the water damage they cause is; unexpectedly, the cost of fixing the wall or rooftop may not be). A few types of hurricane-related damage may likewise be covered, however in 19 states and the District of Columbia policyholders must pay an extra [hurricane deductible](/hurricane-deductible) before coverage kicks in.

## Special Considerations: Floods and Water Exclusion Clauses

Except if it's due to an internal reason, similar to a spouting washer/dryer or a spilling over latrine, flooding is a normal part of a water exclusion clause. These clauses generally characterize a flood as rising or surface waters that come from the outside in, however even this is much of the time subject to debate — and litigation: Should the clause apply in the event that the flood results from man-made powers (a burst dam, a fell levee) as opposed to natural powers (e.g., continuous rain that makes a river flood its banks)? Does surface water come exclusively from rain or dissolving snow, or does it count in the event that it's been perched on a man-made surface like asphalt, a gallery, or a rooftop?

Notwithstanding the legal discussion, most importantly a flood from an outside source that saturates a home presumably will not be covered by the [hazard insurance](/hazardinsurance) part of a standard homeowners policy. The costly idea of water damage, and its pervasiveness — in 2018, water damage and freezing addressed 23.8% of all insurance losses — gives homeowners and renters motivations to track down alternative coverage options.

Normally, that means purchasing a separate contract for protection against flood damage, known as [flood insurance](/flood-insurance). As a matter of fact, for properties in high-risk areas, lenders some of the time require [mortgaged](/contract) homeowners to carry flood insurance — essentially to safeguard the structure of the dwelling. (Not at all like a standard homeowners policy, flood insurance expects that a policyholder buy separate policies to cover the property and the property's items.) Homes financed by a federally backed lender, for instance, require flood insurance assuming they are situated in a government-assigned flood hazard zone.

Flood insurance policies are available for both residential and [commercial properties](/commercial-property). Renters can likewise purchase flood insurance policies that cover their [personal property](/personalproperty) in a solitary family home, apartment, condominium, or business property.

While flood insurance can be purchased through various insurance companies, the rates are regulated by the federal National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP). So a similar policy costs a similar amount, regardless of which company it is purchased through.
