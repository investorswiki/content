# GitHub
GitHub is an electronic open source development platform and facilitating service that allows users to transfer records, reports, and computer code to their accounts. GitHub allows both registered and non-registered users to see, download and even add to the transferred records and source code storehouses. Due to its low cost and features, GitHub turned into the biggest source code platform in the world, being involved by numerous engineers as a method for performing collaborative work, while likewise having the option to share an assortment of software, records, and documentation.
#### How GitHub functions
When a GitHub account is registered, the client can make their own registry of records and content, which is called store. In the wake of making a storehouse, one can make the purported master branch. GitHub master branches address the single starting point of any project. It depends on the client to make a project available to anybody (public storehouse) or to limit the access to it and share just with certain users (private vault). From a master branch, sub-branches can be made, which essentially allows the client to separately deal with different parts of the project. On a public vault, different users are able to recommend changes to the code, eventually transferring new renditions of the records. Ideas are made through a feature called pull request, which enables the engineers to examine and survey the likely changes before they are successfully applied. The GitHub platform offers various features and instruments that make it simple for engineers to make or return changes and to follow their overall progress.
#### What is a pull request?
A pull request allows users to educate others regarding the changes they have made to a certain branch or storehouse. At the point when a pull request is made, the client is taken to an outline screen where he can undoubtedly survey every one of the changes made to the code, looking at the old and the new rendition. Hence, all changes are archived and recorded and users may likewise add remarks, names, and milestones or even assign specific tasks to different supporters.
#### Who utilizes GitHub?
Due to its flexible platform, GitHub has users from both the public and private sector. Software companies, App engineers, individual software engineers, and cryptocurrency designers are just a few models. As an open source project, [Bitcoin GitHub](/bitcoin) has numerous designers around the world, with bunches of individuals adding to the survey and improvement of the Bitcoin source code.
#### Is GitHub free?
GitHub is free for all open source and commercial development projects. Notwithstanding, the free plans limit the numbers of private and public stores that can be made by an account. The free plans likewise limit the number of colleagues a project can have. In this manner, bigger projects might have to upgrade to a paid GitHub plan, as per their requirements.
