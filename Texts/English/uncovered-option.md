At the point when somebody composes a [put option](/putoption) contract, the contract's buyer has the privilege to sell the underlying stock to the writer for a pre-decided strike price prior to the contract's expiration.

The higher the price of the security moves over the contract's strike price before expiration, the more capital loss a naked call writer would experience were they forced to sell 100 shares to the contract buyer at the strike price.
With regards to a naked put option, the most a writer stands to make is the premium their buyer pays for the contract. On account of a put, a writer's potential loss is capped on the grounds that a security can't fall below zero dollars in price.
Hence, a naked put writer's loss is capped at the contract's strike price minus its premium times 100. For instance, in the event that a put contract's strike price is $50 and its premium is $1, its writer could experience a capital loss as much as $4,900.
