# Data Migration
## What Is Data Migration?

Data migration is the most common way of moving stored digital data between computers, systems, or configurations. Data migration happens for a number of reasons, including server replacement or maintenance, a change of [data centers](/data-warehousing), data consolidation projects, and system redesigns. As a very remarkable company's corporate information and [business intelligence](/business-intelligence-bi) is contained in its data, any data migration project must be done carefully to limit risks.

## Grasping Data Migration

Data migration implies a critical danger to [business continuity](/business-continuity-arranging) in the event that it isn't done as expected. Loss of data is, of course, a worst situation imaginable, yet companies must likewise deal with free time, similarity issues, and overall system performance issues. Data migration is made more troublesome by large measures of data, different organizations of data, and disparate data habits inside a corporation.

To limit the risks of data migration, companies make definite data migration policies that prioritize [back ups](/back-up), moving order, and concurrent data environments whenever the situation allows. In the event that it isn't workable for a company to run a pre-migration environment while the new environment is prepared, then, at that point, there will be critical margin time as business operations on the current applications are suspended to consider the data migration. This type of stop, transfer, and begin data migration might be required while moving to new platforms or when there are hard limits on physical storage, and swaps or fixes are required on the existing storage technology.

## Zero Downtime Data Migration

The zero-free time migration model relies upon having sufficient storage to establish and run two complete environments. A full copy of a company's data is taken into the new environment and tried while employees stay in the old environment. The bugs are worked out of the new system, guaranteeing that every one of the applications actually work and everything is where it ought to be. In the wake of testing is complete, a new copy is brought in, and every one of the employees are exchanged over to the new environment. The old data environment is at times left open for a period of months with the goal that employees can get records from the old data system yet not compose new data to those servers. In all data migrations, a post-migration [data audit](/audittrail) is finished to check for data loss.

## Further developing Data Migration

One thing that can further develop a data migration is to clean out and normalize data rehearses prior to migration. The organization of a company's data is in many cases an impression of the different filing habits of its kin. Two individuals with a similar job might well utilize completely various practices. For instance, saving contracts by vendor in one case and by [fiscal year](/fiscalyear) and month in another. Binding together data practices can be a lot greater job than really moving the data, however clean, lucidly organized data backed up by clear policies serves to future proof a company's data for some migrations yet to come.

## Features
- Data migration alludes to progressing data stored on one computer system to another.
- This interaction might happen due to technology redesigns, moving between physical areas, or during routine maintenance operations.
- Since companies today depend intensely on their data to conduct everyday business, data migration must be carried out carefully and safely as not to cause disturbances, loss of data, or a security breach.
