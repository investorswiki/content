# Electronic Filing (E-File)
## What Is Electronic Filing (E-File)?

Electronic filing is the process of submitting tax returns over the internet utilizing tax preparation software that has been preapproved by the relevant tax authority, like the U.S. [Internal Revenue Service](/irs) (IRS) or the [Canada Revenue Agency](/ccra).

The convenience and efficiency of e-filing have made it increasingly famous in recent years. The IRS says e-filing speeds up tax refunds and helps to stay away from delays.

## Electronic Filing (E-File) Options

Taxpayers can file their returns directly on the IRS website, submitting fillable forms utilizing IRS Free File. Those with a [adjusted gross income](/agi) earned in 2021 of $73,000 or less can alternatively use the Free File site to access the free e-filing services of IRS software partners with guided tax preparation, including a Spanish-language option.

A taxpayer has the option of filing the return utilizing any tax preparation software with e-filing usefulness or hiring the services of tax professionals who use comparable software. The IRS Free File site has a search feature to help taxpayers find an authorized e-filing provider in their area.

## Advantages of Electronic Filing

E-filing saves the tax agency time and money because it transmits a return's data directly to its computers, fundamentally reducing input errors. Filing electronically with tax preparation software likewise helps to reduce taxpayer calculation errors and missing entries, the IRS says.

Most taxpayers who e-file and provide direct deposit information can expect to receive any due refund in no less than 21 days assuming there are no issues with their tax return, as per the IRS.

Another benefit of e-filing is that the tax filer receives an acceptance or rejection notice in no less than 48 hours — generally in something like 24 hours — of sending the tax return. Acceptance is proof that the documents have been received and are in the system, while a rejection alerts the taxpayer that the return has not been accepted by the IRS. The rejection notice will include information on what needs to be corrected on the return to make it so it is acceptable. On the off chance that you e-filed before the tax due date yet are rejected after it, then there is a five-day grace period for correcting and resubmitting your return. After that, you must send in a corrected paper return.

## Limitations on E-Filing

The IRS recommends just taxpayers comfortable doing their own taxes e-file without help from a professional or tax preparation software.

IRS Free File is just available for returns for the latest tax year. Earlier year returns returning two years can in any case be filed electronically by registered tax preparers.

The IRS accepts e-filed returns for the latest year until a November cutoff date ordinarily announced in October, subject to the same timeliness rules as paper returns.

An electronic filing could be rejected over mistakes in entering a social security number or a payer's identification number, an omitted form, or a misspelled name. Returns can regularly be e-filed again once such errors are fixed, the IRS says. As a last resort and the deadline looms, send in a paper return instead.
