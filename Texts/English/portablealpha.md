# Portable Alpha
## What Is the Portable Alpha Strategy?

The portable alpha strategy centers around investing in stocks or different assets that have shown next to zero correlation with the markets. To do this, investors separate [alpha](/alpha) from [beta](/beta) by investing in securities that are not in the [market index](/marketindex) from which their beta is derived.

Alpha is the return accomplished well beyond the market return (or beta) without facing more risk. Hence, portable alpha is a strategy that includes investing a portion of assets in assets that have practically no correlation with the market.

## Figuring out Portable Alpha

Initial, several definitions:

- The alpha of a stock or other asset is its historic return over a more extensive market index or one more industry benchmark that it is compared with.
- The beta of an asset is its volatility or its riskiness compared to a benchmark. It measures the degree to which the price of the asset moves with the market, not freely.

Choosing assets for their beta is a key strategy in portfolio management. These are sometimes alluded to as passive returns. A stock or fund is chosen in light of the fact that its beta shows it will match the return of the benchmark.

### Utilizing Beta

A stock or fund with a beta of 1.0 will in general go all over with the movement of the market. A fund with a beta of 0.5 goes all over just half as much as the market. One with a beta of 1.5 goes all over 1.5 times as much as the market.

> Portable alpha may be accomplished by giving one portion of a portfolio to consistent enormous cap stocks and one more portion to more unstable small-cap stocks.
>

Hence, beta can be said to address passive returns or returns that outcome from the movement of the market as a whole.

### Utilizing Alpha

A second type of portfolio returns is known as [idiosyncratic](/idiosyncraticrisk). These are returns that are accomplished by selection as per alpha.

That is, the stocks or funds are chosen since they have a history of beating the benchmark. This cycle is active management, not passive management.

### Utilizing Portable Alpha

An investor can accomplish portable alpha by investing in securities that are not related with the beta. Commonly, the goal with portable alpha is to accomplish a higher overall return without imperiling the beta, or volatility, of the whole portfolio.

A portable alpha strategy could include investing one portion of the portfolio in huge cap stocks to get the beta or market return, and one more portion in small-cap equities to accomplish alpha.

Since small-cap stocks are more unstable than enormous cap stocks, the overall beta will then, at that point, be higher.

To kill this higher beta, the small-cap strategy could be hedged with futures on a small-cap index, subsequently raising the beta of the overall portfolio to its original level.

## Features
- Its beta is a measure of its volatility over the long haul in comparison with a similar benchmark.
- A stock or other asset's alpha is its return in excess of a benchmark against which it very well may be compared.
- Portable alpha is a strategy intended to add alpha returns without risking the overall beta of the portfolio.
