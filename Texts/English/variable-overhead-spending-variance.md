# Variable Overhead Spending Variance
## What Is Variable Overhead Spending Variance?

A spending variance is the difference between the genuine amount of a specific expense and the expected (or planned) amount of an expense. To comprehend what variable overhead spending variance is, it assists with understanding what a variable overhead is. Variable overhead is a cost associated with running a business that vacillates with operational activity. As production output increments or diminishes, variable overheads move in tandem. Overheads are regularly a fixed cost, for instance, administrative expenses. Variable overheads, then again, are tied to production levels.

Variable overhead spending variance is the difference between genuine variable overhead cost, which depends on the costs of indirect materials associated with manufacturing, and the planned costs called the standard variable overhead costs.

## Figuring out Variable Overhead Spending Variance

Variable Overhead Spending Variance is basically the difference between what the variable production overheads **actually** cost and what they **should** have cost given the level of activity during a period.

The standard variable overhead rate is regularly communicated in terms of the number [of machine hours](/overhead-rate) or labor hours relying upon whether the production cycle is transcendently carried out manually or via automation. A company might even involve both machine and labor hours as a basis for the standard (planned) rate if the utilization both manual and automated processes in their operations.

Variable overhead spending variance is great if the real costs of [indirect materials](/rawmaterials) — for instance, paint and consumables like oil and oil — are lower than the standard or planned variable overheads. It is unfavorable in the event that the genuine costs are higher than the planned costs.

> Variable production overheads incorporate costs that can't be directly credited to a specific unit of output. Costs like direct material and direct labor, then again, shift directly with every unit of output.

## Illustration of Variable Overhead Spending Variance

Suppose that real labor hours utilized are 140, the standard or planned variable overhead rate is $8.40 per direct labor hour and the genuine variable overhead rate is $7.30 per direct labor hour. The variable overhead spending variance is calculated as below:

Standard variable overhead Rate $8.40 − Actual Variable Overhead Rate $7.30 =$1.10

Difference Per Hour = $ 1.10 \u00d7 Actual Labor Hours 140 = $154

Variable Overhead Spending Variance = $154

In this case, the variance is good on the grounds that the real costs are lower than the standard costs.

A good variance might happen due to economies of scale, bulk discounts for materials, less expensive supplies, efficient cost controls, or errors in budgetary planning.

An unfavorable variance might happen on the off chance that the cost of indirect labor increments, cost controls are incapable, or there are errors in budgetary planning.

## Restrictions
> ### Fast Fact
> Variable overhead spending variance is basically the difference between the genuine cost of variable production overheads versus what they ought to have cost given the output during a period.
