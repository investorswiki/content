# Widely Held Fixed Investment Trust (WHFIT)
## What Is a Widely Held Fixed Investment Trust (WHFIT)?

A widely held fixed investment trust (WHFIT) is a type of [unit investment trust](/uit) (UIT) with something like one interest held by a [third party](/third-party). Investors who purchase shares of the trust receive any normal payments of interest or dividends earned on the equities or bonds held in trust.

## Seeing Widely Held Fixed Investment Trusts

Widely held fixed investment trusts must host something like one third-get-together interest holder, or [middleman](/middleman). In any case, they function the same way as some other unit investment trust offering shares in a [fixed portfolio](/characterized portfolio) of assets to prospective investors. Since the investors who fund the initial purchase of the assets in the portfolio regularly partake as trust interest holders, widely held fixed investment trusts fall under the category of grantor's trusts.

Trust interest holders receive [dividend](/dividend) or [interest](/interest) payments derived from the underlying assets in the portfolio in view of the extent of shares they hold. The presence of mediators in the trust means investors might hold either direct interest in the trust or indirect interest if a middleman like a broker holds the shares in another investor's name.

WHFITs are classified as pass-through investments for income tax purposes. The gatherings engaged with the creation and maintenance of a WHFIT include:

- **Grantors**: Investors that pool their money to purchase the assets set in the trust.
- **Trustee**: Typically a broker or financial institution that deals with the trust's assets.
- **Middleman**: Usually a broker that holds the unit shares in the trust for their client/beneficiary.
- **Trust Interest Holder**: This is the investor that possesses unit shares in the WHFIT and is qualified for income produced by the trust.

## Different Types of Investment Companies

The [U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)](/sec) considers unit investment trusts one of three types of investment companies, alongside mutual funds and [closed-end funds](/closed-endinvestment). Like mutual funds, widely held fixed investment trusts offer investors an opportunity to purchase shares in a diversified portfolio of underlying assets at a lower cost and with less problem than it would take to independently build the portfolio. Dissimilar to mutual funds, widely held fixed investment trusts offer a static portfolio of assets. They likewise indicate a termination date on which the trust will sell the underlying assets and convey the proceeds to investors.

The U.S. Internal Revenue Service (IRS) generally treats widely held investment trusts as [flow-through entities](/flow-through) for tax purposes. Along these lines, the trust itself doesn't pay taxes on its earnings. All things considered, individuals who invest in the trust receive a Form 1099 specifying their annual earnings and must pay taxes on those amounts as they would some other earned income.

## Widely Held Mortgage Trusts

One common assortment of widely held fixed investment trust, the widely held mortgage trust, offers portfolios comprising of [mortgage](/mortgage) assets. In these cases, the trust commonly purchases a [pool of mortgages](/mortgage_pool) or other comparative debt instruments tied to real estate. Investors earn returns in light of the interest collected on the underlying mortgages. The three major federal mortgage lenders, Freddie Mac, Fannie Mae, and Ginnie Mae, all occasionally issue widely held mortgage trusts.

Connected with this is a real estate mortgage investment conduit (REMIC), which is a unique purpose vehicle that is utilized to pool mortgage loans and issue [mortgage-backed securities (MBS).](/mbs)Real estate mortgage investment conduits hold commercial and residential mortgages in trust and issue interests in these mortgages to investors.

## The Differences Between UITs and Mutual Funds

Mutual funds are unassuming funds, implying that the [portfolio manager](/portfoliomanager) can buy and sell securities in the portfolio. The [investment objective](/investmentobjective) of each mutual fund is to [outperform](/outperform) a specific [benchmark](/benchmark), and the portfolio manager trades securities to meet that objective. A stock mutual fund, for instance, may have an objective to outperform the [Standard and Poor's 500 index](/sp500) of enormous cap stocks.

Numerous investors like to involve mutual funds for stock investing with the goal that the portfolio can be traded. Assuming that an investor is interested in buying and holding a portfolio of bonds and earning interest, that individual might purchase a UIT or closed-end fund with a fixed portfolio. A UIT, for instance, pays the interest income on the bonds and holds the portfolio until a specific end date when the bonds are sold and the principal amount is returned to the owners. A bond investor can claim a diversified portfolio of bonds in a UIT, as opposed to oversee interest payments and bond reclamations in a personal [brokerage account](/brokerageaccount).

## Features

- WHFITS might invest in a fixed portfolio of stocks and bonds, or probably real estate mortgage investments.
- A widely held fixed investment trust (WHFIT) is an investment vehicle where no less than one interested third-party is involved.
