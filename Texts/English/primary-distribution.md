# Primary Distribution
## What Is a Primary Distribution?

In finance, the term primary distribution alludes to the original sale of a [security](/security) issue to the investing public. One of the most notable instances of a primary distribution is the [initial public offering](/ipo) (IPO), in which another company sells its shares interestingly.

A primary distribution may likewise include the issuance of preferred shares, debt securities, or structured notes, among others. A primary distribution is comparable in numerous ways to a [primary offering](/primaryoffering) and the two terms are frequently utilized conversely.

The proceeds from a primary distribution are received directly by the issuer of the security being referred to. For instance, on account of an IPO, the recently listed company gets the proceeds from the sale of stock to the public, raising equity capital for itself.

## How Primary Distributions Work

Primary distributions are a critical part of the overall [financial markets](/financial-market), as they are the primary mechanism by which issuers raise capital from investors in the [public market](/public). Paradoxically, secondary distributions don't raise capital for issuers in light of the fact that their proceeds are paid exclusively to the current owner of those securities.

Not at all like primary distributions, secondary distributions don't increase a company's shares outstanding. This is on the grounds that they don't include the creation of any new shares.

Nonetheless, to sell their shares to another person, that subsequent sale would be viewed as a secondary distribution and wouldn't lead to any direct cash inflow to the company.

Periodically, secondary distributions are made by company officers, [high-net-worth](/hnwi) (HNW) people, or [institutional investors](/institutionalinvestor) who hold large blocks of an existing security. For instance, a secondary distribution may be made by a venture capital ([VC](/venturecapitalist)) firm that aided fund an as of late listed company in the years prior to its IPO. Now that the company is publicly listed, the VC firm might wish to cash out on their position by selling their shares through a secondary distribution.
