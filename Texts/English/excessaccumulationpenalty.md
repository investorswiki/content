# Excess Accumulation Penalty
## What Is the Excess Accumulation Penalty?

The excess accumulation penalty is exacted by the [Internal Revenue Service](/irs) (IRS) when a retirement account owner or the beneficiary of a retirement account neglects to pull out the base amount required for a tax year. This base amount required is known as the [required least distribution](/requiredminimumdistribution) (RMD).

Retirement account holders beyond 72 years old and their heirs of any age are generally required to take RMDs to stay away from the excess accumulation penalty. The RMD age was beforehand 70\u00bd yet was raised to 72 following the December 2019 passage of the Setting Every Community Up For Retirement Enhancement (SECURE) Act.

## Figuring out the Excess Accumulation Penalty

An excess accumulation penalty of half [excise tax](/excisetax) for that year might be charged assuming withdrawals made by the account owner are lower than the required least distribution for the year. Generally, account owners must start getting distributions by April 1 of the year following the year in which they arrive at age 72.

The justification for this is simple: If you contribute pre-tax dollars to a retirement account, the IRS needs those tax dollars sooner or later. The penalty applies to [individual retirement accounts](/ira) (IRAs), including [SEP](/sep) and SIMPLE IRAs. It doesn't matter to [Roth IRAs](/rothira), since the taxes have proactively been paid on those dollars.

The required least distribution for any a seemingly endless amount of time after the year wherein the person arrives at age 72 must be made by Dec. 31 of that year. In the event that the excess accumulation is due to reasonable blunder, and the account holder has done whatever it takes to cure the mistake, a waiver of the penalty can be mentioned.

The amount required to be not entirely set in stone by the IRS and can be calculated by utilizing its worksheet.

## Types of Retirement Accounts

To be certain you pull out the required least distribution from your retirement account, it's useful to survey the various types of retirement accounts that require RMDs.

### Payroll Deduction IRA

Regardless of whether an employer need to take on a retirement plan, it can permit its employees to add to an IRA through payroll deductions. A [payroll deduction](/payroll-deduction-plan) IRA gives a simple and direct way for eligible employees to save.

### Salary Reduction Simplified Employee Pension (SARSEP)

A [SARSEP](/sarsep) is a SEP set up before 1997 that incorporates a salary reduction arrangement. Rather than laying out a separate retirement plan, employers make contributions to their own IRA and the IRAs of their employees, subject to certain percentages of pay and dollar limits.

### Simplified Employee Pension (SEP)

These give a simplified method to employers to make contributions to a retirement plan for their employees. Rather than laying out a [profit-sharing](/profitsharingplan) or money purchase plan with a [trust](/trust), employers can take on a SEP agreement and make contributions directly to an individual retirement account or an individual retirement annuity laid out for each eligible employee.

### SIMPLE IRA Plan

[SIMPLE IRA](/simple-ira) plans are tax-inclined toward retirement plans that small employers, including self-employed individuals, can set up for the benefit of their employees.
