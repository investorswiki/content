# Irrelevance Proposition Theorem
## What Is the Irrelevance Proposition Theorem?

The irrelevance proposition theorem is a theory of corporate capital structure that posits financial leverage doesn't influence the value of a company in the event that income tax and distress costs are absent in the business environment. The irrelevance proposition theorem was developed by [Merton Miller](/merton-miller) and [Franco Modigliani](/franco-modigliani), and was a reason to their Nobel Prize-winning work, "The Cost of Capital, Corporation Finance, and Theory of Investment." It is entirely expected to see the expression adjusted to the "capital structure irrelevance guideline" or "capital structure irrelevance theory," in the well known press.

## Understanding the Irrelevance Proposition Theorem

In fostering their theory, Miller and Modigliani previously assumed that firms have two primary approaches to getting funding: equity and debt. While each type of funding has its own benefits and disadvantages, the ultimate outcome is a firm sharing its cash flows to investors, no matter what the funding source picked. On the off chance that all investors approach similar financial markets, investors can buy into or sell out of a firm's cash flows anytime.

This means that without even a trace of taxes, bankruptcy costs, agency costs, and asymmetric data, and in an efficient market, the value of a firm is unaffected by how that firm is financed.

Miller and Modigliani utilized the irrelevance proposition theorem as a starting point in their compromise theory, which depicts the possibility that a company picks how much debt finance and how much equity finance to use by adjusting the costs (bankruptcy) and benefits (growth).

Reactions of the irrelevance proposition theorem center around the lack of realism in eliminating the effects of income tax and distress costs from a firm's capital structure. Since many factors influence a firm's value, including profits, assets, and market opportunities, testing the theorem becomes troublesome. For financial specialists, the theory rather frames the significance of financing choices more than giving a description of how financing operations work.

## Illustration of the Irrelevance Proposition Theorem

Assume company ABC is valued at $200,000. This valuation is all derived from the assets of an equivalent amount that it holds. As per the irrelevance proposition theorem, the valuation of the company will continue as before no matter what its capital structure i.e., the net amount of cash or debt or equity that it holds in its account books. The job of interest rates and taxes, outer factors that could fundamentally influence its operational expenses and valuation, in its account book is totally wiped out.

For instance, consider that the company holds $100,000 in debt and $100,000 in cash. The interest rates associated with debt servicing or cash holdings are viewed as zero, as indicated by the irrelevance proposition theorem. Presently guess that the company makes an equity offering of $120,000 in shares and its excess assets, worth $80,000, are held in debt. After some time, ABC chooses to offer more shares, worth $30,000 in equity, and reduce its debt holdings to $50,000.

This move changes its capital structure and, in reality, would become cause to rethink its valuation. Yet, the irrelevance proposition theorem states that the overall valuation of ABC will in any case continue as before in light of the fact that we have killed the possibility of outer factors influencing its capital structure.

## Features
- The theorem is frequently scrutinized on the grounds that it doesn't consider factors present in that frame of mind, as income tax and distress costs.
- The theorem likewise doesn't think about different factors, for example, profits and assets, which influence a firm's valuation.
- The irrelevance proposition theorem was developed by Merton Miller and Franco Modigliani, and was a reason to their Nobel Prize-winning work, "The Cost of Capital, Corporation Finance, and Theory of Investment."
- The irrelevance proposition theorem states that financial leverage doesn't influence a company's value in the event that it doesn't need to experience income tax and distress costs.
