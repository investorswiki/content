# SEC Yield
## What is the SEC Yield?

The SEC yield is a standard yield calculation developed by the U.S. [Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)](/sec) that takes into account fairer comparisons of bond funds. It depends on the latest 30-day period covered by the fund's filings with the SEC. The yield figure mirrors the [dividends](/profit) and interest earned during the period after the deduction of the fund's expenses. It is likewise alluded to as the "standardized yield."

## Grasping the SEC Yield

The SEC yield is utilized to compare [bond funds](/bondfund) in light of the fact that it catches the effective rate of interest an investor might receive from now on. It is widely viewed as an effective method for looking at mutual funds or [exchange-traded funds (ETFs)](/etf) since this yield measure is generally exceptionally steady from one month to another. The subsequent yield calculation shows investors what they would earn in yield throughout a year period in the event that the fund kept earning a similar rate until the end of the year. It is mandatory for funds to compute this yield. This yield contrasts from the [Distribution Yield](/distribution-yield), which is ordinarily shown on a bond's website.

## Calculation of the SEC Yield

Most funds compute a 30-day SEC yield on the last day of every month, however U.S. [money market funds](/money-marketfund) work out and report a seven-day SEC yield. The standardized formula for the 30-day SEC yield comprises of four factors:

a = interest and dividends received throughout the past 30-day period

b = accrued expenses over the course of the past 30-day period, excluding repayments

c = the average number of shares outstanding, consistently, which were qualified for receive distributions

d = the maximum price per share on the day of the calculation, the last day of the period

The formula of the annualized 30-day SEC yield is:

2 x (((a - b)/(c x d) + 1) ^ 6 - 1)

## Illustration of SEC Yield

Expect Investment Fund X earned $12,500 in dividends and $3,000 in interest. The fund likewise recorded $6,000 worth of expense, of which $2,000 was repaid. The fund has 150,000 shares qualified for receive distributions, and on the last day of the period, the day the [yield](/yield) is being calculated, the highest price the shares came to was $75. In this scenario, the factors equivalent:

a = $12,500 + $,3000 = $15,500

b = $6,000 - $2,000 = $4,000

c = 150,000

d = $75

When these numbers are connected to the formula, it seems to be this:

30-day yield = 2 x ((($15,500 - $4,000)/(150,000 x $75) + 1) ^ 6 - 1), or 2 x (0.00615) = 1.23%

## Features
- The yield calculation shows investors what they would earn in yield throughout a year period on the off chance that the fund kept earning a similar rate until the end of the year.
- The SEC yield is a standard yield calculation developed for fair comparison of bonds.
