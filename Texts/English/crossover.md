For most models, the crossover signals that now is the right time to one or the other buy or sell the underlying asset. Investors use crossovers along with different indicators to follow things like defining moments, price trends and money flow.

Crossovers showing a moving average are generally the reason for breakouts and breakdowns. Moving averages can determine a change in the price trend in view of the crossover. For instance, a technique for trend reversal is utilizing a five-period simple moving average along with a 15-period simple moving average ([SMA](/sma)). A crossover between the two will signal a reversal in trend, or a breakout or breakdown.

A breakdown would be indicated by the five-period moving average crossing down through the 15-period.

As long-term indicators carry more weight, the golden cross shows a [bull market](/bullmarket) on the horizon and is built up by high trading [volumes](/volume).
