# Booking the Basis
## What Is Booking the Basis?

Booking the basis is an arrangement made between a buyer and a seller utilizing a [forward](/forward-trade contract) sales agreement.

It doesn't lock in the full price that must be paid toward the finish of the contract/agreement.

The full price is the basis added to (or deducted from) the price of the goods, which not entirely set in stone sometime in the not too distant future.

The basis will be added or deducted from that price to decide the full price of the payment for the sales agreement.

This can be put into utilization by traders or firms who accept that the basis will extend or contract from here on out and wish to [hedge](/hedge) themselves against that risk.

## Figuring out Booking the Basis

"Booking the basis" is utilized to work out a portion of the price of a sales agreement. The price of goods will be set let later, yet the basis is resolved at this point. The basis and price of the goods will be added together sometime in the not too distant future to give the full price of the sales agreement.

To start with, the two gatherings to a transaction concur upon the formula or basis for the deal. Then, at that point, sometime in the future, the last price is found by applying the recently settled upon basis to the current price of goods levels. The settled upon basis might be either positive or negative and is normally the difference between the [spot price](/spotprice) and the futures price in the market.

In effect, the two gatherings are just locking in the difference between a futures price and a spot price. They are consenting to add (or take away) this difference from the genuine price of the goods. The price of the goods not entirely set in stone sometime in the not too distant future and is normally founded on the overarching rates in the market around then.

## Instance of Booking the Basis

Envision that a forward sales agreement for conveying cotton is inked in June, with the buyer and seller consenting to a period horizon ending in November. The two players likewise concur that a basis of $20 will be added to the price of cotton at some later date.

Since the basis has booked, this means that the buyer, the seller, or the two players will have the option to declare at a previous date than November what the price of goods will be. For instance, one party might request to lock in a price of goods in August when the futures price of cotton is $210.

The total payment or cost of the sales agreement would be $230 = ($210 + $20), which comes about because of adding the original basis to the settled upon price of goods.

By booking the basis, the two sides have locked in a $20 basis.
