# Automated Clearing House (ACH)
## What Is the Automated Clearing House (ACH)?

The Automated Clearing House (ACH) Network is an electronic assets transfer system run by the former [National Automated Clearing House Association (NACHA)](/nacha) starting around 1974.

The ACH payment system gives ACH transactions to use with payroll, direct deposit, tax refunds, consumer bills, tax payments, and a lot greater payment services in the U.S.

## How the ACH Network Works

The ACH Network is an electronic system serving financial institutions to work with financial transactions in the U.S. It addresses in excess of 10,000 financial institutions and ACH transactions totaled more than $55 trillion out of 2019 by empowering almost 25 billion electronic financial transactions.

The ACH Network basically acts as a financial hub and assists individuals and organizations with moving money starting with one bank account then onto the next. ACH transactions comprise of direct deposits and direct payments, including [business-to-business (B2B)](/btob) transactions, government transactions, and consumer transactions.

An originator begins a direct deposit or direct payment transaction utilizing the ACH Network. Originators can be individuals, organizations, or government bodies, and ACH transactions can be either debit or credit. The originator's bank, otherwise called the starting depository financial institution (ODFI), takes the ACH transaction and batches it together with other ACH transactions to be conveyed at ordinary times over the course of the day.

An ACH operator, either the Federal Reserve or a clearinghouse, gets the batch of ACH transactions from the ODFI with the originator's transaction included. The ACH operator sorts the batch and makes transactions accessible to the bank or financial institution of the planned beneficiary, otherwise called the getting depository financial institution (RDFI). The beneficiary's bank account gets the transaction, subsequently accommodating the two accounts and ending the interaction.
