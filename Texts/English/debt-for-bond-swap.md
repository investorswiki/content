# Debt for Bond Swap
## What Is a Debt for Bond Swap?

A debt for bond swap is a debt swap including the exchange of another bond issue for comparative outstanding debt, or vice versa. The most common sort of bond utilized in the debt for bond swap is a [callable bond](/callablebond) in light of the fact that a bond must be called before swapping with another debt instrument. The bond's prospectus will detail the item's calling schedule.

Debt for bond swap transactions ordinarily occur to exploit falling interest rates when the cost of borrowing goes down. Different reasons might remember a change for the tax rates or for tax write-off purposes.

## Understanding Debt for Bond Swaps

Debt for bond swap happens when a company, or individual, calls a formerly issued bond, to exchange it for another [debt instrument](/debtinstrument). Frequently, a debt for bond swap exchanges one bond for one more bond with additional ideal terms.

Bonds typically have severe rules concerning maturity and interest rates, so to operate inside the regulations, companies issue callable bonds, which empower the issuer to recall a bond whenever without encountering any punishments.

For instance, in the event that interest rates go up a company might choose to issue new bonds at a lower face value and retire its current debt that conveys a higher face value; the company can then assume the loss as a tax deduction.

## Debt for Bond Swap and Callable Bonds

A callable bond is a debt instrument in which the issuer reserves the right to return the financial backer's principal and stop interest payments before the bond's maturity date. For instance, the issuer might call a bond developing in 2030 of every 2020. A callable (or redeemable) bond is typically called at an amount somewhat better than expected value. Higher call values are the aftereffect of prior bond calling.

For instance, on the off chance that interest rates have declined since a bond's beginning, the [issuing](/issue) company might wish to refinance the debt at the lower rate of interest. Calling the existing bond and reissuing will set aside the company cash. In this case, the company will call its current bonds and reissue them at a lower interest rate. Corporate and municipal bonds are two types of callable bonds.

## Special Considerations

For the most part, a debt for bond swap means giving a subsequent bond. A debt for bond swaps is most common when interest rates go down. In view of the reverse relationship between interest rates and the price of bonds, when interest rates go down a company can call the original bond with a higher interest rate, and swap it out with a recently issued bond with a lower interest rate.

> A debt for bond swap doesn't necessarily in every case require the issuance of a second bond of a similar type as the initial; a company might decide to utilize one more sort of debt instrument to replace the original bond. A debt for bond swap could replace the original bond with [notes](/note), certificates, mortgages, leases, or different agreements between a lender and a borrower.
