# Interest Coverage Ratio
The interest coverage ratio is the determination of how effectively/convenient a company can pay the interest on debt or loans. A solid company can meet interest payments as well as principal too. A low interest coverage ratio, otherwise called times interest earned, may stop lenders from giving extra funding to companies.

## Features

- The interest coverage ratio is calculated by separating a company's earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) by its interest expense during a given period.
- A few variations of the formula use EBITDA or EBIAT rather than EBIT to work out the ratio.
