# One-Cancels-All Order
## What Is a One-Cancels-All (OCA) Order?

A one-cancel-all order (OCA) is a bundle of no less than three stock or option limit orders placed together. Assuming one of these orders is executed, the leftover orders get canceled. An advanced order is accessible from broker platforms that take care of experienced traders. The two general strategies of utilizing an OCA order incorporate improving an entry price inside one stock or advancing the selection of one stock among several decisions. This order type isn't offered by all brokers.

## How a One-Cancel-All Order (OCA) Works

The orders sent all the while by an OCA can be [limit orders](/limitorder), [stop orders](/stoporder), or [stop-limit orders](/stoporder). placed on one or numerous stocks or equity option contracts. Assuming one of the trades held inside the OCA is set off, that order is executed and the other orders are promptly taught to be canceled. When an order is placed, a broker system can cancel that order on the off chance that it isn't now in that frame of mind of being filled. This means that an OCA order conveys a tiny risk that beyond what one order could actually be filled inside the split second after the main order is filled however before all other orders can be canceled.

Contingent upon how the broker's system is modified, in the event that the set off order must be partially filled, the other orders might be left open yet adjusted by the extent of the partially executed trade. In the event that an investor cancels one of the orders, the remainder will automatically be removed too.

The orders can all be placed on similar underlying stock or on separate issues. Option contracts can be part of a bundled OCA too. [Time in force](/timeinforce) headings, for example, great until canceled (GTC) might be applied to OCA orders.

## When to Use a One-Cancel-All (OCA) Order

There are many justifications for why an OCA order can be helpful. Typically, investors utilize the OCA order to invest in the most optimal stock between a couple of options, enhance the price point at which they enter a single stock, and shield their profits and safeguard themselves from losses.

### Streamline Selection of Multiple Stocks

For instance, assume an investor decides they need to invest in the retail sector in the approaching quarter. Assume they have $15,000 of accessible capital to work with. They research the sector and select three stocks they will consider, however they need to see which one will offer the best bargain over the course of the next week.

They place three limit orders, one for each stock, at a price over 1% below the latest statements. They determine the right number of shares for each stock to boost the number of shares they could buy at the prices indicated in the OCA order. Whichever stock arrives at the separate limit order first will be the stock the investor has chosen, and the other two orders will be canceled.

### Improve Entry Point in Single Stock

Another strategy includes thinking about various courses to a single investment. For example, a trader hoping to claim a particular stock might bundle a standard limit purchase order for the stock with at least one [options contracts](/optionscontract) that could give them other rights to purchase the stock at a positive price.

### Shield from Losses and Safeguard Gains

A third reasoning for an OCA order once in a while alluded to as a [bracketed](/bracketedbuyorder) order is intended to guarantee profit on account of a stock's heightening price and protect against downside loss. In this alternative order, an investor places a market buy order for shares of company X and brackets that order with two sell orders.

The first is a sell limit order at a strike price higher than the original market purchase price; the second is a stop-loss order set at an acceptable margin below the market purchase price. The structure of this OCA guarantees the investor a base loss from downside movement and a guaranteed gain in the event that the prices move to an acceptable level. One-cancels-the-other orders are additionally utilized thusly.
