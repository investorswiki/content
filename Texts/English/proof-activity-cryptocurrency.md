# Proof of Activity
## What Is Proof-of-Activity (PoA)?

Proof-of-activity (PoA) is a [blockchain](/blockchain) consensus algorithm utilized in digital forms of money and comparative systems. It is utilized to guarantee that all transactions happening on the blockchain are genuine, as well as to guarantee that all miners show up at a consensus. PoA is a combination of two other blockchain consensus algorithms: [proof-of-work (PoW)](/proof-work) and [proof-of-stake (PoS)](/proof-stake-pos).

## Grasping Proof-of-Activity (PoA)

[Bitcoin](/bitcoin), the most famous cryptocurrency, utilizes the PoW consensus algorithm. A special feature of this algorithm is that it builds the [difficulty level](/difficulty-cryptographic forms of money) of [mining](/bitcoin-mining) as time elapses by. This method likewise prevents the bitcoin network from being hacked. Be that as it may, on the grounds that the difficulty of mining builds increasingly computing power must be utilized. Because of there being more energy consumption, there are more costs included (remembering the costs of wear and tear for the hardware).

With a PoW system, a miner can mine or approve transactions in view of the amount of effective work they have previously contributed to the blockchain. As energy and hardware costs spiraled upwards, because of increased mining difficulty in PoW networks, the PoS system arose as an alternative.

With a PoS system, a miner's ability to mine or confirm transactions relies on the number of cryptocurrency coins they hold. Albeit the PoS system accomplishes a reduction in power bills, an accidental symptom of it is that it can advance coin hoarding (as opposed to spending).

Both PoW and PoS systems are planned to prevent the probability of a [51% attack](/51-attack) â€” a situation where a group of participants gains control of the greater part the network's mining computing power. The risk of a 51% attack is that that group can then have full control of the network, including the power to halt new transactions from getting confirmed, stop payments between different blockchain users, and, surprisingly, reverse the transactions completed in the past during their control of the network, permitting them to [double-spend](/doublespending) the cryptocurrency coins.

PoA additionally prevents the chance of a 51% attack, as in POW and POS, since it is impossible to foresee who the signing peer would be from here on out, and coin saving competition among underwriters doesn't permit the computing power to be accumulated inside a group.

## Special Considerations
### Mining Process in a Proof-of-Activity (PoA) System

The PoA system is an endeavor to join the best parts of both the PoW and the PoS systems. In PoA, the mining system starts the same way as in a PoW cycle, with different miners attempting to outperform each other with higher computing power to track down another block. At the point when another block is found (or mined), the system changes to PoS, with the recently found block containing just a header and the miner's reward address.

In light of the header subtleties, a new, random group of validators from the blockchain network is chosen; they are required to approve or sign the new block. The more coins a validator possesses, the more chances they have for being chosen as an endorser.

When all the validators sign the recently found block, it gains the situation with a complete block, it gets distinguished and added to the blockchain network, and transactions begin getting recorded on it. If a portion of the chose underwriters are inaccessible to sign the block to completion, the cycle moves to the next winning block with another set of validators being picked at random (contingent upon their coin stake). This interaction go on until a triumphant block gets the required number of underwriters and turns into a complete block. The mining charges/rewards are split among the miner and the different validators who contributed in their particular jobs to approve the block.

Since the PoA system weds PoW and PoS, it draws analysis for its partial utilization of both. Too much power is as yet expected to mine blocks during the PoW phase, coin hoarders actually have more chances of getting on the endorsers' rundown and collecting more virtual currency rewards.

## Illustration of Proof-of-Activity (PoA)

Decred (DCR) is the most notable cryptocurrency that utilizes the PoA consensus mechanism. With Decred, blocks are made about at regular intervals. The mining system for Decred starts with nodes (PCs that partake in the network) searching for a solution to a cryptographic riddle with a realized difficulty level to make another block. Up until this point, this cycle looks like a PoW system.

When the solution has been found, it is communicated to the network. The network then confirms the solution. Right now, the system turns into a PoS. The more DCR that a node has mined, the more probable they are to be decided to vote on the block. (In DCR's blockchain, stakeholders earn tickets that grant them voting power in exchange for mining DCR.) Five tickets are picked pseudo-randomly from the ticket pool; if somewhere around three of the five vote "yes" to approve the block, it is permanently added to the blockchain. The two miners and voters are rewarded with DCR.

## Features
- Proof-of-activity (PoA) is a blockchain consensus algorithm that is a combination of two other blockchain consensus algorithms: proof-of-work (PoW) and proof-of-stake (PoS).
- Decred (DCR) is the most notable cryptocurrency that utilizes the PoA consensus mechanism.
- The PoA system is an endeavor to consolidate the best parts of both the PoW and the PoS systems; the mining system starts like a PoW system, however after another block has been successfully mined, the system changes to look like a PoS system.
