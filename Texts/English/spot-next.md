# Spot Next
## What Is Spot Next?

Spot next (S/N) is a term utilized in foreign currency trading. It denotes the delivery of purchased currency on a day after the [spot date](/spot-date). Spot-next contracts are short-term swaps where a currency is carried out one further day, the next day after the spot.

Spot-next is otherwise known as "next business day."

## Understanding Spot Next

With regards to foreign exchange trading, otherwise called forex trading, timing is everything. As the whole reason of foreign currency trading depends on capitalizing gains from differences in exchange rates, and these rates are constantly shifting, forex offers an exciting place for certain investors. Due to the worldwide reach of finance, trade, and commerce, forex markets are often viewed as one of the largest and most [liquid](/liquidity) asset markets in the world.

During a [spot trade](/spottrade), the [spot date](/spot-date) references the day that the funds of the foreign currency or instrument transaction are transferred. In light of the horizon, which alludes to the date the transaction started, the spot date ordinarily drifts around two business days. As it follows, spot next is generally the day after the spot date.

## Illustration of Spot Next

The price for spot-next conveyances is adjusted for the extra time period. For instance, a currency that is bought on Tuesday will have a spot date of Thursday and assuming it is moved spot-next it will settle on Friday. The rate will be adjusted relying upon the interest rates of the two winning currencies. In any case, as it is just one day after the spot, the rate of change will be negligible.

For some currency pairs like the U.S. dollar/Canadian dollar cross ([USD/CAD](/usd-cad-us-dollar-canadian-dollar-currency-pair)), spot-next will settle two days after the trade date on the grounds that the spot date is T+1, not T+2. Therefore, a trade in this currency pair that is executed on Tuesday, will have a spot-next settlement date of Thursday.
