## What Is the September Effect?

The September effect alludes to historically weak stock market returns for the long stretch of September. There is a statistical case for the September effect contingent upon the period investigated, yet a large part of the theory is recounted. It is generally accepted that investors return from summer vacation in September ready to lock in gains as well as tax losses before the year's end. There is likewise a conviction that individual investors liquidate stocks going into September to offset tutoring costs for children. Similarly as with numerous other calendar effects, the September effect is viewed as a historical characteristic in the data as opposed to an effect with any causal relationship.

## Understanding the September Effect

The September effect is real as in an analysis of the market data — most frequently the [Dow Jones Industrial Average](/djia) (DJIA) — shows that September is the main calendar month with a negative return throughout recent years. Be that as it may, the effect isn't overpowering and, all the more significantly, isn't predictive in any helpful sense. Assuming an individual had wagered against September throughout recent years, that individual would have created an overall gain. Assuming the investor had made that wagered exclusively in 2014, for example, that investor would have lost money.

## The October Effect

Like the [October effect](/octobereffect) before it, the September effect is a market anomaly as opposed to an event with a causal relationship. Truth be told, October's 100-year dataset is positive in spite of being the long stretch of the [1907 panic](/bank-panic-of-1907), Black Tuesday, Thursday, and Monday in 1929, and [Black Monday in 1987](/blackmonday). The long stretch of September has seen as much market disturbance as October. It was the month when the original Black Friday happened in 1869, and two significant single-day dips happened in the DJIA in 2001 after 9/11 and in 2008 as the [subprime crisis](/subprime-meltdown) sloped up.

Notwithstanding, as per Market Realist, the effect has disseminated in recent years. Throughout recent years, for the S&P 500, the average month to month return for September is roughly [-0.4%](/september-effect) while the median month to month return is positive. Likewise, continuous huge downfalls have not happened in September as frequently as they did before 1990. One clarification is that as investors have responded by "pre-situating;" that is, selling stock in August.

## Clarifications for the September Effect

The September effect isn't limited to U.S. stocks however is associated with markets worldwide. A few analysts consider that the negative effect on markets is owing to seasonal behavioral bias as investors change their portfolios toward the finish of summer to cash in. Another explanation could be that most mutual funds cash in their holdings to harvest tax losses.
