# Fill or Kill - FOK
A few exchanges and trading platforms offer a type of order known as "Fill or Kill Order" (FOK). The term alludes to the possibility that an order must be filled immediately completely or not executed by any stretch of the imagination. It is closely connected with the ["All or Nothing" (AON)](/aon) order type, which alludes to an order that must be filled completely or not in any way shape or form. Dissimilar to, FOK orders, nonetheless, AON orders don't have a specific spotlight on the immediate point in time.
Fill or Kill orders are in many cases utilized when a trader would rather not acknowledge partial delivery of assets. For example, when they have a time-based demand to take care of their requests on distinct and unlinked markets or exchanges. So a FOK order would permit them to make numerous orders and sit tight for one to be completely executed without facing the challenge of getting partial fills. After one of the orders is filled completely, the trader can cancel the leftover ones.
To act as an illustration of a Fill or Kill use case, think about this following scenario:
Alice needs to set up a [altcoin](/altcoin) [masternode](/masternode) immediately, yet one of the requirements for running a masternode is that she must hold 1000 units of that specific cryptocurrency. On the off chance that time was not a restricting factor, Alice could place various buy orders until the 1000 threshold is in the end reached. Be that as it may, since she needs the masternode going right away, she can place various Fill or Kill buy orders for 1000 units of the altcoin (in various exchanges). Along these lines, Alice will possibly pay for the altcoins assuming she gets the 1,000 units she needs and this permits her to cancel any order that isn't filled completely.
