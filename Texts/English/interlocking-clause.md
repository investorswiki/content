# Interlocking Clause
## What Is an Interlocking Clause?

The term "interlocking clause" alludes to a provision found in a [reinsurance](/reinsurance) treaty. The provision is utilized to determine how to distribute a loss between at least two reinsurance settlements. The interlocking clause permits the reinsured to spread the [risk](/risk) across somewhere around two agreement periods. An interlocking clause is valuable when a loss comes from a single occurrence, like a natural disaster or another catastrophic event.

## How Interlocking Clauses Work

The manner in which insurance companies treat time is frequently confounded. Differences in accident years, reporting years, and [underwriting](/underwriting) years are just a portion of the factors that impact the treatment of losses.

Now and again, an insurer might purchase numerous [reinsurance treaties](/treaty-reinsurance) to cover similar risk throughout various time periods. At the point when there are several reinsurance deals, the insurer must spread loss between them. This is conceivable with the inclusion of an interlocking clause.

Interlocking clauses are utilized to distribute or designate a [liability](/liability) associated with a single occurrence. It is valuable when the reinsured has two extra parallel reinsurance settlements, or when a separate reinsurance treaty has two underwriting years that might be interlinked.

Without the interlocking clause, the reinsured is responsible for the whole retention of every treaty or underwriting year. This could bring about the reinsured not getting a [loss payout](/loss-settlement-sum).

The critical part of an interlocking clause is the manner by which it distributes and allots the loss across several years, and how the assigned extents connect with loss retention and [coverage](/insurance-coverage). Designating the loss across various time periods without distributing the loss retention and coverage means that a loss from a single occurrence is less inclined to surpass the retention limit.

This is the total risk an insurer consents to hold. The reinsurer is additionally less inclined to be at risk for any loss, and the reinsured is bound to be exclusively responsible for covering the loss.

Reinsurance settlements that don't have an interlocking clause treat all losses from a single occurrence as though there was a single date of loss. This means the loss won't be allocated across numerous reinsurance settlements.

## Illustration of an Interlocking Clause

Here is a speculative situation to show how an interlocking clause functions. Suppose an insurance company purchases a reinsurance treaty with an interlocking clause to safeguard it from excess losses.

The reinsurance treaty covers two distinct years. For the principal year, the [reinsurer](/reinsurer) has coverage of $400,000 more than a $300,000 retention guideline and for the subsequent year, the reinsurer has coverage of $500,000 more than a $200,000 retention threshold.

The terms of the agreement allot and designate the coverage and the retention proportionally. In this case, the primary year takes a 25% allocation while the subsequent year takes a 75% allocation.

We should expect the reinsured encountered a loss of $500,000 in the subsequent year. As a result of the proportional allocation of losses, coverage, and retention, the reinsurer is responsible for $275,000 or 25% of the allocated coverage. Had the reinsurance treaty just apportioned the loss across one period, the reinsurer would have had a liability of $175,000.

## The Bottom Line

Interlocking clauses are provisions found in reinsurance deals that determine how losses are allocated between at least two reinsurance arrangements. An interlocking clause gives a reinsurer the permission to spread losses out north of at least two agreement periods, which is a simpler financial burden to bear.
