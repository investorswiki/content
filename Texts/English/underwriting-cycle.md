# Underwriting Cycle
## What Is an Underwriting Cycle?

The [underwriting](/underwriting) cycle alludes to changes in the insurance business throughout some stretch of time. A commonplace underwriting cycle traverses a number of years, as market conditions for the underwriting business go from boom to [bust](/bust) and back to boom once more. An underwriting cycle is otherwise called an "insurance cycle."

## Understanding an Underwriting Cycle

The underwriting cycle addresses the recurring pattern of business among soft and hard insurance markets. Toward the beginning of an underwriting cycle, business is soft due to increased competition and excess insurance capacity, because of which [premiums](/insurance-premium) are low. Then, at that point, a natural disaster or other occasion leads to a flood in [insurance claims](/insurance_claim), which drives lesser-capitalized insurers out of business.

Diminished competition and lower insurance capacity lead to better underwriting conditions for enduring insurers, empowering them to raise premiums and post strong [earnings](/earnings) growth. As the insurance claims are paid off and the tide of new claims dies down, insurance companies slowly return to profitability. New insurance companies then, at that point, enter the market, offering lower premiums and looser requirements than the existing companies. The existing companies are then constrained to slacken their requirements to remain competitive, and the [insurance](/insurance) cycle starts from the very beginning once more.

The underwriting cycle propagates on the grounds that a majority of insurance companies place short-term gains over long-term stability, selling insurance without concern for what happens when the soft market closes. The best way to effectively control or protect an insurance company against the effects of the insurance cycle is to overlook short-term profitability and spotlight on saving capital. An insurance company may likewise consider laying out limits and putting cash to the side in a "blustery day" type of account. Trained productivity can significantly affect a company's financial stability and long-term business possibilities.
