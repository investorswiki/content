# Sum Certain
## What Is Sum Certain?

A sum certain depicts the foreordained settlement price for a contract or negotiable instrument. It alludes to a fixed or specific amount of money, with no room for [ambiguity](/contra-proferentem-rule).

A [negotiable](/negotiable-instrument) instrument can't be negotiated except if it specifies a sum certain. For instance, on the off chance that a borrower goes into a mortgage contract with a lender for $400,000, and that amount is obviously stated in the mortgage note, then, at that point, that figure is the sum certain. Sum certain is otherwise called "sum payable."

## Understanding Sum Certain

Sum certain is a legal phrase alluding to a specific amount (typically an amount of money) that is straightforwardly stated in a contract or negotiable instrument, (for example, a [mortgage](/mortgage) or [promissory note](/promissorynote)) at the time the document is written, and which isn't not entirely clear or misinterpretation. Sum certain is accordingly utilized for a wide range of contracts including financial instruments, yet in addition employment agreements, contracts for purchase, and contracts for lease.

A contract between two gatherings that explains a sum certain disposes of any room for misconception or misinterpretation in terms of what amount is owed or due. A sum certain doesn't need future calculation or the anticipating of future happenings.

## Negotiable Securities and Sum Certain

Since a sum certain value is known in advance, entertainers can better [hedge](/hedge) or guarantee against the stated value than if the amount were available to flexibility, or one which differs based on some contingency (for instance the shifting price of a [call option](/calloption) that moves with its underlying security).

A negotiable instrument is a marked document that guarantees a sum certain amount of payment to a predefined person or the assignee. As such, it is a formalized type of [IOU](/iou): A transferable, marked document that vows to pay the bearer a sum of money sometime not too far off or on-request. The payee, who is the person getting the payment, must be named or generally indicated on the instrument.

Since they are transferable and assignable, numerous negotiable instruments might trade on a [secondary market](/secondarymarket).

## Illustration of Sum Certain

Take for instance a contract that specifies, "Alice will pay Bob $8,000 for painting her home, including all costs." The amount owed to Bob is a sum certain. Compare this with, "Alice will pay Bob for his time (at the rate of $60 60 minutes) and costs of materials for the painting of Alice's home." The amount owed to Bob isn't specifically stated.

A contract that determines a sum certain of $8,000 for work carried out is in this way clearer than an unconditional contract that determines payment at a rate of $50 each hour, subject to a maximum of 200 hours. A representative's salary, whenever illuminated in a contract, would be a sum certain while their performance-based bonus wouldn't be.
