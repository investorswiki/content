# Step Premium Option
## What Is a Step Premium Option?

A step premium is a price paid for the purchase of an options contract that is due to be paid in a series of portions made over time as the expiration date or the strike price of the option draws near.

More normal are the premiums paid for [vanilla options](/vanillaoption), which require the whole amount to be paid direct front when the trade is initiated. A step premium option is a type of structured option.

## Figuring out the Step Premium Option

An options buyer might decide to buy a step premium option just to spread the cost over a more drawn out period of time. Another trader might decide to sell ([write](/composing an-option)) a step premium option on the grounds that the total premium will be bigger than for an equivalent vanilla option.

Step premium options are traded [over the counter](/otc) (OTC), so the parties associated with the transaction can make their own terms. Options might be traded either over-the-counter or on a public stock exchange. Flexible contract arrangements, for example, step premium options are a feature of the over-the-counter market. In over-the-counter trades, the contract for the option illuminates the amount of the premium and when it will be paid. A step premium option is more costly than a tantamount vanilla option.

Since step premiums can be tweaked by the parties in question, rather than paying the premium as equivalent amounts of time elapse, the parties might settle on payment when the [underlying](/underlying-asset) asset arrives at certain prices.

### Other Flexible Arrangements

An even more costly arrangement is the contingent premium option. In this case, the investor doesn't pay a premium on the off chance that the option lapses [out of the money](/outofthemoney) (OTM), or with no intrinsic value.

Given the flexibility that is conceivable, a wide assortment of options have been intended to meet different investment needs. Their premiums mirror the unique risks and rewards associated with each type of option.

## Illustration of a Step Option Premium

Say an option buyer needs to start a trade in a step premium option. The options will lapse in about a month.

A vanilla option with the boundaries the traders need has a $1 premium. Since the trader needs a step option, the seller demands $1.10.

The buyer concurs and purchases 10 contracts (of 100 shares each) for a total cost of 100 x 10 x $1.10 = $1,100. As part of the agreement, the option buyer will pay a quarter of the premium, or $275, toward the finish of every week. Toward the finish of about a month, the premium will be paid off in full.

### A Second Variation

As another model, on the off chance that the above option is a [call](/call), the strike price is $45, and the underlying stock as of now trades at $44, the premium portions might be due each time the underlying draws $0.25 nearer to the strike. On the off chance that the underlying ascents to $44.25, the main premium is due. At the point when it ascends to $44.50, another premium payment is due. On the off chance that the underlying doesn't arrive at the strike price, any excess premium is due at expiration.
