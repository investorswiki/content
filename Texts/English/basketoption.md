# Basket Option
## What Is a Basket Option?

A basket option is a type of financial derivative where the underlying asset is a group, or basket, of [commodities](/product), [securities](/security), or [currencies](/currency). Likewise with other options, a basket option gives the holder the right, yet not the obligation, to buy or sell the basket at a specific price, at the latest a certain date.

This [exotic option](/exoticoption) has every one of the qualities of a standard option, however with [strike prices](/strikeprice) in view of the weighted values of its parts. Currency baskets are the most famous type of basket option, and they will get comfortable the holder's home currency.

Since it includes just one transaction, a basket option frequently costs not exactly multiple single options as it saves money on commissions and fees.

## Grasping Basket Options

A [currency basket](/currencybasket) option gives a more practical method for [multinational corporations](/multinationalcorporation) (MNCs) to oversee multi-currency exposures on a consolidated basis. For instance, a global corporation like McDonald's (MCD) could buy a basket option including Indian rupees, British pounds, euros, and Canadian dollars in exchange for U.S. dollars.

Technically, an equity [index option](/indexoption) is a basket option in light of the fact that the [underlying asset](/underlying-asset) is a weighted basket of part stocks. In any case, in light of the fact that the index is a standardized basket where an outsider works out and keeps up with it, index options trade like individual options and are not viewed as exotic options.

Therefore, a basket option typically alludes to an option whereupon a basket is made by the seller of the option, frequently at the request and working together with the buyer's requirements. This is conceivable on the grounds that basket options frequently trade [over-the-counter](/otc) (OTC), and are therefore customizable in view of the buyer's and seller's necessities.

## Qualities of Basket Options

The main feature of a basket option is its ability to proficiently [hedge](/hedge) risk on multiple assets simultaneously. Rather than hedging every individual asset, the investor can oversee risk for the basket, or portfolio, in one transaction. The benefits of a single transaction can be great, especially while staying away from the costs associated with hedging every single part of the basket or [portfolio](/portfolio).

Since every basket is unique, these options include two counterparties and trade over-the-counter. This type of trading limits [liquidity](/liquidity), and there is certainly not a guaranteed method for shutting the options trade ahead of expiration. Assuming that a trader looked for from the position, and they couldn't track down another party to offset their position with, they could open another transaction that completely or somewhat offsets their current transaction.

For instance, on the off chance that they own a call on a basket of currencies, yet never again need to buy those currencies, they could buy a put option on a comparable basket of currencies to net out (or for the most part net out) the effects of the principal option. An option on a commodities index could somewhat offset an option on the investor's specific basket of commodities. A [S&P 500](/sp) index option could to some degree offset an option in light of a portfolio of [blue-chip stocks](/bluechipstock). Furthermore, an option on the U.S. Dollar index could to some degree offset an option on a basket of global currencies.

## Special Considerations

A problem for basket option pricing is that a basket or portfolio doesn't respond similarly its individual parts do. This appears to be legit in light of the fact that investors frequently structure [diversified](/enhancement) portfolios so part assets don't [correlate](/connection). Therefore, a basket may not be guaranteed to respond to changes in [volatility](/volatility), time, and price level similarly as its parts do individually.

A [rainbow option](/rainbowoption) is a comparative type of [derivative](/derivative) that utilizes multiple underlying assets. Notwithstanding, dissimilar to a basket option, every one of the assets underlying a rainbow option must move in the planned course. On the other hand, a rainbow option's payoff might be founded on the best or most exceedingly terrible performing asset in the basket rather than the basket as a whole.

## Illustration of a Currency Basket Option

Expect that an international US-based company needs to buy a basket option on the Canadian and Australian dollar versus the US dollar. In the event that the Canadian and Australian dollars drop against the US dollar they need to have the option to sell them at a predetermined price in order to stay away from further crumbling. In this case, they will buy a put with a basket containing the CAD/USD and the AUD/USD.

Expect the company realizes they have more exposure to CAD and AUD, therefore they opt for a weight of 60/40. In view of current rates, at the hour of the transaction, an index value can be made.

- Accept the CAD/USD rate is 0.76, and the AUD/USD rate is 0.69.
- The index value is: (0.76 x 0.6) + (0.69 x 0.4) = 0.456 + 0.276 = 0.732

Expect the buyer of the put needs a strike price at 0.72 for the basket, and the option will lapse in one year. The buyer and seller will decide the amount of the agreement — how much currency the option is for — as well as settle on a [premium](/premium).

Accept the CAD and AUD rise, and over the next year the index pushes to 0.75. In this case, the option lapses worthless on the grounds that the basket index value is over the 0.72 strike price. The buyer of the put basket option loses their premium, and the seller keeps the premium as profit.

Presently, accept the CAD as well as AUD fall to 0.73 and 0.65. The new index value is 0.698 ((0.73 x 0.6) + (0.65 x 0.4)). In this case, the buyer can exercise the put option to sell the basket at 0.72, since the weighted value of the currencies is just 0.698.

The difference between the strike price and the weighted value, less the premium, is the buyer's profit. The seller's loss is the weighted value minus the strike price, plus the premium received.

## Features
- The downside of the basket option is that there is limited liquidity for such options, so getting out before expiry might require extra offsetting transactions.
- Basket options trade OTC, and are therefore modified in view of the buyer's and seller's requirements.
- A basket option is an option where the underlying is a basket or group of any asset wanted.
- Basket options reduce trading fees, since it is one transaction as opposed to taking individual trades on each position in the basket.
