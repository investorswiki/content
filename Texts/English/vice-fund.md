## What Is the Vice Fund?

The Vitium Global Fund, formerly the Vice Fund, is a mutual fund managed by USA Mutuals that zeros in its investments on vice industries frequently thought to be socially flippant investments or "sin stocks."

Before this fund was established, "vice fund" was informal slang for any fund that invested heavily in various sin stocks.

The Vice Fund was renamed the Vitium Global Fund on October 1, 2019.

## Understanding the Vice Fund

The Vitium Global Fund, formerly called the Vice Fund, primarily puts resources into stocks generating the majority of their [revenue](/revenue) from the alcohol, tobacco, gaming, and defense industries.

The Fund looks for great [dividend](/dividend)- paying stocks in the vice industries and accepts these industries have significant [barriers to entry](/barrierstoentry), which make effective companies a source of reliable stock returns.

The Fund also accepts that its investments are generally market-neutral, meaning that they truly do well in both down and up markets because of a steady demand for vice industry goods through all market cycles.
