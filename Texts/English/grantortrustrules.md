## What Are Grantor Trust Rules?

Grantor trust rules are rules inside the [Internal Revenue Code (IRC)](/internal-revenue-code) that frame certain tax ramifications of a grantor trust. Under these rules, the individual who makes a grantor trust is recognized as the owner of the assets and property held inside the [trust](/trust) for income and [estate tax](/estatetax) purposes.

## Understanding Grantor Trust Rules

Trusts are laid out in light of multiple factors, and as a rule, they're planned as separate legal substances to safeguard the grantor's (or alternately originator's) assets and the income generated from those assets with the goal that the beneficiaries might receive them.

For instance, trusts are made while performing [estate planning](/estateplanning) to guarantee the assets get distributed appropriately to the named beneficiaries upon the death of the owner. Notwithstanding, a grantor trust is any trust wherein the grantor or owner holds the power to control or direct income or assets inside the trust. As such, the grantor trust rules permit a grantor to control the assets and investments in the trust.

Grantor trusts were initially utilized as a [tax haven](/taxhaven) for rich individuals. The tax rates graduated at a similar rate as income tax rates. As increasingly more income was earned in the trust, the income was taxed at the personal income tax rates.

All in all, the grantor got the benefits of a trust, like protecting money however was taxed as though it was a personal account and not a separate legal entity. Additionally, grantors could change the trust and eliminate the money at whatever point they decided to do as such. Grantor trust rules were laid out by the IRS to ruin the abuse of trusts.
