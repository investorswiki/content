# Exchange
An exchange is an organized marketplace where financial instruments - like digital currencies, commodities, and securities - are traded. An exchange might operate on a certifiable facility or on a digital platform. Numerous traditional exchanges, which were initially restricted to physical trading, are currently offering digitized types of assistance as a method for empowering electronic trading (otherwise called paperless trading).
One of the fundamental elements of an exchange is to give liquidity inside a secure and organized trading environment, going about as an intermediary for traders to effectively buy and sell their assets while being less defenseless to financial risks.
Exchanges might be classified by the type of trade being executed. Classical exchanges are the ones that perform spot trades (immediate settlement). Then again, there are exchanges that give derivatives trading, like futures and options. Exchanges may likewise be classified by the financial instruments being traded: cryptocurrency exchange, stock or securities exchange, commodities exchange, and the foreign exchange market (Forex). Be that as it may, many exchanges give different services and trading options. For example, numerous commodities exchanges are likewise offering futures trading.
Inside stock exchanges, the main one in a given country is called the primary exchange. A couple of instances of primary exchanges incorporate the New York Stock Exchange, the Tokyo Stock Exchange, and the London Stock Exchange. Most stock exchanges present a severe listing criterion, which guarantees that main companies that meet certain requirements are really listed.
With regards to digital forms of money, digital exchanges are responsible for giving a platform where users can trade one cryptocurrency for another or buy and sell their coins for fiat money. Presently, most cryptocurrency exchanges depend on a centralized system, kept up with by a private company that acts as an intermediary and is responsible for managing all trades and transactions. Convenience and liquidity are the major benefits of centralized exchanges. With respect to drawbacks, these centralized systems are powerless to margin times and cyber assaults, making security a major point of concern. Taking into account that users need to trust their holdings to the company to have the option to trade, it is important to pick an exchange that has proven to be reliable and secure.
Interestingly, decentralized cryptocurrency exchanges (otherwise called DEX) were made as an alternative for centralized exchanges. DEX platforms eliminate the requirement for a middleman and perform trades and transactions inside a trustless automatized environment (in view of smart contracts). In spite of the way that these trading platforms are less helpless to cyber assaults and infrastructure free times, decentralized exchanges are not able to give fiat currency services, like fiat/crypto tradings or fiat withdrawals/stores. What's more, the trading volume will in general be a lot of lower on these types of exchanges, since they are less well known than centralized ones and have limited usefulness.
