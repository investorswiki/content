## What Is the Morningstar Risk Rating?

Funds receive ratings going from 1 to 5, with 1 given to the most obviously awful performers and 5 for something good. The ranking is based on varieties in a fund's month to month returns — with an accentuation on downside varieties — as compared to comparative funds.

## Understanding the Morningstar Risk Rating

Morningstar ratings are based on the fund's past performance as compared to different funds in its Morningstar category. The risk rating is often a starting point for extra research and isn't a buy or sell recommendation.

In the risk rating process, 10% of a category's funds with the most minimal measured risk are rated as "okay." The next 22.5% are rated "less than ideal," the middle 35% are "average," the next 22.5% "better than expected," while the top 10% are rated as "high" risk. Morningstar measures risk for upwards of three periods (three, five, and 10 years). These separate measures are then weighted and averaged to deliver an overall measure for the fund. Funds with under three years of performance history are not rated.

## Analysis of Morningstar Risk Ratings

While Morningstar ratings are viewed as essential in directing investors toward quality investment choices, they are not resistant to analysis. A few financial analysts have scrutinized these ratings since they just compare funds to different funds, in disconnection from the greater marketplace. Subsequently, a fund's rating might mirror its suitability for the specific market more than its overall feasibility and potential.

## FAQ
### How Reliable Are Morningstar Ratings?
While star ratings give a simple heuristic to measuring risk-adjusted return in the past, they tend to be relatively poor indicators of future performance. A research study by Vanguard found that Morningstar ratings didn't foresee a beneficial investment relative to a fund's benchmark. Additionally, the study found that one-star funds had the best excess returns of all compared to their benchmarks.
### How Do Morningstar's Star Risk Rating Work?
The star rating is a quantitative metric that shows a mutual fund's historical risk-adjusted return. Funds can receive somewhere in the range of 1 and 5 stars, with 5 being the best. A fund loses points for having a greater "risk penalty," so in the event that two funds return a similar yield in a given period, the fund that accomplished greater volatility (variance) in returns would be rated lower, as riskier.
### What Does a Morningstar Risk Rating of 5 Stars Mean?
A 5-star risk rating demonstrates that a fund has been among the market's top performers in terms of risk-adjusted return over the past three, five, or ten-year period.
