# International ETF
## What Is an International ETF?

An international exchange-traded fund ([ETF](/etf)) is any ETF that invests specifically in foreign-based [securities](/security). The center might be global, regional, or on a specific country and may hold equities or fixed-income securities.

## Figuring out International ETFs

International ETFs are ordinarily [invested passively](/passiveinvesting) around an underlying benchmark index, however the index might differ substantially from one [fund manager](/fundmanager) to the next. A few funds, particularly those with a wide global footprint or those that invest in countries with advanced economies, can give strong diversification by investing in many companies.

ETFs that invest in a single foreign country might carry higher risks than international ETFs that spread their investments among numerous countries. Assuming that a single country goes through a major [recession](/recession) or other financial hardship, an ETF that just invests in securities based there could have a major performance shortfall. International ETFs are progressively well known for U.S. investors in the midst of strong global growth. Advances in globalization and financial regulation have opened more financial markets to outside investment. As a general rule, [expense ratios](/expenseratio) for international ETFs will quite often be higher than the midpoints in view of the higher costs to invest abroad.

## Emerging Market ETFs

For U.S. investors, international funds can incorporate developed, emerging, or [frontier market](/frontier-market) investments in a scope of asset classes. These funds can offer changing levels of risk and return. Notwithstanding country-specific contemplations, international funds are managed to different asset classes. Debt and equity funds are the two generally common, giving a broad universe to investment. U.S. investors seeking to take more conservative positions can invest in government or corporate debt offerings. Equity funds offer diversified portfolios of stock investments that can be managed to various objectives. Asset allocation funds offering a mix of [debt](/debt) and equity can accommodate more balanced investments with the opportunity to invest in targeted regions of the world.

## Example: The Vanguard Total International Stock ETF

The Vanguard Total International Stock ETF (NASDAQ: VXUS) was sent off in 2011 and invests in global stocks, excluding U.S. stocks. Since its initiation, VXUS has earned investors an annualized return of around 4% by tracking the performance of global company stocks listed on the FTSE Global All Cap ex U.S. Index. The target benchmark index follows enormous , mid-, and small-cap equities of companies operating outside the United States.

The international equities held inside VXUS give investors a unique opportunity to differentiate a portfolio in both developed and emerging markets around the world. The stock movement of companies based overseas doesn't necessarily have a direct correlation to domestic stock prices, giving investors an opportunity to make the most of market movements that might contrast from shifts in U.S. equity markets.

The Vanguard Total International Stock ETF invests something like 95% of all fund assets trying to imitate the performance of the FTSE Global All Cap ex U.S. Index. VXUS is most vigorously weighted in Europe, with 39.6% invested in the region, followed by 26.7% in the Pacific, 25.2% in emerging markets, and 7.9% in North America. Top holdings follow suit with the fund's target index, including Taiwan Semiconductor, Nestl\u00e9, Tencent Holdings, and Samsung Electronics.
