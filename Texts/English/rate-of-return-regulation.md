## What Is Rate of Return Regulation?

Rate of return regulation is a form of price setting regulation where legislatures determine the fair price which is permitted to be charged by a [monopoly](/monopoly). It is intended to safeguard customers from being charged higher prices due to the monopoly's power while as yet permitting the monopoly to cover its costs and earn a fair return for its owners.

## Figuring out Rate Of Return Regulation

Rate of return regulation was utilized most frequently in the United States to price goods and services offered by utility companies, similar to gas, TV cable, water, telephone service, and power. A history of antitrust sentiment and antitrust regulation prompted the implementation of rate of return regulation in the U.S., which was maintained by the 1877 Supreme Court case **Munn v. Illinois** and further developed through a series of cases beginning with **Smyth v. Ames** in 1898.

Rate of return regulation permitted customers to feel that they were getting a fair price for essential services while permitting investors to feel that they were getting a fair return on their investments in these industries. Rate of return regulation stayed common in the U.S. through a large part of the 20^th^ century, step by step being replaced by other, more efficient methods, for example, price-hole regulation and [revenue-cap regulation](/income cap-regulation).

## Benefits and Disadvantages of Rate of Return Regulation

Customers benefit from prices that are reasonable, given the monopolist's operating costs. It offers long-term rate sustainability, as it gives a resistance to rates against the ubiquity of a company among investors and against changes that could happen inside that company. It gives stability in cornered industries, while keeping syndications from creating large gains with price-gouging. Investors, while they won't make immense dividends, will benefit from substantial and steady returns. Customers don't feel as though they are being cheated for essential services, and the monopoly being referred to benefits from a stable public picture subsequently.

Rate of return regulation is frequently condemned on the grounds that it gives minimal incentive to reduce costs and increase productivity. A monopolist who is regulated thusly doesn't earn more on the off chance that costs are reduced. Consequently, customers might in any case be charged higher prices than they would be under free competition. Rate of return regulation can add to the Averch-Johnson effect, by which firms in this way regulated amass capital and permit it to deteriorate to undermine the system and acquire administrative permission to raise rates.
