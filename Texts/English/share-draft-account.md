# Share-Draft Account
## What Is a Share-Draft Account?

A share-draft account is a form of a [checking account](/checkingaccount), with the exception of it is offered by a [credit union](/creditunion) rather than a bank. To comprehend what a share-draft account is, knowing the difference between a bank and a credit union is first important.

Banks are organizations that exist to create a gain from offering financial products, like loans, savings and checking accounts, [certificates of deposit](/certificateofdeposit) (CDs), and credit cards, to consumers. Credit unions are financial institutions that are owned jointly by all individuals or account holders. There is no such thing as them to create a gain but instead to benefit the account holders. At the point when you deposit money into a credit union share-draft account, you're technically buying shares in that credit union.

## Understanding a Share-Draft Account

A share-draft account alludes to a credit union account that is like a bank's checking account. Share-draft accounts were made under the Consumer Checking Account Equity Act of 1979.

Share-draft accounts allow credit union individuals to access their share balances by composing drafts on their accounts. Share-draft accounts allow for an unlimited number of checks to be written, and one of their primary benefits is that they are secured with federal insurance by the [National Credit Union Administration](/ncua) (NCUA).

Insurance for bank deposits is given by the [Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation](/fdic) (FDIC). Both NCUA and FDIC deposits are guaranteed for up to $250,00 per individual. Bank deposits are insured to prevent [bank runs](/bankrun) if a bank fizzles.

Interest earned on share-draft accounts is accumulated quarterly. These accounts are like [negotiable order of withdrawal](/nowaccount) (NOW) accounts, which are fundamentally interest-bearing savings accounts against which drafts can be written. Nonetheless, share-draft accounts are offered by credit unions, though NOW accounts are bank products.

In practice, a share-draft account operates exactly like a checking account. Account holders can compose unlimited checks against the account, and credit unions ordinarily issue debit cards that can be utilized to make purchases and withdrawals involving the shares in the accounts.

Account holders can utilize their debit cards to make [point-of-sale](/point-of-sale) (POS) purchases, pull out money from [ATM](/atm)s, or shop online. Account holders can likewise go into a credit union branch to deposit or pull out money from a share-draft account.

## Share-Draft Accounts versus Checking Accounts

A key difference between share-draft accounts and many checking accounts is that the former earns interest. Credit unions pay interest and [dividends](/profit) on shares held by account holders, so the money deposited into a credit union earns dividends and interest that is accumulated quarterly.

Somewhere in the range of 1933 and 2011 in the U.S., demand deposit checking accounts were not allowed to earn interest. Now that the disallowance on demand deposit interest has been lifted, some bank checking accounts offer interest. Alternately, bank checking accounts often accompany savings accounts associated with them, nearly as one account, where deposits can earn interest.

Another key difference between share-draft accounts and checking accounts is that many banks require a month to month least balance or charge month to month fees for the maintenance of a checking account.

Credit unions don't charge their individuals any month to month fees or require [minimum balances](/least balance) in share-draft accounts, or and no more, low fees. This makes them an attractive option for consumers hoping to abstain from paying fees or keeping up with least balances, particularly now that many credit unions have made their ways for the overall population.

Overall, credit unions give many benefits over banks, seen through better interest rates on deposit and savings accounts, [mortgages](/home loan), and certificates of deposit (CDs), and the previously mentioned low or no-fee accounts.
