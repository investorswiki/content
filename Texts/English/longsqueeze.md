# Long Squeeze
## What Is a Long Squeeze?

A long squeeze happens when a sudden drop in the price of a stock or other asset impels further selling. In a long squeeze, [long](/long) holders of a stock are compelled into selling their shares to safeguard against an emotional loss.

## Seeing Long Squeezes

Long squeeze can be diverged from the more notable [short squeeze](/shortsqueeze). Long squeezes are more apt to be found in [illiquid](/illiquid) stocks, where a couple of determined or panicky shareholders can make ridiculous price [volatility](/volatility) in a short period of time.

[Short sellers](/shortselling) can hoard the trading in a stock for a concise period of time, making a sudden drop in price. Yet a long squeeze requires sufficient panic to set in that long holders begin to dump their situations too. A long squeeze, which has no fundamental basis for the selling, may last for quite a while, or it could be exceptionally concise. Value-buyers or short-term traders who watch for [oversold](/oversold) conditions will step in once the price falls to a point considered "too low," and bid the shares back up.

Long squeezes can happen in any market however may show up more emotional in low liquidity markets. While liquidity assumes a part, so do technical factors and [supply and demand](/law-of-supply-demand). A stock that has been running forcefully higher turns out to be increasingly more defenseless to a long squeeze, particularly on the off chance that the volume is exceptionally high when the price turns lower. That large number of individuals who bought close to the top will begin leaving by the thousand assuming the price declines fundamentally. Many can't bear to hang onto the loss even assuming that they think the price will return to current levels, or higher, after the decline.

Value-arranged investors and [value investing](/valueinvesting) styles have long been the classic solution for securities that have been oversold. Perceiving a long squeeze scenario, value and profound value investors are generally quick to respond to stocks that might be trading at discounts to their true [intrinsic value](/intrinsicvalue). On the off chance that a stock doesn't recuperate from its decline, then, at that point, there was probable a fundamental justification for the sell-off or the stock was overpriced, in the first place. In this case, the selling was reasonable and justified and isn't ordinarily viewed as a long squeeze.

At the point when long squeeze circumstances arise, they are generally gathered in stocks that have a limited [float](/float) or [market capitalization](/marketcapitalization), or possibly the selloffs in these types of stock can be very sensational. These small or even miniature cap securities don't necessarily in every case partake in a solid level of liquidity that can support price levels from unpredictable trading volumes. A quick trader or automated trading system can take advantage of a chance to take advantage of a long squeeze before others bring the stock back from its oversold state.

A stock's float is estimated by its number of shares really accessible for trading, as certain securities are held in treasury or by insiders. Stocks with limited float make for natural squeezes from the long or short side. In these types of stocks, less participants control the shares and in this manner the share price. A large sell order from a big trader can cause a cascade of selling. Compare that to a highly liquid stock with a great many [shareholders](/shareholder), and millions more that are actively keen on buying the stock, and any long squeezes that truly do happen will quite often be less serious.

## Long Squeeze Example

[Intraday](/intraday) charts habitually show long squeezes. This is on the grounds that during most days there is no new fundamental information about the company, and on numerous days there isn't even information about the economy. Subsequently, when there is no major information out that could influence the fundamental value of a stock, the price will in any case change as individuals buy and sell.

[Day traders](/daytrader) need to get into and out of a stock soon. In this manner, assuming that the price is rising, and they enter long, they will sell in the event that the price begins to fall by too much. Their time period is too small to hold onto a falling stock.

Consider this 1-minute intraday chart of Apple (AAPL). The price is continuously moving, and with no fundamental data to cause the selloffs, the selloffs that truly do happen are brought about by short-term longs being forced to sell as the price begins to fall.

The long squeezes were quickly met with buying, showing that it was panicked long holders taking profits and cutting losses who caused the declines, and not a fundamental shift in that frame of mind of the company.

## Highlights
- Long squeezes are more normal in assets that have seen an emotional price rise with exceptionally high volume happening when the price turns lower, and in low liquidity or low float stocks.
- Value investors and traders who search for oversold conditions will look for and step in to buy long squeeze stocks.
- A long squeeze happens while selling prompts further selling, powering a cycle and a large price drop.
