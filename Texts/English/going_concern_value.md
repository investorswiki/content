# Going-Concern Value
## What Is Going-Concern Value?

Going concern value is a value that assumes the company will stay in business endlessly and keep on being profitable. Going concern value is otherwise called total value. This contrasts from the value that would be realized whether its assets were [liquidated](/liquidate) — the liquidation value — on the grounds that an ongoing operation can keep on earning a profit, which adds to its value. A company ought to constantly be viewed as a going concern except if there is a valid justification to accept that it will be going out of business.

## How Going-Concern Value Works

The difference between the going-concern value of a company and its [liquidation value](/liquidation-value) is known as goodwill. Goodwill comprises of theoretical assets, for example, company brand names, brand names, licenses, and customer loyalty. Normally the going-concern value will be greater than the liquidation value. At the point when a company is acquired, the purchase price is normally founded on its going-concern value. This means that a company being acquired can charge a pricing premium that is higher than the value of its assets and considers the value of its future profitability, immaterial assets, and goodwill.

## Going-Concern Value versus Liquidation Value

The going-concern value of a company is ordinarily a lot higher than its liquidation value since it incorporates immaterial assets and customer loyalty as well as any potential for future returns. The liquidation value of a company will even be lower than the value of the company's substantial assets, in light of the fact that the company might need to sell off its unmistakable assets at a markdown — frequently, a deep rebate — to liquidate them before stopping operations. Instances of substantial assets that may be sold at a loss incorporate equipment, unsold inventory, real estate, vehicles, licenses, and other intellectual property (IP), furniture, and fixtures.

As a rule, liquidation value is applied when investors feel a company no longer has value as a going concern, and they need to know the amount they can get by selling off the company's substantial assets and such of its elusive assets as can be sold, like IP. A company or investor that is obtaining a company might contrast that company's going-concern value with its liquidation value to conclude whether it's monetarily beneficial to keep operating the company, or whether exchanging it is more profitable.

Be that as it may, liquidating a company means laying off its employees, and on the off chance that the company is all feasible, this can have negative implications for the laid-off workers as well as for the investor who went with the choice to liquidate a solid company. Liquidating a going concern can give an investor a terrible reputation among potential future takeover targets.

Nonetheless, Widget Corp's. going-concern value could possibly be $60 million, as the company's reputation of being the world's leading gadget producer and its ownership of licenses and associated rights for gadget production mean that the company ought to have a large and constant flow of future cash flows.
