# Renewable Energy Certificate (REC)
## What Is a Renewable Energy Certificate (REC)?

Renewable Energy Certificates (RECs) are a market-based instrument that confirms the bearer possesses one megawatt-hour (MWh) of power produced from a [renewable energy](/renewable_resource) resource. When the power provider has fed the energy into the grid, the REC received can then be sold on the open market as an energy commodity. RECs earned might be sold, for instance, to different elements that are dirtying as a [carbon credit](/carbon_credit) to offset their emissions.

RECs can go by different names, including Green Tags, Tradable Renewable Certificates (TRCs), Renewable Electricity Certificates, or Renewable Energy Credits.

## How Renewable Energy Certificates Work

A Renewable Energy Certificate (REC) acts as an accounting or tracking mechanism for sun based, wind, and other green energies as they flow into the power grid. Since power created from renewable energy sources is undefined from that delivered by some other source, some form of tracking is required.

This accounting and returning energy to the grid is important on the grounds that power is troublesome and costly to store in batteries. Thus, most renewable-produced power, which is unused by the maker, is fed once more into the power grid for use by different customers. The provider of renewable power, for example, a homeowner with roof sunlight based chargers, will then receive a REC. Energy Certificates can be sold, however are normally utilized as a credit against their own power use.

## Requirements for Renewable Energy Certificates

Many states require power utilities to purchase or create renewable sunlight based power. These requirements are called sunlight based cut outs. Besides, many states have a Renewable Portfolio Standard (RPS), which requires power services to make a certain amount of renewable power that builds consistently. These RPS requirements are a huge driver of the Renewable Energy Certificate trades. A power company might purchase these certificates from the homeowner to meet the state's renewable requirement.

While state laws change on the utilization and sale of RECs, the certificates are recognized by many state and nearby legislatures, as well as regional power transmission specialists, non-government organizations (NGOs), and trade gatherings. Other than sunlight based and wind-produced power, RECs might be issued for generators of geothermal, hydro-power without dams, [biofuels](/biofuel), and hydrogen fuel cells.

## Illustration of a Renewable Energy Credit

REC [arbitrage](/arbitrage) is likewise called a REC swap. These trades include the close concurrent buying and selling of RECs with contrasting prices. Traders endeavor to profit from the disparity between the buy and sell price.

For instance, State A has a higher Renewable Portfolio Standard (RPS) requirement and sun oriented cut outs than State B has. The higher requirement drives demand at the cost of Renewable Energy Certificates (RECs) in state A.

The state A provider, who must meet the higher requirements would, subsequently, have an incentive to purchase more affordable state B certificates. The provider may then utilize these credits to meet their requirements.

Renewable Energy Certificates (RECs) are consistently a similar one megawatt-hour (MWh) of power, paying little heed to where production occurred. In any case, the price might differ due to supply and demand. In practice, [broker](/broker) middle people normally work with REC arbitrage, however the market permits renewable energy providers to streamline on energy production, as well as reduce carbon emissions by empowering more green energy production.

## Features
- RECs can ultimately be sold for profit to those hoping to offset their carbon emissions or examiners betting on the value of energy credits.
- REC swaps comprise of trading RECs to profit from the disparity between the buy and sell price; on the grounds that many states have fluctuating RPS standards, this expands opportunities to swap.
- Renewable Energy Certificates (RECs) give proof that the owner of an energy market instrument possesses one MWh of renewable energy; they account for the amount of renewable energy that flows through the power grid.
