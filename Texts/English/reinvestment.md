Proceeds can incorporate any distribution paid out from the investment including dividends, interest, or some other form of distribution associated with the investment's ownership. If not reinvested these funds would be paid to the investor as cash. [Social enterprises](/social-venture) chiefly reinvest back into their own operations.

### Dividend Reinvestment

Dividend reinvestment plans, otherwise called [DRIPs](/dividendreinvestmentplan), permit investors the opportunity to productively reinvest proceeds in extra shares of the investment. Issuers of an investment can structure their investment offerings to incorporate [dividend](/dividend) reinvestment programs.

Corporations generally offer dividend reinvestment plans. Different types of companies with public offerings, for example, master limited partnerships and [real estate investment trusts](/reit) can likewise institute dividend reinvestment plans. Fund companies paying distributions likewise conclude whether they will permit dividend reinvestment.

## Special Considerations: Reinvestment Risk

In spite of the fact that there are several benefits to reinvesting dividends, there are times when the risks offset the rewards. For instance, consider the reinvestment rate, or the amount of interest that can be earned when money is removed from one [fixed-income investment](/fixedincome) and put into another. Basically, the reinvestment rate is the amount of interest the investor could earn in the event that they purchased another bond while holding a [callable bond](/callablebond) called due to an interest rate decline.

Assuming that an investor is reinvesting proceeds, they might have to consider reinvestment risk. [Reinvestment risk](/reinvestmentrisk) is the chance that an investor will not be able to reinvest cash flows (e.g., coupon payments) at a rate comparable to the current investment's rate of return. Reinvestment risk can emerge across a wide range of investments.

Generally, reinvestment risk is the risk that an investor could be earning a greater return by investing proceeds in a higher returning investment. This is regularly considered with fixed income security reinvestment since these investments have reliably stated rates of return that fluctuate with new issuances and market rate changes. Prior to a critical investment distribution, investors ought to think about their current allocations and broad market investment options.

For instance, an investor buys a 10-year $100,000 [Treasury note](/treasurynote) with an interest rate of 6%. The investor hopes to earn $6,000 each year from the security. In any case, toward the finish of the term, interest rates are 4%. Assuming the investor buys an additional 10-year $100,000 Treasury note, they will earn $4,000 yearly instead of $6,000. Additionally, in the event that interest rates accordingly increase and they sell the note before its maturity date, they lose part of the principal.
