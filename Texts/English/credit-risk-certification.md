## What Is Credit Risk Management?

[Risk management](/riskmanagement) is the identification, evaluation and prioritization of risks followed by facilitated and prudent application of resources to limit, monitor and control the probability or impact of lamentable events or to amplify the realization of opportunities. Risk management's objective is to guarantee vulnerability doesn't redirect the undertaking from the business objectives.

The definition of credit risk management given by the RMA is: "the means by which a bank measures, makes due, and monitors its exposures to accomplish an ideal return on its capital. Credit risk managers are entrusted with settling on choices that impact the organization and performance of the loans.

Risks can emerge out of different sources, remembering vulnerability for financial markets, threats from project disappointments (at any phase in design, development, production or sustainment life-cycles), legal liabilities, credit risk, mishaps, natural causes and catastrophes, conscious attack from an enemy or events of questionable or eccentric root source.

Strategies to oversee threats (vulnerabilities with negative outcomes) commonly incorporate keeping away from the threat, diminishing the negative effect or probability of the threat, transferring all or part of the threat to another party, and even holding some or each of the potential or real results of a particular threat and the contrary energies for opportunities (questionable future states with benefits).
