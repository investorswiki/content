# BEP-95
BEP-95 is a Binance Evolution Proposal that presents a real-time burning mechanism to Binance Smart Chain. It's been acquainted with make BNB's tokenomics even more dynamic and further decentralize the network.
With BEP-95, the network will burn a fixed ratio of each block's gas fees that validators collect. The specific ratio will be resolved through BSC's governance mechanisms. The burns will happen even after BSC has arrived at its target goal of 100 million BNB. By diminishing the supply of BNB, upwards pressure is placed on the coin's price. The BEP may likewise diminish the amount of BNB delegators and validators received. In any case, with up price pressure, the fiat value could likewise increase, offsetting any reduction in coins.
To technically execute this, the network collects each block's gas fees and splits between two smart contracts:
**1. System Reward Contract.** 1/16 of gas fees will enter the System Reward Contract until it arrives at a maximum of 100 BNB. These coins will be utilized as cross-chain package sponsorships.
**2. ValidatorSet Contract.** All different gas fees will enter the ValidatorSet Contract and be shared daily with delegators and validators through Binance Chain.
To conduct a burn, the ValidatorSet Contract has a burnRatio variable. After concluding each block, a validator will sign a transaction transferring its gas fees to the smart contracts. The deposit function contains burning logic that sets off the simple formula: burnRatio * gasFee. This sum will then, at that point, be moved to the burn address. The burnRatio will initially be set at 10%.
BSC Validators will actually want to vote through proposals to change the burnRatio amount. This governance mechanism happens on Binance Chain, and any community member can present a proposal for survey with a base deposit of 2,000 BNB. All BNB marked behind a proposal and in a vote is returned after a decision has been made. Quorum is reached at half, and the change will be executed by means of cross-chain communication right away.
