# Wolfe Wave
## What Is a Wolfe Wave?

A Wolfe Wave is a chart pattern made out of five [wave](/elliottwavetheory) patterns in price that suggest an underlying equilibrium price. Investors who utilize this system time their trades in view of the resistance and support lines indicated by the pattern.

## Understanding Wolfe Waves

Wolfe Wave patterns were first recognized by Bill Wolfe and his child, Brian. As per Wolfe, they happen normally in all markets. To remember them, traders must distinguish a series of price motions that compare to specific criteria:

- The waves must cycle at a steady time interval.
- The third and fourth waves must remain inside the [channel](/channel) made by the first and second waves.
- The third and fourth waves must show balance with the first and second waves.

In a Wolfe Wave pattern, the fifth wave breaks out of the channel. As per the theory behind the pattern, a line drawn from the point toward the beginning of the initial wave and going through the beginning of the fourth wave predicts a target price for the finish of the fifth wave. On the off chance that a trader appropriately distinguishes a Wolfe Wave as it forms, the beginning of the fifth wave addresses an opportunity to take a [long](/long) or [short position](/short). The target price predicts the finish of the wave, and hence the place where the trader intends to profit off the position.

## Recognizing Complex Patterns Using Technical Analysis

[Technical analysis](/technicalanalysis) utilizes chart patterns, for example, Wolfe Waves to anticipate market developments and time trades for maximum profit. Traders who utilize technical analysis see charts portraying price developments for securities throughout some stretch of time. As a general rule, technical analysis settles upon hypotheses of supply and demand which suggest certain price levels above or below which securities will battle to trade. Levels of support compare to prices adequately low to draw in sufficient demand to balance out and raise share prices, while levels of resistance relate to prices adequately high to make shareholders sell shares and take profits, lessening demand levels and making prices level off or drop.

At the point when technical analysts search for patterns, for example, Wolfe Waves, they endeavor to profit off of a [breakout](/breakout), where share prices move outside of the channel framed by support and resistance levels. The very laws of supply and demand that produce levels of support and resistance likewise propose prices will recover their equilibrium after a breakout. Traders seeking maximum profit must have the option to distinguish the right places where to buy or sell in real time. While numerous methods exist to do this, traders run huge risks assuming they misidentify patterns or trends. Those keen on utilizing such strategies would generally well to research patterns and the hypotheses behind them carefully, take part in [paper trading](/papertrade) to test those speculations without risking money and utilize supports or stop loss positions to limit the expected down side of a confused trade.

## Highlights
- To be appropriately recognized as a Wolfe Wave a series of criteria must be met, for example, wave cycles each being comparable and distinct price action in the third and fourth waves.
- For a true Wolfe Wave, the fifth wave case in the pattern will be followed by a breakout in price.
- In technical analysis, Wolfe Waves are price patterns comprising of five waves that demonstrate either bullish or bearish trends.
