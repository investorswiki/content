The association was formed to advance better trading prices and conditions for the Eurobond market.

Eurobonds are presently issued through a group of international bond dealers known as a [syndicate](/syndicate).

## History and Expansion of the AIBD

During the 1980s, the AIBD was approved in the United Kingdom as an international securities automatic organization and recognized as a designated investment exchange for fixed-income trading. AIBD Ltd., an entirely claimed subsidiary of the AIBD, opened in London to give data services to the market, and in 1989 the AIBD sent off TRAX, a transaction matching, confirmation, and regulatory reporting system.

In January 1992, the AIBD changed its name to the International Securities Market Association (ISMA). In July 2005, ISMA merged with the International Primary Market Association and changed its name to the International Capital Market Association (ICMA). In 2007, ICMA extended enrollment to asset and fund managers as well as insurance companies and opened associate participation to professional advisers including law firms and accountants.

Throughout the past decade, the association has expanded its presence by opening new parts in the fringe of Europe (Greece, Turkey, and the Balkans as well as Ireland), Asia, and Latin America.
