# Proportional Tax
## What is a proportional tax?
A proportional tax, likewise alluded to as a [flat tax](/flattax), is a tax where the percentage of tax taken from a person's income continues as before, paying little mind to how much money the individual earns.
## More profound definition
In a proportional tax system, everyone is required to pay similar percentage of their income in taxes. For example, in the event that a tax rate is set at 10 percent, an individual who makes $200,000 a year would pay $20,000 a year in taxes, subsequently leaving him $180,000 of income.
Conversely, a taxpayer who makes $10,000 a year pays $1,000 in taxes, which leaves the person with $9,000 every year to meet all their bills. The tax rate of 10 percent is paid similarly regardless of how much money a taxpayer makes.
Allies of proportional tax contend that an equivalent tax rate across board is the most attractive system. There are no exemptions, the rules are effortlessly perceived and there ought not be any inquiries regarding the rate since it is no different for each taxpayer.
One more contention for a proportional tax system is that it spurs individuals to get more cash-flow. The hope is that by empowering individuals to earn a higher income, the country and individuals' quality of life will get to the next level.
Rivals of proportional tax contend that such a tax places an undue burden on the lower and middle class by dispensing with deductions and expanding the tax base to incorporate each level of income.
They claim that taking on such a tax moves the tax burden from wealthy individuals to the poor â€” the people who are generally impacted by taxation and who are less fit for paying.
## Proportional tax model
One illustration of a proportional tax today is the sales tax. Despite the fact that sales tax might fluctuate starting with one region then onto the next, each buyer pays similar sales tax. For instance, If the sales tax is 10 percent, each buyer of a PC that is worth $1,000 would pay $100 in sales tax, paying little mind to personal income.
In countries, for example, Russia, working residents pay a proportional tax to fund government operations. Russia's flat tax of 13 percent was put in place in 2001 by President Vladimir Putin.
Anyway in the U.S., the government doesn't impose a proportional tax on income, yet rather imposes a progressive tax where major league salary individuals are taxed at a higher rate compared to those low-income individuals.
