# B-Share
## What Is a B-Share?

A B-share is a class of shares offered in a mutual fund that charges a sales [load](/load). A B-share is one type of share, the other two being A-shares and C-shares. Each share accompanies its specific fee structure while purchasing or recovering shares in a mutual fund.

## Understanding B-Shares

[Mutual funds](/mutualfund) offer many share classes but the three most common are[ A-](/classashares), B-, and [C-share](/cshare) classes. These classes all address a similar interest in the mutual fund but will contrast in the fees and expenses charged to the investor.

The fees and expenses in a mutual fund are paid in two ways: directly or through fund assets. Sales charges and [redemption](/redemption) fees are typically paid directly by the investor whereas operating expenses, like marketing and distribution, are taken out of fund assets.

Each retail share class may have different [expense ratios](/expenseratio), nonetheless, usually just B-and C-share classes will be charged 12b-1 distribution fees, which increase their total expense.

### B-Shares Fee Structure

Class B shares don't charge a front-end sales load like A-shares but are characterized by a [back-end sales load](/back-end-load) structure, also known as a [contingent deferred sales charge](/cdsc) (CDSC). With back-end load charges, an investor causes a fee when they exit the fund rather than when they join, so all of their funds are invested when they first purchase shares.

The CDSC is typically possibly applied in the event that you sell your shares inside a specific time span, usually in something like six years of purchasing them. The CDSC declines the longer you hold the shares and is eventually eliminated, and after a certain period after elimination, usually two years, Class B shares convert to Class A shares, which offer investors the benefit of a lower annual expense ratio. These sales loads are separate from the operating expenses of a fund. Full details on a fund's sales load structure will be remembered for its [prospectus](/prospectus).

### B-Shares Expenses

As a retail share class, B-share operating expenses are subject to [12b-1 fees](/12b-1fees). 12b-1 fees compensate intermediaries and distributors for marketing and selling retail funds. These fees can frequently be higher for B-shares since they don't need front-end loads and may have commission fees that decrease over the long haul. Thus, B-shares frequently charge one of the highest total expense ratios. 12b-1 fees are not direct charges but are taken from fund assets.

In addition to 12b-1 fees, investors in retail share classes are also charged standard management and other operating expenses. Management and other expense fees are usually the same across all share classes.

### When to Choose B-Shares

As an investor, you will have the decision of what shares you might want to purchase, A, B, or C, or any other that may be offered by the mutual fund. The initial step is to actually decide if to invest in a load or no-load fund.

In the event that you are an accomplished investor who understands the financial markets well and doesn't require financial advice, then a no-load mutual fund is your best option; you will save a significant amount of money that can be utilized for investing instead of being paid as a [commission](/commission).

A load mutual fund will apply when you really want a financial expert to make financial choices for you, thus the sales charges that you are paying. On the off chance that you plan to hold your shares for quite some time or more, B-shares will be your best option. In this scenario, you avoid the front-load charge that A-share investors cause, and after some time your back-load charge will decrease the longer you hold your B-shares.

The important thing to check here is the expense ratio for the B-shares. Make sure it is reasonable and not significantly higher than the expense ratio for the A-shares. In the event that it is, you could save money over the long haul by picking A-shares, even in the event that you have to pay a sales charge upfront.
