# Non-Assessable Policy
## What Is a Non-Assessable Policy?

A non-assessable policy is a type of insurance policy that can't need the [policyholder](/policyholder-excess) to pay extra funds to cover an insurer's losses on the off chance that the losses are greater than its reserves.

## Grasping Non-Assessable Policies

Non-assessable policies are the type of insurance policy that a great many people are know about. They are associated with [commercial line](/commercial-insurance-lines) insurance, like auto contracts and homeowners insurance. Most insurance policies are viewed as non-assessable policies, with the insurance company offering them owned by investors as opposed to by policyholders (as in a [mutual insurance company](/mutual-insurance-company)).

A non-assessable policy limits the liability of the policyholder to the amount of premium owed on the policy. In the event that the insurer can't cover losses coming about because of claims, it must track down funds from different sources, including its investments. Since using investment income and different assets to cover losses means that the insurer will be less profitable, the insurance company's investors will eventually be forced to assimilate losses.

State insurance regulators might place limitations on insurers that give non-assessable policies. Such limitations regularly apply to the amount of reserves that the insurer must set to the side to cover liabilities, the type and number of policies it is permitted to guarantee, and the type of investments it can invest its dividends in. The justification behind the limitations is to guarantee that the insurer can actually cover its liabilities with liquid assets since it can't demand extra funds from policyholders to compensate for losses.
