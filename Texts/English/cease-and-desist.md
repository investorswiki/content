## What Is a Cease and Desist?

A cease and desist is a written notice requesting that the beneficiary quickly stop an illegal or supposedly illegal activity. It very well might be an order or [injunction](/injunction) issued by a court or government agency or a letter from an attorney.

## Grasping Cease and Desist

A cease and desist order and a cease and desist letter require various responses from the beneficiary. Neither can be overlooked.

### Cease and Desist Order

### Cease and Desist Letter

A cease and desist letter isn't legally binding and mirrors the assessment of an individual, regularly an attorney. A cease and desist letter might caution a wrongdoer that legal action might occur in the event that they don't stop the activity. The wrongdoer is generally given a set time span — typically 10 to 15 days — to cease and desist.

A cease and desist letter must follow laws in the jurisdiction in which it is sent. What's more, the American Bar Association (ABA) Model Rules of Professional Conduct direct that a lawyer "will not present, partake in introducing, or threaten to introduce a crook charge exclusively to get an advantage in a civil matter." Such a threat has no legal significance other than being a negotiation tactic.

Cease and desist letters frequently require a signature upon delivery. The letter is normally sent with a return receipt requested, albeit this isn't required.

### Legal Considerations for a Cease and Desist Letter

A lawyer is limited by the ABA Model Rules of Professional Conduct. These rules prevent attorneys from introducing — or participating in — threats or giving crook charges to gain an advantage in a civil case.

Three preconditions typically must be met before an attorney might raise the prospect of charges without abusing the professional conduct code.

1. **The charges must be connected with the civil matter at hand.** Citing a lawbreaker charge that is unrelated to the civil claim to get an upper hand in the civil case is a tricky tactic that is disapproved of by the legal system. An attorney who breaks trust by malignantly distorting a case or making a false claim would be participating in misconduct.
1. **The attorney must accept the civil claim and associated criminal charges depend on merit corresponding to the law.** A claim that is unfounded and without legitimacy can open the attorney to a claim of embarrassment by the person who received the cease and desist letter. The attorney might be found to have filed a pointless claim in violation of the Model Rules of Professional Conduct.
1. **An attorney must not endeavor to apply or inappropriately influence the criminal process.** An attorney who attempts to influence the legal outcome following a cease and desist letter through ill-conceived means like bias, duress, or [fraud](/fraud) might be found to have messed with the legal system. For instance, an attorney may not let a beneficiary know that criminal charges can be kept away from assuming the beneficiary satisfies the client's needs as illuminated in the letter. In legal terms, this could suggest that the attorney has some authority over court procedures, a violation of the ABA Model Rules of Professional Conduct.

Anybody can send a cease and desist letter. An attorney doesn't need to be involved. Nonetheless, an attorney can exhort complainants on whether their rights have been disregarded and on the off chance that they have legal and praiseworthy rights to send a cease and desist letter. The attorney likewise knows the right language to utilize.
