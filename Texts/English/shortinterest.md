Extremely high short interest shows investors are exceptionally critical (possibly excessively negative). At the point when investors are excessively critical it can lead to extremely sharp price rises now and again. Large changes in the short interest likewise flash warning signs, as it shows investors might be turning more [bearish](/bear) or [bullish](/bull) on a stock.

This approach ought to use a tight [stop loss](/stop-lossorder) to control risk, and trades ought to be regularly be viewed as short-term in nature since there could be legitimate purposes behind why investors are so bearish.

An investor who is long a stock may likewise wish to follow short interest.
