A capital gains distribution is a payment by a mutual fund or an exchange-traded fund (ETF) of a portion of the proceeds from the fund's sales of stocks and different assets from inside its portfolio. It is the investor's pro-rata share of the proceeds from the fund's transactions.

It is **not,** nonetheless, a share of the fund's overall profit. The fund might gain or lose money throughout a year, and your balance will rise or fall likewise. In any case, assuming the fund gained from the sale of any of its stocks during that year, it will make capital gains distributions to its shareholders.

Mutual funds are required by law to make ordinary capital gains distributions to their shareholders. The owners of mutual fund shares have the option to take the capital gains distribution as immediate payments or to reinvest it in extra fund shares.

## Grasping Capital Gains Distributions

For the most part, a mutual fund or ETF makes a capital gains distribution toward the finish of every year. The distribution addresses the proceeds of the sales of stock or different assets by the fund's managers all through the [tax year](/fiscalyear).

The investor ought to keep at the top of the priority list that cashing in on the capital gains distribution as opposed to reinvesting it in the fund is really a withdrawal. It diminishes the net amount you have invested in the fund by the amount of the distribution.

Holders of mutual fund shares are required to pay taxes on capital gains distributions made by the funds they own, whether the money is reinvested in extra shares. There is an exception for municipal bond funds, which are tax-exempt at the federal level and for the most part at the state level.

The taxes are not due for that tax year in the event that the investor possesses the fund as part of an IRA, 401(k), or another tax-deferred retirement plan. The taxes will be due when the funds are removed after retirement.

Capital gains distributions might be made even when a fund's overall value has dropped during the year. That is, a fund might have sold a few stocks that had valued in price, yet these gains may be offset or even deleted by different investments that lost money.

## Capital Gains Distributions and Net Asset Value

Albeit this shows up on a mutual fund's price chart as a decline in price on the [ex-dividend](/ex-dividend) date, the total return of the fund has not changed. [Unrealized gains](/unrealizedgain) on securities determine the mutual fund's net asset value until they are sold.
