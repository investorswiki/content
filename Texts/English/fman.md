# FMAN
## What Is FMAN?

FMAN alludes to one of three standard options contract [expiration cycles](/optioncycle), addressing February, May, August, and November. Option cycles allude to a pattern of months where options contracts [expire](/expirationdate).

Each [options series](/optionseries) these days has somewhere around four expiration months trading. Under the current rules, the initial two months are generally the two close to months, yet for the two farther months, the rules utilize the original cycles, for example, with FMAN.

## How FMAN Works

FMAN is the second standard options expiration cycle. The other two are JAJO (January, April, July, and October) and MJSD (March, June, September, and December).

The expiry date is typically the third Friday of the expiry month. That third Friday is the last informal investors can [exercise](/exercise) the option. On the off chance that the third Friday falls on a holiday, the Thursday's expiration date is before the standard Friday expiry.

Investors seeking to invest in an option will find the initial two front months followed by the two leftover cycle months. This gives the opportunity to investors to trade or [hedge](/hedge) for more limited terms as well as buy longer month contracts.

It ought to be noticed that these days the cycle is less important for intensely traded stocks and record following exchange-traded funds in light of the publication of week by week options. Since week after week options are accessible to be traded, an investor that needs to expand their expiration date can roll a quarterly option to some random seven day stretch of the year.

Investors really should comprehend what befalls a cycle when a month passes. Each cycle will constantly have the two front months accessible. Following a month passes the last two leftover months keep on following the originally assigned cycle. For instance, in February the FMAN cycle would have option availability in February, March, May, August. In June, the cycle one option availability would rather be June, August, November, February.

## At the point when Options Expiry

Options have a limited life, meaning they cease to exist past the expiration date. Traders holding the option have until expiry to either exercise the option or close the trade by taking an offsetting position to understand any profit or loss.

Practicing alludes to taking the associated position in the underlying asset. For instance, when a [call option](/calloption) lapses, the call buyer has the decision of allowing the option to terminate worthless and relinquishing the premium paid or practicing the option and in this way buying the underlying asset at the strike price determined by the options contract. Before expiration, they can sell the option for any intrinsic worth and time esteem it might have.

> [Out-of-the-money](/outofthemoney) (OTM) options are not automatically exercised and are permitted to terminate worthless.
>

A [option writer](/composing an-option), or the seller of the option, gets the premium when the buyer buys the option. On the off chance that the option terminates worthless, the seller keeps the whole premium. Assuming the option terminates [in-the-money](/inthemoney), the seller must give the underlying shares to the option buyer at the strike price. The option writer may likewise close out the position by taking an offsetting position before expiry, in this way acknowledging either a loss or a partial gain on the premium received.

## Special Consideraitons

Brokers may automatically exercise in-the-cash options at expiry for the option buyer. Traders can request that options are not automatically exercised. For instance, the trader might not have the capital to buy the underlying stock.

In this case, they probably shouldn't be exercised, however they ought to close out the option position before expiration to lock in any gains they are qualified for (the difference between the current option price and the purchase price).

Even however the out-of-cash option is technically worthless, the option holder might contact the broker requesting the option be exercised (whenever wanted). This might be advantageous assuming that the option is [near-the-money](/close the-cash), and the underlying stock has limited liquidity. In this case, the option permits the trader to position the underlying for the [position size](/positionsizing) associated with the options (typically 100 shares each).
