# Real-Time Quote
## What Is a Real-Time Quote (RTQ)?

A real-time quote (RTQs) is the display of the genuine price of a [security ](/security)at that exact second in time. [Quotes](/quote) are the price of a stock or security displayed on different sites and [ticker tapes](/tickertape). As a rule, these figures are not real-time numbers of where the securities are trading yet are delayed quotes. Delayed quotes, in contrast to real-time quotes, may lag the real trading market by somewhere in the range of 15 and 20 minutes. Real-time quotes are immediate with no postponement.

## Figuring out a Real-Time Quote

Real-time stock quotes, sometimes known as quote real time features, are progressively offered as a free add-on with many electronic financial locales and online brokerages. Be that as it may, a few suppliers will in any case charge an additional fee to gain access to them. Likewise, real-time pricing information for options and different securities might bring about additional fees, as they are expected fundamentally for professional traders and firms.

## How a Real-Time Quote Works

A standard quote on any security consists of a [bid price](/bidprice) and an ask or offer price and is a two-way pricing structure. In this structure, the bid price is the most any buyer will pay for the share or the security.

Conversely, the asking price is the least amount the seller will take for the share. The bidding price is what the sellers would receive for the security, and the [asking (offer) price](/ask) is what buyers must pay for the security. For instance, the quote for a share of XYZ might show up as $23.25 to $23.30.

In this case, the most the buyer will pay is $23.25, and the least the seller will acknowledge is $23.30. Further, the more volume that trades on a specific security will bring the bid and ask prices nearer together.

## Special Considerations

Historically, price quotes showed up by means of ticker tape which depended on broadcast technology. Over the long run, quotes started to be scattered daily in papers and during television communicates. Brokerage customers who wanted a stock quote would depend on telephones where a broker would physically call down to a stock exchange and request a quote. With the rise of Internet-based online trading, the cost of giving real-time quotes dropped altogether and soon became universal as of the mid 2010s.

Stock exchanges give quotes to the public which change with the amount of information accessible. Traders and investors utilizing electronic trading methods might receive Level I, II, or III quotes. As the quotes move up in level, more information is given. Anyway additional information will come at an additional cost.

Giving real-time quotes requires exertion and technology and thusly, costs more. If firms would rather not assimilate this cost, they will only offer delayed quotes. Reuters, for instance, gives a considerable amount of financial information, yet its stock quotes lag the market by 10 to 20 minutes starting around 2021. Financial news services frequently offer real-time quotes as a premium subscription service.

> Except if you're an informal investor or high-frequency trader, delayed quotes are generally adequate for monitoring a portfolio or putting in a request for a stock you plan to hold as long as possible.

## Benefits and Disadvantages of Real-Time Quotes

In a quickly rising, or falling market, otherwise called a [fast market](/fastmarket), even real-time quotes can struggle with keeping up. In that market scenario, a quote delayed by somewhere in the range of 15 and 20 minutes is essentially futile, as a stock might have moved by a huge percentage in that time outline.

For instance, in the event that a trader has a long-term portfolio of stocks and they don't plan to sell right away, they won't require up-to-the-second price information. Delayed quotes give an overall ballpark of where stocks and indexes are, and whether they are trending up or down.
