# Economic Forecasting
## What Is Economic Forecasting?

Economic forecasting is the method involved with attempting to foresee the future condition of the [economy](/economy) using a combination of important and widely followed [indicators](/economic_indicator).

Economic forecasting involves the building of statistical models with inputs of several key factors, or indicators, normally in an endeavor to concoct a future [gross domestic product](/gdp) (GDP) [growth rate](/growthrates). Essential economic indicators include [inflation](/inflation), [interest rates](/interestrate), [industrial production](/ipi), [consumer confidence](/cci), [worker productivity](/work productivity), [retail sales](/retail-sales), and [unemployment rates](/unemploymentrate).

## How Economic Forecasting Works

Economic forecasts are geared toward predicting quarterly or annual GDP growth rates, the high level [macro](/macro-climate) number whereupon numerous businesses and governments base their choices with respect to [investments](/investment), hiring, spending, and other important policies that impact aggregate economic activity.

Business managers depend on economic forecasts, using them as a manual for plan future [operating activities](/operating-activities). [Private sector](/private-sector) companies might have [in-house](/in-house) [economists](/economist) to zero in on forecasts generally pertinent to their specific businesses (e.g., a shipping company that needs to know the amount of GDP growth is driven by [trade](/trade).) Alternatively, they could depend on [Wall Street](/wallstreet) or scholastic economists, those joined to [think tanks](/economic-think-tank) or boutique experts.

Understanding what's on the horizon is additionally important for government authorities, helping them to determine which [fiscal](/fiscalpolicy) and [monetary policies](/monetarypolicy) to execute. Economists employed by the federal, state or nearby governments play a key job in helping policymakers set spending and [tax](/taxation) boundaries.

Since politics is profoundly hardliner, numerous rational individuals respect economic forecasts delivered by governments with sound portions of incredulity. A prime model is the long-term GDP growth forecast assumption in the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 that projects a lot more modest [fiscal deficit](/fiscaldeficit) that will burden people in the future of Americans — with uncommon ramifications to the economy — than independent economist gauges.

## Limitations of Economic Forecasting

Economic forecasting is many times portrayed as a defective science. Many suspect that economists who work for the White House are forced to fall in line, producing ridiculous situations in an endeavor to legitimize legislation. Will the inherently defective self-serving economic forecasts by the Federal government be accurate? Similarly as with any forecast, the truth will come out eventually.

The difficulties and subjective human behavioral parts of economic forecasting are not limited to the government. Private-sector economists, scholastics, and, surprisingly, the [Federal Reserve Board](/frb) (FSB) have issued economic forecasts that were stunningly misguided. Ask [Alan Greenspan](/alangreenspan), [Ben Bernanke](/benbernanke) or a profoundly compensated Wall Street or ivory tower economist what GDP forecasts they delivered in 2006 for 2007-2009 — the period of the [Great Recession](/great-recession).

Economic forecasters have a history of neglecting to predict emergencies. According to Prakash Loungani, assistant director and senior staff and budget administrator at the [International Monetary Fund](/imf) (IMF), economists failed to foresee 148 of the past 150 [recessions](/recession).

Loungani said this inability to spot imminent slumps is intelligent of the constrains on forecasters to play it safe. Many, he added, rather not stray away from the consensus, mindful that striking projections could damage their reputation and possibly lead them to lose their positions.

## Special Considerations

Investors should likewise not disregard the subjective idea of economic forecasting. Expectations are vigorously influenced by what type of economic theory the forecaster becomes involved with. Projections can vary impressively between, for instance, one economist that accepts [business activity](/business-activities) is determined by the [supply of money](/moneysupply) and another that maintains that robust government spending is terrible for the economy.

> ### Important
> The forecaster's personal theory on how the economy functions directs what type of indicators will be paid more regard for, possibly leading to subjective or biased projections.

Numerous ends don't come from objective economic analysis. Instead, they are routinely molded by personal convictions on how the economy and its participants work. That inevitably means that the impact of certain policies will be judged in an unexpected way.

## History of Economic Forecasting

Economic forecasting has been around for a really long time. Nonetheless, it was the [Great Depression of the 1930s](/great_depression) that brought forth the levels of analysis we see today.

After that disaster, a greater onus was put on understanding how the economy functions and where it is heading. This prompted the development of a more extravagant exhibit of statistics and insightful methods.
