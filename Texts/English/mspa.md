# Matched Sale-Purchase Agreement (MSPA)
## What Is a Matched Sale-Purchase Agreement (MSPA)?

In a matched sale-purchase agreement (MSPA), the Federal Reserve sells government securities like [U.S. Treasury](/ustreasury) bonds to an institutional dealer or the central bank of one more country with the contractual agreement to purchase the security back inside a short period of time, normally under about fourteen days. The security is bought back at a similar price at which it was sold and diminishes banking reserves during the term of the matched sale-purchase agreement.

This calculated agreement is otherwise called a "system MSP."

## Understanding Matched Sale-Purchase Agreements (MSPAs)

At last, matched sale-purchase agreements are a rarely-utilized method of briefly decreasing reserves and securities holdings, done when country governments have limited options. The purpose of a matched sale-purchase agreement is to somewhat restrict market liquidity for the term of the matched sale-purchase agreement.

Since matched sale-purchase agreements happen over short periods of time, they are employed as short-term options for stabilizing a market. This financial arrangement is unique in relation to the standard open-market operations (like selling Treasuries to investors), in that activities by the Federal Reserve roll out permanent improvements to banking reserves and securities levels.

Matched sale-purchase agreements contract the economy and are something contrary to repurchase agreements, which extend the financial supply by putting money reserves into the country's economy. For instance, the [Bank of Canada](/bankofcanada) utilizes a type of sale and repurchase agreement to execute a monetary policy called a [Purchase and Resale Agreement](/pra) (PRA). Regularly, Purchase and Resale Agreements are embraced to influence liquidity and interest rates in the money market.

## Matched Sale-Purchase Agreements versus Open Market Operations

As referenced, [open market operations](/openmarketoperations) (OMO) allude to the buying and selling of government securities in the open market to grow or contract the amount of money in the banking system. Purchases of securities infuse money into the banking system and invigorate growth, while sales of securities do the inverse and contract the economy. [The Federal Reserve](/federalreservebank) works with this interaction and utilizations this technique to change and control the [federal funds rate](/federalfundsrate), which is the rate at which banks borrow reserves from each other.
