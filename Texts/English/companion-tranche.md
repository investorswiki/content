# Companion Tranche
## What Is a Companion Tranche?

A companion tranche is a class, or type, of tranche, which is a portion of a debt or security. It is essentially associated as a tranche of a [collateralized mortgage obligation](/cmo) (CMO), which likewise incorporates [planned amortization class (PAC) tranches](/pactranche) and [targeted amortization class (TAC) tranches](/tac). Each CMO that has a PAC or TAC tranche will have a companion tranche. A companion tranche is otherwise called a "support tranche."

## Figuring out a Companion Tranche

A CMO is a [mortgage-backed security](/mbs) that comprises of a pool of mortgages that have been repackaged into one financial security offered available to be purchased to investors. Each CMO is organized by maturity and level of risk.

[Tranches](/tranches) are portions of a CMO, or other debt or security, structured to partition risk or to group the assets by qualities. This division and portioning of securities make them modified and marketable to specific segmenets of investors. The relationship given on account of CMO tranches is the chicken industry and how it developed to the sale of legs, wings, bosom, thighs, fat, and so on. Each segment of the market can buy the right parts at the right cost. Along these lines, no part of the chicken is squandered by some unacceptable buyer, and the financial outcome is augmented for the chicken company.

A CMO that contains a companion tranche is crucial on the grounds that [prepayment](/prepayment) rates on the underlying securities in a collateralized mortgage obligation (CMO) can change, which thus influence principal and interest payments to the arranged amortization class (PAC) and targeted amortization class (TAC) tranches.

The purpose of a companion tranche is to retain any changes in mortgage prepayment rates and to keep the principal and interest payments to the PAC and TAC tranches stable.

## Prepayment Rates

PAC and TAC tranches have priority in getting principal and interest payments in a CMO. A collateralized mortgage obligation (CMO) is given with mortgage prepayment rate presumptions. On the off chance that the genuine prepayment rate contrasts from these suspicions, the thing that matters is consumed by the companion tranche.

Changes in winning interest rates fundamentally impact mortgage prepayment rates. At the point when interest rates fall, mortgage prepayments commonly increase. Increases in prepayment is due to homeowners refinancing their existing mortgages or purchasing new homes to exploit the new lower rates. The prepayments cause a [contraction risk](/contractionrisk) with the shortening of the life, or term, of an arranged amortization class (PAC) or targeted amortization class (TAC).

Then again, when interest rates rise, mortgage prepayments commonly decline. Higher rates mean a homeowner won't refinance and be subject to the increase. Likewise, they might be less apt to move. A diminishing in prepayment, thusly, increases the term of PAC or TAC tranches and is called [extension risk](/extensionrisk).

In the least difficult occurrence, borrowers of the [mortgages](/mortgage) that make up a CMO might pay down their mortgages sooner than expected, which would diminish the principal and interest payments that go into the CMO, which thus go to the investors as returns. To keep this from occurring, the companion tranche will retain the diminishing in payments while the PAC and TAC tranches stay intact and receive their payments as though nothing happened to the underlying mortgages.

## Risk Protection With a Companion Tranche

A companion tranche safeguards both arranged and targeted amortization class tranches from contraction and extension risk. Thusly, the companion tranche keeps up with the stability of the focused on payments to PAC and TAC tranches. Excess mortgage principal payments are paid to the companion tranche when prepayments increase. On the off chance that prepayments decline, the companion tranche receives no principal payments.

Due to these changes in payments, a companion tranche's term can fluctuate widely. It will abbreviate when [interest rates](/interestrate) are low, and prepayments increase, and protract when rates are high, and prepayments decline. Due to this high degree of variability in the term, the [yield](/yield) on a companion tranche is higher than on a PAC or TAC tranche. A companion tranche might be interesting to a higher investor income and will face more challenge of having their principal returned at an undetermined future or prior time.

## Highlights
- A companion tranche is viewed as a support tranche to an arranged amortization class (PAC) tranche and a targeted amortization class (TAC) tranche.
- The other two tranches of a CMO are an arranged amortization class (PAC) tranche and a targeted amortization class (TAC) tranche.
- Companion tranches retain the changes in prepayment rates to guarantee that the interest and principal payments to the arranged amortization class (PAC) tranches and targeted amortization class (TAC) tranches stay stable.
- In view of the volatility in a companion tranche, the yield on a companion tranche is higher than on a PAC or TAC tranche.
- A companion tranche is a tranche that makes up part of a collateralized mortgage obligation (CMO).
