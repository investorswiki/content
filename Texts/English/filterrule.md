# Filter Rule
## What Is a Filter Rule?

A filter rule is a [trading strategy](/trading-strategy) in which a technical analyst sets rules for when to buy and sell investments, based on percentage changes from prior prices. The filter rule is generally based on price momentum, or the conviction that rising prices will quite often proceed to rise and falling prices will quite often keep on falling. A certain percentage rise triggers a buy, while a certain percentage fall triggers a sell.

Albeit, a trader could choose to do the inverse too. It is a subjective strategy, as the percentage level chose is based on the analyst's interpretation of a stock's price history.

## Understanding Filter Rules

[Technical analysts](/technical-analyst) utilize their carefulness while setting boundaries for filter rule trading. Generally, filter rules will be based on historical trends and security price designs recognized from the price chart of an asset. For instance, a technical trader might notice that once the price rises 5% from a specific level, it will in general move another 10% in that equivalent course. Hence, the trader could exploit this by utilizing a filter rule and looking for stocks (or any asset for which the rule is beneficial) that move 5% off a prior [closing price](/closingprice), low, or high. The trader or analyst likewise figures out which price they base the move off, such the high, low, or close of a [price bar](/barchart), or some other technically important price level.

Commonly the percentage will be based on shorter-term trends which frequently bring about price filter triggers for securities moving somewhere in the range of 1% and 10%. The levels could be smaller, for example, 0.2% or 0.5% whenever based on [intraday](/intraday) price developments.

For instance, under a 1% buy/sell filter rule, a trader buys a stock when its price rises 1% over a previous close (or low or high) and sells it when its price falls 1% below a previous close (or low or high).

The trader then likewise needs to choose if they are heading to trade in the two paths, all over, or just in one course. For instance, assuming the trend is up the trader might choose to buy when the price climbs 1%, and sell when the price drops 1%, yet they will not [short sell](/short) when it drops 1%.

Another trader might choose to buy on 1% increments and sell **and** short on a 1% drop. Then, at that point, on a 1% rise, they [cover](/cover) the short and go long again. In this case, they generally have a position.

## Filter Rule Implementations

Executing filter rules requires software which accommodates this feature. Generally, [technical analysis](/technicalanalysis) trading software or charts can be set to give cautions or execute trades consequently based on a financial backer's preference.

Some [traders](/trader) may choose for automated trading which allows them to make the most of trading opportunities all the more quickly. At the point when a signal is triggered the software consequently takes the trade. In different circumstances, traders might wish to be cautioned of price changes to settle on their own investing choices.

Contingent upon the boundaries set, a filter rule can result a large number of trades or a small number of trades every day, week, month, or year. Small boundaries, for example, 1% will trigger definitely a bigger number of trades than a filter of 15% or 20%.

While doing a large number of trades, [commissions](/commission) and position size are a factor. Commissions ought to be sufficiently low, and position size adequately large, to cover the costs of successive trading on small price moves.

They will exit their original position and reserve positions on the off chance that the price moves 0.6% the other way (off a swing high or low). As a further filter, they will just apply the strategy between 9:30 AM and noon EST. Any vacant position is exited at noon.

The chart demonstrates the way that this might have worked out on a day when the stock moved more than 3% during the allowed time span.
