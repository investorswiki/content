# Syndicate Bid
## What is a Syndicate Bid?

A syndicate bid is a bid offered by a member of a banking syndicate to balance out the price of a stock before its secondary offering on the [NASDAQ](/nasdaq) exchange. Syndicate bids assist with dealing with the entry of new shares into the market without leading to a dangerous drop in the price of the stock.

## How a Syndicate Bid functions

A syndicate bid is an endeavor by a member of a trading [syndicate](/syndicate) — meaning a bank, brokerage, or a high-end merchant — to balance out the price of a specific NASDAQ-exchanged stock. A syndicate bid is set right before the stock makes one more offering of shares. At the point when this new group of shares enters the market, the supply of shares will go up. Assuming that there is no immediate direct increase in demand for those shares, the price per share will diminish.

The convergence of new shares accessible for buy and the drop in price that results causes volatility and direct monetary misfortune for current shareholders. To prop up the stock price so the subsequent drop isn't so large and harming, the syndicate member puts the highest bid conceivable to lay out a higher price. Basically, the syndicate bid lays out a high base rate from which the deluge of new shares will bring down the price. Without syndicate bids, a secondary offering could tank the price of a stock or cause extreme volatility or a fast market. Syndicate bids assist with dealing with the availability of new shares without hurting the stock itself, current investors or the NASDAQ as a whole.

## The Ethics of Syndicate Bids

One might think a syndicate bid is a form of insider trading or an endeavor to short a stock. Notwithstanding, on the grounds that the entrance of new shares is announced formally before it works out, this can't qualify as [insider trading](/insidertrading). What's more, on the grounds that the intent of a syndicate bid is to prop up the price of the stock instead of prompt it to fall to benefit from [shorting](/shortselling), the charge that syndicate bids are shorting endeavors is similarly invalid. Syndicate bids are a technique known by all industry participants engaged with share offerings. They comprehend the purpose is to deal with the entry of new shares, and don't think of it as a violation of ethics.
