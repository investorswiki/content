## What Is Bitcoin Dust?

Bitcoin dust alludes to the tiny amounts of bitcoin [leftover or unspent](/utxo) in a transaction that is lower in value than the base furthest reaches of a substantial transaction. Subsequently, processing the transaction is unimaginable, catching a little amount of Bitcoin (maybe 0.00000012 BTC, for example), in a wallet or address.

## Understanding Bitcoin Dust

Bitcoin dust is the small amount of Bitcoin that remaining parts in a specific wallet or address in light of the fact that the monetary value is minuscule to such an extent that it is below the amount of the fee required to spend the bitcoin. It makes the transaction difficult to process.

Whenever any transaction happens on the bitcoin network, it should be approved for validness so the transaction can be handled in a reasonable amount of time. Miners approve the transaction and add it to the [blockchain](/blockchain) network. They are paid a mining fee for playing out this service (this amount can change).

Due to the working mechanism of the blockchain network, now and again the mining fee can be higher than the real amount of the transaction. Bitcoin dust alludes to a bitcoin transaction amount where the fee is higher than the transaction amount, making it inconceivable for the transaction to happen.

> As of July 25, 2021, the average Bitcoin transaction fee was generally $2.00, up from $0.59 a year prior.

## Illustration of Bitcoin Dust

For instance, you start with an unspent transaction output (UTXO). This is Bitcoin at a place on the network that hasn't been spent. You must have at least one UTXO to start a transaction, and at least one UTXO are made simultaneously.

The Bitcoin interaction includes a fee for the miners who are recording the transaction on the blockchain; that fee is proportional to the number of bytes the transaction involves on the blockchain. Each UTXO requires a number of bytes, so the more UTXOs you have, the bigger the transaction. Subsequently, the bigger the fee.

On the off chance that a client has one Bitcoin stored in one UTXO, it will cost less to execute it than one Bitcoin spread across 10 UTXOs of 0.1 bitcoin or 100 UTXOs of 0.01 bitcoin. At the point when you get to tiny numbers of Bitcoin in an UTXO, the cost of recording the transaction on the blockchain will be greater than the value of the Bitcoin.

Such tiny transactions, assuming initiated, are dropped, and should be carried out again between the sender and receiver. This Bitcoin dust can stay in various wallets, making it a worthless holding until the mining fee descends (or more bitcoins are added to the wallet to handle a bigger transaction).

## Impediments of Bitcoin Dust

A weakness — and all the more significantly, a gamble — of bitcoin dust is the chance of de-anonymization, which is the point at which an individual's identity can be linked to their Bitcoin transactions.

Programmers have developed a strategy called a dust attack where micro amounts of Bitcoin dust are shipped off a clueless client's wallet. At the point when the client spends the dust-polluted, programmers use software to dissect the client's different transactions and develop an identity profile for malicious purposes.

## Highlights
- The cost of the fee to process a bitcoin transaction varies in light of the volume of transactions on the network.
- Bitcoin dust is a series of trace amounts of bitcoins that independently are less significant than the computing power or fee that is required to handle them; thus, the transaction is difficult to process.
- While Bitcoin dust can dial back network transactions, endeavoring to clean up Bitcoin dust can make a privacy problem, particularly for small users.
