# Substitution Effect
## What Is the Substitution Effect?

The [substitution](/substitute) effect is the decline in sales for a product that can be credited to consumers switching to cheaper alternatives when its price rises. A product might lose [market share](/marketshare) for some reasons, however the substitution effect is purely an impression of moderation. In the event that a brand raises its price, a few consumers will choose a cheaper alternative. In the event that hamburger prices rise, numerous consumers will eat more chicken.

## Understanding the Substitution Effect

As a general rule, when the price of a product or service increases yet the buyer's [income](/income) remains something very similar, the substitution effect kicks in. This isn't just apparent in consumer behavior. For instance, a manufacturer confronted with a price climb for an essential part from a domestic provider might switch to a cheaper rendition created by a foreign contender.

How, then, at that point, does any company pull off expanding its price? Notwithstanding the substitution effect, there's the [income effect](/incomeeffect) â€” a portion of its customers might be partaking in an increase in spending power and buy a pricier product. A company's progress in repricing its not entirely settled in part by the amount of the substitution effect is offset by the income effect.

## Special Considerations
### Price Fluctuations

As noted, when a product price increases consumers will more often than not drop it for a cheaper alternative. This can transform into a perpetual game of [supply and demand](/law-of-supply-demand). Steak prices rise, so consumers substitute pork. This prompts a decline in the demand for steak, so its price drops and consumers return to buying steak.

This doesn't mean just that consumers pursue a bargain. Consumers pursue their decisions in view of their overall spending power and make consistent adjustments in light of price changes. They endeavor to keep up with their expectations for everyday comforts in spite of price variances.

### Close Substitutes

The substitution effect is most grounded for products that are close substitutes. For example, a customer could pick a synthetic shirt when the pure cotton brand appears to be too pricey. Eventually, enough customers might follow suit to make a quantifiable effect on the sales of both shirt creators.

Somewhere else, in the event that a golf club hikes its fees, a few individuals could stop. Be that as it may, on the off chance that there is no comparable decision for them to go to, they may just need to pay up to try not to stop the game totally.

### Inferior Goods

As silly as it appears, the substitution effect may not happen when the products that increase in price are inferior in quality. Truth be told, an inferior product that rises in price may really partake in a sales increase.

Products that display this phenomenon are called [Giffen goods](/giffen-great), after a Victorian economist who previously noticed it. Sir Robert Giffen noticed that cheap staples, for example, potatoes will be purchased in greater amounts assuming their prices rise. He presumed that individuals on very limited financial plans are forced to buy even more potatoes on the grounds that their rising price places other greater staples by and large out of their compass.

Substitute goods might be adequate substitutions or inferior goods. Demand for a [inferior good](/inferior-kindness) increase when overall consumer spending power falls.
