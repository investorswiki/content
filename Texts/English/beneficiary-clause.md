# Beneficiary Clause
## What Is a Beneficiary Clause?

A beneficiary clause is a provision in a life insurance policy or other [investment vehicle](/investmentvehicle, for example, a [annuity](/annuity) or individual retirement account (e.g., an IRA), that permits the policy owner to name individuals as primary and secondary beneficiaries.

## Figuring out Beneficiary Clauses

A beneficiary clause characterizes the individuals who will benefit from the funds or different benefits from the policyholder or [benefactor](/benefactor). The policy owner might change the [named beneficiaries](/named-beneficiary) whenever by following the details defined in the policy. The term beneficiary alludes to the determination of the beneficiary of funds or different benefits as determined in a policy or trust.

Regularly, any person or entity can be named a beneficiary of a trust, will, or life insurance policy. The individual distributing the funds, or the benefactor, can place limitations on the disbursement of funds, for example, the beneficiary accomplishing a certain age or being married. There can likewise be tax results to the beneficiary. For instance, while the principal of most life insurance policies isn't taxed, the accrued interest may be taxed.

## Beneficiaries of Qualified Retirement Accounts

Qualified retirement plans, similar to a [401(k)](/401kplan) or [IRA](/ira), give the ability of the account holder to assign a beneficiary. Upon the qualified plan holder's passing, a spousal beneficiary might have the option to roll the proceeds into their own IRA. On the off chance that the beneficiary isn't the spouse, there are three unique options for distribution.

The first is to take a lump-sum distribution, which makes the whole amount taxable at the beneficiary's ordinary income level. The second is to lay out an inherited IRA and pull out an annual amount in light of the life expectancy of the beneficiary, otherwise called a "stretch IRA." The third option is to pull out the funds whenever in no less than five years of the original account owner's date of death.

The stretch option is at this point not available for an inheritance received in 2020 due to the death of the Setting Every Community Up for Retirement Enhancement (SECURE) Act of 2019, and consequently just the lump-sum and five-year rule options are available going ahead. The SECURE Act specifies that a beneficiary of a retirement account must take all distributions in 10 years or less.

## Beneficiaries of Life Insurance Policies

Life insurance policies require named beneficiaries to be designated. These can be designated as primary, secondary, or tertiary if the primary or potentially secondary named beneficiaries have died before the death of the insured. The beneficiary might be an individual, an organization (e.g., a charity), or a trust.

Life insurance proceeds are considered [tax-free](/tax-free) to the beneficiary and are not reported as [gross income](/grossincome). Be that as it may, any interest received or accrued is viewed as taxable and is reported as some other interest received.

## Beneficiaries of Non-qualified Annuities

Non-qualified annuities are considered [tax-deferred](/taxdeferred) investment vehicles that permit the owners to assign a beneficiary. Upon the death of the owner, the beneficiary might be liable for any taxes on the [death benefit](/deathbenefit). Dissimilar to life insurance, annuity death benefits are taxed as ordinary income on any gains over the original investment amount.

For instance, on the off chance that the original account owner purchased an annuity for $100,000 and, died when the value was worth $150,000, the gain of $50,000 is taxed as ordinary income to the beneficiary.
