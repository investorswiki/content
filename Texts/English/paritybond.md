# Parity Bond
## What Is a Parity Bond?

A parity bond alludes to at least two bond issues with equivalent rights of payment or equivalent seniority to each other. All in all, a parity bond is an issued bond with equivalent rights to a claim as different bonds previously issued. For instance, unsecured bonds have equivalent rights in that coupons might be claimed with practically no particular bond having priority over another. In this manner, unsecured bonds would be alluded to as parity bonds with one another. Likewise, secured bonds are parity bonds with other [secured bonds](/securedbond).

A parity bond is likewise alluded to as a [pari passu](/pari-passu) bond or a side-by-side bond.

## Understanding Parity Bonds

Parity bonds are like **pari passu** securities, which are securities or debts which have equivalent claims on a right with practically no display of preference. The term "**pari passu**" comes from Latin, and means equivalent balance. For instance, in a **pari passu** security, holders of common shares all have equivalent rights to claim a dividend without one shareholder having priority over another.

A series of fixed-income securities might be issued as a parity bond, or incorporate a **pari passu** clause, to lay out that it capabilities similarly as recently issued bonds.

Since an asset backs secured debts, they are many times not completely equivalent to different obligations held by the borrower. Since there is no asset supporting unsecured debts, there are more prominent examples of borrower [default](/default2) or bankruptcy. Further, a provider of unsecured financing might establish clauses that prevent a borrower from partaking in certain activities, for example, the promising of assets for one more debt to keep a position with respect to repayment.

Unsecured debts will have [parity](/parityprice) with respect to other unsecured debts, implying that the bonds have equivalent rights over the coupon. Secured debts will likewise have parity with respect to other secured debts, despite the fact that secured debts will have rights that override those of unsecured debts. At the end of the day, guaranteed debts and unsecured debts are not parity bonds concerning one another.

## Illustration of a Parity Bond

Parity bonds have equivalent rights to the coupon or [nominal yield](/nominalyield). In fixed-income investments, the coupon is the annual interest rate paid on a bond. Consider a $1,000 bond with a 7 percent coupon rate. The bond will pay $70 each year. In the event that new bonds with a 5 percent coupon are issued as parity bonds, the new bonds will pay $50 each year, yet bondholders will have equivalent rights to the coupon.

A parity bond remains rather than a [junior](/junior-debt) lien or senior lien bond. A junior lien bond, likewise called a [subordinate](/subordinateddebt) bond, has a subordinate claim to pledged revenue as compared to a senior lien bond, which is likewise called a first lien bond. Unsecured debts are subordinate bonds compared to secured debts.
