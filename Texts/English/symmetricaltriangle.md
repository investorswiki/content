# Symmetrical Triangle
## What is a Symmetrical Triangle

A symmetrical triangle is a [chart pattern](/pattern) characterized by two joining trend lines interfacing a series of sequential [peaks](/top) and [troughs](/box). These trend lines ought to merge at a generally equivalent incline. Trend lines that are uniting at inconsistent inclines are alluded to as a rising [wedge](/wedge), falling wedge, ascending triangle, or descending triangle.

## Symmetrical Triangles Explained

A symmetrical triangle chart pattern addresses a period of consolidation before the price is forced to breakout or breakdown. A breakdown from the lower [trendline](/trendline) marks the beginning of another bearish trend, while a breakout from the upper trendline demonstrates the beginning of another bullish trend. The pattern is otherwise called a [wedge chart pattern](/wedge).

The price target for a [breakout](/breakout) or [breakdown](/breakdown) from a symmetrical triangle is equivalent to the separation from the high and low of the earliest part of the pattern applied to the breakout price point. For instance, a symmetrical triangle pattern could begin at a low of $10 and climb to $15 before the price range limits after some time. A breakout from $12 would infer a price target of $17, or $15 - $10 = $5, then + $12 = $17.

The [stop-loss](/stop-lossorder) for the symmetrical triangle pattern is many times just below the breakout point. For instance, if the previously mentioned security breaks out from $12 on high [volume](/volume), traders will frequently place a stop-loss just below $12.

Symmetrical triangles contrast from [ascending triangles](/ascendingtriangle) and [descending triangles](/descendingtriangle) in that the upper and lower trendlines are both slanting towards a center point. Interestingly, ascending triangles have a horizontal upper trendline, foreseeing a potential breakout higher, and descending triangles have a horizontal lower trendline, foreseeing a potential breakdown lower. Symmetrical triangles are additionally like [pennants](/flag) and [flags](/banner) here and there, yet flags have up slanting trendlines as opposed to meeting trendlines.

Similarly as with most forms of [technical analysis](/technicalanalysis), symmetrical triangle patterns work best related to other technical indicators and chart patterns. Traders frequently search for a high volume move as confirmation of a breakout and may utilize other technical indicators to decide how long the breakout could last. For instance, the [relative strength index](/rsi) (RSI) might be utilized to decide when a security has become overbought following a breakout.

## Real World Example of a Symmetrical Triangle

The following chart shows an illustration of a symmetrical triangle pattern in Northwest Bancshares (NWBI):
<!--4DA31C1BFC8A1D0B472520F89FBF2103-->
In this model, Northwest Bancshares is shaping a symmetrical triangle that could go before a breakout. The [price target](/pricetarget) for a breakout would be $19.40, or $17.40 - $15.20 = $2.20, then, at that point, + $17.20 = $19.40. The stop-loss would be $16.40 for a breakdown or $17.20 for a breakout.

## Highlights
- Symmetrical triangles happen when a security's price is merging in a manner that produces two uniting trend lines with comparable slants.
- The breakout or breakdown targets for a symmetrical triangle is equivalent to the distance between the initial high and low applied to the breakout or breakdown point.
- Numerous traders utilize symmetrical triangles related to different forms of technical analysis that act as a confirmation.
