# Cloud Security
## What Is Cloud Security?

Cloud security is the protection of data stored online by means of [cloud computing](/cloud-computing) platforms from theft, leakage, and erasure. Methods of giving cloud security incorporate firewalls, penetration testing, [obfuscation](/data-anonymization), tokenization, virtual private networks (VPN), and staying away from public internet associations. Cloud security is a form of [cybersecurity](/cybersecurity).

## Grasping Cloud Security

Cloud computing is the delivery of various services through the Internet. These resources incorporate devices and applications like data storage, servers, databases, networking, and software. Instead of keeping records on a proprietary hard drive or nearby storage gadget, [cloud-based storage](/cloud-storage) makes it conceivable to save them to a remote database. Up to an electronic gadget approaches the web, it approaches the data and the software programs to run it. Cloud computing is a famous option for individuals and organizations for a number of reasons including cost savings, increased productivity, speed and proficiency, performance, and security.

Cloud security is essential for the numerous users who are concerned about the safety of the data they store in the cloud. They accept their data is safer on their own neighborhood servers where they believe they have more control over the data. In any case, data stored in the cloud might be safer on the grounds that cloud service providers have unrivaled security measures, and their employees are security specialists. On-premise data can be more helpless against [security breaches](/data-break), contingent upon the type of attack. [Social engineering](/social-engineering) and malware can make any data storage system defenseless, yet on location data might be more helpless since its gatekeepers are less knowledgeable about recognizing security threats.

## Security Concerns

Cloud security is a key concern for [cloud storage](/cloud-storage) providers. They not exclusively must fulfill their clients; they additionally must follow certain regulatory requirements for putting away sensitive data, for example, credit card numbers and wellbeing information. Third-party audits of a cloud provider's security systems and procedures assist with guaranteeing that users' data is safe.

Major threats to cloud security incorporate data breaks, data loss, account capturing, service traffic commandeering, insecure [application program interfaces](/application-programming-interface) (APIs), poor decision of cloud storage providers, and shared technology that can compromise cloud security.

Distributed denial of service ([DDoS](/denial-service-attack-dos)) attacks are one more threat to cloud security. These attacks shut down a service by overpowering it with data so users can't access their accounts, for example, bank accounts or email accounts.

## Different Considerations

Keeping up with the security of data in the cloud stretches out past getting the cloud itself. Cloud users must safeguard access to the cloud that can be acquired from data stored on mobile gadgets or carelessness with login credentials. One more cloud security issue is that data stored on a cloud-facilitated in another country might be subject to various regulations and privacy measures.

While picking a cloud provider, it is important to pick a company that attempts to safeguard against malicious insiders through historical verifications and security clearances. The vast majority think outside programmers are the greatest threat to cloud security, yet employees present just as large of a risk. These employees are not really malicious insiders; they are much of the time employees who unwittingly commit errors, for example, utilizing a personal [smartphone ](/smartphone)to access sensitive company data without the security of the company's own network.
