## Purposes behind Postnuptial Agreements

Coming up next are among the situations where couples might look for a postnup.

### Protecting an Inheritance

At the point when one of the spouses expects an enormous inheritance, the two might need to work out who's qualified for the money would it be advisable for them they split. That is particularly important in community property states, in which assets acquired during the marriage generally are generally split similarly between the spouses.

Inheritances received by one spouse during the marriage are normally not thought about community property. In any case, assuming an inheritance has been taken care of such that made it become "coexisted" with community property, an inheritance might be viewed as community property. At the point when there's a postnup in place, the agreement would override that equivalent claim on property and guarantee that the heir kept on possessing their inheritance. Even in some non-community property states like Pennsylvania, any increase in the value of the inheritance is viewed as marital property.

In situations where one spouse's parents gave several a substantial amount of money — maybe for the down payment on a house — a divorce settlement can be a particularly off-kilter process.

The contract might specify, for instance, that the spouse whose family was the source of the money gets the first $100,000 in quite a while to recover the funds.

### Revamping a Relationship

At times arranging these points is viewed as a method for keeping a striving marriage dissolvable. Assume, for instance, that one of the people has been unfaithful. Settling on post-divorce terms that are good for the other spouse can be an indication of an aim to keep the relationship in salvageable shape.
