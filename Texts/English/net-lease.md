A net lease is something contrary to a [gross lease](/gross-lease), where the tenant pays a flat rental fee while the landlord is responsible for different costs.

## Types of Net Leases

The definition of what is a net lease is very broad and a long way from uniform across the country. All things considered, net leases are broken down into three primary types that deal with the principal cost categories of [taxes](/taxes), maintenance, and insurance fees — notwithstanding the rent charged by the landlord. They are:

- **Single Net Lease:** When a tenant signs a single net lease, they pay one of the three expense categories.
- **Double Net Lease:** Tenants who have a [double net lease](/double-net-lease) pay two of the three expense categories. These leases are additionally called net leases.
- **Triple Net Lease:** In a [triple net lease](/triple-net-lease-nnn) — otherwise called a net-net lease, the tenant pays each of the three expense categories. Triple net leases are normally whole building leases with a single tenant as long as possible — typically 10 years or more.

Even with the breakdowns over, the real definition of a net lease is dependent on the subtleties in each contract.

As referenced above, net [leases](/lease) are something contrary to gross leases, where the landlord covers all of the expense categories in exchange for a fixed payment. In practice, a modified gross lease and a single or double net lease can be exactly the same thing. A modified gross lease could have the tenant paying building insurance costs, for instance, and could without much of a stretch be classified as a single net lease. Once more, the subtleties of the lease matter more than whether the lessor thinks of it as a net or gross lease.
