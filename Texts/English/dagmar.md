## What Is DAGMAR?

DAGMAR (characterizing advertising objectives for measured advertising results) is a marketing model used to lay out clear objectives for an advertising campaign and measure its prosperity. The DAGMAR model was presented by Russell Colley in a 1961 report to the Association of National Advertisers and was expanded upon in 1995 by Solomon Dutka.

## Figuring out DAGMAR

The DAGMAR approach advocates a [marketing strategy](/marketing-strategy) that directs the consumer through four phases: awareness, perception, conviction, and action. That path has become referred to by its abbreviation as the ACCA formula. The four stages of the campaign are as per the following:

- Generating awareness of the brand among consumers
- Expanding appreciation of the product and its benefits
- Persuading consumers that they need the product
- Convincing consumers to buy it

The DAGMAR method contains two objectives. The first is to foster a communication task that achieves those specific ACCA steps. The second is to ensure that the outcome of those objectives can be measured against a baseline.

Colley accepted that effective advertising tries to impart as opposed to sell. He determined four essential requirements for assessing the effectiveness of an advertising campaign:

- Be concrete and quantifiable
- Characterize the target crowd or market
- Distinguish the benchmark and the degree of change anticipated
- Indicate a period during which to achieve the goal

## Distinguishing a Target Market to Implement DAGMAR

The [target market](/target-market) is the subset of consumers who have the highest probability of purchasing the product. The target market might be narrow or broad. It could be ladies overall or youthful professional single ladies who live in urban areas.

Identification of a target market can incorporate [demographic](/demographics), geographic, and psychographic segmentation. Target markets can be isolated into primary and secondary gatherings. Primary markets are the initial focal point of a campaign and, ideally, the main customers to buy and utilize the new product. [Secondary markets](/secondarymarket) are the bigger population that might buy the product once the brand becomes laid out.

Subsequent to recognizing the target market, the company lays out the message it needs to impart in its advertising campaign.

## DAGMAR Benchmark and Time Frame

The DAGMAR method expects marketers to lay out a benchmark to measure the progress of a campaign. The present organizations rarely set out to sell a product to everyone. They aim for a specific [share of a market](/marketshare) or a substantial share of a [market segment](/market-segment).

The makeup industry offers an unmistakable model. There are mass-market products accessible in pharmacies, and top of the line products, a few made by similar companies, that are sold exclusively in department stores. There are products that are branded, packaged, and advanced exclusively for teens, and others for mature ladies.

A company introducing another product aims at least one of these market segments, however not every one of them without a moment's delay. Regardless, setting a benchmark for product achievement assists sponsors with characterizing the market and make an effective campaign to arrive at it.

The time period endeavors to set a reasonable cutoff time for passing judgment on the achievement or disappointment of another product's presentation.
