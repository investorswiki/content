# Regulation O
## What Is Regulation O?

Regulation O is a Federal Reserve regulation that places limits and expectations on the [credit ](/credit)extensions a member bank can offer to its executive officers, principal shareholders, and directors. The regulation is intended to forestall bank directors, trustees, executive officers, or principal shareholders ("insiders") from profiting from favorable credit extensions.

## Regulation O Explained

Regulation O manages the credit extensions that member banks can offer to people who are viewed as "insiders" with respect to the bank. While [bank insiders](/insider) are not banned from taking out loans from a bank with which they are expertly associated, federal law carefully manages how that bank regards the insider as a customer. As well as setting limitations on credit extensions for bank insiders, Regulation O expects that banks report any extensions gave to insiders in their quarterly reports.

Regulation O likewise gives an unmistakable definition of bank insiders, isolating them into numerous tiers of association, subject to various credit extension regulations. Insiders can be directors or [trustees](/legal administrator) of a bank, executive officers (for instance, the president or treasurer) or principal shareholders (people who own or in any case control over 10% of the public [shares](/shares) of the institution).

Generally talking, the limitations in place are concocted to guarantee that bank insiders are not given more profitable or liberal credit extensions than the bank would accommodate a non-insider. The bank can't give credit extensions that it wouldn't give to a non-insider customer, nor could it at any point broaden credit past legal or purposeful lending limits. One exception to this rule accompanies compensation bundles given by banks to all employees, including non-insiders. For instance, on the off chance that a bank has a policy of postponing certain [mortgage](/mortgage) application fees for non-insider employees (like tellers), similar fees could be deferred for the bank president, who might be an insider.

### Implementation and Expansion

Regulation O spreads out the [reporting requirements](/divulgence) remembered for two previous financial laws: the Financial Institutions Regulatory and Interest Rate Control Act of 1978 (the main cycle of Regulation O was completely carried out by 1980) and the [Depository Institutions Act of 1982](/garn-st-germain-depository-institutions-act).

Banks and other lending institutions are frequently able to track down exceptions or workarounds to Regulation O, in effect, giving special treatment to insiders without disregarding any of the regulations. One of the provisions of the [Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act](/dodd-frank-financial-regulatory-reform-bill) gave a drawn out definition of "credit extension" to grow the scope of Regulation O.

## Special Considerations For Regulation O

Late growth in investments in [mutual funds](/mutualfund), [exchange-traded funds](/etf) (ETFs), and other record based investment products has made a number of companies pay greater consideration regarding Regulation O. Large asset management companies are becoming principal shareholders through "reserve complexes," organizations that invest in funds. A complex that obtains 10% of a class of [voting ](/votingshares)securities of a banking organization is viewed as a "principal shareholder."
