"Buy to open" is a term utilized by brokerages to address the foundation of a new (opening) long [call](/calloption) or [put](/putoption) position in [options](/option). To buy a call or put, that investor ought to buy to open. A buy-to-open order demonstrates to market participants that the trader is laying out another position as opposed to closing out an existing position. The [sell to close](/selltoclose) order is utilized to exit a position taken with a buy-to-open order.

Laying out another short position is called [sell to open](/selltoopen), which would be closed out with a [buy-to-close](/buytoclose) order. To sell a call or a put, that investor ought to sell to open.

## Understanding Buy to Open Orders

## Stock Considerations

The term "buy to open" can be applied to stocks too. At the point when an investor chooses to lay out another position in a specific stock, the principal buy transaction is viewed as buy to open since it opens the position.

By opening the position, the stock is laid out as a holding in the portfolio. The position stays open until it is closed out by selling every one of the shares. That is known as selling to close since it closes the position. Selling a partial position means that some, yet not all, stocks have been sold. A position is viewed as closed when nothing else of a specific stock remaining parts in a portfolio.

Buy-to-close orders likewise become possibly the most important factor while covering a [short-sell](/shortsale) position. A short-sell position gets the shares through the broker and is closed out by buying back the shares in the open market. The last transaction to totally close out the position is known as the buy-to-close order. This transaction eliminates the exposure totally. The intent is to buy back the shares at a lower price to create a profit from the difference of the short-sell price and the buy-to-close price.

In cases where the share price moves strongly higher, a short-seller might need to buy to close at a loss to prevent even greater losses from happening. In a most dire outcome imaginable, the broker might execute a forced liquidation because of a [margin call](/margincall). Then, the broker would demand that the investor place money in the margin account due to a shortfall. That would create a [buy-to-cover](/buytocover) order to close out the position at a loss due to lacking account equity.

## Buy to Open versus Buy to Close

To buy a call or a put to profit from a price movement of the underlying security, then, at that point, that investor must buy to open. Buying to open starts a long options position that gives a speculator the possibility to create an incredibly large gain with extremely low risk. All then again, the security must move in the right heading inside a limited time, or the option will lose its value to [time decay](/timedecay).

Option sellers enjoy an upper hand over buyers in light of time decay, yet they might in any case need to buy to close their positions. At the point when an investor sells options, the investor stays committed by the terms of those options until the expiration date. Notwithstanding, movements in the price of the security can allow options sellers to take a large portion of their profits significantly sooner or spur them to cut losses.

Assume somebody sells [at the money](/atthemoney) puts lasting for a year, and afterward the underlying stock increases by 10% following three months. The options seller can buy to close and move a large portion of the profits right away. In the event that the stock falls 10% following three months all things being equal, the options seller should pay more to buy to close and limit possible losses.

## Illustration of Buy to Open

Assume a trader has done some analysis and accepts that the price of XYZ stock will go from $40 to $60 in the next year. The trader could buy to open a call for XYZ. The [strike price](/strikeprice) may be $50 with a [expiration date](/expirationdate) about in 12 months' time.
