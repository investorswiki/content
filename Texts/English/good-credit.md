# Great Credit
## What Is Good Credit?

Great credit is a classification for a person's [credit history](/credit-history), demonstrating the borrower has a moderately high [credit score](/credit_score) and is a safe credit risk. Credit scores are given through credit reporting agencies. Lenders check credit scores to give credit underwriting choices and personal investigation subtleties.

## Seeing Good Credit

[Credit rating agencies](/creditrating) assign borrowers a score in view of their credit history, which is followed in a credit report. Credit scoring differs as per the methods utilized in their calculation. The most generally utilized credit score is the [FICO](/fico-fair-isaac) score.

A borrower's credit score can go from 300 to 850. Credit scoring classifications are broken into five tiers: remarkable, generally excellent, great, fair, and extremely poor. Borrowers with a decent credit score fall into any of the main three tiers. As per Experian, borrowers with excellent credit have a score of 800 and higher. Borrowers with generally excellent credit have a score going from 740 to 799, while those with great credit have scores going from 670 to 739.

Consequently, borrowers with a credit score of roughly 670 or higher are considered to have a decent credit score and the best chance of getting credit endorsement from a lender.

The last two tiers are fair and poor. Borrowers in these two categories have more difficulty getting credit and are many times charged higher rates of interest as [subprime loans](/subprimeloan). Borrowers with fair credit have a score of 580 to 669, while those with poor credit have a score of 579 or less.

## Borrower Considerations

There are a number of stages a borrower can assume to further develop their praise score. Payment history accounts for 35% of a borrower's score. Any [delinquent](/delinquent) payments will negatively impact a credit score and stay on a credit report for a considerable length of time. In this manner, borrowers ought to make payments on time and stay away from delinquencies to work on their scores.

One more approach to rapidly further develop a credit score is to reduce the overall amount owed. Total credit utilization accounts for 30% of a borrower's credit score. A borrower can rapidly further develop their credit score by essentially paying down existing debt balances.

While paying down debt is generally the best method for further developing your credit score, another option is to request an increase to your credit limit with your credit card company. This strategy actually diminishes your credit utilization, which might work on your score. Nonetheless, contingent upon your credit risk profile, your credit card company may not consent to an increase. Assuming an increase is approved it is important to guarantee that the extra credit is utilized dependably, and nullifies the point by deteriorating your credit score.

Different factors impacting credit scores incorporate length of credit history, types of credit utilized, new credit lines issued, and recent credit requests. Borrowers ought to be mindful about the new credit lines they take on and the number of credit accounts they apply for. A high number of [hard inquiries](/hard-request) in a short amount of time can negatively influence a borrower's credit score and increase their perceived risk of default to lenders.

## Lender Considerations

A borrower's credit score is a critical factor impacting the type of credit for which they will be eligible. Traditional [lenders](/lender) generally center around borrowers with great credit. This means they will as a rule consider just borrowers with a credit score of 670 or higher. These borrowers are bound to receive loan endorsements overall.
