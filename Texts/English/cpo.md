# Commodity Pool Operator (CPO)
## What Is a Commodity Pool Operator (CPO)?

A commodity pool operator (CPO) is a money manager or investment fund (called a [commodity pool](/commoditypool)) that supervises investments made in commodities securities, for example, futures and options contracts, or foreign exchange (forex) contracts. The commodity pool operator may likewise go with trading choices or instruct different individuals regarding the commodity pool on possible investments for the pool.

A CPO is like a [commodity trading advisor](/cta) (CTA), yet a CTA is an individual or firm that rather gives individualized counsel with respect to the buying and selling of commodities-related securities.

A commodity pool is a type of investment fund, however federal regulations require those funds that trade in commodities to register with the Commodities Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) as commodity pools. Commodity pools have been subject to extra reporting requirements since the enactment of the [Dodd-Frank Act](/dodd-frank-monetary administrative change bill) in 2010.

A commodity pool trades securities that track the underlying prices of goods like corn or meat or natural resources like gold or oil. The commodity pool operator is the salesperson who tracks down new investors for that fund, or pool.

A principal is a partner in the firm and controls the business interests of the commodity pool. An associated person is an employee who solicits orders and looks for new investors for the commodity pool. In short, the associated person is the salesperson for a commodity pool or a supervisor of its sales team.

Commodity pools benefit investors since they gain access to trades that wouldn't be feasible for an individual investor.
