# Earnings Recast
## What Is an Earnings Recast?

An earnings recast is the act of amending and re-releasing a previously released [earnings](/earnings) statement, with specified intent. Some of the most typical reasons for recasting earnings are to show the impact of a [discontinued](/discontinued-operations) business or to separate out earnings-related events that are deemed to be [non-recurring](/nonrecurring-gain-or-misfortune) or otherwise non-representative of normal business earnings.

Earnings recast is otherwise called an "earnings restatement."

## How an Earnings Recast Works

Earnings, the amount of [profit](/profit) that a company produces during a specific period, are very closely watched by [investors](/investor). These figures drive share prices more than anything more and are a key component of perhaps the most common method to value companies: the [price-to-earnings ratio](/price-earningsratio) (P/E ratio). In short, that means that any changes to earnings are a very big deal.

An earnings recast is generally done to several years of [income statements](/incomestatement), depending on how far back the recasting goes. In theory, restating earnings benefits investors, helping them to get a better [comparative](/comparative-statement) sense of how the company is progressing over time.

## Example of an Earnings Recast

General Electric Co. (GE) announced in February 2018 a restating of its earnings for 2016 and 2017, in compliance with a new [accounting standard](/accounting-standard) issued by the [Financial Accounting Standards Board](/fasb) (FASB). The updated accounting standard, which addressed account [revenue](/revenue) from long-term service contracts, resulted in a 13-cent cut in reported [earnings per share](/eps) (EPS) for 2016 and a cut of 16 cents per share for 2017, according to the company's filing.

GE noted that the new standard affected the timing of [revenue recognition](/revenuerecognition) and the classification between revenues and costs for long-term service contracts, consequently weighing on how much profit it could report. However the revised figures might look disheartening, the industrial [conglomerate's](/conglomerate) [restating](/restatement) of previous earnings actually helped investors out. Updating old numbers to reflect the new rules makes it easier for investors to compare them against all earnings reported from 2018 ahead.

## Special Considerations

Because earnings are an important metric that altogether impacts share prices, companies sometimes manipulate them. However illegal and profoundly unethical, this practice isn't generally so rare as it ought to be.

That means that earnings recasts are not generally the result of changes to a company's business structure or accounting standards. Sometimes, prior earnings are updated because auditors spotted traces of [fraud](/fraud) or incompetence in previous [financial statements](/financial-statements).

Over-reporting a company's gains can be very misleading, prompting investors to believe the company is in a stronger financial position than is actually the case. Earnings recasts made as a result of such behavior understandably have a propensity for seriously denting investor confidence and wiping out share prices.

In the late 1990s, Motorcar Parts of America Inc. (MPAA) was forced to restate its earnings after plainly it was engaging in accounting fraud. The automotive [aftermarket parts](/aftermarket-parts) company's stock took a hammering, while the primary perpetrators, [chief operating officer](/coo) (COO) Richard Marks and [chief financial officer](/cfo) (CFO) Peter Bromberg, were sent to prison.
