# Inverse ETF
## What Is an Inverse ETF?

An inverse ETF is a [exchange traded fund (ETF)](/etf) developed by utilizing different [derivatives](/derivative) to profit from a decline in the value of an underlying benchmark. Investing in inverse ETFs is like holding different short positions, which include borrowing securities and selling them with the hope of repurchasing them at a lower price.

An inverse ETF is otherwise called a "Short ETF" or "Bear ETF."

## Figuring out Inverse ETFs

Numerous inverse ETFs use daily futures contracts to create their returns. A [futures contract](/futurescontract) is a contract to buy or sell an asset or security at a set time and price. Futures permit investors to make a bet on the course of a securities price.

Inverse ETFs' utilization of derivatives — like futures contracts — permits investors to make a bet that the market will decline. Assuming that the market falls, the inverse ETF ascends by generally similar percentage minus fees and commissions from the broker.

Inverse ETFs are not long-term investments since the derivative contracts are bought and sold daily by the fund's manager. Subsequently, it is basically impossible to guarantee that the inverse ETF will match the long-term performance of the index or stocks it is tracking. The incessant trading frequently increments fund expenses and a few inverse ETFs can carry [expense ratios](/expenseratio) of 1% or more.

## Inverse ETFs versus Short Selling

An advantage of inverse ETFs is that they don't need the investor to hold a [margin account](/marginaccount) as would be the case for investors hoping to go into [short positions](/short). A margin account is one where a broker loans money to an investor to trade. Margin is utilized with shorting — an advanced trading activity.

Investors who go into short positions borrow the securities — they don't possess them — so they can sell them to different traders. The goal is to buy the asset back at a lower price and unwind the trade by returning the shares to the margin lender. Nonetheless, there is the risk that the value of the security ascends as opposed to falling and the investor needs to buy back the securities at a higher price than the original margined sale price.

Notwithstanding a margin account, short selling requires a [stock loan fee](/stock-loan-fee) paid to a broker for borrowing the shares important to sell short. Stocks with high [short interest](/shortinterest) may bring about difficulty finding shares to be short, which drives up the cost of short selling. Much of the time, the cost of borrowing shares to short can surpass 3% of the borrowed amount. You can see the reason why unpracticed traders can rapidly get in a tight spot.

On the other hand, inverse ETFs frequently have expense ratios of under 2% and can be purchased by anybody with a brokerage account. Regardless of the expense ratios, it is as yet more straightforward and less costly for an investor to take a position in an inverse ETF than it is to sell stocks short.

## Types of Inverse ETFs

There are several inverse ETFs that can be utilized to profit from declines in broad market indexes, for example, the [Russell 2000](/russell2000) or the [Nasdaq 100](/nasdaq100). Likewise, there are inverse ETFs that emphasis on specific sectors, for example, financials, energy, or consumer staples.

A few investors utilize inverse ETFs to profit from market declines while others use them to [hedge their portfolios](/hedge) against falling prices. For instance, investors who own an ETF that matches the S&P 500 can hedge declines in the S&P by claiming an inverse ETF for the S&P. Be that as it may, hedging has risks too. Assuming the S&P rises, investors would need to sell their inverse ETFs since they'll encounter losses offsetting any gains in their original S&P investment.

Inverse ETFs are short-term trading instruments that must be coordinated impeccably for investors to bring in money. There's a huge risk of losses in the event that investors dispense too much money to inverse ETFs and time their entrances and exits ineffectively.

## Double and Triple Inverse ETFs

A [leveraged ETF](/leveraged-etf) is a fund that utilizes derivatives and debt to amplify the returns of an underlying index. Normally, an ETF's price rises or falls on a coordinated basis compared to the index it tracks. A leveraged ETF is intended to support the returns to 2:1 or 3:1 compared to the index.

Leveraged inverse ETFs utilize similar concept as leveraged products and aim to deliver an amplified return when the market is falling. For instance, in the event that the S&P has declined by 2%, a 2X-leveraged inverse ETF will deliver a 4% return to the investor excluding fees and commissions.

## True Example of an Inverse ETF

ProShares Short S&P 500 (SH) gives inverse exposure to large and fair size companies in the S&P 500. It has an expense ratio of 0.90% and more than $1.77 billion in net assets. The ETF aims to give a one-day trading bet and isn't intended to be held for over one day.

In Feb. 2020, the S&P declined, and subsequently, beginning Feb. 17, 2020, the SH rose from $23.19 to $28.22 by March 23, 2020. On the off chance that investors had been in the SH during those days, they would have realized gains.
