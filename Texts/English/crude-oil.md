## What Is Crude Oil?
Crude oil, or petroleum, is a hydrocarbon formed by the decay of large measures of dead creatures like plants, green growth, and microbes packed under layers of sand and mud north of millions of years. Crude is found underground, coastal, and offshore between layers of sand and mud that have solidified into residue.
The liquid can be separated in different ways. The traditional method is by drilling and capping the flow with a wellhead. Another (frequently questionable) method is fracking â€” venturing into areas on a level plane where drilling would be hard to access. This cycle includes pumping high-constrained freshwater, sand, and synthetics into the silt to release bits of crude oil and afterward removing the combination for over-the-ground processing.
Like natural gas and coal, crude is a non-renewable petroleum derivative that releases carbon dioxide into the air when lighted by fire and is a source of concern with regards to climate change.
Crude oil is split into two categories in view of its sulfur content: sweet and sour. It is likewise broken down into two categories in view of density: light and heavy. Crude with lower sulfuric substance would be classified as sweet and bring a price higher than sour since low sulfuric substance makes refining and processing the crude into petroleum products, like gasoline and diesel, simpler. The ideal crude combination is light sweet, which is normally the type utilized for West Texas Intermediate (WTI), the American oil quality benchmark, and Brent, a benchmark widely utilized in Europe.
One more differentiation for crude oil is known as total corrosive number (TAN): The higher the sharpness, the more grounded the metal lines required at treatment facilities for processing to reduce erosion.
## Which Countries Have the Most Oil?
The largest petroleum reserves can be found in Venezuela, Saudi Arabia, Canada, Iran, Iraq, and Russia. A few countries with the largest reserves are part of a league known as the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries that controls very nearly 80 percent of the world's proven oil reserves. Together, the group of 13 nations seeks to regulate crude oil production (and subsequently pricing), and their influence has international effects, particularly in countries like the U.S. what's more, China that have high oil demand.

Proven Oil Reserves for OPEC's 13 Members and the U.S. (a great many barrels)OPEC (2020), EIA (2019)

## What Products Can Be Derived From a Barrel of Crude Oil?
A 42-gallon barrel regularly yields 45 gallons of petroleum products, including gasoline, diesel, stream fuel, heavy fuel oil, and liquefied petroleum gas. Different products and distillates can be utilized as feedstock in the manufacturing of plastics or different industrial synthetics like black-top and greasing up oil.

Which specific petroleum products crude oil gets refined into relies upon demand. In the U.S., gasoline demand is higher than in different countries where diesel is higher in demand and is created more. Heavy crude oil would create smaller amounts of gasoline and diesel and is better appropriate for products like black-top.
