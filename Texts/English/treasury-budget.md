# U.S. Treasury Budget
## What Is the U.S. Treasury Budget?

The U.S. Treasury Budget is a monthly statement that sums up the total receipts and expenditures of the federal government. Authoritatively known as the Monthly Treasury Statement, it additionally uncovers the monthly overflows or deficits in federal spending. In the event that there is a deficit it indicates the means of financing it.

As a practical matter, experts in the bond market watch the statement to perceive how the government plans to finance its debt in the short term and, therefore, what mix of [Treasury bonds](/treasurybond) (T-bonds) and Treasury notes (T-notes) will be issued to collect the money. The monthly fluctuations in the budget statement are watched by economists as an indicator of current government spending trends and the conceivable direction of monetary policy.

## Understanding the U.S. Treasury Budget

The U.S. Treasury budget fills in as a running tally of government spending and borrowing. It is an essential tool for the federal government on the grounds that any changes in the budget balance might require changes in federal policy on spending and [taxation](/taxation).

The monthly budget data affects the financial markets, both directly and indirectly. Treasury securities are the most directly impacted by the monthly statement, particularly when the monthly budget shows a higher deficit.

The [deficit](/deficit) in the monthly budget directly correlates to the number of T-notes and T-bonds the U.S. government necessities to sell to finance the operation of the federal government. As the deficit increases, more T-notes and T-bonds are sold to fund its operations.

### Supply and Demand

Assuming demand stays constant and the supply of Treasury securities increases, the [market value](/marketvalue) of these financial instruments goes down. The opposite happens on the off chance that the deficit declines or is eliminated. Less Treasury securities will be accessible on the grounds that there is no debt to fund.

> The 10-year T-note is often utilized as a benchmark for calculating [mortgage rates](/mortgage-rate).

Following the [law of supply and demand](/law-of-supply-demand), the quantity of a particular product that is accessible causes an inverse pressure on its price. During times of high federal debt, greater government securities are offered and their prices will drop.

Lower prices in bonds and notes equate to higher [yields](/yield) for the investor. Higher yields in the market mean the government must issue Treasury securities at higher [interest rates](/interestrate).

At the point when the rates on these least unsafe investments increase, the effect is felt across all debt markets. A higher interest rate environment is conceived.

### Tools of the Treasury

The [federally guaranteed obligations](/federally-guaranteed-obligation) which the U.S. Treasury utilizations to balance the budget come in different forms, each with varying [maturities](/maturity), interest rates, coupons, and yields. All are backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. government.

T-bonds have the longest maturities of all government-issued securities and are offered to investors with 20-or 30-year terms. T-bond investors receive interest payments like clockwork.

T-notes have a shorter maturity than T-bonds and have two-, three-five-, seven-or 10-year maturity dates. The shorter maturity notes offer lower interest rates than T-bonds.

[Treasury bills](/treasurybill) (T-bills) have set term lengths of 4, 8, 13, 26, or 52 weeks. They offer the lowest yield of the three bond types but are auctioned off to investors at a discount. No interest is paid but the investor trades them out at maturity for the higher face price.
