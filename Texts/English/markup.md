# Markup
## What Is a Markup?

A markup is the difference between an investment's most reduced current [offering price](/offeringprice) among broker-dealers and the price charged to the customer for said investment. Markups happen when brokers act as principals, buying and selling securities from their own accounts notwithstanding the obvious danger as opposed to getting a fee for facilitating a transaction. Most dealers are brokers, and vice versa, thus the term [broker-dealer](/broker-dealer) is common.

Markups likewise show up in retail settings, where retailers mark-up the selling price of merchandise by a certain amount or percentage to earn a profit. A pricing method by which a retailer lays out a selling price by adding a markup to total variable costs is called the [variable cost-plus pricing](/variable-cost-plus-pricing) method.

## Grasping Markups

Markups happen when certain marketable securities are free for purchase by retail investors from dealers who sell the securities straightforwardly from their own accounts. The dealer's just compensation comes as the markup, the difference between the security's purchase price and the price the dealer charges to the retail investor. The dealer accepts some risk as the market price of the security could drop before being sold to investors.

In business, the markup is the [price spread](/spread) between the cost to deliver a decent or service and its selling price.

They will express the markup as either a fixed amount or a percentage over the cost.

## Markups versus Markdowns

A [markdown](/markdown), then again, happens when a broker purchases a security from a customer at a price lower than its market value. Markdowns likewise happen when a dealer charges a customer a lower price for a security than the current bid price among dealers. Dealers could offer lower prices to customers to animate extra buying, which will offset their initial losses by earning them extra commissions.

For retailers, a price markdown is a conscious reduction in the selling price of a decent. There are several justifications for why a retailer might choose to markdown its goods. For [seasonal merchandise](/seasonality), the retailer might be anxious to clear the racks of old merchandise to account for the next season's goods. They might cut prices to do as such, even on the off chance that it means they write off the sale. A few manufacturers might emerge with new models of products every year or like clockwork, in which case they will offer markdowns on more seasoned products as opposed to risk being left with [obsolete inventory](/obsoleteinventory).

## Benefits of Markups

Markups are a real way for broker-dealers to create a gain on the sale of securities. Securities, for example, bonds, bought or sold on the market are offered with a spread. The spread is determined by the bid price, what somebody will pay for the bonds, and the ask price, which is the thing somebody will acknowledge for the bonds.

At the point when a dealer acts a principal in the transaction, he can mark up the bid price, which makes a more extensive [bid-ask spread](/bid-askspread). The difference between the market spread and the dealer's marked-up spread is the profit.

The dealer is simply required to unveil the [transaction fee](/transaction-fees), which is ordinarily a nominal cost. In doing as such, the buyer isn't conscious of the dealer's original transaction or the markup. According to the buyer's point of view, the main cost for the bond purchase is the small transaction fee. Ought to bond buyers try to quickly sell the bonds on the open market, they would need to make up the dealer's markup on the spread or cause a loss. The [lack of transparency](/transparency) puts the burden on the bond buyers to determine whether they are getting a fair deal.

Dealers rival each other by diminishing the amount of their markups. It is workable for bond buyers to compare the price the dealer paid for the bond with its actual price.
