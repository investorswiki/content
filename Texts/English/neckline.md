# Neckline
## What Is a Neckline?

The neckline is a level of [support](/support) or [resistance](/resistance) found on a [head and shoulders](/head-shoulders) pattern that is utilized by traders to decide strategic areas to place orders. A neckline interfaces the [swing lows](/swinglow) (which happen following the initial two pinnacles) of the head and shoulders beating pattern. A move below the neckline flags a breakout of the pattern and shows that a reversal to the downside of the prior uptrend is in progress.

On account of a head and shoulders lining pattern, called a [inverse head and shoulders](/inverseheadandshoulders), the neckline interfaces the two [swing highs](/swinghigh) of the pattern and reaches out to the right. At the point when the price transcends the neckline it flags a breakout of the pattern and a reversal to the upside of the prior downtrend.

## What Does a Neckline Tell You?

The neckline is the part of the head and shoulders chart pattern that interfaces the two reaction lows (besting pattern) or highs (lining pattern) to form an area of support or resistance. The head and shoulders chart pattern is usually used to foresee bullish or bearish [reversals](/reversal).

At the point when the price breaks below the neckline of a garnish pattern it means the prior uptrend is logical over, and a downtrend is in progress. At the point when the price breaks over the neckline of an inverse pattern it means the prior downtrend is reasonable over, and an uptrend is in progress.

The neckline is a straight line that interfaces the lows (top) or highs (inverse) and is extended out to the right. After the head and shoulders form their third pinnacle (top), on the off chance that the price drops below the neckline, the pattern is viewed as complete and a further downside move is expected.

The neckline's slant may at times should be drawn at a point, as opposed to horizontal. This is on the grounds that the reaction lows or highs may not generally be equivalent, and thusly, the line will take on a slant while interfacing them. In the event that the neckline is seriously slanted higher or lower, it is less valuable for trading and scientific purposes.

Frequently, the head and shoulders pattern is utilized related to different forms of technical analysis that act as confirmation, including other chart patterns or technical indicators. For instance, if the [relative strength index](/rsi) (RSI) or [moving average convergence divergence](/macd) (MACD) indicator was showing [bearish divergence](/divergence) heading into the head and shoulders pattern, a few traders would see that as added confirmation that the price is bound to head lower after the downside neckline breakout.

## Head and Shoulders Pattern

A head and shoulders pattern form after an uptrend and is made out of a pinnacle, a [retracement](/retracement), a higher second pinnacle, a retracement, a lower third pinnacle, and a drop below the neckline.

A few traders enter [short](/short) or exit [long positions](/long) when the price drops below the neckline. For those entering short, a [stop loss](/stop-lossorder) is much of the time placed over a recent swing high or over the high of the third pinnacle.

The estimated downside move for the head and shoulders is the level of the pattern — which is the difference between the prices of the second top to the lowest low of the two retracements — deducted from the neckline breakout point. This is called the [price target](/pricetarget). There are no guarantees the price will arrive at that level, or that it will stop falling at that level. It is just an estimate.

Similar concepts apply to an inverse head and shoulders, besides in reverse. The pattern forms after a [downtrend](/downtrend) and is made out of a low, a move higher, a lower low, a move up, a third higher low, and afterward a rally over the neckline.

A few traders enter long positions or exit short positions when the price transcends the neckline. For those entering longs, a stop loss is in many cases placed below a recent swing low or below the low of the third low.
