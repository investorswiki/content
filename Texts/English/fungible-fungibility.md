## What Is Fungibility? What Makes an Asset Fungible?
Fungibility is the property of being exchangeable for different assets of a similar kind with practically no change in value or ease of use. For example, a U.S. dollar is fungible, on the grounds that, at a given point in time, you could exchange any one dollar for some other, and your new dollar would have a similar value and convenience as the one you traded.
Of course, the U.S. dollar **does** change in value after some time relative to different currencies, however it is as yet fungible on the grounds that — **at any one point in time** — all U.S. dollars are worth a similar amount. In other words that all U.S. dollars change in value in group as a cash — not exclusively as single dollars.

## What Makes an Asset Non-Fungible?
At the point when an asset isn't fungible, it for the most part has to do with condition or unique qualities. Not at all like a dollar, which is worth a similar amount whether it's fresh and new or old and crumpled, two Toyota 4Runners of a similar variety and year could be with stunningly various amounts in light of their wear and condition.
Likewise, two jewel cut sapphires — regardless of whether they're a similar variety and size and come from a similar mine — might be worth various amounts in light of moment differences in quality, clearness, and considerations. The equivalent goes for most collectibles — two first-version duplicates of **The Amazing Spider-Man #1** may evaluate at various values due to their condition and the degree to which tone has blurred from the covers.
Put just, when something is non-fungible, it is unique or exceptional. There might be other comparative products or assets, yet every one has its own particular elements and characteristics, particularly in terms of quality.
## What Are Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs)?
NFTs, or non-fungible tokens, are — at their center — strings of data stored on a blockchain that imply ownership of a digital asset of some kind. Along these lines, they function similar to certificates of credibility for digital collectibles.
**Note:** A blockchain is an unalterable, publicly noticeable ledger that stores data about digital transactions.
Any digital file can be "stamped" as a NFT and afterward sold and traded. For example, an artist could make a NFT connoting ownership of an original piece of digital art, then, at that point, sell it to a fan or collector. While anybody with a computer could download the digital art piece to appreciate, just the collector who purchased it could resell it, as their proof of ownership is embedded in the blockchain.
Visual art is the most common type of asset traded as NFTs, however music, recordings, and different assets can be stamped into NFTs also. An assortment of digital art by notable illustrator and visual fashioner Beeple sold for $69 million in March of 2021.
