# Support Test
## What Is the Support Test?

The support test is one of five tests that must be passed to claim another person as a dependent for legal and tax purposes. The support test orders that the taxpayer must have given the greater part of the prospective dependent's everyday costs during the year.

Everyday costs incorporate feasts, lodging, dress, medical and dental care, transportation, sporting activities, and whatever else that a parent would regularly accommodate a child or other dependent. There are, be that as it may, special rules with respect to numerous support agreements and for children of separated or isolated parents.

## Understanding the Support Test

A dependent is a qualifying person who qualifies a taxpayer for claim dependent-related tax benefits on a tax return. Tests in the [Internal Revenue Code](/internal-revenue-code) (IRC) lay out a person's qualification to be a taxpayer's dependent for dependency claims.

The Support Test is closely connected with the Relationship and Residence Tests, yet the prospective dependent doesn't need to live with the taxpayer to breeze through this assessment. The Support Test is maybe the most direct measure of whether a taxpayer ought to have the option to claim somebody as a dependent. All things considered, on the off chance that the person isn't monetarily dependent upon the taxpayer, why should the taxpayer have the option to claim their as a dependent?

The potential dependent being referred to might be a qualifying child or a qualifying relative and individuals must consider the support test each tax year for which they wish to claim a dependency exemption.

## Support test rules

The Support Test estimations are quite certain, and must comply with the accompanying rules:

- The amount of support for lodging costs considers the fair rental value of the lodging, including a reasonable allowance for the utilization of machines, utilities, and furniture.
- The cost for bulk purchases bought for a whole family unit, for example, food, must be partitioned by the number of total household individuals, to accomplish an accurate figure spent on the possible dependent.
- The residential property gave to house a potential-dependent must be measured by its fair market value.

Certain apparatuses and electronic things might be viewed as expenses, contingent upon their utilization. In the event that you buy a child a $200 sound system as a birthday present, which is fundamentally delighted in inside the bounds of his room, you might incorporate this as a support cost. However, a $500 flat screen TV positioned in the entertainment room, to be delighted in by the whole family, may not be incorporated as a support cost, for that equivalent child. Different things that are not viewed as support costs incorporate life insurance premiums, instructive assistance, and money stopped in a bank account, that isn't decisively spent.

Individuals who choose for utilize a fiscal year to report their income must incorporate the support paid during the calendar year in which your fiscal year started.
