# Hawkish versus Dovish
## What's the significance here in Finance?
The financial world has come to associate the hawk with aggressive monetary policy that favors higher[ interest rates](/interestrate) to curb[ inflation](/inflation). A hawkish[ Federal Reserve](/federal-reserve) pursues policy choices that endeavor to reduce rising prices, keep up with solid levels of employment, and in this way avoid[ recession](/recession).
At the point when a hawk has something in its sightline, it seems to zero in exclusively on its prey; to expand the representation, a few pundits accept when the Fed lasers in on fighting inflation, it might miss the outcomes its activities have on the more extensive economy, for example, slowing the housing market or[ GDP](/gdp) growth.
## What Is Hawkish Monetary Policy? What Are Some Examples?
Hawkish monetary policy, otherwise called tight monetary policy, is put into practice when a central bank like the Federal Reserve wishes to contract[ financial liquidity](/liquidity). It does this in more than one way:
1. At its[ FOMC meeting](/fomc-policy-proclamation), the Fed can increase the[ Fed Funds rate](/federalfundsrate), which is a target rate of interest that banks charge each other for overnight loans. Banks, thusly, charge interest to their clients — this rate is known as the prime rate — thus any increase in the Fed Funds rate prompts a comparing rise in short-and long-term interest rates.
1. The Fed can likewise reduce the number of[ Treasuries](/depository securities) and[ mortgage-backed securities](/cmbs) it possesses through[ quantitative tightening](/quantitative-tightening) measures. As its name suggests, this practice tightens the Fed's balance sheets and assists with accomplishing its target inflation rate of 2%.

How could the Fed have to tighten liquidity? One illustration of hawkish monetary policy occurred in 1980, when the Fed Funds rate hit a shocking 20%. Federal Reserve Chair Paul Volcker took an extreme position to combat the high as can be inflation, known as [stagflation](/stagflation), which had originated from an oil embargo during the 1970s.
This embargo made oil prices rise from $3 to $12 a barrel and had other negative economic results, including increased food and transportation costs, and higher union wages. The main path out of a years-long recession was through high interest rates.
## What's the significance here in Finance?
Dovish (or accommodative) policy, is something contrary to hawkish and favors expansionary monetary policy to accomplish maximum levels of employment. The Fed does this by lowering the Fed Funds rate. This meaningfully affects the economy, making it simpler for homebuyers to get a mortgage, consumers to purchase things on credit, and organizations to get loans to hire more workers or increase production, and so on.
The Fed strolls a fine line when it makes changes to the Fed Funds rate; when interest rates are too high, economic growth contracts, payrolls shrink, and unemployment rises. Then again, assuming interest rates are too low, deficiencies can happen, and inflation can increase. The command of the Federal Reserve is to keep a sound economy through stable prices and maximum employment, and to do as such, it must set interest rates at the right level with impeccable timing.

Dovish monetary policy leans toward an "pain free income" environment, when the Fed Funds rate is cut, which makes it simpler for organizations and consumers to acquire loans. [Quantitative easing](/quantitative-easing) is practiced in dovish times. Consumers spend more, and the economy extends.
After the 2007-2008 Financial Crisis, which originated from the collapse of U.S. [mortgage-backed securities](/cmbs) and affected global markets, the Fed sliced interest rates from 4.5% toward the finish of 2007 to between 0.0% to 0.25% toward the finish of 2008. Furthermore, somewhere in the range of 2008 and 2014, the Fed likewise started a series of trillions of dollars worth of quantitative easing measures to increase financial liquidity and empower lending. During this period, the United States entered 10 years long[ bull market](/bullmarket).
## Is the Fed Hawkish or Dovish?
