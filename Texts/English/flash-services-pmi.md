The PMI series comprises of month to month economic surveys of carefully chosen companies. They track variables like output, new orders, employment and prices across key sectors. The headline index from the surveys is a weighted combination of survey variables intended to give an overall perspective on underlying usiness trends.

For instance, a great deal of exertion was required by national European statistics offices to get a steady measure of Eurozone GDP.
