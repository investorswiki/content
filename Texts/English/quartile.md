## What Is a Quartile?

A quartile is a [statistical](/statistics) term that portrays a division of perceptions into four defined stretches in light of the values of the data and how they compare to the whole set of perceptions.

## Grasping Quartiles

To comprehend the quartile, it is important to comprehend the [median](/median) as a [measure of central tendency](/descriptive_statistics). The median in statistics is the middle value of a set of numbers. It is the place where precisely half of the data lies below or more the central value.

In this way, given a set of 13 numbers that are arranged (ascending or descending), the median would be the seventh number. The six numbers going before this value are the least numbers in the data, and the six numbers after the median are the highest numbers in the dataset given. Since the median isn't impacted by extreme values or exceptions in the distribution, it is some of the time preferred to the [mean](/mean).

The median is a robust assessor of location doesn't yet express anything about how the data on one or the other side of its value is spread or scattered. That is where the quartile steps in. The quartile measures the spread of values above and below the mean by separating the distribution into four groups.

## How Quartiles Work

Very much like the median partitions the data into half so that half of the measurement lies below the median and half lies above it, the quartile breaks down the data into quarters so that 25% of the measurements are not exactly the lower quartile, half are not exactly the median, and 75% are not exactly the upper quartile.

A quartile isolates data into three points — a lower quartile, median, and upper quartile — to form four groups of the dataset. The lower quartile, or first quartile, is denoted as Q1 and is the middle number that falls between the littlest value of the dataset and the median. The subsequent quartile, Q2, is likewise the median. The upper or third quartile, denoted as Q3, is the central point that lies between the median and the highest number of the distribution.

Presently, we can outline the four groups formed from the quartiles. The primary group of values contains the most modest number up to Q1; the subsequent group incorporates Q1 to the median; the third set is the median to Q3; the fourth category involves Q3 to the highest data point of the whole set.

Every quartile contains 25% of the total perceptions. Generally, the data is organized from littlest to largest:

1. **First quartile**: the most minimal 25% of numbers
1. **Second quartile**: somewhere in the range of 0% and half (up to the median)
1. **Third quartile**: 0% to 75%
1. **Fourth quartile**: the highest 25% of numbers

## Illustration of Quartile

Assume the distribution of math scores in a class of 19 understudies in ascending order is:

- 59, 60, 65, 65, 68, 69, 70, 72, 75, 75, 76, 77, 81, 82, 84, 87, 90, 95, 98

To start with, mark down the median, Q2, which in this case is the 10^th^ value: 75.

Q1 is the central point between the littlest score and the median. In this case, Q1 falls between the first and fifth score: 68. (Note that the median can likewise be incorporated while ascertaining Q1 or Q3 for an odd set of values. If we somehow managed to remember the median for one or the other side of the middle point, then Q1 will be the middle value between the first and 10^th^ score, which is the average of the fifth and 6th score — (fifth + 6th)/2 = (68 + 69)/2 = 68.5).

Q3 is the middle value among Q2 and the highest score: 84. (Or on the other hand on the off chance that you incorporate the median, Q3 = (82 + 84)/2 = 83).

Since we have our quartiles, how about we decipher their numbers. A score of 68 (Q1) addresses the main quartile and is the 25^th^ percentile. 68 is the median of the lower half of the score set in the accessible data — that is, the median of the scores from 59 to 75.

Q1 lets us know that 25% of the scores are under 68 and 75% of the class scores are greater. Q2 (the median) is the 50^th^ percentile and shows that half of the scores are under 75, and half of the scores are over 75. At long last, Q3, the 75^th^ percentile, uncovers that 25% of the scores are greater and 75% are under 84.

## Special Considerations

If the datapoint for Q1 is farther away from the median than Q3 is from the median, then we can express that there is a greater dispersion among the more modest values of the dataset than among the larger values. A similar logic applies in the event that Q3 is farther away from Q2 than Q1 is from the median.

On the other hand, assuming there is an even number of data points, the median will be the average of the middle two numbers. In our model above, assuming we had 20 understudies rather than 19, the median of their scores will be the [arithmetic average](/arithmeticmean) of the 10^th^ and 11^th^ numbers.

Quartiles are utilized to compute the interquartile range, which is a measure of variability around the median. The interquartile range is just calculated as the difference between the first and third quartile: Q3-Q1. In effect, it is the scope of the middle half of the data that shows how spread out the data is.

For large datasets, Microsoft Excel has a QUARTILE function to compute quartiles.

## Features
- A quartile isolates data into three points — a lower quartile, median, and upper quartile — to form four groups of the dataset.
- The quartile measures the spread of values above and below the mean by separating the distribution into four groups.
- Quartiles are utilized to compute the interquartile range, which is a measure of variability around the median.
