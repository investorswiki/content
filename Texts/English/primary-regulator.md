# Primary Regulator
## What Is a Primary Regulator?

A primary regulator is a state or federal regulatory agency entrusted with being the fundamental overseeing entity of a [financial institution](/financialinstitution). Generally speaking, this is the very agency that issued the initial charter permitting the financial institution to operate.

Banks and other financial institutions must file quarterly [call reports](/callreport) that show their income and overall condition to their primary regulatory authority.

## Figuring out a Primary Regulator

For national banks, the primary regulator is the [Office of the Comptroller of the Currency](/office-comptroller-currency-occ) (OCC). State-chartered banks and bank holding companies, in the mean time, initially report to the [Federal Reserve Board](/frb) (FRB), while state banks reply to the banking departments of their particular states.

### Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC)

The OCC charters, manages, and administers every single national bank and federal savings associations, as well as federal branches and agencies of foreign banks. The OCC is an independent bureau of the U.S. Department of the Treasury.

### Credit Unions

The [National Credit Union Administration](/ncua) (NCUA) oversees and guarantees federal [credit unions](/creditunion) and all state-chartered credit unions.

### State-Chartered Banks

Two federal agencies share responsibility for state banks. The [Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation](/fdic) (FDIC) protects state-chartered banks that are not individuals from the [Federal Reserve System](/federalreservebank) (FRS), as well as deposits in banks and savings associations.

For state-chartered banks that are individuals from the FRS, in the mean time, the FRB is the primary regulator. Furthermore, state-chartered banks are administered by state banking regulators.

## Special Considerations

The OCC is by a wide margin the greatest primary regulator and is responsible for the biggest number of institutions. The OCC notes that it has the power to analyze the national banks and federal [thrifts](/thrift). It can support or deny applications for new [charters](/corporatecharter), branches, capital, or different changes in corporate or banking structures. It can likewise make supervisory moves against national banks and federal thrifts that don't consent to laws and regulations or that in any case take part in shaky practices.

The OCC can eliminate officers and directors, arrange agreements to change banking practices, and issue [cease and desist orders](/cease-and-desist) as well as civil money punishments. In addition, it can issue rules and regulations, legal translations, and corporate choices overseeing investments, lending, and different practices.

The [Office of Thrift Supervision](/ots) (OTS) was converged with the OCC, the FDIC, the Federal Reserve Board of Governors, and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) in July 2011 to make one regulatory agency. Already, the OCC managed all federally chartered and state-chartered savings banks and savings and loan associations (S&Ls).
