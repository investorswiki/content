## What is Putable Common Stock?

Putable common stock will be stock that gives investors the option to sell (or "put") the stock back to the company at a foreordained price.

## Grasping Putable Common Stock

With putable [common stock](/commonstock), investors have the option of selling their shares back to the issuer at a foreordained price. Commonly, this price is moderately low, so the [put option](/putoption) acts simply as a type of insurance in the event the price falls essentially. Investors will frequently sell when the stock price falls below the foreordained price. The put option makes the stock more appealing to investors, facilitating the raising of capital by the responsible company.

Putable common stock was imagined in 1984 by Drexel Burnham Lambert, an investment banking firm, for the public offering of its client Arley Merchandise Corporation. Notwithstanding, the [Securities and Exchange Commission](/sec) mediated and advised Arley to treat the European style puts as debt on its balance sheet. Drexel resolved this problem in a subsequent client case including Gearheart Industries. In this case, it made the offering redeemable in cash, debt, preferred stock, or common stock.

Putable common stock is commonly used to take care of the underpricing problem in [initial public offerings](/ipo). On the off chance that the price of a stock falls below a certain guaranteed value guaranteed by the issuer, then, at that point, the investor is assigned more stock. In the event that the stock transcends the guaranteed value, nothing occurs. In that respect, putable stock look like [convertible bonds](/convertiblebond) as opposed to equity, yet are classified as the last option on a company's balance sheet.

Companies may likewise issue callable common stock, which allows them to buy back stock at a foreordained price. This allows the company to really budget for buybacks more.

During that period, the price of shares would fall quickly close to the date of put expiration. Owners of putable common stock would receive new shares to make up the losses and guarantee a steady foreordained value to their holdings, while company founders would need to sell their shares to compensate for the losses.
