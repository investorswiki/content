## What Is a Voluntary Lien?

A voluntary lien is a claim that one person has over the property of one more as security for the payment of a debt. Liens are connected to the property and not to a person. A voluntary [lien](/lien) is contractual or consensual, implying that the lien is made by an action taken by the debtor, for example, a mortgage loan to buy real estate.

## Figuring out Voluntary Lien

A voluntary lien is a type of lien that exists as a result of an action taken by a [debtor](/debtor). This is something contrary to an involuntary lien that happens by law, for example, a tax or special assessment lien that is forced by a regulatory authority. Normally the holder of property can't legally sell the property while a lien is in place. The lien ought to mirror the real value of the property being referred to that is being utilized as collateral. Should there be a default on the debt, the lien holder can claim the property â€” for instance, through foreclosure procedures in real estate or through a repossession of vehicles.

## Various Ways Voluntary Liens Are Applied

Also, [mortgages](/mortgage) for real estate, voluntary liens become possibly the most important factor with financing for different transactions, like loans for cars. Generally the physical property acts as collateral under the lien; be that as it may, there are models where a voluntary lien is applied to business loans, personal loans with collateral other than cars or homes, credit agreements, and even lease to-possess machines.

The idea of the lien may be structured to be placed on some different option from property that is obtained through the loan that was taken out. All things considered, some kind of property that is now owned is put as collateral for a credit extension or cash advance that will be utilized for different purposes.

For example, a lien could be put on an important painting that is put up as collateral for a cash advance to fund another purchase. A homeowner who has proactively paid off a mortgage could require more cash close by and look for a home equity credit extension. Just similarly as with a mortgage, the house would act as collateral with the lien holder getting an interest. Besides, a business could have a voluntary lien on it if the business owner takes out a credit extension to cover different operational costs and tasks. In this case, they wouldn't claim the business. All things being equal, they would receive a security interest in it.
