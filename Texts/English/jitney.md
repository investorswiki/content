Different practices which the firms now and again participate in incorporate buying and selling thinly traded securities, for example, penny stocks, more than once buying and selling their shares between each other at always expanding prices. Assuming the liquidity in the stock is adequately small, other market participants may be tricked into accepting that the rising price of the shares addresses genuine market interest, consequently drawing in outside buyers. XYZ and ABC will then, at that point, sell their shares to these new buyers, taking a gain.

In different occurrences, the two firms will execute a comparable scheme however in the reverse direction. Rather than executing at consistently expanding prices, they will do as such at steadily diminishing prices. The goal in this transaction is scare different owners of the security into selling their shares, offering XYZ and ABC the chance to buy a large number of shares at a falsely low price.

These supposed "jitney game" practices amount to market manipulation, and they are disallowed under United States laws and regulations.
