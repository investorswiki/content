# Outright Forward
## What is an Outright Forward?

An outright forward, or currency forward, is a currency contract that locks in the [exchange rate ](/exchangerate)and a [delivery date](/deliverydate) past the [spot value date](/spot-date). It is the most straightforward type of foreign exchange [forward contract](/forwardcontract) and safeguards an investor, importer or exporter from exchange rate changes.

## Seeing Outright Forwards

An outright forward contract characterizes the terms, rate and delivery date, of the exchange of one currency for another. Companies that buy, sell or borrow from foreign businesses can utilize outright forward contracts to moderate their exchange rate risk by locking in a rate that they consider to be positive.

For instance, an American company that buys materials from a French provider might be required to give payment to half of the total value of the [Euro](/euro) payment now and the other half in six months. The primary payment can be paid for with a [spot trade](/spottrade), yet to reduce [currency risk](/currencyrisk) from the conceivable appreciation of the Euro versus the [U.S. dollar](/usd-US dollar), the American company can lock in the exchange rate with an outright forward purchase of Euros.

The price of an outright forward is derived from the spot rate plus or minus the forward points calculated from the interest rate differential. A point to note is that the [forward rate](/forwardrate) is certainly not a forecast of where the spot rate will be on the forward date. A currency that is more costly to purchase for a forward date than for spot date is viewed as trading at a forward premium while one that is less expensive is supposed to exchange at a forward discount.

The spot [foreign exchange market](/foreign-exchange-markets) generally gets comfortable two business days with the exception of the [USD/CAD](/usd-cad-us-dollar-canadian-dollar-currency-pair), which chooses the next business day. Any contract that has a delivery date that is longer than the spot date is named a forward contract. Most currency forward contracts are for under 12 months, yet longer contracts are conceivable in the most liquid currency pairs. [Foreign exchange](/foreign-exchange) forward contracts can likewise be utilized to estimate in the currency market.

## Settlement

An outright forward is a firm commitment to take delivery of the currency that was purchased and make delivery of the currency that was sold. The counterparties must give each other guidelines concerning the specific accounts where they take delivery of currencies.

An outright forward can be closed out by going into another contract to do the contrary which can bring about either a gain or loss versus the original deal, contingent upon market developments. If the nearby out is finished with the equivalent counterparty as the original contract, the currency amounts are typically gotten under an International Swap Dealers Association agreement. This reduces the settlement risk and the amount of money that requirements to change hands.
