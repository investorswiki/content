# Self-Employed Contributions Act (SECA) Tax
## What Is the Self-Employed Contributions Act (SECA) Tax?

The Self-Employed Contributions Act (SECA) tax is a levy from the U.S. government on the individuals who work independently, as opposed to for an outside company. It requires self-employed workers to contribute tax equivalent to both the employer and employee portions of the [Federal Insurance Contributions Act](/fica) (FICA) tax, which funds Social Security and Medicare.

## Understanding the Self-Employed Contributions Act (SECA) Tax

SECA taxes are registered on the basis of net earnings, defined as the gross income derived from business activities, minus the expenses incurred in the course of carrying on with work.

[Social Security tax](/social-security-tax) is assessed at a fundamental rate of 6.2% for an employer and 6.2% for the employee. Self-employed taxpayers subject to SECA are taxed at 12.4% (6.2% + 6.2%), as they are viewed as both employer and employee.

There are limits, nonetheless, on how much income is subject to this percentage. For 2021, the Social Security tax is simply applied to the first $142,800 of earnings. In 2022, the tax will be applied to the first $147,000 of earnings. Any income over that level isn't subject to Social Security tax.

> Except if there is a specific agreement in place between countries, exiles (Americans who live and work abroad) are as yet expected to pay SECA taxes on earnings that are acquired during the time spent being self-employed.

The Medicare tax rate is 2.9% (1.45% for employers plus 1.45% for employees), and there is no exemption over a certain income. Total SECA tax is, along these lines, 15.3%.

Big league salary earners face an extra SECA levy. Because of the Affordable Care Act (ACA), individuals with a net income above $200,000 ($250,000 for married couples filing jointly) will be subject to an extra 0.9% Medicare tax.

## Deducting the Self-Employed Contributions Act (SECA) Tax

The employer portion of the payment is [deductible](/tax-deduction) as a business expense. As such, the IRS permits self-employed individuals to utilize the employer half of the self-employment tax as a business deduction for reasons for computing the taxpayer's income tax. This considers that the efforts of running a company are taken on by an individual, instead of an "employer," which would be the case for an employee of a company.

It is important to note that self-employment taxes allude to Social Security and Medicare taxes, like FICA taxes paid by an employer. At the point when a taxpayer takes a deduction of one-half of the SECA tax, it is just a deduction for the calculation of that taxpayer's income tax. It doesn't reduce the net earnings from self-employment or reduce the self-employment tax itself.

## Paying the Self-Employed Contributions Act (SECA) Tax

Since taxpayers who are self-employed aren't subject to [withholding tax](/withholdingtax), the IRS requires SECA tax to be remembered for quarterly [estimated payments](/estimated-tax) of income taxes. If self-employed net earnings are under $400 (or $108.28 from a congregation or other qualified church-controlled organization exempt from employer Social Security and Medicare taxes), no SECA tax is due, and it isn't required to be listed on a tax return; be that as it may, if self-employed net earnings are over this base, SECA tax must be paid on the whole amount, including the amount under the base.
