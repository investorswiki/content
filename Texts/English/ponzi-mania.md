# Ponzi Mania
## What Was Ponzi Mania?

Ponzi mania depicted the market air after the apparently sudden recognition of [Ponzi schemes](/ponzischeme) that followed the capture of [Bernard Madoff](/bernard-madoff) for operating an unlawful operation. Ponzi mania took full force in December of 2008 when federal specialists found that Bernard Madoff had worked a gigantic Ponzi scheme over the prior decade, defrauding investors of almost $65 billion.

## Grasping Ponzi Mania

In the wake of Madoff's capture, the [Securities and Exchange Commission](/sec) and other federal specialists put their complete efforts into finding and closing down unlawful Ponzi schemes that were responsible for billions of dollars worth of losses to investors. Following the immense losses recognized by Bernard Madoff's investors, individual investors across the world turned out to be considerably more conscious of the indications of likely Ponzi and pyramid schemes, bringing about Ponzi mania.

In hindsight, the mania-like mind-set in the wake of the Madoff scandal ought to have been anticipated as it's a typical element to the market's [boom and bust cycle](/boom-and-bust-cycle). The idea of 'mania' traces all the way back to the absolute previously recorded speculative [bubble](/bubble): For example, the [Tulip mania](/tulipmania) of 1637. During the Dutch Golden Age, contract prices for new and chic tulip bulbs passed unfathomable levels before falling as individuals arrived at their faculties. Since this first mania, subsequent bubbles have frequently been marked or related to the hyper behavior of crowds. Scottish writer Charles Mackay's **Extraordinary Popular Delusions and the Madness of Crowds**, first distributed in 1841 still stands as an early tome in crowd psychology.

What is maybe most intriguing about Bernie Madoff's Ponzi and the mania that followed is that he hoodwinked evidently sophisticated or possibly generally shrewd investors. As opposed to the normal [pyramid schemes](/pyramidscheme) that get the ordinary "Joe" (person) attempting to make a simple buck, Madoff's approach purposely targeted a very much obeyed crowd. Maybe his audacity moved his scam on for longer than in any case less difficult cons.

## What Is a Ponzi Scheme?

A Ponzi scheme is a fraudulent investing scam promising high [rates of return](/rateofreturn) with little risk to investors.

Notwithstanding, the principal recorded cases of this kind of investment scam can be followed back to the mid-to-late 1800s, and these were organized by Adele Spitzeder in Germany and Sarah Howe in the United States. As a matter of fact, the methods of what came to be known as the Ponzi Scheme were depicted in two separate books written by Charles Dickens, **Martin Chuzzlewit**, distributed in 1844, and **Little Dorrit** in 1857.

Charles Ponzi's original scheme in 1919 was centered around the US Postal Service. The postal service, around then, had developed international reply coupons that permitted a shipper to pre-buy postage and remember it for their correspondence. The receiver would take the coupon to a neighborhood post office and exchange it for the priority airmail postage stamps expected to send a reply.
