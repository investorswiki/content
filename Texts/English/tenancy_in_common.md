# Tenancy in Common (TIC)
## What Is Tenancy in Common (TIC)?

Tenancy in common (TIC) is an arrangement wherein at least two individuals share ownership rights in a property or bundle of land. Every independent owner might control an equivalent or different percentage of the total property, which can be [commercial](/commercialrealestate) or residential. At the point when a tenant in common kicks the bucket, their share of the property passes to their estate; they reserve the option to leave it to any [beneficiary](/beneficiary) they pick.

## How Tenancy in Common (TIC) Works

At the point when at least two individuals own property as tenants in common (TIC), they all have equitable interests and privileges in all areas of that property. Notwithstanding, the co-tenants can have an alternate share of ownership interests. For instance, Sarah and Debbie may each claim 25% of a property, while Leticia possesses half.

Tenancy in common agreements can be made whenever. In this way, an individual might foster an interest in a property years after different members share went into a tenancy practically speaking arrangement. Getting back to the model above, we could say that Sarah and Leticia initially each owned half of the property. Sooner or later, Sarah chose to carry Debbie into the arrangement, splitting her half portion with her. That made a group of TICs with a 25/25/50 split.

The members of the agreement can likewise independently sell or borrow against their portion of ownership.

## Discarding a Tenancy in Common

At least one co-tenants can buy out different members to disintegrate the tenancy in common. In the event that the co-tenants foster restricting interests or directions for the property's utilization or improvement, or they need to sell the property, they must come to a joint agreement to push ahead. In cases where a comprehension can't be reached, a partition action might happen. The partition action can be voluntary or court-requested, contingent upon how well the co-tenants cooperate.

In a legal partition continuing, a court will split the property between the tenancy in common members, permitting every member to push ahead separately from different members. Known as a partition in kind, it is the most direct method for separating the property and is typically the method utilized when co-tenants are not ill-disposed.

On the off chance that the co-tenants won't cooperate, they might think about going into a partition of the property by sale. In this case, the holding is sold and the proceeds are split between the co-tenants as per their separate interests in the property.

## Property Taxes With Tenancy in Common

Since a tenancy in common agreement doesn't legally partition a bundle of land or property, most tax jurisdictions won't separately assign every owner a proportional property tax bill in light of their ownership percentage. Most frequently, the tenants in common receive a single [property tax](/propertytax) bill.

In numerous jurisdictions, a tenancy in common agreement forces [joint-and-several liability](/joint-and-several-liability) on the co-tenants. This expectation means every one of the independent owners might be liable for the property tax up to the full amount of the assessment. The liability applies to every owner no matter what the level or percentage of ownership.

When the property tax is paid, co-tenants can deduct that payment from their income tax filings. On the off chance that the taxing jurisdiction followed joint-and-several liability, every co-tenant can deduct the amount they contributed. In counties that don't follow this system, they can deduct a percentage of the total tax up to their level of ownership.

## Tenancy in Common versus Joint Tenancy

Despite the fact that they sound comparative, tenancy in common contrasts in more ways than one from a [joint tenancy](/joint-tenancy).

In a joint tenancy, tenants get equivalent shares of a property with a similar deed simultaneously, and augmentations or expulsions of any member of the group are substantially more critical. In TIC agreements, the change in members doesn't break the agreement; with a joint tenancy, the agreement is broken in the event that any of the members wish to sell their interest.

For instance, to buy out the others, the property technically must be sold and the proceeds distributed similarly among owners. Joint tenancy members can likewise utilize the legal partition action to separate the property assuming that the holding is adequately large to oblige this separation.

### Death of a Joint Tenant

Another substantial difference happens in the event of one co-tenant's death. As mentioned before, TIC agreements permit the death of property as a portion of the owner's estate. In any case, in a joint tenancy agreement, the title of the property passes to the enduring owner.

As such, tenants in common have no automatic rights of survivorship. Except if the deceased member's last will determines that their interest in the property is to be split between the enduring owners, a deceased tenant to common's greatest advantage has a place with their estate. Alternately, with joint tenants, the deceased owner's interest is automatically moved to the enduring owners. For instance, when four joint tenants own a home and one tenant kicks the bucket, every one of the three survivors winds up with one extra third share of the deceased's quarter of the property.

### Marriage and Property Ownership

A few states set joint tenancy as the default property ownership for married couples, while others utilize the tenancy in common ownership model. A third model, utilized in certain states, is a [tenancy by the entirety](/tenancy-by-the-entirety), in which every spouse has an equivalent and undivided interest in the property.

## Upsides and downsides of a Tenancy in Common

Buying a home with a family member, companion, or business partner as tenants in common might make it simpler to enter the real estate market. Since deposits and payments are isolated, purchasing and keeping up with the property might be more affordable than it would be for an individual. Furthermore, borrowing capacity might be streamlined on the off chance that one owner has a greater income or better financial balance than different members.

In any case, while selling property as tenants in common, ordinarily all borrowers sign the archives. Since all members sign mortgage reports, on account of a [default](/default2), the lender might hold onto the holdings from all group members. Likewise, even assuming that at least one borrowers cease giving contributions to the mortgage payment, different borrowers must in any case cover the payments to keep away from foreclosure.

The ability to utilize a [will](/will) for assigning beneficiaries to the property gives the co-tenant control over their share. On the off chance that a co-tenant kicks the bucket without a will, their interest in the property will go through [probate](/probate) — an exorbitant event both in terms of time and money.

Additionally, the leftover co-tenants might find they currently own the property with someone they don't have the foggiest idea or with whom they disagree. This new co-tenant might file a partition action, driving reluctant co-tenants to sell or separation the property.
