# Order-Driven Market
## What Is an Order Driven Market?

An order-driven market is a financial market where all buyers and sellers display the prices at which they wish to buy or sell a specific security, as well as the amounts of the security wanted to be bought or sold. This sort of trading environment is something contrary to a [quote-driven market](/quotedriven), which just displays bids and asks of [designated market makers](/designated-market-producer dmm) and experts for the specific security that is being traded.

## Understanding an Order Driven Market

Order-driven markets comprise of a consistent flow of buy and sell orders from market participants. There are no designated liquidity suppliers, and the two essential types of orders are market orders and limit orders. By comparison, in a quote-driven market, designated market creators give bids and offers that other market participants might trade on.

The greatest advantage of participating in an order-driven market is [transparency](/transparency) since the whole [order book](/order-book) is displayed for investors who wish to access this data. Most exchanges charge fees for such data.

Then again, an order-driven market might not have a similar degree of [liquidity](/liquidity) as a quote-driven market, since the subject matter experts and market creators in the last option need to execute business at their posted bid and ask prices.

### What Informed Trading Means for Order-Driven Markets

All together driven environments, where traders can pick between market orders, which require liquidity, and limit orders, which give liquidity, informed trading activities can really give a lift to liquidity.

A higher share of informed traders further develops liquidity as proxied by the bid-ask spread and market flexibility. In any case, informed traders significantly affect the price impact of orders. Compared to market orders, limit orders have a more modest price impact by a factor of around four.

### How Order Driven Environments Rank Buy and Sell Orders

Order-driven trading systems rank buy and sell orders as indicated by price, matching the most noteworthy ranking orders (if conceivable) at the base order amount. In the event that there is an excess volume of shares to be bought or sold in a provided order, trading systems will match the order with the next most elevated ranked sell or buy order.

The primary rule in the order priority hierarchy is price priority, trailed by secondary priority rules, which decide how to rank orders of a similar price. The principal order to show up at the best price ordinarily has priority over different orders, however at times trading systems trade displayed amounts before hidden amounts of a similar price.
