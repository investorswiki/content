# Deficiency Judgment

A deficiency judgment is a court ruling against an in debtor [default](/default2) on a secured loan, when the sale of the property that secured the loan neglects to cover the debt in full. It allows the lender to collect extra money from the debtor to compensate for any shortfall.

## How a Deficiency Judgment Works

The legal principle of a deficiency judgment could apply to any secured loan, for example, a vehicle loan, where property seized from a defaulting debtor sells for not exactly the lender is as yet owed on it. By and large, notwithstanding, the term is associated with mortgage [foreclosures](/foreclosure).

Home mortgages are intended to stay away from a deficiency by basing loan amounts on the [appraised value](/appraised_value) of the property and expecting borrowers to make a [down payment](/down_payment). Like that, the lender is putting less money at risk than the property is worth.

In theory, those shields guarantee that the lender can sell the property for enough money to recover its loan should the borrower default. In any case, in a real estate downturn, for example, the one that happened in 2008, a home's value can drop below the amount of the outstanding loan on it. This is at times alluded to as a [underwater mortgage](/underwater-mortgage). At the point when a borrower defaults on their mortgage under such conditions, the lender might look for a deficiency judgment.

## Illustration of a Deficiency Judgment

Consider a home bought for $300,000 with a $30,000 down payment and a $270,000, 30-year mortgage at an interest rate of 4%. The borrower defaults on the $270,000 loan following two years, leaving a [principal](/principal) balance of about $260,000. The bank sells the home for $245,000, then, at that point, wins a deficiency judgment against the borrower for the leftover $15,000. That is the amount that the borrower would have to pay.
