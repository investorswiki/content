# Urban Development Act of 1970
## What Is the Urban Development Act of 1970?

The Urban Development Act of 1970 is legislation implemented through the U.S. [Department of Housing and Urban Development](/us-department-housing-urban-development-hud) (HUD) that presented the Federal Experimental Housing Allowance Program and Community Development Corporation.

This act was passed to do the following:

- Lay out a national growth policy in the U.S.
- Encourage and support reasonable growth and development in states, metropolitan districts, counties, urban areas, and towns featuring new community and ghetto growth
- Correct certain laws with respect to housing and urban development

## Understanding Urban Development Act of 1970

The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development was laid out in 1937 through the U.S. Housing Act of 1937. The Department of Housing and Urban Development Act of 1965 laid out HUD as a Cabinet-level agency inside the U.S. government. The Urban Development Act of 1970 authorized the government to give greater outlays to housing subsidy programs and rent supplement programs for low and moderate-income families.

Funding for projects related to the act comes from various sources including state, neighborhood, and federal government, donations from individuals and corporations, as well as loans through traditional and contemporary financial institutions.

The act made the Community Development Corporation, a national network of [nonprofit](/non-profitorganization), community-put together organizations centered with respect to renewing their nearby networks, normally low-income, under-served areas that have disintegrated and where investment is sparse. These organizations, first and foremost, assist with creating reasonable housing, yet they are additionally associated with monetary development, disinfection, street beautification, and neighborhood planning projects.

## The Federal Experimental Housing Allowance Program

The Act likewise ran the Federal Experimental Housing Allowance Program, which started in 1973 and ended in 1979, including in excess of 25,000 families in 12 metropolitan areas with some $170 million in endowments to individual families. The thought was to perceive how best to further develop housing conditions for low-income individuals by giving them vouchers to pay for market-rate housing instead of build new public housing.

The Urban Institute deduced in the late 1970s that housing allowances "don't give critical momentum towards the majority of the stated objectives of HUD policy." Later policies had HUD giving appropriations directly to property managers through the Section 8 program, and building extra large public housing projects, an activity that has largely ended.

Federal spending on housing is for the most part geared toward richer individuals. A 2017 study by Apartment List found the famous tax break called the[ mortgage interest deduction](/home-mortgage-interest) (MID), cost the federal government $71 billion of every 2015, over two times the $29 billion spent on Section 8 funding for low-income renters. Also, over half of top level salary families claim MID, while just 11% of low-income families receive endowments of any sort for housing.
