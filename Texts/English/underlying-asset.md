# Underlying Asset
## What is an Underlying Asset

Underlying asset are the financial assets whereupon a [derivative's](/derivative) price is based. [Options](/option) are an illustration of a derivative. A derivative is a financial instrument with a price that depends on an alternate asset.

## The Basics of Underlying Asset

Underlying assets give derivatives their value. For instance, an option on stock XYZ gives the holder the right to buy or sell XYZ at the [strike price](/strikeprice) up until expiration. The underlying asset for the option is the stock of XYZ.

An underlying asset can be utilized to recognize the thing inside the agreement that offers some incentive to the contract. The underlying asset upholds the security engaged with the agreement, which the parties included consent to exchange as part of the derivative contract.

## Grasping Derivative Contracts

The price of an option or [futures](/futures) contract is derived from the price of an underlying asset. In an option contract, the [writer](/composing an-option) must either buy or sell the underlying asset to the buyer on the predefined date at the settled upon price. The buyer isn't committed to purchase the underlying asset, however they can exercise their right assuming they decide to do as such. In the event that the option is going to lapse, and the underlying asset has not moved well to the point of making practicing the option worthwhile, the buyer can let the terminate and they will lose the amount they paid for the option.

Futures are an obligation to the buyer and a seller. The seller representing things to come consents to give the underlying asset at expiry, and the buyer of the contract consents to buy the underlying at expiry. The price they receive and pay, individually, is the price they entered the futures contract at. Most futures traders close out their situations prior to expiration since retail traders and [hedge funds](/hedgefund) have little need to take physical possession of barrels of oil, for instance. However, they can buy or sell the contract at one price, and assuming it moves well they can exit the trade and create a gain that way. Futures are a derivative in light of the fact that the price of an oil futures contract depends on the price movement of oil, for instance.

## Illustration of an Underlying Asset

In cases including stock options, the underlying asset is the actual stock. For instance, with a stock option to purchase 100 shares of Company X at a price of $100, the underlying asset is the stock of Company X. The underlying asset is utilized to decide the value of the option up till expiration. The value of the underlying asset might change before the expiration of the contract, influencing the value of the option. The value of the underlying asset at some random time lets traders know whether the option is worth [exercising](/exercise) or not.

The underlying asset could likewise be a currency or [market index](/marketindex), like the S&P 500. On account of stock indexes, the underlying asset is involved the common stocks inside the stock market index.
