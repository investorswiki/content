A war bond is a debt security issued by a government to finance military operations during times of war or conflict. Since war bonds offered a rate of return below the market rate, investment was accomplished by making emotional appeals to energetic residents to loan the government money.

## Understanding War Bonds

A war bond is a debt instrument issued by a government for of borrowing money to finance its defense initiatives and military efforts during times of war. A war bond is basically a loan to a government. In the U.S., the sale of war bonds was overseen by the War Finance Committee. War bonds were initially known as Defense Bonds and were first issued as [Liberty Bonds](/liberty-bond) in 1917 to finance the United States government participation in World War I. Through the sale of these bonds, the government raised $21.5 billion dollars for its war efforts.

After the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, Dec. 7, 1941, the U.S. entered the Second World War, and Defense Bonds were renamed War Bonds. In excess of 80 million Americans purchased war bonds and brought in more than $180 billion in revenue. The bonds sold for half to 75% of their [face value](/facevalue) and had denominations going from $10 to $1,000, contingent upon the year they were issued.

The bonds were sold below their face value — investors paid not exactly the face value initially and were paid the face value amount at maturity. As such, war bonds were considered [zero-coupon bonds](/zero-couponbond) in light of the fact that they didn't pay interest payments over time or coupon payments. All things being equal, investors earned the difference between the purchase price and the face value of the bond at maturity.

War bonds were baby bonds, which implied they had more modest [par values](/parvalue), or face values, than standard bonds. This made them more affordable for retail investors. One more feature of the bonds was that they were nontransferable — just the bond purchaser could redeem the bonds from now on. War bonds initially had a 10-year maturity, which brought about a 2.9% return.

Congress extended the interest that could be earned so that bonds sold from 1941 to 1965 [accrued interest](/accruedinterest) for a long time. Bonds issued after 1965 accrued interest for quite a long time. After the finish of World War II, War Bonds became known as Series E bonds. The U.S. government kept giving Series E bonds until 1980 when Series EE bonds supplanted them.
