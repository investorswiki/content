# Poverty Gap
## What Is the Poverty Gap?

The poverty gap is a ratio showing the average shortfall of the total population from the [poverty line](/international-poverty-line) — the base level of [income](/income) required to secure the essential necessities for survival. At the end of the day, it mirrors the intensity of poverty in a nation.

## Understanding the Poverty Gap

The poverty gap indicator is delivered by the [World Bank](/worldbank) Development Research Group. It measures poverty by taking a gander at household [per capita](/percapita) income and consumption.

The World Bank looks to measure all individuals against a similar standard. Thusly, it sets an international poverty line at periodic stretches, working out the [cost of living](/cost-of-living) at some random time by considering the going rate for fundamental food, dress, and shelter around the world.

In 2015, this threshold was refreshed from $1.25 to $1.90 each day. It is hard to set a common international poverty threshold since various countries have various thresholds for poverty.

The World Bank's poverty gap data is accessible for 115 countries worldwide and is refreshed semi-annually in April and September.

## U.S. Poverty Gap

The United States has its own poverty threshold, which shifts relying upon the state and the number of individuals in a household. Starting around 2020, the average threshold for a family of four remained at $26,200. That means that a married couple with two children and an annual household income of $20,000 is decided to reside below the poverty line. The poverty gap in this model would be $6,200.

In 2019, the [U.S. Census Bureau](/bureauofcensus) reported that there were 6.55 million families and 11.3 million individuals in the country with an income below the poverty threshold. As per its data, the poverty gap for these families and individuals, on average, was $10,668 and $7,375, separately, finishing in a total nationwide poverty gap of $154 billion.

## Special Considerations

The commonly utilized poverty headcount ratio gives a basic count of the relative multitude of individuals below a poverty line in a given population, thinking of them as similarly poor. Thus, being a defective measurement is considered by some.

### Poverty Gap Index

The poverty gap measurement is generally important to [economists](/financial analyst) and government authorities for working out the poverty gap index. The index, likewise delivered by the World Bank, takes the [mean](/mean) shortfall from the poverty line and partitions it by the value of the poverty line.

In the event that you duplicate a country's poverty gap index by both the poverty line and the total number of individuals in the country, you get the total amount of money expected to free the poor in the population once again from extreme poverty and up to the poverty line, accepting perfect targeting of transfers.

For instance, assume a country has 10 million residents, a poverty line of $500 each year, and a poverty gap index of 5%. In such a case, an average increase of $25 per individual, each year, would dispense with extreme poverty. The $25 is 5% of the poverty line, and the total increase expected to kill poverty is $250 million — $25 duplicated by 10 million individuals.

The poverty gap index is added substance. At the end of the day, the index can be utilized as an aggregate poverty measure, as well as be disintegrated for different sub-groups of the population, for example, by region, employment sector, education level, orientation, age, or ethnic group.
