# NR6 Form
## What Is Form NR6?

The NR6 Form is a [Canada Revenue Agency (CRA)](/ccra) document that a non-resident who has received a rent or timber royalty payment in Canada must submit to the agency to declare their intent to file an income tax return for that year. The NR6 is much of the time utilized related to Form NR4, which is filled out by substances who have paid out money to non-residents in Canada.

## Understanding the NR6 Form

The NR6 Form is a required filing for non-residents of Canada who have received rent or timber [royalty](/royalty) payments in Canada. The CRA distributes the form and handles any remaining federal taxation in Canada. The filer of a NR6 form isn't expected to make a tax payment with the form. Rather, it is a declaration that they expect to file a tax return with any associated payments for that tax year. The CRA expects that a NR6 Form be filed at the very latest the main day of a tax year where the non-resident hopes to receive rent or royalty payments. An individual must file a T1159 Income Tax Return by June 30 of the next year. A corporation or trust is required to file a T2 Corporation Income Tax Return something like six months after the completion of its tax year.

CRA expects that any non-resident of Canada getting rent or timber royalty payments have a Canadian agent who gathers the rent or royalty payments. Prior to the CRA supporting the NR6 Form, the agent must keep and make payment of the pertinent non-resident tax by the fifteenth day of the month following the rent or royalty payment. Following NR6 endorsement, the non-resident is permitted to keep taxes until the due date.

## Non-Resident Taxpayer Status in Canada

The NR6 Form is expected for non-resident payers of Canadian income tax as it were. CRA characterizes a non-resident as any individual who regularly lives in a country outside of Canada or, all the more explicitly, stays in Canada less than 183 days out of each year. Individuals who spent over 183 days in Canada during a tax year yet have no residential connections to the country as defined by the CRA still up in the air to be considered residents and in this manner subject to resident tax rates. This classification frequently applies to government employees positioned outside of Canada or those spending over 183 days in Canada without residency in another country.

Tax obligations depicted on the NR6 Form fall under Part XIII of the Canadian tax code. Different forms of income under Part XIII incorporate ordinary [stock dividends](/ordinary-dividends), Canadian pension benefits and payments from Canadian retirement savings accounts. Non-resident taxpayers are regularly subject to a flat 25-percent tax rate for rent and eminences except if a [tax treaty](/taxtreaty) between their native country and Canada gives relief from that rate.
