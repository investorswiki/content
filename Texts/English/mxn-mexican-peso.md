## What Is MXN (Mexican Peso)?

MXN is the currency condensing for the Mexican peso, which is the official currency of Mexico. The Mexican peso is comprised of 100 **centavos** and is frequently given the symbol $ or Mex$. The name "peso" means "loads" and alludes to gold or silver loads.

## Figuring out MXN (Mexican Peso)

The peso was initially founded on Spain's official currency, known as **real**, which was the Spanish dollar stamped in silver. The Mexican name originated from the most common denomination of the currency, which was the silver 8-genuine coin, and stayed in circulation until the mid-nineteenth century. In 1863 the principal coins were created that were named in **centavos**, and worth 100th 100th of the peso. These coins stayed in circulation until the mid-twentieth century, however their substance of gold was decreased substantially over the long haul.

Following a period of [hyperinflation](/hyperinflation) and currency [devaluation](/devaluation) during the 1980s, which happened after Mexico defaulted on its [external debt](/outer debt) because of the 1970s oil crisis, the government of Mexico in 1993 made another peso, or **nuevo peso**, to supplant the original peso. The new peso supplanted the old peso at a rate of 1:1,000.

In the same way as other emerging market currencies, the value of the peso changes with the international and global sentiment. Generally, when global volatility is low, the peso appreciates, as found in the years after the [Great Recession](/great-recession). A huge number of accommodative central bank policy drives saw volatility fall and the value of the peso slowly climb.

Soon after the presidential election of Donald Trump in 2016, volatility spiked, and, as vulnerability encompassing the [North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA)](/nafta) uplifted, the peso plunged, losing around 20% of its value in 90 days.

The Mexican peso is the fifteenth most traded currency in the world and the most traded in Latin America.
