# Elective-Deferral Contribution
## What Is an Elective-Deferral Contribution?

An elective-deferral contribution is made straightforwardly from an employee's salary to their employer-sponsored retirement plan, for example, a [401(k)](/401kplan) or [403(b)](/403bplan) plan. The employee must approve the exchange before the contribution can be deducted.

Elective deferrals can be made on a pre-tax or after-tax basis on the off chance that an employer permits them. The [Internal Revenue Service](/irs) (IRS) lays out limits on how much an employee can concede or add to a [qualified retirement plan](/qrp). An elective-deferral contribution is otherwise called a salary-deferral or salary-decrease contribution.

## How an Elective-Deferral Contribution Works

Elective-deferral contributions made into traditional 401(k) plans are made on a pre-tax or tax-deferred basis, successfully diminishing an employee's [taxable income](/taxableincome). Suppose an individual making $40,000 a year chooses to contribute $100 each month into their 401(k). These deferrals total $1,200 each year. Thus, the employee's pay is taxed at $38,800 that year rather than $40,000.

Since there's a tax-derivation upfront, any distributions are taxed at the income tax rate for the retired person at the hour of [withdrawal](/withdrawal). Several limitations apply concerning when and under what conditions an employee can make withdrawals from an employer-sponsored retirement plan. For instance, an extra 10% penalty tax might apply if an individual makes a withdrawal before age 59\u00bd â€” expecting the employee meets the conditions that permit the person in question to take an early [distribution](/distribution). State and nearby taxes may likewise be assessed for early withdrawals.

A few employers permit workers to contribute toward [Roth 401(k)](/roth401k) plans. Contributions made to these arrangements are made on an after-tax basis. After tax-basis means the assets are taxed before they were saved into the retirement plan. Since there's no pre-tax benefit with Roth 401(k)s, employees can pull out deferrals tax-free for however long they're over the age of 59\u00bd.

> Not at all like Roth IRAs, Roth 401(k)s are not subject to RMDs during the proprietor's lifetime.
