# Liquidating Market
## What Is a Liquidating Market?

A liquidating market is a type of securities market in which there is broad-based selling of most securities simultaneously, giving the effect of low and decreasing prices on most securities while selling volumes stay high. This mass [liquidation](/liquidation) of securities frequently happens when the contracts have reached or are approaching the point of delivery.

## Understanding Liquidating Markets

A liquidating market is one in which the majority of investors are leaving or selling off the securities they own which are traded in that market, so overall there is an overall liquidation of securities in a single market.

A market encountering this type of mass liquidation will wind up in a seemingly impossible situation in the end, yet this frequently doesn't occur right away. All things being equal, the market first will go through a series of cycles, with a succession of all over developments to differing degrees. When the primary wave of liquidation starts to die down, another group of deal looking for buyers might dive in, attempting to make the most of the opportunity to buy low.

This initial round of activity might send a mixed signal that the trend has stopped and is switching. In fact, this period of buying may rapidly give way to one more round of liquidating, and this rehashed cycle of buying and selling might go on for some time, sending a number of mixed signals that things have settled down before the market at last arrives at its true base.

> Fear can lead to panic selling, pushing prices well below their intrinsic value. This, of course, can give opportunities to buy low â€” yet it is hard to tell while a liquidating market has wrapped up.

## Illustration of a Liquidating Market

A liquidating market can happen for essentially any type of security on the off chance that the right conditions create. Investors frequently settle on the choice to liquidate when a financial [bubble](/bubble) of some type explodes.

A housing bubble may be a genuine model. This includes an environment wherein real estate prices are persistently bid up as a general trend across the board. Rising prices, particularly those that rise suddenly and quickly raise, will probably at last arrive at a point where they max out. When the bubble explodes, investors stop buying into real estate and start selling their holdings.

This makes the aggregate effect of a sell-off in the real estate market as a whole, which would display somewhat low prices on houses and strong selling pressure. In this case, eyewitnesses could call the real estate market a liquidating market, as the vast majority of the market's participants are primarily keen on liquidating their assets into cash around then. This leads to a [saturation of the market](/marketsaturation), as energetic sellers flood the market with properties they need to rapidly dump.

## Highlights
- A liquidating market is one where many market participants are attempting to sell their holdings simultaneously.
- An asset bubble popping is an illustration of a liquidating market, frequently exacerbated by feelings like panic and fear.
- Such a market might experience extreme and sudden price drops, which could push prices below their fundamental value, giving possible opportunities to sharp buyers.
