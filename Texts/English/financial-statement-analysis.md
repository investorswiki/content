## What Is Financial Statement Analysis?

External stakeholders use it to understand the overall health of an organization as well as to evaluate financial performance and business value. Internal constituents use it as a monitoring device for dealing with the finances.

## Instructions to Analyze Financial Statements

The financial statements of a company record important financial data on every aspect of a business' activities. Accordingly, they can be evaluated on the basis of past, current, and projected performance.

Several techniques are commonly used as part of financial statement analysis. Three of the main techniques include [horizontal analysis](/horizontalanalysis), [vertical analysis](/vertical_analysis), and [ratio analysis](/ratioanalysis). Horizontal analysis compares data horizontally, by dissecting values of line items across two or more years. Vertical analysis takes a gander at the vertical effects line items have on other parts of the business and furthermore the business' proportions. Ratio analysis uses important ratio metrics to calculate statistical relationships.

## Types of Financial Statements

Companies use the balance sheet, income statement, and cash flow statement to manage the operations of their business and furthermore to provide transparency to their stakeholders. Each of the three statements are interconnected and create different views of a company's activities and performance.

Short-term assets, for example, cash and accounts receivable can tell a ton about a company's operational efficiency; liabilities include the company's expense arrangements and the debt capital it is paying off; and shareholder's equity includes details on equity capital investments and retained earnings from periodic net income. The balance sheet must balance assets and liabilities to equal shareholder's equity. This figure is considered a company's book value and serves as an important performance metric that increases or decreases with the financial activities of a company.

The income statement is broken into three parts that help to analyze business efficiency at three different points. It begins with revenue and the direct costs associated with revenue to identify gross profit. It then moves to [operating profit](/operating_profit), which deducts indirect expenses like marketing costs, general costs, and depreciation. At long last, after deducting interest and taxes, the net income is reached.

Fundamental analysis of the income statement for the most part involves the calculation of gross profit margin, operating profit margin, and net profit margin, which each divide profit by revenue. Profit margin helps to show where company costs are low or high at different points of the operations.

### Cash Flow Statement

The cash flow statement provides an overview of the company's cash flows from operating activities, investing activities, and financing activities. Net income is carried over to the cash flow statement where it is included as the top line item for operating activities. Like its title, investing activities include cash flows involved with firmwide investments. The financing activities section includes cash flow from both debt and equity financing. The reality shows how much cash a company has available.

### Free Cash Flow and Other Valuation Statements

Companies and analysts likewise use free cash flow statements and other valuation statements to analyze the value of a company. Free cash flow statements arrive at a [net present value](/npv) by discounting the free cash flow a company is estimated to generate over time. Private companies might keep a valuation statement as they progress toward potentially opening up to the world.
