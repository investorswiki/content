# Competitive Tender
## What Is Competitive Tender?

Competitive tender is an auction interaction through which large institutional investors (likewise called primary wholesalers) purchase recently issued government debt. The competitive tender interaction awards securities to the highest bidders; all bids must be presented by a foreordained date and must be for at least $100,000.

Competitive tender is likewise called competitive bidding.

## Grasping Competitive Tender

Competitive tender is one of two bidding processes for buying new government securities in the primary market (i.e., straightforwardly from the government). The other bidding process for buying government securities is [non-competitive tender](/noncompetitivetender).

The U.S. Treasury essentially utilizes non-competitive tender, while Canada's central bank, the [Bank of Canada](/bankofcanada), principally utilizes competitive tender (yet in addition acknowledges non-competitive bids). The people who receive securities in the competitive tender cycle may then decide to sell them on the secondary market. Primary merchants may likewise decide to bid in the interest of smaller customers.

The U.S. Treasury holds week by week and month to month auctions to sell Treasury securities — Treasury bills, notes, bonds, and [Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities](/tips) (TIPS) — to the public. Closely involved individuals commonly place bids at the cost and amount of debt securities they will purchase from the Treasury.

Bids are accepted as long as 30 days in advance of the auction and might be submitted either electronically through the [Treasury Automated Auction Processing System](/taaps) (TAAPS) or via mail. The bids are confidential and kept fixed until the auction date. Participants in any Treasury auction comprise of small investors and [institutional investors](/institutionalinvestor) who submit bids arranged as either competitive or non-competitive tenders.

Non-competitive tenders are presented by smaller investors who are guaranteed to receive securities. Be that as it may, there is no guarantee on the price or yield received. The [yield on the bond](/bond-yield) not set in stone by the competitive side of the auction which is dealt with as a Dutch auction — a type of auction where the price on a thing is brought down until it gets a bid.

A competitive tender is a bid put together by greater investors, like institutional investors. Every bidder is limited to 35% of the amount of the offering per auction. Each bid submitted indicates the most reduced rate, yield, or discount margin that the investor will acknowledge for the debt securities.

## Competitive Tender Example

We should take a gander at an illustration of how competitive bidding through a [Dutch auction](/dutchauction) works. Assume the Treasury looks to bring $9 million up in two-year notes with a 5% coupon. How about we expect the competitive bids submitted are as per the following:

- $1 million at 4.79%
- $2.5 million at 4.85%
- $2 million at 4.96%
- $1.5 million at 5%
- $3 million at 5.07%
- $1 million at 5.1%
- $5 million at 5.5%

The bids with the most reduced yield will be accepted first since the issuer will like to pay lower yields to its bond investors. In this case, since the Treasury is hoping to raise $9 million, it will acknowledge the bids with the least yield up to 5.07%.

At this mark, just $2 million of the $3 million bid will be approved. All bids with a yield greater than 5.07% will be dismissed, and all bids below will be accepted. In effect, this auction is cleared at 5.07%, and all fruitful competitive and non-competitive bidders will receive the 5.07% yield.
