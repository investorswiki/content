# Net Investment
## What Is Net Investment?

Net investment is the total amount of money that a company spends on [capital assets](/capitalasset), minus the cost of the [depreciation](/depreciation) of those assets. This figure gives a feeling of the real expenditure on durable goods like plants, equipment, and software that are being utilized in the company's operations.

Capital assets lose value after some time due to wear and tear and obsolescence. In this way, deducting depreciation from gross [capital expenditure (CAPEX)](/capitalexpenditure) gives a more accurate image of their genuine value.

Capital assets incorporate all property and equipment that add to the productive capacity of the business. The total for capital assets likewise incorporates the costs of their upkeep, maintenance, repair, and establishment.

### Net Investment for Nations

Net investment is a part of a country's gross domestic product (GDP).

In a country's GDP, the figure demonstrates gross private domestic investment. It remembers all expenditures by private companies and legislatures for real estate and inventories. Subsequently, it is a leading indicator of a country's potential economic production capacity.

## Grasping Net Investment

Assuming gross investment is reliably higher than depreciation, the net investment figure will be positive, showing that the company's productive capacity is expanding. Assuming gross investment is reliably lower than depreciation, net investment will be negative, it is decreasing to show that productive capacity. That can be a problem down the road. This is true for all substances, from the littlest companies to the biggest national economies.

Net investment is, consequently, a better indicator than gross investment of how much an enterprise is investing in its business since it considers depreciation.

Investing an amount equivalent to the total depreciation in a year is the base required to keep the [asset base](/asset-base) from contracting. While this may not be a problem for a little while, a net investment that is negative for a drawn out time frame period ultimately will deliver the enterprise uncompetitive.

## Net Investment Calculation

Assume a company burns through $1 million on another piece of machinery that has an expected life of 30 years and has a [residual value](/residual-value) of $100,000. Based on the straight-line method of depreciation, annual depreciation would be $30,000, or ($1,000,000 - $100,000)/30. Consequently, the amount of net investment toward the finish of the primary year would be $970,000.

### The Formula

The formula for computing net investment is:

Net Investment = Capital Expenditures - Depreciation (non-cash)

Ordinary investment in capital assets is critical to an enterprise's continuing achievement. The net investment amount required for a company relies upon the sector it works in, Sectors like industrial products, goods producers, utilities, and telecommunications are more capital escalated than sectors like technology and consumer products.

That is the reason, while looking at net investment among different companies, it is generally applicable assuming they are in a similar sector.

## Features
- Assuming that net investment is positive, the company is extending its capacity.
- Net investment shows how much a company is spending to keep up with and work on its operations.
- Assuming net investment is negative, its capacity is contracting.
