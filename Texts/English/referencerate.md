# Reference Rate
## What Is a Reference Rate?

A reference rate is a [interest rate](/interestrate) benchmark used to set other interest rates. Different types of transactions utilize different reference rate benchmarks, however the most common incorporate the [Fed Funds Rate](/federalfundsrate), [LIBOR](/libor), the prime rate, and the rate on benchmark U.S. Treasury securities.

Reference rates are helpful in homeowner mortgages and sophisticated interest rate swap transactions made by institutions.

## How a Reference Rate Works

Contingent upon the composition of a security or financial contract, the reference rate can be more enthusiastically to comprehend. Troubles happen particularly in the event that the rate is as an inflation benchmark, for example, the [Consumer Price Index (CPI](/consumerpriceindex) or as a measure of economic wellbeing, for example, the [unemployment rate](/unemploymentrate) or corporate [default rate](/defaultrate).

Reference rates are at the core of a [adjustable-rate mortgage (ARM)](/arm). With an ARM, the borrower's interest rate will be the reference rate, normally the prime rate, plus an extra fixed amount, known as the [spread](/spread). From the lender's perspective, the reference rate is a guaranteed rate of borrowing. At any rate, the lender generally procures the spread as profit. For the borrower, nonetheless, changes in the reference rate can have a distinct financial impact. On the off chance that the reference rate takes a sudden action up, borrowers who pay [floating interest rates](/floatinginterestrate) can see their payments rise emphatically.

Reference rates additionally form the benchmark for a [interest rate swap](/interestrateswap). In an interest rate swap, the floating reference rate is traded by one party for a [fixed interest rate](/fixedinterestrate) or a set of payments. The reference rate will decide the floating interest rate portion of the contract.

## Reference Rate Example

Suppose a homebuyer needs to borrow $40,000 to assist with supporting the purchase of another home. The bank offers a [variable interest rate](/variableinterestrate) loan at prime plus 1%. That implies the interest rate for the loan equals the prime rate plus 1%. In this way, on the off chance that the prime rate is 4%, your mortgage conveys an interest rate of 5% (4%+1%). In this case, the [prime rate](/primerate) is the reference rate.

The bank may "reset" the rate every once in a while as the reference rate vacillates. At the point when the prime rate goes up, your rate likewise goes up. Adversely, when the prime rate falls, so does your payment rate. By permitting the bank to "reset" the rate, it evades the chance that the borrower may [default](/default2) on the loan, which makes the bank lose money. Borrowers likewise benefit from a "reset" of rate. It assists them with trying not to overpay for a loan on the off chance that prime rates end up going down after the conclusion of the loan.

The consumer price index is the reference rate for [Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities](/tips), known as TIPS. TIPS are U.S Treasury securities that are indexed to inflation to safeguard investors from the neutralizing effects of [inflation](/inflation). TIPS will pay interest at regular intervals utilizing the basis of a fixed rate applied to the underlying principle. Calculation of interest utilizes the adjusted principal increased by one-half of the interest rate. On [maturity](/maturity), the U.S. Treasury will pay either the original or an adjusted principal, whichever is higher.
