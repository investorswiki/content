# ZMK (Zambian Kwacha)
## What Is the Zambian Kwacha (ZMK)?

The Zambian **kwacha** (ZMK) is the official [legal tender](/legal-tender) and national currency of the Republic of Zambia, issued by the country's [central bank](/centralbank), the Bank of Zambia. The Zambian kwacha gets its name from the word for "day break" in the Nyanja language, and is partitioned into 100 **ngwee** however consistent inflation has made the ngwee (and lower denominations of kwacha) practically worthless.

As of December 2020, 1 ZMK is equivalent to US $0.048. t

## Figuring out the Zambian Kwacha

In 1964, the British province of Northern Rhodesia pronounced its independence and changed its name to the Republic of Zambia. The Bank of Zambia issued a Zambian rendition of the pound likewise in 1964. The Zambian pound coursed alongside the recently utilized British currency. The Currency Act of 1967 officially settled the Zambian kwacha, which supplanted the Zambian **pound** at an exchange rate of 1 kwacha to 0.5 pounds, the equivalent of 1.4 U.S. dollars. Zambian pounds kept on coursing alongside the kwacha until 1974.

The central bank initially linked the kwacha's value to both the [British pound](/gbp) (GBP) and the [U.S. dollar](/usd-US dollar) (USD) until 1971. In what had become known as the "[Nixon Shock](/nixon-shock)" the U.S. removed itself from the gold standard, successfully ending the post-WW II [Bretton Woods](/brettonwoodsagreement) agreement. Revaluation of the USD caused the revaluation of the kwacha against the pound. Zambia thusly dropped its pegging to the British pound and reset its U.S. dollar peg to a rate of 1.4 U.S. dollars per kwacha. Further devaluation of the U.S. dollar in February 1973 drove the Bank of Zambia to present a 4.5 percent [crawling peg](/crawlingpeg) for the kwacha against the dollar.

A period of economic distress brought about by a combination of low global copper prices and expansions in fuel costs set off high inflation in Zambia during the 1980s. The Bank of Zambia answered by giving higher [denominations](/denomination) of currency, introducing 100-and 500-kwacha banknotes. The coming of multiparty politics prompted some economic liberalization in the mid 1990s, however inflation stayed high. In 1996, the Bank of Zambia was forced to present notes at denominations of 5,000, 10,000, 20,000, and 50,000 kwacha as the currency depreciated essentially over the long run. The ZMK exchange rate lined at around 4,800 kwacha for each U.S. dollar in 2006. A period of economic growth has followed, carrying relative stability to the kwacha's value.

In 2013, the central bank [re-denominated](/redenomination) its currency utilizing a divisor of 1,000. Stable values against the U.S. dollar went on through 2014. A slowdown in the Chinese economy and decreased demand for copper caused a 42 percent fall against the dollar in 2015. Since that time, the currency has bounced back into a relatively stable reach somewhere in the range of 10 and 20 kwacha for each U.S. dollar.

## The Zambian Economy

Zambia is a major producer of copper on the landmass of Africa. Due to its copper production, the country's economy and the value of its currency have generally experienced volatility in view of movements in the copper [commodity ](/commodity-market)in the global market.

Kenneth Kaunda turned into the principal leader of Zambia in 1964, and he stayed in power until 1991. During this time, all Zambian banknotes highlighted a picture of Kaunda. His picture was subsequently supplanted by an African fish hawk after he left office.

A serious economic crisis coming from poor government oversight and overspending contributed to high inflation all through the 1990s and 2000s. As per 2019 data from the World Bank, Zambia is a lower-center income nation which encounters a 2.9% annual growth rate in population. Today, the country keeps on battling with [inflation](/inflation). The yearly gross domestic product (GDP) growth rate is 2% with an inflation rate of 9.8 percent.

- The Zambian kwacha (ZMK) is the official currency of Zambia.
- The kwacha was presented in 1967 when it supplanted the Zambian pound, which was being used during its period as the British province of Northern Rhodesia.
