# Interpolated Yield Curve (I Curve)
## What Is an Interpolated Yield Curve (I Curve)?

An interpolated yield curve (I curve) is a [yield curve](/yieldcurve) derived by utilizing on-the-run Treasuries. Since [on-the-run Treasuries](/on-the-runtreasuries) are limited to specific maturities, the yield of maturities that lies between the on-the-run treasuries must be interpolated. Interpolation is a method for determining the value of an obscure entity, frequently by utilizing mathematical analysis to estimate the value of that entity.

Financial analysts and investors add yield curves to assist with foreseeing future economic activity and bond market price levels. They can achieve this by utilizing a number of methodologies, including bootstrapping and [regression analysis](/regression).

## Understanding the Interpolated Yield Curve (I Curve)

The yield curve is the curve that is framed on a graph when the [yield](/yield) and different maturities of Treasury securities are plotted. The graph is plotted with the y-hub portraying interest rates and the x-hub showing the rising time durations. Since short-term bonds commonly have lower yields than longer-term bonds, the curve inclines upwards from the base left to the right.

At the point when the yield curve is plotted utilizing data on the yield and maturities of [on-the-run Treasuries](/on-the-runtreasuries), it is alluded to as an interpolated yield curve or I curve. On-the-run Treasuries are the most as of late issued U.S. [Treasury bills](/treasurybill), notes, or bonds of a particular maturity.

Conversely, [off-the-run Treasuries](/off-the-runtreasuries) are marketable Treasury debt consisting of more [seasoned issues](/seasonedissue). The on-the-run Treasury will have a lower yield and higher price than a comparative off-the-run issue, and they only make up a small percentage of the total issued Treasury securities.

## Interpolation

Interpolation is basically a method used to determine the value of an obscure entity. Treasury securities issued by the U.S. government are not available for each period of time. For instance, you will actually want to find the yield for a 1-year bond, yet not a 1.5-year bond.

To determine the value of a missing yield or interest rate to infer a yield curve, the missing information can be interpolated utilizing different methods including bootstrapping or regression analysis. Once the interpolated yield curve has been derived, [yield spreads](/yieldspread) can be calculated from it as not many of the bonds have maturities comparable to those of the on-the-run Treasuries.

## Bootstrapping

The bootstrapping method utilizes interpolation to determine the yields for Treasury [zero-coupon securities](/zero-couponbond) with different maturities. Utilizing this method, a coupon-bearing bond is stripped of its future cash streams — that is, [coupon payments](/coupon) — and converted into various zero-coupon bonds. Normally, a few rates at the short finish of the curve will be known. For rates that are obscure due to inadequate liquidity at the short end, you can utilize between bank money market rates.

To recap, first insert rates for each missing maturity. You can do this utilizing a [linear interpolation](/interpolation) method. Once you have determined all the term structure rates, utilize the bootstrapping method to get the zero curve from the par term structure. An iterative interaction makes it conceivable to determine a zero-coupon yield curve from the rates and prices of coupon-bearing bonds.

## Special Considerations

A few distinct types of fixed-income securities trade at yield spreads to the interpolated yield curve, making it an important benchmark. For instance, certain agency [collateralized mortgage obligations](/cmo) (CMOs) trade at a spread to the I curve at a spot on the curve equivalent to their weighted average lives. A CMO's weighted average life will doubtlessly lie some place inside the on-the-run treasuries, which makes the derivation of the interpolated yield curve essential.

## Features
- Investors and financial analysts frequently add yield curves to gain a better comprehension of where the bond markets and the economy may be going from now on.
- An interpolated yield curve or "I curve" alludes to a yield curve that has been plotted utilizing data on the yield and maturities of on-the-run Treasuries.
- On-the-run Treasuries are the most as of late issued U.S. Treasury bonds or notes of a specific maturity.
- Interpolation alludes to the methods used to make new estimated data points between realized data points on a graph.
- Two of the most common methods to interject a yield curve are bootstrapping and regression analysis.
