# Capped Option
## What Is a Capped Option?

A capped option limits, or caps, the maximum conceivable profit for its holder. At the point when the [underlying asset](/underlying-asset) closes at or past a predetermined price, the option automatically [exercises](/exercise).

For capped [call options](/calloption), the option exercises if and when the underlying closes at or over the foreordained level. Likewise, capped [put options](/putoption) exercise if and when the underlying closes at or below the foreordained level.

## How a Capped Option Works

Capped options are one type of [derivative](/derivative) that gives an upper and lower boundary for potential results. The difference between the strike price and the limits is known as the cap interval. While this boundary limits the profit potential for the holder, it comes at a reduced cost. Consequently, in the event that the holder accepts the underlying asset will move unassumingly, capped options give a decent vehicle to capture it. To show up at the option's cap price for a call, add the cap interval to the [strike price](/strikeprice). For a put, deduct the cap interval from the strike price.

One more name for capped options is capped-style options. Thoughtfully, capped options are like [vertical spreads](/verticalspread) where the investor offers a lower priced option to offset the purchase of a higher priced option to some degree. The two options have a similar [expiration date](/expirationdate).

For instance, in a [bull call spread](/bullcallspread), the investor purchases call options with one strike price while likewise selling similar number of calls of a similar asset and expiration date however at a higher strike. Since the subsequent call is farther from the current price of the [underlying](/underlying), its price is lower. The two trades together cost not exactly the outright purchase of the calls. In any case, the trade off is a limited profit potential.

## Other Similar Strategies

Sellers need to safeguard against big developments and high volatility. Of course, for the seller the trade-off for volatility protection is lower [premiums](/premium) collected. Furthermore, for the buyer, it is the reverse with a limited profit potential and a lower cost to purchase.

One strategy to oversee volatility is called a [collar](/collar). This is a protective options strategy for the holder of an underlying asset through the purchase of a [out-of-the-money](/outofthemoney) put option while at the same time selling an out-of-the-cash call option. A collar is otherwise called hedge covering.

[Range forward contracts](/range-forward-contract) are common in the [currency markets](/worldwide currency-markets) to hedge against currency market volatility. They are zero-cost [forward contracts](/forwardcontract) that make a scope of exercise prices through two derivative market positions. A reach forward contract is developed so it gives protection against unfavorable conversion scale developments while holding an upside potential to capitalize on great currency changes.
