# Natural Gas ETF
## What Is a Natural Gas ETF?

A natural gas [exchange-traded fund](/etf) (ETF) is a type of pooled investment product that gives investors exposure to natural gas prices. These funds are frequently regulated by a professional manager, who invests for the investors, and will generally invest in a basket of natural gas [futures contracts](/futurescontract) as opposed to hold stocks of natural gas companies.

## Grasping Natural Gas ETFs

Natural gas is a commodity that fills some needs. It is utilized as a source of energy for heating, cooking, fuel, and power generation as well as to make plastics and other organic synthetics.

Investors really should figure out the difference between natural gas ETFs and other well known types of ETFs. Numerous ETFs own their [underlying assets](/underlying) straightforwardly, for example, gold ETFs that own physical bullion or industry-area ETFs that own the shares of companies operating in their industry.

Natural gas ETFs, nonetheless, typically own no physical natural gas. All things being equal, they own natural gas by implication by purchasing natural gas futures contracts that trade on a commodities exchange. The profitability of a natural gas ETF is, thusly, dependent on the overall price bearing of natural gas, in view of the trading that happens on the commodities exchange.

## Limitations of Natural Gas ETFs

Since natural gas ETFs hold futures contracts, they are presented to a special type of risk called [contango](/contango). Every month, the manager of the natural gas ETF needs to purchase new futures contracts to replace the old contracts that terminate. The new contracts will quite often have marginally higher prices than the old ones, implying that each time contracts are replaced, extra costs are incurred by the fund manager. Over the long run, these small costs can amount to make a large drag on the fund's overall performance.

Therefore, investors will generally try not to depend on natural gas ETFs as a type of long-term investment vehicle. As a result of contango risk, an investor could cause tremendous costs from the continuous turn over of futures contracts, implying that even assuming natural gas prices truly do rise over their investment period, they probably won't rise to the point of making the overall investment profitable.

Most investors seeking exposure, in this way, utilize natural gas ETFs chiefly as a short-term trading vehicle, with the goal that the costs of contango don't sufficiently collect to have a significant impact.
