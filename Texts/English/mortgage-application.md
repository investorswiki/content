# Mortgage Application
## What Is a Mortgage Application?

A mortgage application is a document submitted to a lender when you apply for a mortgage to purchase real estate. The application is broad and contains information about the property being considered for purchase, the borrower's financial situation and employment history, and that's just the beginning. Lenders utilize the information in a mortgage application to choose whether or not to endorse the loan.

## Grasping a Mortgage Application

When you are under contract to buy a specific property, your lender will start the mortgage application. The mortgage application asks for a lot of information, so it's best to gather every one of your financial subtleties prior to applying.

Despite the fact that there are several renditions of mortgage applications that are utilized by lenders, one of the most common is the 1003 mortgage application form, otherwise called the Uniform Residential Loan Application**,** which is a normalized form involved by the majority of lenders in the U.S. The 1003 form incorporates all the information that a mortgage lender necessities to decide if a potential borrower is worth the risk of the loan.

The 1003 loan application is a form from the Federal National Mortgage Association, or Fannie Mae. Fannie Mae and [Freddie Mac (Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp.)](/freddiemac) are lending endeavors made by Congress that purchase and guarantee mortgages. As both require the utilization of Form 1003 — or its Freddie Mac equivalent, Form 65 — for any mortgage that they consider for purchase, it is easier for lenders to utilize the fitting form at the beginning than try to transfer information from a proprietary form to a 1003 form when the opportunity arrives to sell the mortgage.

## Special Considerations

The mortgage application is just one step in the loan application process. Borrowers need to initially evaluate their finances. Lenders prefer to see a [debt-to-income (DTI) ratio](/dti) that doesn't surpass 35%, without any than 28% of that debt going toward servicing your mortgage. Thus, for instance, on the off chance that you earn $85,000 every year, your housing expenses shouldn't surpass $2,480 per month. Housing expenses incorporate the potential mortgage payment as well as the home insurance, property taxes, and condominium fees, if applicable.

Lenders likewise will charge for [private mortgage insurance](/mortgage-insurance) (PMI) on the off chance that the borrower has a [down payment](/down_payment) that is under 20% of the purchase price of the home. PMI safeguards the lender in case the borrower can't pay off the loan.

Along these lines, taking into account the size of your down payment is important. A more modest down payment will lead to a bigger month to month mortgage payment. On the other hand, in the event that the borrower puts down no less than 20%, the regularly scheduled payment is less and there would be no month to month PMI payment. [Conventional mortgages](/conventionalmortgage) generally require at least 5%, while [Federal Housing Administration (FHA) mortgages](/fhaloan) ask for 3.5%. [Veterans Affairs (VA) mortgages](/valoan) don't frequently require anything down.

The next step is to approach a lender for pre-qualification**,** which incorporates a credit check that assists the lender with evaluating the amount to loan you. When you have your pre-qualification letter, it permits you to begin shopping for homes.
