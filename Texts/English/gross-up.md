## What Is a Gross-Up?

A gross-up is an extra amount of money added to a payment to cover the income taxes the beneficiary will owe on the payment.

The gross-up is most frequently found in executive compensation plans. For instance, a company might consent to pay an executive's relocation expenses plus a gross-up to offset the expected income taxes that will be owed on the salary payment.

## How a Gross-Up Works

Grossing up a paycheck is basically computing a paycheck yet in reverse. Normally, employees are initially paid a gross paycheck amount from which deductions are subsequently kept (like taxes, retirement contributions, and social security) and the employees are paid the remainder as net pay. In a gross-up situation, the ideal net pay is organized in advance and the gross is adequately increased to guarantee that the ideal net pay is given to the employee.

As a practice, grossing up is most frequently done for one-time payments, for example, repayments for relocation expenses or end of year bonuses. Contingent upon a company's calculation method, an employee might in any case have an extra [tax liability](/taxliability).

In truth, grossing up is generally a question of semantics. It just rehashes an employee's salary as the take-home pay as opposed to gross pay before tax withholding. A few companies favor the gross-up method, particularly while compensating C-level executives and other high-paid employees. The procedure can to some extent cover salary expenses during financial reporting.

## Instance of Grossing-Up

For instance, consider a company offering an employee who has an income tax rate of 20% a net salary of $100,000 yearly. The formula for grossing up is as per the following:

- **Gross pay** = net pay/(1 - tax rate)

The employer must gross-up the salary paid to the employee to $125,000 to account for the required 20% paid on income â€” on the grounds that $125,000 x (1 - 0.20) = $100,000.

## The Gross-Up Controversy

With executive pay going under increased examination considering the 2008 financial crisis, grossing up has developed as an inexorably famous method for paying executives. Companies can proficiently increase executive pay by 30% or more, without it being apparent in their financial statements since those statements show just what employees net.

Nonetheless, several companies have stood out as truly newsworthy for utilizing gross-up strategies with horrifying and dubious outcomes. In 2005, counseling firm Towers Perrin directed a study uncovering that 77% of companies, while evolving management, grossed up [severance packages](/severence-package) for active executives. One such company was Gillette, purchased by Procter and Gamble in 2005. Gillette's leaving [chief executive officer](/ceo) (CEO), James Kilts, received $13 million in gross-up payments in his severance package.

What's more, with the rise of the gig economy, telecommute (WFH), and business, grossing up is difficult to decide since the total income of the individual is obscure as it remembers different surges of income for expansion to the full-time positions.
