# Coefficient of Determination
## What Is the Coefficient of Determination?

The coefficient of determination is a statistical measurement that looks at how differences in a single variable can be made sense of by the difference in a subsequent variable, while predicting the outcome of a given event. In other words, this coefficient, which is more generally known as R-squared (or R^2^), surveys how strong the linear relationship is between two variables, and is vigorously relied on by researchers while leading trend analysis. To refer to an illustration of its application, this coefficient might mull over the accompanying question: assuming a lady becomes pregnant on a certain day, what is the probability that she could deliver her baby on a particular date from now on? In this scenario, this metric means to work out the correlation between two related events: origination and birth.

## Understanding the Coefficient of Determination

The coefficient of determination is a measurement used to make sense of how much variability of one factor can be made by its relationship another related factor. This correlation, known as the "[goodness of fit](/decency of-fit)," is represented as a value somewhere in the range of 0.0 and 1.0. A value of 1.0 demonstrates a perfect fit, and is in this manner a highly reliable model for future forecasts, while a value of 0.0 would show that the calculation neglects to model the data by any means accurately. However, a value of 0.20, for instance, recommends that 20% of the dependent variable is predicted by the independent variable, while a value of 0.50 proposes that half of the dependent variable is predicted by the independent variable, etc.

## Graphing the Coefficient of Determination

On a graph, the decency of fit measures the distance between a fitted line and the data points that are all scattered throughout the diagram. The tight set of data will have a regression line that is close to the points and have a high level of fit, implying that the distance between the line and the data is small. Albeit a solid match has a R^2^ close to 1.0, this number alone can't determine whether the data points or predictions are biased. It likewise doesn't let analysts know whether the coefficient of determination value is intrinsically positive or negative. It is at the discretion of the user to assess the importance of this correlation, and how it very well might be applied with regards to future trend examinations.

## Highlights
- The coefficient of determination is a complex thought centered on the statistical analysis of models for data.
- This measure is represented as a value somewhere in the range of 0.0 and 1.0, where a value of 1.0 shows a perfect fit, and is consequently a highly reliable model for future forecasts, while a value of 0.0 would demonstrate that the model neglects to model the data by any means accurately.
- The coefficient of determination is utilized to make sense of how much variability of one factor can be made by its relationship another factor.
- This coefficient is normally known as R-squared (or R^2^), and is in some cases referred to as the "decency of fit."
