# Long the Basis
## What Is Long the Basis?

Long the basis is a trading strategy where an investor who claims or has bought a [commodity](/commodity) hedges their investment, or gives themselves somewhat buffer against potential market changes, by selling [futures contracts](/futurescontract) on that commodity. Making a such move gives a guaranteed price at which they might sell their commodities in the event that the market price moves against their underlying position.

## Seeing Long the Basis

Long the basis, by definition, means the investor must be [bullish](/bull) on a specific commodity and generally is looking to [hedge](/hedge) their bullish position.

For example, a gold-mining company keeps a huge position in the precious metal. In any case, the price of gold is defenseless to market pressures and is probably going to change on occasion. To hedge against adverse changes, the company might decide to buffer its bullish position through the sale of [futures](/futures) contracts and consequently lock in a guaranteed scope of value.

Interestingly, a trader who is bearish on a commodity might go into a [short the basis](/shortthebasis) trade. Shorting the basis suggests the investor will be taking a [short position](/short) in the commodity and a long position in the futures contract. This strategy is utilized to hedge a position by locking in a future spot or cash price and consequently eliminating the vulnerability of rising prices.

Both the long-the-basis and the short-the-basis trades are [basis trading](/basis-trading) strategies. Basis trading connects with a trading strategy where a trader accepts that two comparable securities are mispriced relative to one another, and the trader will take restricting long and short positions in the two securities to profit from the [convergence](/convergence) of their values.

> A bullish investor hoping to hedge their position would be viewed as long the basis; a bearish investor hoping to hedge would be viewed as short the basis.

## Illustration of Long the Basis

It is August at the Smith family farm, and the Smiths have agreed to sell their soybean crop to a wholesaling group, Soy Tofu. The contracted price is $400 a ton, which is the current cash price. The wholesalers think they have gotten a reasonable setup, accepting that soybean prices will rise before long. Notwithstanding, they likewise are a bit worried about how might affect their profit, at resale, on the off chance that bean prices were to fall.

Accordingly, Soy Tofu chooses to sell soybean futures at $425 per ton. The wholesalers are presently long the basis, meaning they are [long](/long) soybeans and short soybean futures. In the event that the price falls, being long the basis will guarantee a great price at which they can resell. Their [cost basis](/costbasis), in this case, is negative $25, or cash of $400, minus futures of $425.

The wholesalers are making a trade-off, notwithstanding. They are trading price risk for [basis risk](/basisrisk) â€” that is, the risk that the price of soybeans and soybean futures won't move in lockstep. The wholesalers will profit assuming the differential among soybean and soybean futures prices limits. Nonetheless, an extending of this differential will bring about a loss.

Instead of for hedging, the wholesalers may likewise decide to go long the basis by guessing about the price differential among soybeans and soybean futures. Maybe they accept neighborhood prices for soybeans will rise. In the event that the price comes to $450 while the futures price advances just to $430, their [net proceeds](/netproceeds) due to the limiting of the basis will be $25 on the soybeans, and negative $5 on the soybean futures, for a total of $20. Their bullish bet will have paid off.

Notwithstanding, assuming that the price of soybeans stays at $400, while the futures price rises to $435, the basis will be negative $35. The enlarging of the basis from the previous negative $25 will bring about a loss of $10 per ton.

Eminently, it is likewise feasible for the Smith family to go long on the basis, also. To do as such, they would hold their soybeans in storage and sell soybean futures. The family might decide to do this in the event that they think neighborhood soybean prices will rise.
