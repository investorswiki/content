# Callable Swap
## What Is a Callable Swap?

A callable swap is a contract between two [counterparties](/counterparty) in which the exchange of one stream of future interest payments is exchanged for one more in view of a predefined principal amount. These swaps typically include the exchange of the [cash flows](/cashflow) from a fixed interest rate for the cash flows of a floating interest rate.

The difference between this swap and a customary interest rate swap is that the payer of the fixed rate has the right, yet not the obligation, to end the contract before its [expiration date](/expirationdate). One more term for this derivative is a cancellable swap.

A swap where the payer of the variable or floating rate has the right, yet not the obligation, to end the contract before expiration is called a [putable swap](/putable-swap).

## How a Callable Swap Works

There is little difference between a [interest rate swap](/interestrateswap) and a callable swap other than the call feature. Notwithstanding, this directs an alternate pricing mechanism which accounts for the risk the payer of the [floating rate](/floatinginterestrate) must take. The call feature makes it more costly than a plain vanilla interest rate swap. This cost implies the fixed rate payer will pay a higher interest rate and potentially need to pay extra funds to purchase the call feature.

Albeit a large number of the mechanics are comparative, a callable swap isn't equivalent to a swap option, which is better known as a [swaption](/swaption).

## Why Use a Callable Swap?

An investor could pick a callable swap on the off chance that they anticipate that the rate should change in a manner that would adversely influence the [fixed rate](/fixedinterestrate) payer. For instance, assuming the fixed rate is 4.5% and interest rates on comparative derivatives with comparative maturities fall to maybe 3.5%, the fixed rate payer could call the swap to [refinance](/refinance) at that lower rate.

Callable swaps frequently accompany callable debt issues, particularly when the fixed rate payer is more interested in debt cost as opposed to the [maturity](/maturity) of that debt.

One more motivation to utilize this [derivative](/derivative) is to safeguard against the early termination of a business arrangement or asset. For instance, a company gets financing for a factory or land at a [variable interest rate](/variableinterestrate). They may then try to lock in a fixed rate with a swap in the event that they accept there is a chance it will sell the financed asset right on time due to a change in plans.

The extra cost of the call feature is like a [insurance policy](/insurance-inclusion) for the financing.
