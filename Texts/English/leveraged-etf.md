# Leveraged ETF
## What Is a Leveraged ETF?

A leveraged exchange-traded fund (ETF) is a marketable security that utilizes [financial derivatives](/subsidiary) and debt to intensify the returns of an underlying index. While a traditional [exchange-traded fund](/etf) typically tracks the securities in its underlying index on a coordinated basis, a leveraged ETF might aim for a 2:1 or 3:1 ratio.

Leveraged ETFs are accessible for most indexes, like the [Nasdaq 100 Index](/nasdaq100) and the [Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA)](/djia).

## Leveraged ETFs Explained

ETFs are funds that contain a basket of securities that are from the index that they track. For instance, ETFs that track the [S&P 500 Index](/sp500) will contain the 500 stocks in the S&P. Typically, on the off chance that the S&P moves 1%, the ETF will likewise move by 1%.

A leveraged ETF that tracks the S&P could utilize financial products and debt that amplify each 1% gain in the S&P to a 2% or 3% gain. The degree of the gain is contingent on the amount of leverage utilized in the ETF. Utilizing is an investing strategy that utilizations borrowed funds to buy options and futures to increase the impact of price developments.

Be that as it may, leverage can work the other way also and lead to losses for investors. On the off chance that the underlying index falls by 1%, the loss is amplified by the leverage. Leverage is a blade that cuts both ways meaning it can lead to huge gains, however it can likewise lead to critical losses. Investors ought to know about the risks to leveraged ETFs since the risk of losses is far higher than those from traditional investments.

The management fees and [transaction costs](/transactioncosts) associated with leveraged ETFs can decrease the fund's return.

## The Leverage in Leveraged ETFs

A leveraged ETF could utilize derivatives, for example, [options contracts](/calloption) to amplify the exposure to a specific index. It doesn't intensify the annual returns of an index however all things being equal, tracks the daily changes. Options contracts grant an investor ability to trade an underlying asset without the obligation that they must buy or sell the security. Options contracts have an expiration date by which any action must be completed.

Options have upfront fees — known as premiums — associated with them and permit investors to buy a large number of shares of a security. Accordingly, options layered with an investment, for example, stocks can add to the gains of holding the stock investment. Along these lines, leveraged ETFs use options to add to the gains of traditional ETFs. Portfolio managers can likewise borrow to buy extra shares of securities, further adding to their positions yet in addition adding to the potential for gains.

A leveraged [inverse ETF](/inverse-etf) utilizes leverage to bring in money when the underlying index is declining in value. At the end of the day, an inverse ETF ascends while the underlying index is falling permitting investors to profit from a bearish market or market declines.

## The Costs of Leverage

Along with management and transaction fee expenses, there can be different costs engaged with leveraged exchange-traded funds. Leveraged ETFs have higher fees than non-leveraged ETFs in light of the fact that premiums should be paid to buy the options contracts as well as the cost of borrowing — or margining. Many leveraged ETFs have expense ratios of 1% or more.

Regardless of the high expense ratios associated with leveraged ETFs, these funds are frequently more affordable than different forms of margin. Trading on [margin](/marginaccount) includes a broker lending money to a customer so the borrower can purchase stocks or different securities with the securities held as collateral for the loan. The broker additionally charges an interest rate for the margin loan.

For instance, short selling, which includes borrowing shares from a broker to wager on a downward move, can carry fees of 3% or more on the amount borrowed. The utilization of margin to buy stock can turn out to be also costly, and can result in [margin calls](/margincall) should the position start losing money. A margin call happens when a broker requests more money to support the account in the event that the collateral securities lose value.

## Leveraged ETFs as Short-term Investments

Leveraged ETFs are typically utilized by traders who wish to hypothesize on an index, or to exploit the index's short-term momentum. Due to the high-risk, high-cost structure of leveraged ETFs, they are rarely utilized as long-term investments.

For instance, options contracts have expiration dates and are typically traded in the short term. It is challenging to hold long-term investments in leveraged ETFs in light of the fact that the derivatives used to make the leverage are not long-term investments. Thus, traders frequently hold positions in leveraged ETFs for just a couple of days or less. Assuming leveraged ETFs are held for long periods, the returns might be very unique in relation to the underlying index.
