# Market Value Added (MVA)
## What Is Market Value Added?

Market value added (MVA) is a calculation that shows the difference between the market value of a company and the capital contributed by all investors, the two bondholders and shareholders. At the end of the day, it is the market value of debt and equity minus all capital claims held against the company. It is calculated as:

**MVA = V - K**

where MVA is the market value added of the firm, V is the market value of the firm, including the value of the firm's equity and debt (its [enterprise value](/enterprisevalue)), and K is the total amount of capital invested in the firm.

MVA is closely connected with the concept of [economic value added](/eva) (EVA), addressing the [net present value](/npv) (NPV) of a series of EVA values.

## Understanding Market Value Added (MVA)

At the point when investors need to look in the engine to perceive how a company performs for its shareholders, they first gander at MVA. A company's MVA is an indication of its capacity to increase shareholder value after some time. A high MVA is evidence of effective management and strong operational capacities. A low MVA can mean the value of management's activities and investments is not exactly the value of the [capital contributed](/contributed-capital) by shareholders. A negative MVA means the management's activities and investments have lessened and switched the value of capital contributed by shareholders.

## MVA Reflects Commitment to Shareholder Value

Companies with a high MVA are appealing to investors not just due to the greater likelihood they will create positive returns yet additionally in light of the fact that it is a decent indication they have strong leadership and sound governance. MVA can be deciphered as the amount of wealth that management has made for investors far beyond their investment in the company.

Companies that are able to maintain or increase MVA over the long run normally draw in greater investment, which keeps on improving MVA. The MVA may really downplay the performance of a company since it doesn't account for cash payouts, like dividends and stock buybacks, made to shareholders. MVA may not be a reliable indicator of management performance during strong bull markets when stock prices rise overall.
