# Extra Expense Coverage
## What Is Additional Expense Coverage?

Extra expense coverage will be coverage that gives funds to expenses above the thing the policyholder was paying before a claim was made. It is given to a policyholder, assuming certain criteria are met, and may make some maximum memories period over which benefits can be received and a [policy limit](/aggregatelimit) of the amount of coverage that will be given.

## Grasping Additional Expense Coverage

For an expense to be considered for repayment by an insurer under a homeowner's policy, it must meet a certain number of capabilities. The expense must be viewed as fundamental, must be incurred by the policyholder, must be to proceed with a normal standard of living, and must be brought about by the insurable event happening. For instance, on account of a their homeowner property harmed in a fire, extra expense [coverage](/insurance-coverage) may cover expenses connected with extra costs for food, clothing, and transportation.

## How Additional Expense Coverage Works

Before giving funds to extra expense coverage, insurers will try to lay out a baseline of what the policyholder was paying for ordinary expenses before a claim was made. This [baseline](/baseline) is utilized to decide if the costs that the policyholder stated in a claim are above what they normally pay.

For instance, if the[ homeowner](/homeowners-insurance) burns through $300 a month on fuel to go to work before a fire harmed the property and $400 a month after a claim was documented, the $100 would be viewed as extra. In any case, in the event that a policyholder paid $100 every month for cell telephone use and this cost didn't change due to the fire, then, at that point, the insurer is probably not going to cover this expense since it didn't surpass the baseline.

## Special Considerations

Insurers will probably require the policyholder to give receipts to expenses. Policyholders may not recover expenses in the event that a receipt isn't given. For instance, in the event that a policyholder briefly moves into a loft while repairs are made to their home, yet the condo doesn't charge for utilities, the policyholder will not have the option to collect insurance proceeds for utility expenses.

For commercial policies, this type of coverage would pay extra costs in excess of normal operating expenses that a business would cause to continue to work while its property or plant is being fixed or supplanted under the covered claim.

Extra expense coverage can be purchased notwithstanding or rather than [business income coverage](/businessincome), contingent upon the size and needs of the organization. Extra expense coverage kicks in after a disaster has happened and the business has moved to an alternate location or has needed to change its customary mode of working. Such coverage can be purchased as a separate insurance policy or as a rider to an existing policy.
