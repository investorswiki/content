## What Is Bitcoin Unlimited?

Bitcoin Unlimited was a proposed fork from the Bitcoin blockchain after the community started examining concerns over sluggish transaction times and rising fees, and that would permit Bitcoin to handle more transactions and reduce fees. It would have achieved this by considering an increase in the block size. The fork was never initiated, yet further concern and discussion prompted possible forks.

The Bitcoin Unlimited project joined the Bitcoin Cash (BCH) project and made a client for BCH. Bitcoin Cash changed its name to Bitcoin ABC (Adjustable Block-size Cap) in 2018, then, at that point, rebranded as eCash (XEC) in May 2021. Subsequently, in 2022, Bitcoin Unlimited is a client that supports XEC.

## Grasping Bitcoin Unlimited

Bitcoin Unlimited was an endeavor to address issues the Bitcoin blockchain issues emerging at that point. The Bitcoin network records transactions on a shared ledger, called a blockchain. Rather than a single database, [the ledger](/disseminated ledgers) is stored on a great many various PCs, where it very well may be freely checked by any spectator.

A program generally alluded to as a consensus mechanism checks transactions, and individuals facilitating the program and software are called miners. At that point, another block was made to record the next transaction about at regular intervals on the Bitcoin blockchain.

> It actually takes the Bitcoin blockchain around ten minutes to open another block, however applications running on different layers have been designed to speed up the interaction and reduce transaction fees.

This system is less efficient than legacy systems since it can handle less transactions than a centralized database. As Bitcoin payments turned out to be more famous, the network started to arrive at its limits, causing transaction times and fees to increase. Bitcoin Unlimited was one of several proposed software upgrades that would reduce network congestion by expanding Bitcoin's transaction limits.

### History

In 2015, Perter Rizun presented and started examining a proposal on Bitcoin Forum to change the block size and make a fork called Bitcoin Unlimited. Energized by the discussion and support, Rizun kept working on and advancing Bitcoin Unlimited. Acquiring some support from the community, Bitcoin Unlimited was made in any case failed to become famous.

In any case, the block size dispute at last caused the Bitcoin network to split in August 2017. Most miners and users stayed on the old network, which kept the block size limit at 1 MB. A subsequent cryptocurrency, Bitcoin Cash, was made by those users and miners who changed their software to take into consideration bigger blocks.

> For a fork to find success, it should be executed by the community. On account of Bitcoin Unlimited, miners didn't transfer the proposed code to their machines, rather liking to remain with the original Bitcoin blockchain. This is one of the manners in which a community directs the development of a blockchain.

Bitcoin Unlimited didn't vanish as many failed forks do. At the point when the BitcoinCash (BCH) fork arose, the Unlimited team chose to go along with them yet made a client to support the network.

Bitcoin Cash changed its name to Bitcoin Cash ABC in 2018, then, at that point, rebranded as eCash (XEC) in May 2021, so Bitcoin Unlimited is a client that supports XEC.

## How Is Bitcoin Unlimited Different?

Blocks are documents where Bitcoin transactions are permanently recorded, similar to a ledger page or record book. Each time a block is completed, it gives way to the next block in the [blockchain](/blockchain). In the Bitcoin network, each block is limited to one megabyte of transaction data like clockwork.

Bitcoin Unlimited suggested that the size of blocks ought to be increased and that [miners](/bitcoin-mining) — people and companies that give the computing power to record Bitcoin transactions — would step up to increase capacity.

Bitcoin Unlimited is still under active development, yet rather than being a blockchain, cryptocurrency, or payment system, it is an "execution of the Bitcoin client software" that supports Bitcoin ABC and eCash.

## Features
- Bitcoin Unlimited was planned to further develop transaction speed through scale.
- It recommended that the size of blocks ought to be increased and that miners would step up to increase capacity.
- Bitcoin Unlimited exists as a client for BitcoinABC, which utilizes the cryptocurrency eCash.

### Is Free Bitcoin Real?

### Will Bitcoin Be Unlimited?
