## What Is Per-Share Basis?

The per-share basis is a measurement utilized in the financial world to represent the quantity of something for one share of a company's [stock](/stock). Such measures are utilized in the analysis and valuation of a company. Instances of this incorporate the accompanying:

## Per-Share Basis Explained

The per-share basis is an intently watched metric that can be utilized by investors to make heads or tails of a company's profitability per unit of shareholder ownership. To measure something on a per share basis, take the total quantity of anything that you are measuring and gap it by the number of [outstanding shares](/outstandingshares) in the company. For instance, in the event that the earnings of a company reach $2 million, and there are 4 million shares outstanding, the earnings on a per-share basis are $0.50 per share.

The per-share basis, when applied accurately, can be helpful in checking out at underlying factors in a company's profitability. It can likewise be an approach to sussing out qualities or shortcomings that would somehow be concealed by just seeing overall outcomes.

## Real World Example of Cash Flow Per Share

Cash flow per share is ordinarily one of the main measures of profitability, as [net income](/netincome) can fluctuate in view of various applications of accounting rules and in response to accounting changes and corporate repetitions. While cash flow can emerge out of a number of measures - including [EBITDA](/ebitda) (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization), [free cash flow](/freecashflowpershare), and different areas - it is overall less effectively controlled and hence a decent way to asses profitability.

- **Cash flow per share = (Cash flow - Preferred dividends)/Shares outstanding**

Consider a made up eCommerce Company called SellBuy, which reported overall second-quarter cash flow growth from the main quarter. However, what might be said about on a per-share basis?

During the second quarter of 2018, SellBuy reported cash flow of $5 million and [preferred dividends](/preferreddividend) of $600,000, outperforming overall outcomes in the principal quarter, when it reported cash flow of $4 million and preferred dividends of $200,000. Apparently, on the surface, that SellBuy increased its cash flow quarter-to-quarter and had subsequently shown some overall financial improvement in its [quarterly results](/earningsreport).

Yet, is that accurate while seeing what unfolded on a per-share basis? Did cash flow really develop on a quarter-to-quarter basis? In this model, during the primary quarter, SellBuy had a total of 8 million shares outstanding and in the subsequent quarter, it had 10 million shares outstanding. In the principal quarter, the cash flow was $3,800,000 (cash flow of $4 million - dividends of $200,000). In the subsequent quarter, the cash flow was $4,400,000 (cash flow of $5 million - dividends of $600,000).

Utilizing the calculation, the cash flow per share in the main quarter was as per the following:

- **$3,800,000/8 million shares = $0.475**

The cash flow per share in the subsequent quarter was as per the following:

- **$4,400,000/10 million shares = $0.44**

The model shows that while SellBuy might have created greater cash flow in the subsequent quarter, on a cash-flow-per-share basis, it really declined from the principal quarter, due to the way that it had more shares outstanding.
