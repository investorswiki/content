# Reconversion
## What Is a Reconversion?

An IRA reconversion — or [recharacterization](/recharacterization) — permitted investors to reverse a Roth IRA conversion by shifting the funds once more into a [traditional IRA](/traditionalira). Nonetheless, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 restricted the practice. Today, a Roth IRA conversion is irrevocable — when you transfer funds into a Roth, you can't fix the move.

## Grasping Reconversion and Recharacterization

In the past, a person could recharacterize a Roth IRA conversion back into a traditional IRA account. Notwithstanding, one of the provisions in the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act restricted the practice.

Reconversion was well known since it offered people a method for fixing a Roth IRA conversion that didn't go as expected. Here is a model. Let's assume you convert $50,000 from a traditional IRA into a Roth IRA. The whole $50,000 is taxable in the time of the conversion since you're moving money from a pretax traditional IRA into an after-tax Roth. Keep in mind, you pay taxes on distributions from traditional IRAs. In any case, qualified Roth IRA withdrawals are without tax — so you really want to settle those taxes when the money goes into the account.

Presently, accept the stock market failed after you did the conversion and the IRA has declined in value to $25,000 before the tax-filing cutoff time. Toward the finish of that tax year, you would in any case owe taxes on the total changed over amount — $50,000 in our model. As such, you would owe tax on $50,000 for changing over completely to a Roth, yet you would just have $25,000 in the account toward the year's end. The Roth IRA conversion would appear to be a big misstep in a situation like this.

In the past, investors could recharacterize the recently made Roth IRA back into a traditional IRA, in this way escaping a precarious situation. Be that as it may, reconversion is presently not a choice; when you do a Roth IRA conversion, there's no way but forward.

## IRA Contribution Recharacterization

While you can never again fix a Roth IRA conversion, you can recharacterize a Roth IRA contribution into a traditional IRA contribution as well as the other way around. For example, on the off chance that you contributed $4,000 to a Roth IRA, you could recharacterize it as a $4,000 traditional IRA contribution.

Recharacterizing a contribution permits you to change your brain or right an error. For instance, you could need to recharacterize in the event that you contributed to a Roth and later realized your income was too high to do as such. Essentially, you could recharacterize a contribution in the event that you figure out you can't deduct your traditional IRA contribution — or you needn't bother with any more tax deductions that year.

> The year you made the primary contribution is the tax year to which that contribution relates — not really the year you actually contributed. Recall that you generally have until tax day (normally April 15) to make an earlier year contribution.

You have until the due date for filing your federal income tax return (counting any extensions) to recharacterize a contribution. Also, gave you recharacterize your contribution by this cutoff time, you can regard the contribution like you made it straightforwardly to the subsequent IRA. That means you can really overlook your contribution to the principal IRA.

## FAQ
### How Do You Recharacterize an IRA Contribution?
To recharacterize an IRA contribution, ask your IRA custodian to transfer the amount — including the contribution and related earnings — to an alternate type of IRA. The recharacterization can happen inside a similar institution (in the event that you utilize one custodian for the two IRAs) or by means of a legal administrator to-legal administrator transfer on the off chance that various providers keep up with your IRAs. You can generally do the administrative work online or utilizing your provider's all's standard forms.
### How Do You Allocate Earnings When Recharacterizing IRA Contributions?
If you recharacterize an IRA contribution, you need to transfer the contribution and any earnings (or losses) connected with those funds. The simplest method for deciding the right amount is to ask your IRA provider. They will actually want to let you know the earnings (or losses) that are attributable to the contribution you need to recharacterize.However, suppose the contribution you need to recharacterize addresses the whole IRA balance (e.g., you've made just one contribution to that IRA). In that case, you can transfer the whole amount without agonizing over the earnings or losses.
### The amount Can I Contribute to My IRA?
For the 2021 and 2022 tax years, you can contribute up to $6,000 to your Roth and traditional IRAs. Assuming that you're 50 or more established, you can make an extra $1,000 [catch-up contribution](/catchupcontribution).
