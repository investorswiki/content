Since it is required to conform to regulations, tZero can position itself as a provider of guidance, clearing, and verification services to different companies hoping to release tokens to raise funds.

While companies hoping to raise funds through the sale of tokens could build their own platforms, and accordingly cut out the middleman, this would require substantial investment and aptitude.
