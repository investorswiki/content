# Stated Income/Stated Asset Mortgage (SISA)
## What Is Stated Income/Stated Asset Mortgage (SISA)?

A stated income-stated asset mortgage (SISA) loan application allows the borrower to declare their income without verification by the lender. These loans were intended to ease the application cycle for purchasers who have incomes that are hard to document, for example, the self-employed and the individuals who rely upon tips as a significant portion of their income.

SISA loans are one loan in a category of products called Alt-A. SISA loans are also known as [no income-no asset](/nina) (NINA) loans and liar loans. Released lending requirements allowed the SISA loan to play an influential job in the 2008 subprime financial crisis.

## Understanding Stated Income/Stated Asset Mortgage (SISA)

The stated income-stated asset mortgage (SISA) originated as a device for potential homeowners in specific financial situations to apply for a mortgage. Self-employed individuals, for example, frequently maximize tax deductions to reduce their [adjusted gross income](/agi) (AGI) and hence have access to cash flows which may not appear on individual tax returns.

Usually, lower AGIs would make these borrowers less attractive to lenders. The SISA loan is also intended to help purchasers whose income may come as tips, or other unconventional cash payments.

Initially, these loans had severe conditions to offset the risk introduced to the lender by brought down income disclosure requirements. SISA borrowers faced a combination of higher interest rates, more substantial down payments, and higher [credit score](/credit_score) requirements than traditional loans required. The borrower could have to have considerable cash reserves available in their bank accounts. Also, the loan could limit the new month to month mortgage payment to a particular percentage over their current housing payment.

Presently, these products are the setting for borrowers seeking to purchase investment properties.
