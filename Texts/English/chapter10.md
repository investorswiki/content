# Chapter 10
## What Is Chapter 10?

Chapter 10 was a type of corporate [bankruptcy](/bankruptcy) filing that was eventually retired due to its complexity. Chapter 10, initially known as "Chapter X," listed the processes and procedures for liquidations including corporations. It was utilized to determine whether a company justified [reorganization](/reorganization) and restoration to long-term feasibility or ought to be closed down and [liquidated](/liquidation).

Chapter 10 was presented as part of the Bankruptcy Act of 1898 as a plan for rearranging monetarily troubled companies and afterward incorporated into the Chandler Act of 1938. It was disposed of by the Bankruptcy Reform Act in 1978. Its most valuable thoughts were moved into Chapter XI, which later turned into the modern [Chapter 11](/chapter11).

## Grasping Chapter 10

Bankruptcy offers an individual or business attempting to repay outstanding debts a chance to begin once more. Creditors are precluded from gathering any money they are owed, on account of a [automatic stay](/automaticstay) forced by the [bankruptcy court](/bankruptcy-court). The distressed company, the debtor, is given the option to either enter liquidation, the most common way of finishing a business and distributing its assets to petitioners, or work out a satisfactory repayment plan and work.

In the United States there are several unique categories of liquidations. Chapter 10 was one of the ways accessible, offering a system for [financially distressed](/financial_distress) companies to [restructure their debt](/debtrestructuring). This rendition of bankruptcy offered the debtor a chance at a new beginning, gave it satisfied its obligations under the plan of reorganization.

One important element of Chapter 10 was that it required the bankruptcy courts to constantly act to the greatest advantage of [shareholders](/shareholder). Such a directive effectively made the most common way of determining whether liquidation or reorganization was the better option — and afterward enacting either plan — both costly and complex.

Chapter 10 gave such wide-ranging powers and obligations to court-delegated [trustees](/trustee) that company management was basically displaced. As management was not engaged with the most common way of choosing whether to rearrange or liquidate, trustees or other interested parties designated by the court needed to swear that they had no personal interest in the outcome as a condition of their service. This concept was known as "disinterestedness."

## Chapter 10 versus Chapter 11

Chapter 10 was viewed as so complex, tedious, and possibly costly that it acted as a hindrance to bowing out of all financial obligations for corporations. Its rules were so wide ranging and particularly nitty gritty that corporations frequently picked Chapter 11 all things being equal.

> Chapter 11, which was initially planned for small, privately possessed businesses and individuals, was made a reasonable bankruptcy option for corporations following a series of court fights.

In a Chapter 10 bankruptcy management is displaced, and a court-delegated manager or trustee supervises the reorganization or restructuring process. This is generally not the situation in a Chapter 11 filing. Chapter 11 offers the advantage of not eliminating a company's management, and that means it can play a bigger part in executing a reorganization.

Chapter 11 likewise permits management to have to a greater extent a say in how creditors are reimbursed and the way that assets are liquidated. Since it is somewhat more straightforward, a Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing turned into the preferred option over a Chapter 10 for debtors and their legal counselors, as well as creditors, even assuming that shareholders never again have fundamental protection.
