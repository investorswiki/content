## What Is Deregulation?

Deregulation is the reduction or elimination of government power in a specific industry, for the most part enacted to make more competition inside the industry. Over the years, the battle between defenders of regulation and advocates of government neutrality has moved market conditions. By and large, [finance](/financial_sector) has been perhaps of the most vigorously examined industry in the United States.

## Figuring out Deregulation

Advocates of deregulation contend that overbearing legislation diminishes investment opportunity and frustrates economic growth, hurting more than it makes a difference. Without a doubt, the U.S. financial sector wasn't vigorously regulated until the [stock market crash of 1929](/stock-market-crash-1929) and the subsequent [Great Depression](/great_depression). In response to the country's greatest financial crisis in its history, Franklin D. Roosevelt's presidential administration enacted many forms of financial regulation, including the [Securities Exchange Acts of 1933](/securitiesact1933) and 1934 and the U.S. Banking Act of 1933, otherwise known as the Glass-Steagall Act.

The Securities Exchange Acts required all publicly traded companies to reveal applicable financial data and laid out the [Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)](/sec) to oversee securities markets. The Glass-Steagall Act restricted a financial institution from taking part in both [commercial](/commercialbank) and [investment banking](/investment-banking). This reform legislation depended on the conviction that the quest for profit by large, national banks must have spikes in place to stay away from crazy and manipulative behavior that would lead financial markets in unfavorable headings.

Over the years, defenders of deregulation consistently worked on these safeguards until the [Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010](/dodd-frank-financial-regulatory-reform-bill), which forced the most clearing legislation on the banking industry since the 1930s. How could they make it happen?

## The History of Deregulation

In 1986, the [Federal Reserve (Fed)](/federalreservebank) reworked the Glass-Steagall Act and concluded that 5% of a commercial bank's revenue could be from investment banking activity. In 1996, that level was pushed up to 25%. The next year, the Fed decided that commercial banks could participate in [underwriting](/underwriting), the method by which corporations and governments raise capital in debt and equity markets. In 1994, the Riegle-Neal Interstate Banking and Branching Efficiency Act was passed, correcting the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956 and the Federal Deposit Insurance Act, to permit [interstate banking](/interstate-banking) and spreading.

Afterward, in 1999, the Financial Services Modernization Act, or [Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act](/glba), was passed under the watch of the Clinton administration and overturned the Glass-Steagall Act totally. In 2000, the [Commodity Futures Modernization Act](/cfma) precluded the [Commodity Futures Trading Commission](/cftc) from controlling credit default [swaps](/trade) and other [over-the-counter (OTC)](/otc) derivative contracts. In 2004, the SEC made changes that diminished the extent of capital that investment banks need to hold in reserves.

This binge of deregulation, notwithstanding, came to a crushing halt following the [subprime mortgage crisis of 2007](/subprime-complete implosion) and the financial crash of 2007-2008, most strikingly with the section of the Dodd-Frank Act in 2010, which restricted [subprime mortgage](/subprime_mortgage) lending and [derivatives](/derivative) trading.

Be that as it may, with the 2016 U.S. election bringing both a Republican president and Congress to power, then-President Donald Trump and his party set their sights on fixing Dodd-Frank. In May 2018, Trump marked a bill that excluded small and regional banks from Dodd-Frank's most rigid regulations and released rules put in place to prevent the sudden collapse of big banks. The bill passed the two houses of Congress with bipartisan support after fruitful dealings with Democrats.

Trump had said that he wanted to "do a big number" on Dodd-Frank, perhaps even revoking it totally. In any case, former Rep. Barney Frank (D-Mass.), its co-support, said of the new legislation, "This is certainly not a 'big number' on the bill. It's a small number." Indeed, the legislation left major bits of Dodd-Frank's rules in place and failed to roll out any improvements to the [Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB)](/consumer-financial-protection-bureau-cfpb), which was made by Dodd-Frank to police its rules.

## What Are the Effects of Deregulation?

The expected effects of deregulation are to increase investment opportunities by dispensing with limitations for new businesses to enter markets and increase competition.

Expanding competition supports innovation, and as companies enter markets and rival one another, consumers can appreciate lower prices.

Reducing the need to utilize resources and capital to agree with regulations permits corporations to invest in research and development.

Without expecting to follow commanded limitations, businesses will foster new products, set competitive prices, utilize more labor, enter foreign countries, buy new assets, and interact with consumers without the need to submit to regulations.

## The Bottom Line

Deregulation brings down costs of operations, permits more businesses to enter a market, and brings down prices for consumers. These factors can assist with invigorating productivity and lead to increased economic growth.
