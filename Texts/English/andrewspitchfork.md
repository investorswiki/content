## Grasping Andrews' Pitchfork

This technical indicator (here and there alluded to as "median line studies"), was developed by Alan Andrews. It utilizes trend lines that are made by choosing three points toward the beginning of confirmed trends, higher or lower. This is accomplished by setting the points at three consecutive pinnacles and box. Once the points are in place, a straight line that means the "median line" is drawn from the primary point through the midpoint between the upper and lower points. Upper and lower [trend lines](/trendline) are then drawn parallel to the median line.

Andrews' Pitchfork additionally utilizes trigger lines, which are trend lines that begin from point one (median line inception price) and converge with different points. A lower trigger line connects points one and three, inclining up on a rising pitchfork. An upper trigger line joins points one and two, inclining lower on a falling pitchfork. Trading signals created by the trigger lines commonly happen well after price breaks the pitchfork's upper or lower trend line. Breakouts over the upper trigger line recommend further upside, while [breakdowns](/breakdown) below the lower trigger line anticipate further downside.
