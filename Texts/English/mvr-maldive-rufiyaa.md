# Maldivian Rufiyaa (MVR)
## What Is the Maldivian Rufiyaa (MVR)?

The Maldivian rufiyaa (MVR) is the national currency of the Republic of the Maldives. The rufiyaa is comprised of 100 subunits, called laari, and is addressed by the currency symbol Rf. The name rufiyaa is derived from the Hindi Sanskrit word rupya, signifying "silver."

## Grasping the MVR

The modern rufiyaa was brought into circulation in 1947, when it supplanted the Sri Lankan rupee at a value of 1-to-1. Initially, this change simply applied to the rufiyaa's paper [banknotes](/paper_money), with its coins just beginning circulation in 1983. The laari, be that as it may, has a history in the Maldives dating back to the 1800s. Control of both the coins and the banknotes falls under the authority of the Maldives Monetary Authority, the [central bank](/centralbank) of the Maldives.

Today, the most generally utilized forms of the rufiyaa are the 1, 2, 5, 10, 25, and 50 denomination coins. For the banknotes, famous assortments incorporate the 5, 10, 20, 50, 100, 200, and 500 denomination issuances. By and large, the occupants of the Maldives utilized cowrie shells, which are derived from sea snails, as a type of currency. Afterward, strips of silver were utilized, with the earliest coins showing up during the 1600s.

Modern rufiyaa banknotes are outlined with scenes and symbols addressing the culture and history of the Maldives. The 5 rufiyaa note, for instance, incorporates individuals playing soccer, a well known distraction in the country. The 10 rufiyaa note highlights people moving while at the same time playing traditional drums, while the 100 rufiyaa note portrays local people wearing traditional apparel.

## Genuine Example of the MVR

Between August 2011 and December 2020, the value of the rufiyaa has been roughly $0.065 [U.S. dollars (USD)](/usd) for each 1 rufiyaa. Like every single national currency, the strength of the rufiyaa is at last in light of the economy of its responsible country. On account of the rufiyaa, the economy of the Maldives is intensely dependent on the travel industry, which involves generally 60% of Maldivian foreign exchange. Food products, for example, fish filets and other fish products, used to contain a relatively large share of Maldivian exports, despite the fact that their significance has blurred relative to the travel industry in recent years.

Overall, the Maldives is viewed as an example of overcoming adversity with respect to its [economic development](/economicgrowth). In 1989, the government started working toward economic reforms to grow exports and empower foreign investment. At one time, fishing was the primary driver of the Maldivian economy and gave almost 90% of the country's income. Today, the travel industry shoulders a large part of the load. A tsunami in 2004 harmed the industry, yet it has since bounced back. In the mid 1980s, the Maldives positioned as one of the main 20 most unfortunate countries in the world. Yet, as indicated by the [World Bank](/worldbank), the Republic of the Maldives has since turned into an upper-center income country.
