# Credit Default Insurance
## What Is Credit Default Insurance?

Credit default insurance is a financial agreement — typically a credit derivative, for example, a [credit default swap](/creditdefaultswap) (CDS) or a total return swap — to moderate the risk of loss from default by a borrower or bond issuer.

Credit default insurance takes into consideration the transfer of credit risk without the transfer of an underlying asset.

## Understanding Credit Default Insurance

The most widely utilized type of credit default insurance is a credit default swap (CDS). Credit default swaps transfer credit risk just; they don't transfer interest rate risk. A CDS is a financial [derivative](/derivative) that permits an investor to "swap" or offset their [credit risk](/creditrisk) with that of another investor.

In effect, a CDS is [insurance](/insurance) against non-payment. Through a CDS, a buyer can reduce the risk of their investment by shifting all or a portion of that risk onto an insurance company, or different CDS seller, in exchange for a periodic fee. For instance, assuming a lender is stressed that a borrower is going to [default](/default2) on a loan, the lender could utilize a CDS to offset or swap that risk.

Along these lines, the buyer of a credit default swap gets credit protection, while the seller of the swap guarantees the [creditworthiness](/credit-value) of the debt security. The buyer of a credit default swap will be qualified for the standard worth of the contract by the seller of the swap, should the issuer default on payments.

In the event that the debt issuer doesn't default and all works out in a good way, the CDS buyer will wind up losing some money, yet the buyer stands to lose a lot greater proportion of their investment in the event that the issuer defaults, and they have not bought a CDS. Thusly, the more the holder of a security believes its issuer is probably going to default, the more helpful a CDS is and the more the [premium](/premium) might be viewed as an advantageous investment.

### History of Credit Default Swaps

Credit default swaps have existed beginning around 1994. CDSs are not publicly traded, and they aren't required to be reported to a government agency. CDS data can be utilized by financial experts, regulators, and the media to monitor how the market sees the credit risk of any entity on which a CDS is accessible, which can measure up to that given by the credit rating agencies, including Moody's Investors Service and Standard and Poor's.

Most CDSs are recorded utilizing standard forms drafted by the [International Swaps and Derivatives Association](/isda) (ISDA), in spite of the fact that there are numerous variations. Notwithstanding the fundamental, single-name swaps, there are basket default swaps (BDSs), index CDSs, funded CDSs (additionally called credit-connected notes), as well as loan-just credit default swaps (LCDS). Notwithstanding corporations and governments, the reference entity can incorporate a [special purpose vehicle](/spv) giving asset-upheld securities.

## Credit Default Swaps versus Total Return Swaps

While credit default swaps transfer credit risk just, total return swaps transfer both credit and interest rate risk. A total return swap is a swap agreement wherein one party makes payments in view of a set rate, either fixed or variable, while the other party makes payments in light of the return of an underlying asset, which incorporates both the income it generates and any [capital gain](/capitalgain).

In total return swaps, the underlying asset, alluded to as the reference asset, is normally an equity index, a basket of loans, or bonds. The asset is owned by the party getting the set rate payment.
