## Special Considerations: Methods of Valuation

There are numerous ways a company can be valued. You'll learn about several of these methods below.

### 1. Market Capitalization

[Market capitalization](/marketcapitalization) is the simplest method of business valuation. It is calculated by multiplying the company's share price by its total number of shares outstanding. For example, as of January 3, 2018, Microsoft Inc. traded at $86.35. With a total number of shares outstanding of 7.715 billion, the company could then be valued at $86.35 x 7.715 billion = $666.19 billion.

### 2. Times Revenue Method

Under the [times revenue](/times-revenue-method) business valuation method, a stream of revenues generated over a certain period of time is applied to a multiplier which depends on the industry and economic environment. For example, a tech company might be valued at 3x revenue, while a service firm might be valued at 0.5x revenue.

### 3. Earnings Multiplier

Instead of the times revenue method, the [earnings multiplier](/earningsmultiplier) might be used to get a more accurate picture of the real value of a company, since a company's profits are a more reliable indicator of its financial success than sales revenue is. The earnings multiplier changes future profits against cash flow that could be invested at the current interest rate over the same period of time. In other words, it changes the current [P/E ratio](/price-earningsratio) to account for current interest rates.

### 4. Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Method

The [DCF method](/dcf) of business valuation is like the earnings multiplier. This method is based on projections of future cash flows, which are adjusted to get the current market value of the company. The principal difference between the discounted cash flow method and the profit multiplier method is that it takes inflation into consideration to calculate the present value.

### 5. Book Value

This is the value of shareholders' equity of a business as displayed on the balance sheet statement. The [book value](/bookvalue) is derived by deducting the total liabilities of a company from its total assets.

### 6. Liquidation Value

[Liquidation](/liquidation-value) value is the net cash that a business will receive assuming that its assets were liquidated and liabilities were paid off today.

This is in no way, shape or form an exhaustive rundown of the business valuation methods being used today. Other methods include replacement value, breakup value, asset-based valuation regardless some more.
