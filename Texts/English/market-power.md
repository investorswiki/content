# Market Power
## What Is Market Power?

Market power alludes to a company's relative ability to control the price of a thing in the marketplace by controlling the level of supply, demand or both.

A company with substantial market power can control the market price and in this manner control its profit margin, and perhaps the ability to increase impediments to possible new participants into the market. [Firms](/firm) that have market power are frequently depicted as "price creators" since they can lay out or change the marketplace price of a thing without giving up market share.

Market power is otherwise called [pricing power](/pricingpower).

## Understanding Market Power

Market power can be perceived as the level of influence that a company has on deciding market price, either for a specific product or generally inside its industry. An illustration of market power is Apple Inc. in the smartphone market. In spite of the fact that Apple can't totally control the market, its iPhone product has a substantial amount of market share and customer loyalty, so it can influence overall pricing in the smartphone market.

The ideal marketplace condition is alluded to as a state of perfect competition, where there are various companies creating contending products, and no company has any huge level of market power. In markets with perfect or close perfect competition, producers have little pricing power thus must be [price-takers](/pricetaker).

Of course, that is only a hypothetical ideal that rarely exists in real practice. Numerous countries have antitrust laws or comparable legislation intended to limit the market power of any one company. Market power is much of the time a consideration in government approval of [mergers](/mergersandacquisitions). A [merger](/megamerger) is probably not going to be approved assuming it is accepted that the subsequent company would comprise a monopoly or would turn into a company with unnecessary market power.

The scarcity of a resource or raw material can play a critical job in pricing power, even more so than the presence of rival suppliers of a product. For instance, different dangers, for example, debacles that put the oil supply at risk, lead to higher prices from petroleum companies, notwithstanding the way that rival suppliers exist and contend in the market. The narrow availability of oil, combined with the far and wide dependence on the resource across numerous industries means that oil companies hold huge pricing power over this commodity.

## An Example of Market Power

For instance, when the iPhone was initially presented by Apple, the company had substantial market power as it basically defined the smartphone and app market with the send off of the product â€” it was for a short period of time the monopoly.

At that point, the cost to get an iPhone was high and could remain so a direct result of a lack of rival gadgets. Accordingly, iPhone prices were set initially by Apple and not by the marketplace. Even as the principal contender smartphones arose, the iPhone kept on addressing the high finish of the market in terms of pricing and expected quality. As the remainder of the industry started to make up for lost time in service, quality, and availability of apps, Apple's market power decreased.

The iPhone didn't disappear from the market as additional participants showed up. Apple started to offer new models of iPhones in different varieties, including more affordable models targeted at more spending plan disapproved of consumers.

## Power Structures of Markets

There are three essential marketplace conditions that exist in terms of market power, as applied to either an overall economy or a marketplace for a specific thing.

The first is the recently noted ideal condition of perfect competition. With perfect competition, notwithstanding a number of companies delivering something similar or a comparable product, there are likewise negligible or no barriers to new companies entering the marketplace. Agricultural markets are frequently highlighted as instances of relatively perfect competition markets since it is almost outside the realm of possibilities for anybody producer of an agricultural commodity to gain a substantial amount of market power.

Something contrary to perfect competition conditions is a monopoly wherein one company totally controls the market for a product or service, or possibly a portion of the total market, and can change pricing freely. Limited [monopolies](/monopoly) are frequently considered utility companies, however their ability to raise prices is typically limited by government authority.

A [oligopoly](/oligopoly) alludes to a marketplace overwhelmed by a small number of companies, and in which there are substantial barriers to new contestants in the market. The companies in an oligopoly generally have combined, however not an individual, market power. An illustration of oligopoly is the market for cellphone service, controlled by a relatively small number of firms, in which large barriers to new participants exist.
