# Isolated Margin
Isolated Margin is the margin balance allocated to an individual position. Isolated Margin mode permits traders to deal with their risk on their individual positions by limiting the amount of margin allocated to every one. The allocated margin balance for each position can be individually adjusted.
On the off chance that a trader's position is liquidated in Isolated Margin mode, rather than their whole margin balance, just the Isolated Margin balance gets liquidated.
For instance, suppose Alice enters a long position in BTC worth 1000 USD with 10x leverage. She has a margin balance of 2000 USD yet just wishes to risk a portion of that for an individual position. She sets the Isolated Margin for the position to 100 USD. Assuming her position is liquidated, she will not lose in excess of 100 USD.
The Isolated Margin amount can be adjusted for open positions. In the event that a position in Isolated Margin mode is close to being liquidated, liquidation can be prevented by dispensing extra margin to the position.
Then again, adjusting the margin mode associated with a position after it has previously been opened is beyond the realm of possibilities. Checking the margin mode settings before entering a position is exceptionally encouraged.
One more regularly utilized margin mode on trading platforms is Cross Margin. In Cross Margin mode, the whole margin balance is shared across open positions to keep away from liquidation. On the off chance that Cross Margin is empowered, the trader risks losing their whole margin balance along with any open positions in the event of a liquidation. Any realized PnL from another position can aid a losing position that is close to being liquidated.
Ordinarily, Cross Margin is the default setting on most trading platforms, as it is the more direct approach suitable for beginner traders. Notwithstanding, Isolated Margin can likewise be helpful for additional speculative positions that require severe downside limitations.
