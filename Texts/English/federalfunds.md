## What Are Federal Funds?

Federal funds, frequently alluded to as fed funds, are excess reserves that [commercial banks](/commercialbank) and other financial institutions deposit at regional [Federal Reserve banks](/federalreservebank); these funds can be loaned, then, to other market participants with lacking cash available to meet their lending and reserve needs. The loans are unsecured and are made at a moderately low interest rate, called the federal funds rate or overnight rate, as that is the period for which most such loans are made.

## Grasping Federal Funds

Fed funds assist commercial banks with meeting their daily [reserve requirements](/requiredreserves), which is the amount of money that banks are required to keep up with at their regional Federal Reserve. Reserve requirements depend on the volume of customer deposits that each bank holds. Excess, or secondary, reserves are cash amounts held by a bank or financial institution in excess of what is required by regulators, creditors or [internal controls](/internalcontrols). For commercial banks, excess reserves are estimated against standard reserve requirement amounts set by central banking specialists. These required [reserve ratios](/reserveratio) set the base liquid [deposits](/deposit) (like cash) that must be in reserve at a bank; more is viewed as excess.

The Federal Reserve Bank sets a target rate or reach for the fed funds rate; it is adjusted periodically founded on economic and monetary conditions.

## Overnight Markets

The fed funds market operates in the United States and runs parallel to the offshore [eurodollar](/eurodollar) deposit market. Eurodollars are likewise traded overnight and the interest rate is basically indistinguishable from the fed funds rate, however the transactions must be reserved outside of the United States. Multinational banks frequently use branches domiciled in the Caribbean or Panama for these accounts, even however the transactions might be executed in U.S. trading rooms. Both are wholesale markets with transactions going from $2 million to well more than $1 billion.

## The Fed Funds Rates

The Federal Reserve utilizes open market operations to deal with the supply of money in the economy and change short-term interest rates. This means that the Fed trades a portion of the [government bonds](/credit_market) and bills it has given; this increments or diminishes the money supply and, hence, lowers or raises short-term interest rates. [Open Market Operations](/openmarketoperations) are carried out by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.

The federal funds rate (fed funds rate) is one of the main interest rates for the U.S. economy, as it influences broad economic conditions in the country, including inflation, growth, and employment. The federal funds rate is set in U.S. dollars and is commonly charged on overnight loans. The fed funds rate is consequently the effective interest rate at which commercial banks loan reserves to each other on an overnight basis.

The federal funds rate is closely connected with short-term interest rates in the broader market, so these transactions straightforwardly impact eurodollar and [LIBOR](/libor) rates also. The Federal Reserve declares the effective fed funds rate toward the finish of each trading day, which is the weighted average rate for all transactions in the market that day.

## Market Participants

The participants in the fed funds market incorporate U.S. commercial banks, U.S. parts of foreign banks, savings and loan organizations and government-sponsored undertakings, like the Federal National Mortgage Association (Fannie Mae) and [Federal Home Loan Mortgage Association](/freddiemac) (Freddie Mac), as well as securities firms and agencies of the federal government.
