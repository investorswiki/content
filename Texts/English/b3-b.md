## What Is B3/B-?

B3/B-alludes to the letter grades ratings agencies assign to companies, issuers, and securities that are viewed as speculative and carry a greater degree of risk than investment grade bonds. In the world of junk bonds, a B3/B-rating is about as low of a rating as most investors will acknowledge.

## Grasping B3/B-

Credit ratings fall into two broad categories: investment grade (high grade) and speculative-grade. The last option is likewise called non-investment grade, high yield, or derisively, junk (i.e., [junk bonds](/junkbond)). Companies viewed as investment grade generally have long histories, large and stable cash flows, high profitability, strong market management groups with a history of good execution on business strategy, and strong market shares.

The boundary between investment grade and non-investment grade is BBB-. Non-investment grade ratings demonstrate riskier industry and business profiles, altogether less financial stability and flexibility, meaning greater vulnerability including their ability to repay debt.

Inside the non-investment grade category, BB-evaluated companies and substances are thought of as safer than those with low single B ratings.

Moody's assigns its B3 rating for "obligations considered speculative and subject to high credit risk." Entities that receive this rating might be encountering financial instability or hold deficient cash reserves relative to their business needs, debt or other financial obligations.

Furthermore, various types of debt issued by a similar company can all have various ratings.

Additionally, numerous investment funds have approaches/rules that confine their securities holdings to investment-grade debt or place limits on how much non-investment grade debt can be held.
