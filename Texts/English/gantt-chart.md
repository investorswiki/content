Gantt charts can be utilized in overseeing projects of all sizes and types. These may incorporate building infrastructure like dams, scaffolds, and roadways. They may likewise incorporate software development and different innovations. Project management apparatuses, like Microsoft Visio, Project, SharePoint, and Excel, or concentrated software, like Gantto or Matchware, can help in planning Gantt charts.

## Illustration of a Gantt Chart

In the event that the project is tied in with putting in new software on a server, the project tasks that require completion are leading research, choosing a software product, testing the software, and introducing it. An achievement is choosing the software. These tasks show up as vertical lines on the chart.

Say the project duration is 40 days. Each task requires 10 days to complete, and each task is dependent on the previous task. A critical activity is testing the software in the development and test conditions. The task start and end dates, duration, and milestones show up as horizontal bars. The percentage of turn out completed for each task additionally is shown on the horizontal bars.
