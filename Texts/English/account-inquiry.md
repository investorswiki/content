# Account Inquiry
## What Is an Account Inquiry?

An account inquiry is a survey of a financial account, whether it be a depository account or credit account. The inquiry can allude to past records, payments, and other specific transactions, or to some other sections connecting with the account.

Most financial institutions have a proper department that deals with account requests.

An account inquiry should be possible per the request of a bank, [lender](/lender), or other financial institution that requires a copy of an account history when an individual, business, or other entity applies for credit or a [loan](/loan). The term is frequently used to mean a [credit inquiry](/credit-inquiry): that is, when there is a request to or from a credit agency about a particular consumer. Credit agencies might issue account requests to credit card companies or different lenders as part of evaluating whether individuals are current on the bills they are responsible for.

## The Purpose of an Account Inquiry

An account inquiry is commonly initiated when an individual tries to assume new debt, particularly related to making a substantial purchase like the acquisition of real estate. Before the candidate is approved for the new debt, the lender needs to see their history with regards to paying their debts in an orderly fashion. This step is key in evaluating the overall creditworthiness of a likely borrower, as well as organizing the rates they might be offered for the loan.

An account holder might start an account inquiry for their own sake, particularly assuming that sketchy activity is thought —, for example, debits that the account holder doesn't recall approving or charges that look new. By requesting that the bank or creditor send off an investigation into such transactions, the inquiry could be a beginning in distinguishing security breaks or occasions of fraud.

Account requests could likewise be made to guarantee that payments have cleared or possibly delivered on time.

At the point when those requests are reported to credit agencies, it very well might be viewed as cause to bring down the consumer's credit score, to some degree briefly — in light of the fact that the behavior could be deciphered as an individual needing money, or on the verge of a spending binge that will pile up a ton of unpaid liability.

There's an exception for contract related requests, in any case. Credit agencies comprehend that individuals typically shop around for the best deal, visiting several lenders, and that every one of the different requests are for a similar single loan (except if by some odd chance a family is planning to buy three distinct $500,000 homes). So they don't count a rash of requests against you, especially on the off chance that they're all inside several months.
