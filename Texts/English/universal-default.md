# Universal Default
## What is universal default?
Universal default is a policy of certain lenders that permits them to punish borrowers who pay any creditor late, bringing about a drop in the customer's [credit score](/credit_score). Universal default is generally regularly utilized with credit card companies and is disclosed in the fine print of their contracts with customers.
## More profound definition
With universal default, a lender changes the loan terms from the customary terms to the default terms. This might incorporate raising a cardholder's interest rate for making late payments on different debts reported to the [credit bureaus](/creditbureau). Or on the other hand, a lender can reduce the customer's [credit limit](/credit_limit) â€” even close their account.
The [Credit Card Accountability Responsibility and Disclosure Act (CARD Act)](/credit-card-accountability-responsibility-and-disclosure-act-of-2009) of 2009 has mellowed the effects of universal default by limiting the balances that card issuers can raise rates on. Universal default policies were not, in any case, precluded or made unlawful by the CARD Act.
Should a card issuer climb a customer's interest rate, the higher rate will be applied exclusively to new balances. The customer is given 45 days to pay the current debt in light of the old agreement.
The CARD Act further states that card issuers can't increase the interest rate on a balance except if the cardholder has not made any payment following 60 days.
