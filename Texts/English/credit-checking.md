# Credit Checking
## What Is Credit Checking?

Credit checking, with respect to forex markets, looks at the financial wellbeing and creditworthiness of [counterparties](/counterparty) in a currency transaction. This credit check guarantees that the two players have the means important to cover their side of the transaction in a trade.

Credit checking can likewise allude to checking the [credit score](/credit_score) of anybody, including one's self. Loans, for example, frequently require a credit check before they can be issued.

## Understanding Credit Checking

A credit check in the [foreign exchange](/forex) (forex) market is similar as the credit check a landlord makes on a likely tenant. The landlord is doing a record verification to check whether the imminent tenant can stand to make the customary rental payments on time.

Without the course of credit checking, one party in a forex transaction would have no [assurances](/assurance) concerning the creditworthiness of the other party included. By participating in credit checking before transactions occur, confidence is kept up with that each party has sufficient credit to carry out and respect the deal.

Since the 2008 financial crisis, regulation across all markets has become more severe making credit checks a more strenuous and extended task. Notwithstanding checks, most firms have increased capital requirements for customers, which has gone about as a form of a credit check, or safety net against traders and firms that can't make great their side of the transaction.

In January 2015, when the [Swiss National Bank](/swiss-national-bank) (SNB) pulled the price floor between the euro and the Swiss franc, the worth of the franc rose by however much 25 percent right away, which cleared out margin traders, and the losses were borne by the brokers. While credit checks could never have supported these losses, the increase in capital requirements has possibly decreased the extent of the losses should an event like this happen once more.

## While Credit Checking Occurs

Retail traders might go through credit checking while opening a forex account, or any type of trading account. The broker is checking the financial viability of the trader, should that trader get into a position where the money in their account can't cover their outstanding losses, basically making a negative balance in the trader's account.

Assuming the client is unable or reluctant to cover the loss, the broker might need to bear those losses and afterward choose if they wish to legally seek after the trader for funds to cover the losses. Credit checking decides whether the client is logical able and ready to cover losses or negative balances.

Credit checking on retail clients, opening retail trading accounts, is ordinarily done when the client opens the account, and not so much for every transaction.

[Over-the-counter](/otc) (OTC) transactions, regularly between organizations or financial institutions, may do credit checking on a counterparty dependent upon the situation. For instance, in the event that two gatherings are going to participate in a large currency transaction, they might wish to confirm each other's financial position through a credit check prior to drawing in with one another.

When gatherings are aware of one another's financial position they may not need credit checks each time they do a transaction, particularly in the event that it is under a certain dollar amount. In the event that the transactions increase in size or one party accepts there has been a material change in the financial position of the other, credit checking might be required once more.

## Illustration of Credit Checking Between Institutions

Expect that two private companies need to participate in a [currency swap](/currencyswap). They are private, so their financial information may not be publicly revealed and therefore a counterparty may not know how that company is doing.

Expect Company A necessities to swap \u00a310 million for $12.5 million from Company B. This suggests a GBP/USD exchange rate of 1.25. The gatherings then settle on what interest rate is tied to each amount. They could both pay a fixed rate, both pay a [floating rate](/floatinginterestrate), or one party could pay a variable interest rate while the other pays a fixed rate.

The particulars of the deal don't make any difference too much in terms of the credit check. What is important is that each party feels the other side can cover their side of the transaction. Swaps are at times placed in light of the expectation of future incomes or cash flows. Yet those incomes or cash flows may not necessarily materialize. Therefore, Company A will need reasonable assurance that Company B can exchange the funds back or potentially pay any differences in interest rates and exchange rates that might create between when the swap is initiated and when it terminates. Company B will need to see something similar from Company A.

A strong [commercial credit score](/business-credit-score), as well as other financial information given by each company, for example, their cash position and perhaps incomes and expenses, will assist each party with feeling more comfortable with the transaction.
