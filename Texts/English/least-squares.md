# Least Squares Criterion
## What Is the Least Squares Criterion?

The least squares criterion is a formula used to measure the precision of a straight line in portraying the data that was utilized to create it. That is, the formula decides the line of best fit.

This mathematical formula is utilized to foresee the behavior of the dependent variables. The approach is likewise called the least squares regression line.

## Figuring out the Least Squares Criterion

The least squares not entirely set in stone by limiting the [sum of squares](/sum-of-squares) made by a mathematical function. A not entirely set in stone by squaring the distance between a data point and the regression line or mean value of the data set.

A least squares analysis starts with a set of data points plotted on a graph. Independent variables are plotted on the horizontal x-hub while dependent variables are plotted on the vertical y-pivot. The analyst utilizes the least squares formula to decide the most reliable straight line that will make sense of the relationship between an independent variable and a dependent variable.

### Common Uses of Least Squares

Progresses in computing power notwithstanding new financial engineering strategies have increased the utilization of least square methods and extended its essential principles.

Least squares and related statistical methods have become commonplace all through finance, economics, and investing, even on the off chance that its beneficiaries aren't generally aware of their utilization.

For instance, the robo-guides presently utilized by many investing platforms utilize Monte Carlo simulation procedures to oversee portfolios, however this is achieved in the background and away from the account holders who use them.

Different applications incorporate time-series analysis of return distributions, economic forecasting and policy strategy, and advanced option modeling.

### What Does Least Squares Tell You?

Rather than attempting to tackle an equation precisely, mathematicians utilize the [least squares method](/least-squares-method) to show up at a close estimation. This is alluded to as a greatest probability estimate.

The least squares approach limits the distance between a function and the data points that the function makes sense of. It is utilized in regression analysis, frequently in [nonlinear regression](/nonlinear-regression) modeling in which a curve is squeezed into a set of data.

The least squares approach is a famous method for deciding regression equations, and it enlightens you concerning the relationship between response variables and predictor variables.

Modeling methods that are much of the time utilized while fitting a function to a curve incorporate the straight-line method, the [polynomial method](/polynomial_trending), the logarithmic method, and the Gaussian method.

Linear or ordinary least squares is the easiest and most commonly involved linear regression assessor for examining observational and experimental data. It finds a straight line of best fit through a set of given data points.

## Features
- Least squares results can be utilized to summarize data and make expectations about related however unnoticed values from a similar group or system.
- The least squares criterion method is utilized all through finance, economics, and investing.
- It is utilized to estimate the precision of a line in portraying the data that was utilized to make it.
