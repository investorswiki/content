# Option Income Fund
## What Is an Option Income Fund?

An option income fund, otherwise called an option income closed-end fund (OI-CEF), is a type of pooled investment whose goal is to produce current income for its investors by earning premiums from selling [options contracts](/optionscontract).

Option income can be produced by selling [delta-neutral](/deltaneutral) options strategies, for example, [straddles](/shortstraddle) or [strangles](/strangle), by composing [covered calls](/coveredcall), or using other more complex strategies.

## Understanding Option Income Funds

Option income funds are generally best appropriate for tax-advantaged accounts on the grounds that the profits those investors earn on the options sold are then taxed as ordinary income, instead of as dividends.

One way these funds produce income is to sell options strategies that are delta-impartial, implying that they don't change in value as the market drops either up or down. A short straddle is an options strategy included selling both a [call option](/calloption) and a [put option](/putoption) with a similar strike price and [expiration date](/expiration-date).

A strangle is comparative, however utilizes calls and puts at various strike prices all things considered. It is utilized when the trader accepts the underlying asset won't move essentially higher or lower over the existences of the options contracts. The maximum profit is the amount of [premium](/premium) collected by composing the options. The expected loss, in any case, can be unlimited in the event that the market moves fundamentally, so it is typically a strategy for further developed traders.

A covered call is another common strategy, where an upside call is sold against an existing long position in the equivalent underlying. While utilizing a covered call strategy, the portfolio can in any case lose money in the event that the underlying asset falls in price, and the maximum profit to the upside is likewise limited. In the event that the asset's price remains generally flat, nonetheless, a covered call strategy can be a somewhat okay income generator.

Option income funds offer clear rewards, including higher returns than standard funds. Be that as it may, such an income-creating strategy can likewise be a lot riskier than just investing in dividend-paying stocks. Since they use options contracts, there are several more risk factors.

That is the reason option income CEFs have the two defenders and downers. For an illustration of the last option, see a 2005 Bloomberg article named "Option Income Funds: Watch Out," which contends that while payouts might be liberal low-yield times, their risks are great.

## The Benefits of Option Income Funds

Then again, a 2012 piece in Kiplinger thought that "Option-Income CEFs May Be a Smarter Choice."

Jeffrey R. Kosnett has written that there are approximately 30 option-income CEFs, and they remember all that from funds that concentration for just the 30 stocks in the Dow Jones industrials, to funds that sell options on developing markets stocks. He made sense of that there are a few key benefits to such funds: "Anything that their strategy, option-income CEFs share two ethics. In the first place, all trade at discounts to their net asset value per share. Second, these funds are great for a market caught in a genuinely narrow trading range."

The explanation, as indicated by Kosnett, has to do with covered-call strategies: "A call option gives its holder the right to buy, or call, a stock from the option's seller at a certain price by a certain date. It is risky to Buy options. Be that as it may, selling a call against a stock you own is a conservative strategy. Thusly, you limit the possible appreciation of your stocks, yet you create extra income through the sale of the options."

Kosnett further noticed the accompanying:

> Option-income funds assign quite a bit of their distributions as a "arrival of capital," a phrase that proposes you're not getting a true dividend. Yet, just as there is great cholesterol and awful cholesterol, there are great and terrible returns of capital. Cash inflows from option sales are repeatable and sustainable.
