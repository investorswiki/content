# Secondary Mortgage Market
The secondary mortgage market is a huge marketplace of banks, investors and financial institutions that trades mortgages, servicing rights and mortgage-backed securities. While numerous homebuyers aren't aware of it, the secondary mortgage market gigantically affects how you get a mortgage, the rate you pay and the standards you must meet to do as such.
While a lender might have initially gotten you a loan, generally speaking today the lender doesn't hold the loan. All things being equal, it sells the loan into the secondary mortgage market, where it very well might be cut and diced into quite a few mortgage-backed securities to fulfill investors' necessities.
This is the way the secondary mortgage market works and who may really possess your home loan.
## How the secondary mortgage market functions
Most people know how the fundamental mortgage process functions. A borrower asks a bank for a loan, and the bank stretches out money to the homebuyer and keeps the loan on its books for the loan's term. That is Banking 101 — yet it's less normal the way in which things are done today in the mortgage market.
In the wake of making a loan, a bank frequently sells it in the secondary mortgage market, however the bank might hold the servicing rights. Many loans are sold to the government-sponsored ventures Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac or different aggregators, which can repackage the loans as mortgage-backed securities, or MBS, or hold them on their own books and collect the interest from borrowers.
To be sold to the agencies, the loan must be "conforming" — that is, the loan must fulfill certain guidelines set by the agencies. These factors include:
- A maximum loan amount of $510,400 (for 2020) in many U.S. states, however it is higher in others
- The down payment relative to the size of the loan, normally somewhere around 3%
- The borrower's credit score, normally no less than 630 to 650
- The borrower's debt-to-income ratio, which ought to be something like 41%

The demand for conforming loans helps push down the mortgage rates for borrowers who can fulfill the guidelines. Note that jumbo loans are not regularly viewed as conforming loans.
The government agencies are one type of mortgage aggregator, yet other large institutions (counting the mortgage originator itself) might be aggregators and make their own MBS, too.
## What are mortgage-backed securities?
When aggregators buy mortgage loans, they can hack them up and repackage them into bonds called mortgage-backed securities.
Think of the mortgage as a sort of cash flow, with specific qualities in light of the loan. Aggregators can repackage these cash flows — normally large number of mortgages in a single security — in various ways to make bonds that appeal to the investment needs of certain sorts of investors.
For instance, mortgages can be cut into tranches with differing degrees of safety — and the more secure the bond, the lower its yield, as a rule. Thus, investors searching for a higher interest payment can buy fairly riskier mortgage-backed securities, while the individuals who must buy higher-rated bonds, (for example, insurance companies or public pension investors) can buy the more secure tranches.
Investors searching for different traits, for example, those in light of risk or timing of cash flow, can find different MBS bonds to meet their specific necessities. It's a wide market offering a scope of bonds.
Just like ordinary bonds, these mortgage-backed securities are graded by the rating agencies, including Standard and Poor's, Moody's and Fitch, which collect fees for their services.
When the bonds have been made and rated, they are sold to investors, who might hold them for their own portfolios or sell them later in the secondary market. Banks themselves may likewise be buyers of MBS, which might offer more diversification than loans written exclusively in their service area.
