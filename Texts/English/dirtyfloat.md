# Dirty Float
## What Is a Dirty Float?

A dirty float is a floating exchange rate where a country's [central bank](/centralbank) infrequently intercedes to change the bearing or the pace of change of a country's currency value. In many occurrences, the central bank in a dirty [float](/float) system acts as a buffer against an outer [economic shock](/economic-shock) before its effects become disruptive to the domestic economy. A dirty float is otherwise called a "managed float."

This can be diverged from a [clean float](/clean-float), where the central bank doesn't intercede.

## Figuring out Dirty Floats

From 1946 until 1971, large numbers of the world's major industrialized nations took part in a [fixed exchange rate](/fixedexchangerate) system known as the [Bretton Woods Agreement](/brettonwoodsagreement). This ended when President Richard Nixon took the United States off the gold standard on August 15, 1971. From that point forward, most major industrialized economies have taken on floating exchange rates.

Many emerging countries look to safeguard their domestic industries and trade by utilizing a managed float where the central bank intercedes to direct the currency. The frequency of such intervention fluctuates. For instance, the Reserve Bank of India closely deals with the rupee inside an exceptionally narrow [currency band](/currency-band) while the Monetary Authority of Singapore allows the neighborhood dollar to vacillate all the more unreservedly in an undisclosed band.

There are several justifications for why a central bank mediates in a currency market that is generally allowed to float.

## Market Uncertainty

Central banks with a dirty float sometimes mediate to consistent the market on occasion of inescapable economic uncertainty. The central banks of both Turkey and Indonesia mediated transparently various times in 2014 and 2015 to combat currency weakness brought about by instability in emerging markets worldwide. A few central banks don't really want to publicly recognize when they mediate in the currency markets; for instance, Bank Negara Malaysia was widely supposed to have mediated to support the [Malaysian Ringgit](/myr-malaysian-ringgit) during a similar period, yet the central bank has not recognized the intervention.

## Speculative Attack

Central banks sometimes mediate to support a currency that is enduring an onslaught by a [hedge fund](/hedgefund) or other speculator. For instance, a central bank might find that a hedge fund is guessing that its currency could devalue significantly; subsequently, the hedge fund is building up speculative short positions. The central bank can purchase its very own large amount currency to limit the amount of [devaluation](/devaluation) brought about by the hedge fund.

A dirty float system isn't viewed as a true [floating exchange rate](/floatingexchangerate) in light of the fact that, hypothetically, true floating rate systems don't allow for intervention. Be that as it may, the most renowned confrontation between a speculator and a central bank occurred in September 1992, when George Soros forced the Bank of England to remove the pound from the [European Exchange Rate Mechanism](/exchange-rate-mechanism) (ERM). The pound hypothetically floats unreservedly, however the Bank of England burned through billions on an ineffective endeavor to protect the currency.
