# Garn-St. Germain Depository Institutions Act
## What Was the Garn-St. Germain Depository Institutions Act?

The Garn-St. Germain Depository Institutions Act was enacted by Congress in 1982. The primary purpose was to ease pressures on banks and savings and loans which increased after the Federal Reserve brought rates up with an end goal to combat inflation. Financial institutions that had taken on interest rate risk by lending at low rates in prior years were confronted with negative spreads when the Fed drove deposit interest rates higher in the mid 1980s.

The act followed the foundation of the [Depository Institutions Deregulation Committee](/depository-institutions-deregulation-committeedidc) by the [Monetary Control Act](/monetary-control-act) (MCA), which had started deliberately transitioning away from interest rate ceilings on bank deposit accounts. Together, these acts are today widely comprehended to have contributed to the subsequent [Savings and Loan Crisis](/sl-crisis) of the 1980s and 90s.

## Grasping the Garn-St. Germain Depository Institutions Act

Inflation in the United States had spiked altogether during the 1970s after the last connections between the U.S. dollar and gold were cut off under the Nixon administration, and again in the late 1970s, breaking above 10% by mid 1980. After the Federal Reserve, under Chairman Paul Volcker forcefully started raising rates into the 1980s the trend at last switched, with inflation floating between 2.5-5.0% for the vast majority of the 1980s.

Traditional banks were trapped in the middle as they were paying more for their deposits than they were earning on mortgage loans which had been made in before years at much lower interest rates. They had taken on huge interest rate risk through maturity confusing, lending long-term at low rates for home mortgages, and borrowing exceptionally short-term at variable rates on bank deposits. Unfit to get free from lower rates of interest on their fixed-rate, long-term holdings, banks were becoming illiquid.

Simultaneously, Fed [Regulation Q](/regulationq), which had recently confined banks and savings and loans (known as S&L or frugalities) from raising their deposit interest rates, was phased out for deposit accounts other than checking accounts under the MCA. Investors and depositors ran to money market mutual fund accounts, Cd's, and savings accounts to acquire higher interest rates, and corporations developed alternatives, for example, [repurchase agreements](/repurchaseagreement). As the deposit rates that they paid out rose, while the interest they were getting from existing mortgages stayed fixed, banks were trapped in a squeeze.

On the lending side, Title VIII of the Garn-St. Germain Depository Act, "Elective Mortgage Transactions," authorized banks to offer adjustable-rate mortgages. Nonetheless, the act likewise had substantial benefits for consumer real estate owners, since it allowed consumers to place their mortgaged real estate in [inter-vivos trusts](/intervivostrust) without triggering the due-on-sale clause that allows banks to dispossess and collect the balance due on a mortgaged property when ownership of that property is moved. This made it more straightforward for property owners to pass real estate to minors and heirs, and furthermore allowed the well off to safeguard their real estate holdings from creditors or lawsuit settlements.
