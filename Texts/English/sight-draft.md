## What Is a Sight Draft?

A sight draft is a type of [bill of exchange](/billofexchange), in which the exporter holds the title to the shipped goods until the importer gets and pays for them. Sight drafts are involved with both air shipments and ocean shipments for financing transactions on goods in international trade. Not at all like a [time draft](/time-draft), which considers a short-term defer in payment after the importer gets the goods, a sight draft is payable immediately.

## Sight Drafts Explained

A bill of exchange is a written order once utilized essentially in international trade that dilemmas one party to pay a fixed sum of money to one more party on demand or at a predetermined date. Bills of exchange are like checks and promissory notes â€” they can be drawn by people or banks and are generally transferable by supports. These come in two fundamental forms: sight drafts and time drafts.

A shortcoming of sight drafts is that assuming the bringing in country denies the shipment or the importer can't pay for the shipment when it shows up, the exporter won't get compensated and will be responsible for return delivery or disposal costs. Sight drafts must be joined by a [letter of credit](/letterofcredit) and other required documents, for example, a [ocean bill of lading](/ocean-bill-of-lading), to be paid.

While delivery by water, before cargo can be delivered, an original ocean [bill of lading](/billoflading) must be appropriately endorsed by the buyer and given up to the carrier, since it is the document demonstrating title. Then again, [air waybills](/airway-bill) of lading needn't bother with to be introduced for the buyer to take title to goods.

Numerous international trade transactions use drafts as a method for showing the terms of payment for sent goods.

Subsequently, the key difference between a period draft and a sight draft is that sight drafts require an immediate payment while time drafts permit the importer to pay sometime in the future.
