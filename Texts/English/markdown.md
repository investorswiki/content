## What Is a Markdown?

A markdown in finance is the difference between the highest current [bid price](/bidprice) among dealers in the market for a security and the lower price that a dealer charges a customer. Dealers will at times offer lower prices to animate trading; the thought is to compensate for the losses with extra [commissions](/commission).

## Figuring out Markdowns: Bids and Spreads

In finance, bid prices are how much buyers are offering to pay. Ask prices are the sums that merchants will acknowledge. The difference between the highest bid price and the most minimal ask price is called the [bid-ask spread](/bid-askspread).

The [inside market](/insidemarket) is the trading in a specific security that happens between market creators (dealers that meet specific criteria). The inside market for the most part has lower prices and more modest spreads than the market for [retail investors](/retailinvestor).

## Markdowns and Markups in Finance

Deducting the price on the inside market from the price a dealer charges retail customers gives a spread. This spread is known as a markdown on the off chance that the spread is negative. The spread is called a [markup](/markup) in the event that it is positive.

Markups are more normal since market producers can ordinarily get more great prices than retail customers. Market producers can buy securities in bulk, and inside markets are more [liquid](/liquidity).

In any case, there are circumstances wherein markdowns happen. For instance, a municipal bond issue probably won't have as much demand as a dealer suspected it would. In this case, they may be forced to reduce the price to clear their [inventory](/inventory). Dealers could accept that by checking prices down, they can create sufficient trading activity to compensate for their losses through commissions.

## Markdowns and Disclosure

A principal transaction happens when a dealer sells its very own security out account and despite the obvious danger.

Broker-dealers are required to reveal how a trade is completed in the trade confirmation, alongside any commissions. Nonetheless, they are not required to unveil markups or markdowns, besides under particular conditions.

## Special Considerations: Excessive Spreads

Controllers generally think about markups and markdowns of over 5% to be outlandish, yet this is just a guideline. Markdowns of over 5% can be justified considering winning market conditions. Pertinent market conditions incorporate the type of security, the dealer's more extensive pattern of markups and markdowns, and the price of the security.

When in doubt, the best brokers keep spreads far below over the top levels due to extraordinary competition in financial markets. High spreads are additionally bound to be an issue with thinly traded securities.
