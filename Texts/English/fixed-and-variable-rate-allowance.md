# Fixed and Variable Rate Allowance (FAVR)
## What Is the Fixed and Variable Rate Allowance (FAVR)?

The fixed and variable rate allowance (FAVR), or fixed and variable rate reimbursement, is an approach to [reimbursing employees](/reimbursement-plan) who utilize their own or leased vehicles for business related activities. For tax purposes,

FAVR payments must be made quarterly, as indicated by [Internal Revenue Service](/irs) (IRS) rules, which additionally forces specific limitations on how and how much an employee's vehicle must be utilized to meet all requirements for the FAVR allowance.

A fixed and variable rate allowance plan may likewise be alluded to as a "mileage [reimbursement plan](/reimbursement-plan)" or a "fixed and variable plan." It repays employees via a combination of a month to month allowance and mileage reimbursement payments.

A fixed and variable rate allowance incorporates two payment types: periodic fixed payments and periodic variable payments.
