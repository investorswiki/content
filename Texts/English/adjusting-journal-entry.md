## Why Are Adjusting Journal Entries Important?

In any case, the company actually needs to accrue interest expenses for the months of December, January, and February.

Since the firm is set to release its year-end financial statements in January, an adjusting entry is expected to mirror the accrued interest expense for December. To precisely report the company's operations and profitability, the accrued interest expense must be recorded on the December income statement, and the liability for the interest payable must be reported on the December balance sheet. The adjusting entry will debit interest expense and credit interest payable for the amount of interest from December 1 to December 31.
