# NINJA Loan
## What Is a NINJA Loan?

A NINJA loan is a shoptalk term for a loan extended to a borrower with practically zero endeavor by the lender to confirm the candidate's ability to repay. It means "no income, no job, and no assets." Whereas most lenders require loan candidates to give evidence of a stable stream of income or adequate [collateral](/collateral), a NINJA loan disregards that verification interaction.

NINJA loans were more normal prior to the 2008 financial crisis. In the aftermath of the crisis, the U.S. government issued new regulations to further develop standard lending practices across the credit market, which included tightening the requirements for giving loans. Right now, NINJA loans are rare, if not terminated.

## How a NINJA Loan Works

Financial institutions that offer NINJA loans base their decision on a borrower's [credit score](/credit_score) without really any verification of income or assets, for example, through income tax returns, pay stubs, or bank and brokerage statements. Borrowers must have a credit score over a certain threshold to qualify. Since NINJA loans are generally given through subprime lenders, notwithstanding, their credit score requirements might be lower than those of mainstream lenders, like major banks.

NINJA loans are structured with differing terms. Some might offer an attractively low initial interest rate that increases over the long run. Borrowers are required to repay the debt as indicated by a scheduled time span. Neglecting to make those payments can make the lender make a legal move to collect the debt, bringing about a drop in the borrower's credit score and ability to get different loans from now on.

## Advantages and disadvantages of NINJA Loans

Since NINJA loans require so little desk work compared, for instance, with traditional home mortgages or business loans, an application is handled rapidly. Their expedient delivery makes them interesting to certain borrowers, especially the people who lack the customary documentation or don't wish to create it.

The loans can, be that as it may, be extremely dangerous for both the lender and the borrower. Since NINJA loans require no evidence of collateral, they are not secured by any assets that a lender could seize assuming the borrower defaults on the loan.

NINJA loans are likewise dangerous for the borrower, free as they are by the traditionally conservative bank underwriting practices that frequently keep the two sides in the clear. Borrowers might be urged to take out bigger loans than they can sensibly hope to repay, especially in the event that they center around a low starting interest rate that will rise from now on.

After a high level of loan defaults helped trigger the 2008 financial crisis and a crash in real estate values in many parts of the country, the government forced stricter rules on lenders, making loans more highly regulated than before, with mortgage loans seeing the best impact.

The 2010 [Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act](/dodd-candid financial-administrative reform-bill) made new standards for lending and loan applications. The new rules to a great extent got rid of NINJA loans, expecting lenders to get more far reaching data about prospective borrowers, including their credit scores and reported evidence of their employment and other income sources.
