In February 1994, the OCC distributed the main release of the options disclosure document (ODD), which has taken on a number of supplements over the subsequent many years. These supplements explain prior concepts and oblige the developing complexity of [options](/option) products over the development of the derivatives market.

## Special Considerations

Beside the fundamental description of different option types, maybe the main section of the ODD is the "Principal Risks of Options Positions." Someone new to the options markets should, in all seriousness carefully read this section, which goes over the primary risks of every one of the option types made sense of in the document and gives a few instances of how a trader might lose money. Even a seasoned trader would find the document valuable for updates. The risk disclosure segment obtusely starts: "An option holder runs the risk of losing the whole amount paid for the option in a somewhat short period of time."

The ODD proceeds to make sense of other options trading risks, for example, different risks to [option writers](/author), risks of combination transactions, (for example, [option spreads](/spreadoption)), risks occurring from the disruption in the markets of underlying assets, and special risks of index options.
