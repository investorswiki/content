# Catastrophe Bond
## What Is a Catastrophe Bond (CAT)?

A catastrophe bond (CAT) is a high-yield [debt instrument](/debtinstrument) that is intended to fund-raise for companies in the insurance industry in the event of a natural disaster. A CAT [bond](/bond) allows the [issuer](/issuer) to receive funding from the bond provided that specific conditions, like a quake or twister, happen. On the off chance that an event protected by the bond initiates a payout to the insurance company, the obligation to pay interest and repay the principal is either deferred or totally pardoned.

CAT bonds have short [maturity dates](/maturitydate) of between three-to-five years. The primary investors in these securities are [hedge funds](/hedgefund), pension funds, and other institutional investors.

## Understanding Catastrophe Bonds

Catastrophe bonds are involved by property and casualty insurers as well as [reinsurance](/reinsurance) companies to transfer risk to investors. First marketed during the 1990s, these bonds offer insurance and reinsurance companies one more approach to offsetting the risk associated with underwriting policies. Institutional investors can receive a higher interest rate from CAT bonds than from most other [fixed-income securities](/fixed-incomesecurity).

CAT bonds are a type of insurance-linked security (ILS) — an umbrella term for financial securities that are linked to pre-indicated events or insurance-related risks. CAT bonds are paid to insurance companies provided that a catastrophe — that is protected by the bond — happens.

## How CAT Bond Payouts Work

At the point when CAT bonds are issued, the proceeds raised from investors go into a secure [collateral ](/collateral)account, where they might be invested in different other low-risk securities. Interest payments to investors come from the secure collateral account.

A CAT bond may be structured so that the payout happens provided that the total natural disaster costs surpass a specific dollar amount over the predefined coverage period. Bonds likewise can be pegged to the strength of a tempest or tremor, or to the number of events, for example, in excess of five named storms striking Texas. A series of natural disasters would trigger a payout to the insurance company, which funds likewise would come from the secure collateral account.

Investors would lose their [principal](/principal) in the event that the costs of the covered natural disasters surpass the total dollar amount raised from the bond issuance. Be that as it may, on the off chance that the costs to cover the disaster don't surpass the predetermined amount during the bond's lifetime, investors would return their principal at the bond's maturity. The investor likewise would benefit from getting the standard interest payments in return for holding the bond.

## The Benefits and Risks of CAT Bonds
### Expected Benefits

The [interest rates](/interestrate) paid by CAT bonds are not typically linked to the financial markets or economic conditions. Along these lines, CAT bonds offer investors stable interest payments even when interest rates are low and traditional bonds are offering lower yields. Further, [institutional investors](/institutionalinvestor) may utilize CAT bonds to help [diversify](/diversification) a portfolio to safeguard against economic and market risk. The justification for this possibly reduced risk is that these investments don't be guaranteed to correspond to economic performance or stock market moves.

CAT bonds offer a competitive yield compared to other fixed-income bonds and [dividend](/dividend)- paying stocks. Investors in CAT bonds receive fixed interest payments over the life of the bond. Likewise, in light of the fact that these bonds' maturities are ordinarily short-term, there is less likelihood that an event triggering payout would happen.

CAT bonds benefit the insurance industry in light of the fact that the capital raised lowers their out-of-pocket costs for natural disaster coverage. CAT bonds likewise furnish insurance companies with cash when they need it the most, which could prevent them from expecting to file for bankruptcy in light of a natural disaster.

### Expected Risks

In spite of the fact that CAT bonds can reduce risk to insurance companies, the risk is borne by the purchasers of the securities. The risk of losing the principal amount invested is moderated to some degree by the short maturity of the bonds.

As per the Insurance Information Institute, in 2019 overall losses from overall natural catastrophes totaled $150 billion dollars, which was generally in accordance with the inflation-adjusted average of the previous 30 years, and down from $186 billion out of 2018. In 2019, 820 events caused losses, compared with 850 events in 2018. Insured losses from the 2019 events totaled $52 billion, down from $86 billion of every 2018. In this way, albeit overall losses were down in 2019 versus 2018, the costs from damages can run into the billions of dollars, and investors holding CAT bonds are at risk of losing all or part of their investment. Investors need to gauge the risks versus the returns of the appealing yields offered by CAT bonds.

CAT bonds can offer diversification from economic and [market risk](/marketrisk) in light of the fact that natural disasters don't normally correspond with economic events and stock market developments. Be that as it may, there could be exemptions on the off chance that a natural disaster were to cause a recession and consequently a stock market decline. Investors holding CAT bonds would be at risk of losing their principal on the off chance that the grievous event prodded a payment to the insurance company. Notwithstanding, on the off chance that the catastrophic event happened during a recession, the outcomes could be compounded assuming that a portion of the investors likewise lost their types of revenue (occupations) concurrent with losing their investment in the CAT bond.
