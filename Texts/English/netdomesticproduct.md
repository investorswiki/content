# Net Domestic Product (NDP)
## What Is Net Domestic Product (NDP)?

Net domestic product (NDP) is an annual measure of the economic output of a nation that is calculated by deducting [depreciation](/depreciation) from [gross domestic product](/gdp) (GDP).

## How Net Domestic Product (NDP) Works

NDP accounts for capital that has been consumed throughout the year through housing, vehicle, or machinery decay. The depreciation accounted for is frequently alluded to as [capital consumption allowance](/capital-consumption-allowance-cca) and addresses the amount expected to supplant those depreciated assets.

The frequency and scope of such replacements can shift by type of [capital assets](/capitalasset). Machinery that is put to ordinary use might require parts supplanted consistently until the whole piece of equipment is at this point not usable. While that might require numerous years, notwithstanding startling damage or deformities, there is a cycle of equipment disappointment and replacement. Part of the machinery in a factory's [production line](/product-line) may should be supplanted while one more set of comparable machines keeps on functioning inside a similar factory. The acquisition of the replacement machinery would be considered into the depreciation part of the NPI.

This varies from an expansion of factory operations — for instance, the opening of another site, adding to the total number of plants. The acquisition of new machines for the new factory would address a gain on the grounds that the demand was driven by the need to increase the scope of the operations, as opposed to act as a replacement. This would mean the purchased machine would qualify as a gain for the NDP.

The construction of new homes on beforehand unused [real estate](/realestate) can likewise address a gain for the NDP on the off chance that the homes are not expected to supplant defunct or destroyed property. For instance, in numerous urban areas, efforts might be made to reuse underutilized real estate that has fallen into deterioration. Rather than growing the spread of the city, more seasoned buildings may be destroyed and supplanted by new construction expected to fill a similar use as the ancestor building. Such a model would qualify as depreciation and replacement. Paradoxically, in the event that another housing community is developed, the construction of homes would be contributory to NDP.

## Special Considerations

NDP, alongside GDP, [gross national income](/gross-national-income-gni) (GNI), [disposable income](/disposableincome), and [personal income](/personalincome), is one of the key checks of economic growth that is reported on a quarterly basis by the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA).

However GDP is much of the time refered to while evaluating the economic wellbeing of a country, NDP puts into viewpoint the pace at which capital assets corrupt and must be supplanted. This is important as inability to make a move would bring about a lessening in the country's GDP.

## Features
- Net domestic product (NDP) is an annual measure of the economic output of a nation that is adjusted to account for depreciation.
- It is calculated by taking away depreciation from the gross domestic product (GDP).
- NDP, alongside GDP, gross national income (GNI), disposable income, and personal income, is one of the key measures of economic growth that is reported on a quarterly basis by the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA).
- An increase in NDP would demonstrate developing economic wellbeing, while a decline would show economic stagnation.
