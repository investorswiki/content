# Credit Rating
## What is a credit rating?
A credit rating is a measurement of a person or business entity's ability to repay a financial obligation in view of income and past repayment narratives. Normally communicated as a credit score, banks and lenders utilize a credit rating as one of the factors to determine whether to loan money. Individuals receive credit ratings from one of the three major credit reporting agencies in the U.S.: TransUnion, Experian and Equifax.
## More profound definition
Credit ratings can determine whether you fit the bill for financing. Your credit rating is a measurement of your past repayment history on debts including credit cards and personal loans, which gives lenders knowledge into the probability of you paying them back in the event that they support you for a loan.
On the off chance that you keep a high credit rating, the probability of banks and lenders supporting you for financing are high. A poor credit rating might address an inability to repay debt and limit your financing options.
Credit ratings and credit scores frequently work interchangeably. For instance, most businesses receive credit ratings communicated as letter grades, (for example, triple-A, twofold An or A) from agencies like Standard and Poor's, while you receive a rating communicated as a score, known as a FICO score.
The most common factors that influence your credit score are the length of your credit history, past repayment history and your credit utilization. The three credit reporting agencies take that data and build your credit profile, which will determine your overall credit rating and score.

## Credit rating model
Your credit rating or score is rarely a static number, and it can change in view of new data that financial institutions ship off the reporting agencies. In the event that you miss a payment or apply for another credit extension, that data is sent to the credit reporting agencies. On the off chance that you have a high credit rating, one missed payment can bring down your credit score.
