# Box-Jenkins Model
## What Is the Box-Jenkins Model?

The Box-Jenkins Model is a mathematical model intended to forecast data ranges in view of contributions from a predefined [time series](/timeseries). The Box-Jenkins Model can dissect several unique types of time series data for forecasting.

Its methodology utilizes differences between data points to determine outcomes. The methodology allows the model to distinguish trends utilizing autoregresssion, moving averages, and seasonal differencing to create forecasts.

[Autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) models](/autoregressive-integrated-moving-average-arima) are a form of Box-Jenkins model. The terms ARIMA and Box-Jenkins are sometimes utilized reciprocally.

## Grasping the Box-Jenkins Model

Box-Jenkins Models are utilized for [forecasting](/forecasting) a variety of anticipated data points or data ranges, including business data and future security prices.

The Box-Jenkins Model was made by two mathematicians: George Box and Gwilym Jenkins. The two mathematicians examined the concepts that contain this model in a 1970 publication called "Time Series Analysis: Forecasting and Control."

Estimations of the parameters of the Box-Jenkins Model can be exceptionally muddled. Thusly, similar to other time-series regression models, the best outcomes will ordinarily be accomplished using programmable software. The Box-Jenkins Model is additionally generally best appropriate for short-term forecasting of 18 months or less.

## Box-Jenkins Methodology

The Box-Jenkins Model may be one of several, time series analysis models a forecaster will experience while utilizing modified forecasting software. As a rule, the software will be modified to automatically utilize the best fitting forecasting methodology in view of the [time series](/timeseries) data to be forecasted. Box-Jenkins is reported to be a top decision for data sets that are for the most part stable and have low [volatility](/volatility).

The Box-Jenkins Model forecasts data utilizing three principles: autoregression, differencing, and moving average. These three principles are known as p, d, and q, separately. Every principle is utilized in the Box-Jenkins analysis; together, they are aggregately displayed as ARIMA (p, d, q).

The autoregression (p) process tests the data for its level of stationarity. Assuming the data being utilized is stationary, it can work on the forecasting system. Assuming that the data being utilized is non-stationary it should be differenced (d). The data is additionally tried for its moving average fit (which is done in part q of the analysis cycle). Overall, initial analysis of the data prepares it for forecasting by determining the parameters (p, d, and q), which are then applied to foster a forecast.

## Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA)

Box-Jenkins is a type of autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model that measures the strength of one dependent variable relative to other evolving variables. The model's goal is to anticipate future securities or financial market moves by looking at the differences between values in the series rather than through real values.

An ARIMA model can be perceived by framing every one of its components as follows:

- [Autoregression (AR)](/autoregressive): alludes to a model that shows a changing variable that relapses all alone lagged, or prior, values.
- Integrated (I): addresses the differencing of raw perceptions to allow for the time series to become stationary, i.e., data values are supplanted by the difference between the data values and the previous values.
- [Moving average (MA)](/movingaverage): consolidates the dependency between a perception and a residual mistake from a moving average model applied to lagged perceptions.

## Forecasting Stock Prices

One use for Box-Jenkins Model analysis is to forecast [stock](/stock) prices. This analysis is normally worked out and coded through R software. The analysis brings about a logarithmic outcome, which can be applied to the data set to produce the forecasted prices for a predetermined period of time from now on.

ARIMA models depend on the assumption that past values meaningfully affect current or future values. For instance, an investor utilizing an ARIMA model to forecast stock prices would expect that new purchasers and merchants of that stock are influenced by recent market transactions while choosing the amount to offer or acknowledge for the security.

Albeit this assumption will hold under many various conditions, it isn't true all of the time. For instance, in the years prior to the 2008 Financial Crisis, most investors didn't know about the risks presented by the large arrangement of [mortgage-backed securities](/mbs) (MBS) held by many financial firms.

During those times, an investor utilizing an autoregressive model to foresee the performance of U.S. financial stocks would have had valid justification to foresee a continuous trend of stable or rising stock prices in that sector. Notwithstanding, when it became public information that many financial institutions were at risk of approaching collapse, investors unexpectedly turned out to be less worried about these stocks' recent prices and far more worried about their underlying risk exposure.

Consequently, the market quickly revalued financial stocks to a much lower level, a move that would have completely frustrated an autoregressive model.
