# Quadruple Witching
## What Is Quadruple Witching?

The term quadruple witching refers to the date on which certain [derivatives](/derivative) contracts expire simultaneously. This happens with four different types of contracts, including stock index futures, stock index options, stock options, and single stock futures. Quadruple witching dates happen four times a year on the third Friday of March, June, September, and December. Market activity on these days is typically highest during the last trading hour as traders try to move on these contracts.

## Understanding Quadruple Witching

As noted above, quadruple witching refers to a date when four different types of futures and options expire on the same day. These four contracts are stock index futures, stock index options, stock options, and single stock futures. When they expire, investors must make a move by adjusting their positions or closing out the contracts.

Quadruple witching is like [triple witching](/triplewitchinghour), which is when three out of the four markets expire at the same time. Quadruple witching days replaced triple witching days when [single stock futures](/singlestockfuture) started trading in November 2002. Because these contracts expire on the same triple witching schedule, the terms triple and quadruple witching are often used interchangeably even however there's a disparity in the number of expiring markets.

All witching dates derive their names from the volatility (or ruin) that results from these products expiring on the same day. When investors move on their positions, it can trigger critical volume and order flow. In folklore, supernatural beings are said to roam the earth during the [witching hour ](/witching-hour)of 12 PM with the end goal that being abroad as of now carries ruin and misfortune to those unfortunate enough to encounter these evil spirits.

## Types of Contracts Involved in Quadruple Witching

Since it has become so obvious what's really going on with quadruple witching, let's take a gander at the four classes of contracts that expire on these dates.

### Options Contracts

[Options](/option) are derivatives, and that means they base their value on [underlying securities](/underlying-security) like stocks. Options contracts give a buyer the opportunity, yet not the responsibility, to complete a transaction of the underlying security at the very latest a specific date and at a preset cost called a strike price.

There are two types of options:

- A [call option](/calloption) can be purchased to speculate on a price increase in a specific stock. In the event that the price is higher than the strike price at the option's expiration date, the investor can exercise or convert to shares of the stock and cash out for a profit.
- A put option allows an investor to profit from a decrease in a stock's price the length of the price is below the strike on expiration.

Options expire on the third Friday of every month. There is an upfront fee or premium to buy or sell an option.

### Index Options

A [index option](/indexoption) is just like a stock options contract, yet instead of buying individual securities, index options give investors the right yet not the obligation to execute the index, for example, the [S&P 500](/sp500). Whether the index price or value is above or below the option's strike price on the expiration date determines the profit on the trade.

Index options offer no ownership of the individual stocks. Instead, the transaction is [cash-settled](/cash-settled-options). This gives the difference between the option's strike and the index value at expiry.

### Single Stock Futures

[Futures](/futures) contracts are legal agreements to buy or sell an asset at a determined price at a specified future date. Futures contracts are standardized with fixed quantities and expiration dates. Futures trade on a futures exchange. The buyer of a futures contract is obligated to buy the underlying asset at expiry while the seller is obligated to sell at expiry.

Single stock futures are obligations to take delivery of shares of the underlying stock at the contract's expiration date. Each contract represents 100 shares of stock. However, holders of stock futures don't receive [dividend](/dividend) payments, which are cash payments to shareholders from an organization's earnings.

### Index Futures

[Index futures](/indexfutures) are like stock futures except investors buy or sell a financial or stock index with the contract settling on a future date. The existing position is offset when the contract expires, and a profit or loss is cash-settled into the investor's account.

Investors use index futures to bet on the direction of an index, buying assuming they believe the index will rise and selling in the event that they believe the market will drop. Index futures can likewise be used to [hedge](/hedge) a [portfolio](/portfolio) of stocks with the goal that a portfolio manager does not have to sell the portfolio during market declines.

The futures contract earns a profit while the portfolio declines and takes a loss. The goal is to minimize short-term portfolio losses for long-term holdings.

## Market Impact of Quadruple Witching

As noted above quadruple witching days witness heavy trading volume. One of the primary reasons for the increased activity is the options and futures contracts that are profitable settle automatically with offsetting trades.

Call options expire in-the-money and are profitable when the price of the underlying security is higher than the strike price in the contract. Put options are in-the-money when the stock or index is priced below the strike price. In the two circumstances, the expiration of in-the-money options results in automatic transactions between the buyers and sellers of the contracts. As a result, quadruple witching dates lead to an increased amount of these transactions being completed.

Market indices, for example, the S&P 500 tend to decline soon after quadruple witching. This might be due to the exhaustion of the near-term demand for stocks. Despite the overall increase in trading volume, quadruple witching days don't necessarily translate into heavy [volatility](/volatility).

Volatility measures the extent of price vacillations in securities. Low volatility could be due to long-term institutional investors, for example, pension funds managers who are largely unaffected since they don't change their long-term positions. The availability of a variety of hedging instruments with multiple expiration dates all through the year has likewise diminished the impact of quadruple witching days to some degree.

## Closing and Rolling Out Futures Contracts

A significant part of the action surrounding futures and options on quadruple witching days is focused on offsetting, closing, or rolling out positions. A futures contract contains an agreement between the buyer and seller where the underlying security is to be delivered to the buyer at the contract price at expiration.

For example, one [E-mini S&P 500](/sp_500_mini) futures contract is worth 50 times the value of the S&P 500. So the value of an E-mini contract when the S&P 500 is 2,100 at expiration is $105,000. This amount is delivered to the contract owner assuming it is left open at expiration.

Contract owners don't have to take delivery on the expiration date. Instead, they can close their contracts by booking an offsetting trade at the prevailing price with cash settling the gain or loss from the purchase and sale prices. Traders can likewise [roll their contracts forward](/rollforward), a process that extends the contract by offsetting the existing trade and simultaneously booking a new option or futures contract to be settled from now on.

## Arbitrage Opportunities

Over the course of a quadruple witching day, transactions including large blocks of contracts can create price movements that might provide arbitrageurs the opportunity to profit on temporary price bends. [Arbitrage](/arbitrage) can quickly escalate volume, especially when high-volume round trips are repeated multiple times over the course of trading on quadruple witching days. However, just as activity can provide the potential for gains, it can likewise lead to losses very rapidly.

## Real-World Example of Quadruple Witching

There tends to be a great deal of frenzy in the days leading up to a quadruple witching day. However, it's unclear whether the genuine witching leads to increased market gains. That is because it's impossible to separate any gains due to expiring options and futures from gains due to other factors like earnings and economic events.

Friday, March 15, 2019, was the main quadruple witching day of 2019. Similarly as with whatever other witching day, there was hectic activity in the preceding week. As per a Reuters report, trading volume on U.S. market exchanges on that day was "10.8 billion shares, compared to the 7.5 billion average… over the last 20 trading days."

For the week leading into quadruple witching Friday, the S&P 500 was up 2.9% while the Nasdaq was up 3.8%, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) was up 1.6%. However, a large number of the gains that happened really seemed to happen before the quadruple witching Friday since the S&P was exclusively up by 0.5% while the Dow was exclusively up 0.54% Friday.
