The term originated in baseball during the 1800s. Observers who went to games that were delayed or canceled due to weather conditions could receive a check to go to a future game at no extra charge.

## Illustration of a Rain Check

Suppose The Big Store typically sells Yummy Wheat Cereal for $4 per box every week. Management chooses to put the grain on sale at $2.50 per box for next week. The store promotes the sale in its flyers and online. In the event that you go to the store and find Yummy Wheat Cereal has sold out, you can ask the store for a rain check. The store will issue you a coupon with the $2,50 sale price, the quantity you can purchase, and the expiry date. At the point when you return to the store, you essentially present the cashier with the coupon at the checkout.

One thing to note: Vendors generally don't issue rain checks for special advancements. So a special stamped "Buy One, Get One Free" may not be applicable for a rain check after the stock is drained.

## Rain Checks and the Unavailability Rule

After 1989, rain checks became standard practice in supermarkets in light of the fact that the [Federal Trade Commission](/ftc) (FTC) laid out the inaccessibility rule. This federal law qualifies consumers for receive rain checks, substitute things of equivalent value, or alternative compensation equivalent to the advertised things or discount.

The inaccessibility rule shields consumers from false or misleading advertising by requiring basic food item retailers to stock an adequate number of supplies to fulfill the anticipated demand for a sale sensibly. The FTC laid out this law to prevent hustle sales — the practice of advertising bargain prices to draw in heavy traffic while understocking sale things to urge customers to buy more costly products. Running out of inventory isn't unlawful, yet a retailer might disregard the law by more than once understocking sale things without informing the public that amounts are limited.

### Exemptions for Rain Check Laws

Individual states have their own consumer protection acts, which might extend the liability of retailers or subject a more extensive scope of products to rain check laws. A few states limit the amount of time consumers need to recover the rain check whenever they are informed of a restocked thing.

Retailers can limit supplies, for which rain checks are not allowed. Yet, to do so and be fair to consumers, the store must plainly state that there is a limited supply of stock and that it won't issue rain checks.

Rain check laws commonly don't matter to products that are not delivered at the hour of purchase, like apparatuses and furniture. Large [high-ticket items](/big-ticket-thing) are routinely stocked in small amounts and may require substantial dealing with costs for retailers to keep more inventory at the store. Close-outs, clearances, seasonal sales, and broad discounts are normally excluded, as the retailer is in many cases selling off inventory that can't be restocked inside a reasonable time period.

## What Happens If You Don't Get a Rain Check?

In the event that the store you go to doesn't give you a rain check, you ought to initially check to check whether the sale thing has limitations. On the off chance that the store states "No Rain Checks" or that the quantity is limited, it isn't committed to issues you a rain check. In the event that there is no limitation and you can't get a rain check, you can file a protest with the FTC — especially in situations where the retailer keeps running unavailable on advertised specials. You can likewise grumble to your state consumer protection agency or the state attorney general.
