# CryptoRuble
## What Is CryptoRuble?

The CryptoRuble is a digital currency right now in development, charged by Russian President Vladimir Putin. It won't be a [cryptocurrency](/cryptocurrency) in how Bitcoin is, as it will be issued by the government with no mining included.

The value of the CryptoRuble will be indistinguishable from the value of a normal ruble. The main pilot group for the testing of the digital ruble was formed in June 2021 and incorporates 12 banks.

## Grasping CryptoRuble

Vladimir Putin announced in October of 2017 that Russia would give its own state-supported cryptocurrency â€” the CryptoRuble. The CryptoRuble, albeit not formally sent off, started its testing phase in June 2021. The digital ruble will be issued by Russia's Central Bank as a central bank digital currency (CBDC) and managed by the Russian government.

Certain Russian banks have communicated interest in testing out the digital ruble, including the Credit Bank of Moscow and Crimea's Russian National Commercial Bank. This testing is expected to begin in the final part of 2021.

In 2022, the bank is expected to permit residents to test the currency. The thought is that CryptoRuble will assist with diminishing costs inside the financial system while helping competition among banks. It's worth taking note of that Russia actually doesn't perceive digital tokens or cryptographic forms of money as legal tender.

On the downside, the digital currency will be centralized in nature, as it's issued by the Central Bank. The CryptoRuble is expected to operate like the Russian ruble, just in digital and encoded form. The CryptoRuble will have a similar price the ruble has and will actually want to be traded with traditional rubles.

> Dissimilar to cryptographic forms of money, CryptoRuble won't be mined, yet rather issued by the Russian government. Hence, it will be regulated by an official body, while digital currencies are not.

## Objectives of CryptoRuble

It is hypothesized that one of the fundamental explanations behind Putin's interest in blockchain is that transactions are scrambled, and in this manner more straightforward to circumspectly send money without agonizing over sanctions put on the country by the international community.

This theory built up momentum after the Financial Times reported in mid 2018 that one of Putin's economic advisors, Sergei Glazyev, said during a government meeting that, "this instrument [CryptoRuble] suits us very well for sensitive activity on behalf of the state. We can settle accounts with our counterparties all around the world without really considering sanctions." Note that Glazyev himself was put under sanctions by President Obama, keeping him from trading in or venturing out to America in 2014.

One more justification for CryptoRuble is that it could assist with stepping out other digital currencies that are past government control like Bitcoin and Ether. Russia stays disappointed with digital currencies, with Putin himself saying in October 2017 that digital currencies were utilized mostly for crime purposes. These feelings keep on reflecting in the bills presented by Russian administrators in 2020 and 2021.
