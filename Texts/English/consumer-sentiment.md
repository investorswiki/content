# Consumer Sentiment
## What Is Consumer Sentiment?

Consumer sentiment is a statistical measurement of the overall strength of the economy as determined by consumer assessment. It considers individuals' inclinations toward their current [financial health](/financial-wellbeing), the soundness of the economy in the short-term, and the possibilities for longer-term economic growth, and is widely viewed as a helpful [economic indicator](/economic_indicator).

Consumer sentiment arose as an economic statistic during the mid-twentieth century and has since turned into a [barometer](/barometer) that influences public and economic policy.

## Grasping Consumer Sentiment

In the U.S., [consumer spending](/consumer-spending) makes up a majority of economic output. As much as 70% of [gross domestic product](/gdp) (GDP) is driven by a consumer spending part, so the sentiment or demeanor of consumers goes a long way in measuring the strength of the economy. The other primary drivers of GDP are business investments, government spending, and [net exports](/netexports).

In the event that individuals are sure about the future they are probably going to shop more, supporting the economy. Interestingly, when consumers are questionable about what lies ahead, they will more often than not set aside cash and make less [discretionary](/discretionary-cost) purchases. Desolate sentiment debilitates demand for goods and services, affecting corporate investment, the [stock market](/stockmarket), and employment opportunities, in addition to other things.

Extremely bullish consumer sentiment can likewise be awful for the economy. At the point when individuals buy bunches of goods and services prices can rise fundamentally, leading to an unwanted rise in [inflation](/inflation). To stamp out inflation, central banks climb interest rates, which prompts an increase in borrowing costs for the two consumers and businesses. This will in general slow economic growth and weigh on [exports](/send out) â€” higher interest rates fortify the value of currencies.

## Recording Consumer Sentiment

Two key measures that express consumers' sentiments about the economy and their subsequent plans to make purchases are the [Consumer Confidence Index (CCI)](/cci), prepared by the Conference Board (CB), and the [Michigan Consumer Sentiment Index (MCSI)](/mcsi), led by the University of Michigan. The two indexes depend on a household survey and are reported consistently.

[Investors](/financial backer) closely follow consumer sentiment indexes as they give a helpful indicator of how much demand there is for the goods and services delivered by companies listed on the stock market.

While dissecting the data, it is important to determine trends diagramed out throughout a longer time outline, like four or five months. The media frequently focuses a light on changes over time or the last month against that very month the prior year. Analysis that centers something like single period values, without taking a gander at the more profound trend, is misleading.

> As per the CCI, consumer sentiment hit an all-time low in February 2009 and a record high in May 2000.

## Special Considerations

For some, the significance of the trends of consumer sentiment rests in the way that the CCI originated in the twentieth century when the concept of the "ordinary" consumer was more homogeneous.

Recognizing this historical reality, as well as potential sampling bias and conceivable subjectivity across districts, the safe bet is to zero in on trends framing some kind of linear movement, whether vertical or descending, or the movement can hit an overall level, which sometimes happens when the economy movements to various stages in the [business cycle](/businesscycle).
