# SEC Form 10-QT
## What Is SEC Form 10-QT?

A SEC Form 10-QT is known as a progress report pursuant to SEC Rule 13a-10 or 15d-10. It is utilized when there is a presentation of financial statements during "momentary periods" as opposed to the standard three-month (quarterly) periods covered by a traditional SEC Form 10-Q.

SEC Form 10-QT is ordinarily filed subsequent to a [Form 8-K](/8-k) filing telling the securities and exchange commission ([SEC](/sec)) of a change of a [fiscal year end](/fiscalyearend). It must conform in any remaining regards to the requirements of a form 10-Q with the exception of the time spans presented. On the off chance that the information given by this form should be amended by a firm, they should present a form 10-QT/A.

## How SEC Form 10-QT Works

Government securities laws order that [publicly traded companies](/publiccompany) must give certain corporate and financial information to regulators and the investing public. These divulgences will be made on a periodic basis, or, in all likelihood as specific events happen.

A company uses SEC Form 10-Q upon the completion of each quarter to reveal un-inspected [financial statements](/financial-statements, (for example, the company's income statement and balance sheet) and gives an outline of the company's financial situation. The specific filing dates rely upon the association's fiscal year, yet it is important to file quarterly 10-Q reports every year.

SEC Form 10-QT is utilized when such corporate divulgences are made from sync with the quarterly schedule. This is most often utilized when a company is changing its fiscal year, either due to [mergers](/consolidation) or acquisitions or for other business reasons. The Form 10-QT will present the small part of the year not covered by other 10-Qs or 10-Ks.

## The Two Sections of 10-QT

There are two parts to a 10-QT or 10-Q filing. The initial segment contains relevant financial information covering the period. This incorporates condensed financial statements, management discussion and analysis on the financial condition of the entity, exposures with respect to market risk, and internal controls.

> At the point when corporate exposures are not adding up with the quarterly schedule, troughs will utilize a SEC Form 10-QT.
>

The second part contains any remaining information. This incorporates legal procedures, unregistered sales of equity securities, the utilization of proceeds from the sale of unregistered sales of equity, and defaults upon senior securities. The company revealed some other information — including the utilization of exhibits — in this section.

## Special Considerations

At the point when a company neglects to file its form 10-QT by the filing cutoff time, for its transitionary period it must utilize a non-ideal (NT) filing. A NT filing must make sense of why the cutoff time was missed, and it gives the company five extra days to file without penalty.

A 10-QT filing is thought of as opportune in the event that it is filed inside this extension. Inability to consent to this extended cutoff time brings about consequences, including the potential loss of the SEC registration, removal from exchanges, and legal repercussions. On the off chance that a 10-QT should be amended, a form 10-QT/An is filed with the SEC.
