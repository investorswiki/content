# Empirical Duration
## What is Empirical Duration?

Empirical Duration is the calculation of a bond's [duration](/duration) based on historical data as opposed to a preset formula, as [effective duration](/effectiveduration) does.

## Figuring out Empirical Duration

Basically, empirical duration is more reasonable in that it utilizes historical data to model a bond price's sensitivity to various interest rate situations. At the point when the historical yields rise or fall, the historical bond prices will fall or rise likewise, and this data forms the basis for empirical duration. [Regression](/regression) analysis of historical market-based bond prices and Treasury yields is the statistical cycle by which empirical duration can be estimated.

Empirical duration communicates the inverse relationship of bond interest rates and prices. At the point when interest rates for new bond issues go up, prices for existing bonds go down as they become moderately less appealing to investors. With duration, investors can get a practical estimate of how much their bond's price will go down if rates go up. That is on the grounds that, as a general rule, at whatever point rates for new bonds rise by one percentage point, prices for existing bonds will fall by their duration communicated as a percentage.

For example, say you're looking at two bonds that share a [coupon rate](/coupon-rate) of five percent. In looking all the more carefully at every one, you notice the main bond has a duration of 4.8 years while the subsequent bond has a duration of 9.2 years. This means assuming interest rates rise to six percent, the principal bond's price will fall by just around 4.8 percent while the subsequent bond's price will fall by almost double that, or around 9.2 percent. In this sense, duration provides investors with a key measure of volatility while looking at various bond investments. Controlling for different factors, a bond with more limited duration will experience less volatility than a bond with longer duration.

## Advantages and disadvantages of Empirical Duration

Empirical duration enjoys a few benefits and burdens over effective duration, which has investors utilize a formula to figure out what might befall a bond's price in the event that interest rates shift by one percentage point.

The upsides of empirical duration incorporate that the estimate doesn't depend on hypothetical formulas and insightful suspicions; the investor just necessities a solid series of bond prices and a solid series of Treasury yields. Disservices incorporate that a solid series of a bond's price may not be accessible, and the series of prices that is accessible probably won't be market based, but instead modeled or matrix priced (the price is based on comparative security).

## Features
- Regression analysis of historical market-based bond prices and Treasury yields is the statistical interaction by which empirical duration can be estimated.
- Empirical Duration is the calculation of a bond's duration based on historical data as opposed to a preset formula, as effective duration does.
