# Apparent Supply
## What Is Visible Supply?

Noticeable supply is the amount of a decent or [commodity](/commodity) that is presently being stored or shipped that is available to be bought or sold. This supply is important as it distinguishes a clear quantity of goods available for purchase or delivery upon the assignment of [futures](/futurescontract) contracts. For example, all of the wheat held in silos or storage facilities, along with the wheat being moved from ranches is part of the apparent supply.

In the [municipal bond](/municipalbond) markets, the multi day apparent supply alludes to the total [par value](/parvalue) (face value) of all [new issue](/newissue) municipal bonds that are expected to be coming to market in the next 30 days.

## Figuring out Visible Supply

Prices in the market are supposed still up in the air by the law of [supply and demand](/law-of-supply-demand) - the more supply of a few decent available influences the demand (and vice versa). Subsequently, having the option to account for the supply of commodities is of urgent significance to these markets and their connected futures markets. By and large, an increase in noticeable supply is viewed as a bearish signal, while a reduction is viewed as a bullish one.

In any case, the price of a decent isn't totally impacted by the amount of noticeable supply. Since commodities, like wheat or oil, are in many cases purchased through futures, [options](/optionscontract), or [forward](/forwardcontract) contracts long before the date of real physical delivery, prices are bound to be affected by the future supply as opposed to what is available at that moment. Future supply, or supply which is at present in processing or preparation, is supposed to be part of the invisible supply, since it can't (yet) be counted and accounted for.

## Apparent versus Invisible Supply

Noticeable supply remains as opposed to [invisible supply](/invisiblesupply), which alludes to an obscure or unquantifiable amount of physical stock of a commodity that will ultimately be available for endless supply of a futures contract.

Not at all like the apparent supply, this amount of supply underlying a futures contract exists, yet it hasn't yet been accumulated, stored, or set to the side for delivery; though any such stock of a commodity that has been accounted for is the "noticeable" supply.

An increase in the apparent supply of bonds is bearish at costs as additional bonds will increase the supply of new debt. In like manner, a fall in the multi day noticeable supply is bullish at bond costs.
