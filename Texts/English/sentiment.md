# Sentiment

In finance, the term sentiment (or market sentiment) alludes to the profoundly subjective inclination about the state of a market. It is the overall feeling that traders and investors have concerning the price action of a specific asset.
Basically, the market sentiment is a consequence of various factors. It might incorporate the data derived from [fundamental analysis (FA)](/fundamentalanalysis) and specialized analysis (TA) indicators. Recent news and price history may likewise play a job all the while.
While they are closely related, worth noticing market sentiment and fundamental analysis are very various things. While the sentiment is connected with psychology and feelings, fundamental analysis is more associated with the performance of a specific business or cryptocurrency project (e.g., reputation and [market capitalization](/market-capitalization)).
Numerous traders and chartists believe the market sentiment to be a decent indicator of potential short and mid-term price developments. As a general rule, when the sentiment is excessively hopeful ([bullish](/bullmarket)) or cynical ([bearish](/bearmarket)), the market will in general reverse and begin moving the other way.
All in all, the market will in general go up when the majority of traders are bearish, and down when the overall sentiment is more bullish than what could be viewed as normal. Thusly, market sentiment may frequently fill in as a type of contrarian indicator.
The market sentiment is something contrarian traders search for. On the off chance that a great many people are bullish, they will think about selling or shorting. In any case, on the off chance that the sentiment is too bearish, they will think about buying or opening a long position.
Summarizing, market sentiment should be visible as the consequence of the two major feelings that drives a financial market: fear and greed. Other than that, market sentiment is an important part of market psychology.
Recently, endeavors have been made to precisely measure and evaluate market sentiment by applying the outcomes and information from fields like behavioral finance and behavioral economics.
