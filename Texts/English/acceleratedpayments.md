## What Are Accelerated Payments?

In the finance industry, accelerated payments are voluntary payments made by a borrower to reduce the [outstanding balance](/normal outstanding-balance) of their loan all the more quickly. Contingent upon the terms of the loan, accelerated payments might be an appealing option for borrowers wishing to limit their total cost of borrowing. Notwithstanding, some loan structures disincentivize accelerated payments through [prepayment penalties](/prepaymentpenalty) and other such provisions.

Accelerated payments are ordinarily applied to a loan's principal, which reduces the outstanding balance and required interest in later payments.

## How Accelerated Payments Work

Accelerated payments are a common technique involved by borrowers in various financial settings. A common model is that of [home mortgage loans](/home-mortgage), in which borrowers are frequently permitted to make higher than commanded payments to rapidly pay off their principal more. This, thus, can bring about a more limited [amortization period](/amortization) and, hence, a reduction in overall [interest expenses](/interestexpense).

These accelerated payment structures are common in different non-rotating loans, which are otherwise called [term loans](/termloan). These loans are structured utilizing a [amortization schedule](/amortization_schedule), which sets out the loan payments' timing and amount. Every payment will have a part of interest and principal, with the percentage allocated to the principal expanding progressively as the loan arrives at maturity.

Contingent upon the terms of the loan, the amount of interest contained in every payment can be founded on either a [fixed](/fixedinterestrate) or a [variable interest rate](/variableinterestrate). The higher the rate of interest on a loan, the more beneficial it very well may be to make accelerated payments.

## Mortgage Loans and Accelerated Payments

For example, in a home mortgage loan, the borrower's [equity in the home](/home_equity) develops progressively as the mortgage loan's principal balance declines. As well as expanding the borrower's net worth, the growth of equity in a property can give collateral to the borrower, which they can use to finance subsequent purchases. This equity can likewise be leveraged to raise cash, for example, through a [mortgage refinance transaction](/refinance).

Albeit accelerated payments can be advantageous, contingent upon the terms of the loan, it may not be efficient to exploit this option. A few lenders remember prepayment penalty conditions for their loan contracts, which either limit or levy fees against accelerated payments past a predetermined limit.

In mortgage lending, these sorts of prepayment terms are, as a matter of fact, very common. Lenders will frequently limit accelerated payments to a maximum of 20% of the loan balance every year. Also, lenders might impose extra punishments in the event that the borrower looks to refinance the mortgage or sell the underlying property before the finish of the mortgage term. Consequently, it is important to carefully consider the legalities of a loan to determine whether accelerated payments are genuinely practical.

For example, on the off chance that she can fund-raise from different lenders or investors to finance her next purchase, she might be better off involving her capital as a [down payment](/down_payment) briefly real estate acquisition, possibly earning essentially in excess of a 3.50% return.
