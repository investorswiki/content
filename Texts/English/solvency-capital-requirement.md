# Solvency Capital Requirement (SCR)
## What Is a Solvency Capital Requirement (SCR)?

A solvency capital requirement (SCR) is the total amount of funds that insurance and [reinsurance](/reinsurance) companies in the [European Union](/europeanunion) (EU) are required to hold. SCR is a formula-based figure adjusted to guarantee that all quantifiable risks are thought of, including non-life [underwriting](/underwriting); life underwriting; wellbeing underwriting; and market, credit, operational, and [counterparty](/counterparty) risks. The solvency capital requirement covers existing business as well as new business expected throughout the span of 12 months. It must be recalculated something like one time each year.

## How Solvency Capital Requirements Work

Solvency capital requirements are part of the Solvency II Directive issued by the EU in 2009, which is one of in excess of twelve existing EU directives. The directive plans to organize the laws and regulations of the 28 EU individuals as they connect with the insurance industry. Assuming that the supervisory specialists discover that the requirement doesn't enough mirror the risk associated with a particular type of insurance, it can change the capital requirement upwards.

The SCR is set at a level that guarantees that insurers and [reinsurers](/reinsurer) can meet their obligations to policyholders and [beneficiaries](/recipient) over the accompanying 12 months with a 99.5% likelihood, which limits the possibility of falling into financial ruin to not exactly once in 200 cases. The formula adopts a measured strategy, implying that individual exposure to each risk category is assessed and afterward collected.

### Three Pillars of the Solvency II Directive

The EU Solvency II directive assigns three pillars or tiers for capital requirements. Pillar I covers the quantitative requirements; that is, the amount of capital an insurer ought to hold. Pillar II lays out requirements for the governance, effective supervision, and risk management of insurers. Pillar III subtleties exposure and transparency requirements.

As per data services supplier RIMES, the new regulation forces complicated and huge consistence troubles on numerous European financial organizations. For instance, 75% of firms in 2011 detailed that they were not in that frame of mind to agree with Pillar III reporting requirements.

### The Minimum Capital Requirement

Notwithstanding the SCR capital requirement, a base capital requirement (MCR) must likewise be calculated. This figure addresses the threshold below which a public regulatory agency would mediate. The MCR is planned to accomplish a level of 85% likelihood of adequacy north of one year.

For regulatory purposes, the SCR and MCR figures ought to be viewed as "delicate" and "hard" floors, individually. That is, a layered intervention process applies once the capital holding of the (re)insurance company falls below the SCR, with intervention turning out to be logically more extraordinary as the capital holdings approach the MCR. The Solvency II Directive gives regional controllers several choices to address breaks in the MCR, including the complete withdrawal of authorization from selling new strategies and constrained conclusion of the company.
