# Appraisal Approach
## What Is the Appraisal Approach?

While appraisals are commonly acted related to a sale of a thing, they may likewise be directed for [insurance](/insurance) or [taxation](/taxation) purposes.

## Understanding the Appraisal Approach

The appraisal approach is utilized to decide the worth of high-value assets, for example, real estate properties, objects of art, jewelry, vehicles, financial interests in oil fields, and other alternative assets. The values of these things are hard to measure since they don't change hands frequently to the point of dependably producing current [market prices](/market-price) the way public stocks and other [securities](/security) do. Thus, the value of such things must be estimated by qualified people known as [appraisers](/appraiser).

## Appraisal Approach Requirements

Appraisals are possibly considered authentic assuming directed by uninvolved parties who are certified and licensed by state regulatory boards. Appraisers must fulfill the Universal Guidelines of Professional Appraisal Practice (USPAP) rules and pass the significant scholarly courses.

Appraisers depend on the accompanying three methods of laying out real estate property values:

1. [Sales comparison](/sales-comparison-approach). This is the most common method, where appraisers value a property in light of the recent selling prices of comparable properties in a similar area. To achieve this, no less than three [comparable](/comparables) properties must be reported inside the last year, in an open and competitive market.
1. [Cost approach](/cost-approach). This practice operates under the reason that a property's value ought to rise to the cost of building an equivalent building, considering the cost of the land and construction expenses, less [depreciation](/depreciation). All things considered, it would be monetarily silly for a home buyer to pay more for a property than it would cost to build a comparative structure without any preparation.
1. [Income approach](/income-approach). In some cases alluded to as the "income capitalization approach," this gauges the value of a property in view of the income it generates. It's calculated by taking the net operating income (revenue the property generates minus operating expenses), and isolating it by the [capitalization rate](/capitalizationrate) â€” the expected rate of return.
