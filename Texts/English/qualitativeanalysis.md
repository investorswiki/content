# Qualitative Analysis
## What Is Qualitative Analysis?

Qualitative analysis utilizes subjective judgment to break down a company's value or prospects in view of non-quantifiable data, for example, management mastery, industry cycles, strength of research and development, and labor relations.

Qualitative analysis stands out from [quantitative analysis](/quantitativeanalysis), which centers around numbers found in reports, for example, balance sheets. The two procedures, be that as it may, will frequently be utilized together to look at a company's operations and assess its true capacity as an investment opportunity.

## Fundamentals of Qualitative Analysis

The qualification among qualitative and quantitative approaches is like the difference among human and artificial intelligence. Quantitative analysis utilizes exact information sources like profit edges, [debt ratios](/debtratio), earnings multiples, and so forth. These can be connected to a mechanized model to yield an exact outcome, for example, the [fair value](/fairvalue) of a stock or a forecast for earnings growth. Of course, for the present, a human needs to compose the program that does the math, and that includes a fair degree of subjective judgment. Whenever they are programmed, however, PCs can perform quantitative analysis in fractions of a second, while it could take even the most gifted and profoundly prepared humans minutes or hours.

Qualitative analysis, then again, manages immaterial, inexact worries that belong to the social and experiential domain as opposed to the mathematical one. This approach relies upon the kind of intelligence that machines (at present) lack, since things like positive associations with a brand, management trustworthiness, customer satisfaction, [competitive advantage](/competitive_advantage), and social movements are troublesome, ostensibly unthinkable, to capture with mathematical data sources.

## Figuring out People and Qualitative Analysis

Qualitative analysis can sound practically like "paying attention to your gut," and without a doubt numerous qualitative analysts would contend that gut sentiments have their place simultaneously. That doesn't mean, in any case, that it's anything but a thorough approach. For sure, it can consume substantially more investment than quantitative analysis.

Individuals are central to qualitative analysis. An investor could begin by getting to know a company's management, including their instructive and professional backgrounds. One of the main factors is their experience in the industry. All the more abstractly, do they have a record of difficult work and prudent independent direction, or are they better at knowing — or being connected with — the right individuals? Their notorieties are additionally key: do their associates and companions respect them? Their relationships with business partners are likewise worth investigating since these can straightforwardly affect operations.

## Company Culture and Qualitative Analysis

The manner in which employees view the company and its management is important. Are they fulfilled and inspired, or do they detest their managers? The rate of employee turnover can demonstrate employees' loyalty or lack thereof. What does [workplace culture](/corporate-culture) say regarding the company? Excessively hierarchical offices advance interest and competition and sap productive energy; a sluggish, unmotivated environment can mean employees are essentially worried about checking in. The ideal is an energetic, creative culture that attracts top ability.

## Gathering Data for Qualitative Analysis

Truly, gathering data for qualitative analysis can be troublesome. Fortune 500 CEOs are not known for plunking down with retail investors for a visit or showing them around the corporate headquarters. In part, Warren Buffett can utilize qualitative analysis so actually on the grounds that individuals will give him access to their time and data. Most of us need to filter through news reports and organizations' filings to get a feeling of chiefs' records, strategies, and methods of reasoning. The [management discussion and analysis](/mdanalysis) (MD&A) section of a company's [10-K filing](/10-k) and [quarterly earnings conference calls](/earnings-call) give a window into strategies and communication styles. Clear, transparent communication and sound strategies are valuable. Trendy expressions, hesitance, and short-termism, not really.

## Qualitative Analysis in Context

Customers are the main group more vital to a company's prosperity than management and employees since they are the source of its revenue. Incidentally, on the off chance that a company places customers' interests before shareholders, it could be a better long-term investment. On the off chance that plausible, it's really smart to try being a customer. Let's assume you're thinking about investing in an airline that has gotten control over costs, beat [earnings estimates](/earningsestimate) in three sequential quarters, and plans to [buy back shares](/buyback). At the point when you try to actually utilize the airline, notwithstanding, you find the website bug-ridden, the customer service agents cranky, the extra fees petty, and your fellow travelers angry. The negative experience lets you know that the company has a lack of priority for its customers and to be careful making an investment in the airline.

A company's [business model](/businessmodel) and competitive advantage are essential parts of qualitative analysis. What gives the firm an enduring leg up over its adversaries? Has it concocted another technology that contenders will see as difficult to duplicate, or that has [intellectual property](/intellectualproperty) protection? Does it have a unique approach to taking care of a problem for its customers? Is its brand worldwide perceived — positively? Does its product have social reverberation or an element of wistfulness? Will there actually be a market for it in twenty years? In the event that you can conceivably envision another company stepping in and doing what this one improves, then, at that point, the [barrier to entry](/barrierstoentry) might be too low. For what reason will an un-laid out company be the one to make or disturb its picked market, and is there any valid reason why it won't then be replaced thus?

## True Example of Qualitative Analysis

The thought behind quantitative analysis is to measure things; the thought behind qualitative analysis is to figure out them. The last option requires an all encompassing perspective and a fact-based general story. Setting is key. For instance, a [CEO](/ceo) who exited college would be a red flag at times, however [Mark Zuckerberg](/mark-zuckerberg) and Steve Jobs are exemptions. Silicon Valley is, for better or more regrettable, an alternate monster. A look at McDonald's Corp's (MCD) financials a couple of years prior would have informed you nothing regarding an approaching backlash against cheap, unfortunate food. Then again, a simply qualitative approach is powerless against distortion by vulnerable sides and personal inclinations. Quantitative measures can act as a check on these propensities.
