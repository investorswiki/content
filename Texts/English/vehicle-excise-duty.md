# Vehicle Excise Duty
## What is Vehicle Excise Duty

Vehicle excise duty (VED) is a tax paid for most UK-driven and left vehicles. VED doesn't fit the standard definition of a tax exacted at the point of manufacture. For cars registered from April 2017 onwards, rates paid in the primary year are related to the vehicle's carbon dioxide emissions, however subsequent payments are not.

## BREAKING DOWN Vehicle Excise Duty
## Starting points of Vehicle Excise Duty

The primary UK vehicle tax originated from the 1888 Customs and Inland Revenue Act. The tax limited and controlled the utilization of cars. The British government acquainted the requirement with number and register cars in 1904, and in 1906, the center moved to the condition of the roads. In 1909, another tax in view of the power of the engine was presented, and its proceeds were utilized to further develop road infrastructure.

The Road Board, an overseeing body entrusted with making and modifying road infrastructure policies, was made in 1910. In 1920, the Road Fund, made by the British Government to pay for the building and maintenance of UK roads, supplanted the Road Board. Nonetheless, the [revenue](/revenue) collected from the road fund was frequently appropriated for different purposes. The misappropriation was immense to the point that the chancellor of the Exchequer, Winston Churchill, called it the "Strike Fund." From 1937, vehicle excise duties (VED) were paid into the new Consolidated Fund, and the Road Fund served exclusively as a [administrator](/administrator) until it closed in 1956.

In the late 1970s, there were conversations about abrogating the VED and expanding fuel tax to cover the shortfall. Be that as it may, in 1980, the decision was made to hold the vehicle tax.

## The Changing Structure of Vehicle Excise Duty

In 1997, the government examined assessing VED on a vehicle's level of carbon dioxide discharge. In the 1999 UK Budget, new cars registered in subsequent years would be classified into one of four vehicle excise duty bands in view of their emissions. A few incentives were given inside each band for cars utilizing cleaner fuel. The tax on new cars was altogether lower than that on more established cars, empowering the motoring public to purchase fresher models. In 2002, 2003, and 2006, they presented fifth, sixth, and seventh bands. In the 2009 UK Budget, an update of the system was announced, introducing 13 VED bands in which all new cars will be sorted in.

## Latest Developments in VED

In 2014, the government canceled the recently utilized paper tax plate, which was required to be shown on a vehicle's windscreen. The government announced that there was no requirement for the circles and that the electronic vehicle register and Automatic Number Plate Recognition could guarantee that vehicles were accurately licensed and that VED had been paid.

2017 saw a major update of the vehicle excise duty band and rate design, which has brought about the vehicle tax being substantially higher or lower for certain types of new cars.
