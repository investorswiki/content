# HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC)
## What Is HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC)?

The term Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs (HMRC) alludes to the tax authority of the U.K. government. The agency, otherwise called Her Majesty's Revenue Services, is responsible for collecting taxes, paying [child benefits](/childtaxcredit), upholding tax and customs laws, and implementing the payment of [minimum wage](/minimum_wage) by employers.

HMRC was formed in 2005 following the merger of the [Inland Revenue](/inland-revenue) and the Board of Customs and Excise, the agencies which formerly took care of internal taxes and customs collection separately.

It administers the efficient collection of taxes and the transfer of funds to the Treasury. It additionally guarantees that [revenue](/revenue) for the funding of public services is promptly accessible. One more job of the tax-related sector of HMRC is to instruct and inform the public about their tax-paying duties.

Different divisions inside the agency include:

- The Benefits and Credits division. This unit is responsible for the administration and payment of [tax credits](/taxcredit), child benefits, and statutory payments, including statutory sick pay and maternity pay.
- Enforcement and Compliance, which handles different regions, for example, making a move against the non-payment of taxes, recuperating unpaid student loans, executing systems to reduce tax avoidance (like [DOTAS](/dotas-disclosure-tax-avoidance-plots)), and implementing the payment of the lowest pay permitted by law. HMRC can investigate people and organizations associated with dodging taxes or committing fraud. On the off chance that the tax authority accepts a taxable entity deliberately keeps information in its [income](/income) disclosure, it might continue with a criminal investigation.
- The Customs arm of HMRC. This section is centered around the enforcement of customs payments and regulations for international trade to collect revenue and stifle pirating and unlawful trade in tobacco, liquor, petroleum, and different goods.

## Special Considerations

One of the critical elements of HMRC is to guarantee that the flow of money to the Chancellor of the Exchequer is consistent by means of its tax collection, compliance, and enforcement programs. The collection of taxes and the enforcement of tax laws in cases of non-payment guarantees the persistent movement of funds into the Treasury.

The payment of benefits and tax credits offers practical help to families and people qualified for this assistance. The enforcement of customs and the quest for runners safeguards the country's interests and empowers above-board international trade.

## History of HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC)

Under the 2005 Commissioners for Revenue and Customs Act, commissioners delegated by the Queen to get a sense of ownership with the country's taxation system laid out HRMC as a non-ecclesiastical department. Accordingly, the agency reports directly to Parliament through the Treasury, which is under the leadership of the Chancellor of the Exchequer. The Treasury, thusly, regulates spending by HMRC.

Before the [merger](/merger) of Customs and Excise and the Inland Revenue, a case was introduced by Permanent Secretary of the Treasury Gus O'Donnell's report in 2004 that organizational change offered "possible improvements in customer service, effectiveness, and proficiency." The converging of direct and indirect revenue departments was thought of and, surprisingly, executed before, as far back as 1849, when the Board of Stamps and Taxes was merged with the Board of Excise, making the Board of Inland Revenue.

In 1862, a committee was delegated to investigate whether joining the duties of the Inland Revenue with those of Customs and Excise would be better. The proposal was upset at the induction of the Inland Revenue. In 1909, the [excise duties](/excisetax) were taken out from the administration of the Inland Revenue and were combined with the Board of Customs to form the Board of Customs and Excise. Yet again a 1999 report by the Treasury Committee suggested a merger, refering to the likely savings in public expenditure and [compliance costs](/compliance-cost).

The decision, announced in March 2004, to blend the [Inland Revenue](/inland-revenue) and the Board of Customs and Excise was met with some distrust as the two departments had such unique historical and social establishments and legal designs. There was likewise the topic of job losses, which in fact were substantial and happened in spates over a period of years.
