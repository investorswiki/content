Range alludes to the difference between the low and high prices for a security or index throughout a specific time span.

## Understanding a Trading Range

A range for an individual trading period is the highest and lowest prices traded inside that trading period. For numerous periods, the trading range is estimated by the highest and lowest prices throughout a foreordained time period. The relative difference between the high and the low, whether on an individual candlestick or over large numbers of them, characterizes the historical volatility of the prices. The amount of volatility can shift starting with one asset then onto the next, and starting with one security then onto the next. Investors favor lower volatility, so prices turning out to be essentially more unstable are said to demonstrate strife or some likeness thereof in the market.

The range relies upon the type of security; and for a stock, the sector wherein it operates. For instance, the range for fixed-income instruments is a lot more tight than that for commodities and equities, which are more unpredictable in price. Even for fixed-income instruments, a [Treasury bond](/treasurybond) or government security commonly has a more modest trading range than a junk bond or convertible security.

Many factors influence a security's price, and thus its range. Macroeconomic factors like the economic cycle and [interest rates](/interestrate) have a critical bearing on the price of securities throughout extensive time spans. A recession, for example, can decisively enlarge the price range for most equities as they plunge in price.

For instance, most technology stocks had wide price ranges between 1998 to 2002, as they soared to grand levels in the primary half of that period and afterward drooped — numerous to single-digit prices — in the repercussions of the [dotcom bust](/dotcom-bubble). Essentially, the 2007-08 financial crisis extensively extended the trading range for equities due to the broad correction that saw most indices plunge more than half in price. Stock ranges have restricted essentially since the Great Recession as volatility has diminished during a nine-year bull market.

## Ranges and Volatility

Since price [volatility](/volatility) is equivalent to risk, a security's trading range is a decent indicator of risk. A conservative investor favors securities with more modest price changes compared to securities that are defenseless to huge gyrations. Such an investor might like to invest in additional stable sectors like utilities, healthcare, and telecommunications, as opposed to in more cyclical (or high-beta) sectors like financials, technology, and commodities. Generally talking, high-beta sectors might have more extensive ranges than low-beta sectors.

## Range Support and Resistance

A security's trading range can really highlight support and resistance levels. On the off chance that the lower part of a stock's range has been around $10 on a number of events traversing numerous months or years, then, at that point, the $10 region would be viewed as an area of strong support. In the event that the stock breaks below that level (particularly on heavy volume), traders decipher it as a bearish signal. On the other hand, a breakout over a price that has denoted the highest point of the range on various events is considered as a breach of resistance and gives a bullish signal.
