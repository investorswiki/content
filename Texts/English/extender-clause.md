# Extender Clause
## What Is an Extender Clause?

An extender clause is a contractual provision in an exclusive real estate [listing agreement](/listing-agreement). This type of clause safeguards the listing agent by ensuring their full [commission](/commission) if the property sells after the listing agreement has previously expired.

For the agent to qualify and receive their commission, the buyer must be somebody to whom the agent showed the property during their experience as the listing agent.

## Figuring out Extender Clauses

An extender clause safeguards the listing agent from losing a commission that they earned, even assuming that the agreement has expired. For instance, a seller might hope to cut down on [closing costs](/closingcosts) when they sell their home. To do this, they could try to try not to pay the buyers' agent's commission. On the off chance that the seller goes despite the agent's good faith and makes a deal to sell the home to a buyer after the listing agreement has expired, the seller could set aside cash by not paying the agent's commission.

An extender clause safeguards against such an occurrence, ensuring the agent gets their commission.

While a listing agreement closes, assuming the seller goes into another listing agreement with an alternate agent, they should let the new agent know about an extender clause still in effect for the previous agent.

## How an Extender Clause Works

A homeowner might go into an exclusive listing agreement with a real estate agent. The duration of these agreements shift, yet 90 days is a common length. During those three months, the real estate agent generally strives to carry expected buyers to see the home. Real estate agents work on commission, implying that they are paid in view of the sale and price of properties. This spurs them to get however many likely buyers as they can.

Assuming following three months the exclusive listing agreement terminates and the home has not sold, the seller or the agent might decide not to restore the agreement. The seller might wish to work with an alternate agent or the agent might verify that the house isn't probably going to sell and isn't worth their time.

On the off chance that the listing agreement contained an extender clause, after the agreement has expired, assuming one of the potential buyers who had seen the home through the agent purchases the house, the agent actually receives the commission they would have received through the expired contract.

Extender clauses determine a finish to the provision, which is normally a couple of months after the contract terminates. Consequently, in the event that a potential buyer returns to purchase the home in a little while, if it's still available to be purchased, the agent would at this point not be qualified for their commission.

## Features
- An extender clause just applies to a buyer whom the original agent brought in and normally broadens the period wherein an agent can earn a commission by a couple of months.
- Without an extender clause, a seller could put off a sale until the listing agreement has ended, permitting them to try not to pay the buyer's agent a commission.
- An extender clause safeguards a listing agent if they show a potential buyer a property, yet the buyer doesn't really make the purchase until after that agent no longer has the option to the listing.
