# Unsecured Note
## What Is an Unsecured Note?

An unsecured note is a loan that isn't secured by the issuer's assets. [Unsecured](/unsecured) notes are like [debentures](/debenture) yet offer a higher [rate of return](/rateofreturn). Unsecured notes give less security than a debenture. Such notes are likewise frequently uninsured and subordinated. The note is structured for a fixed period.

## Grasping Unsecured Note

Companies sell unsecured notes through private offerings to generate money for corporate drives, for example, [share repurchases](/sharerepurchase) and [acquisitions](/procurement). An unsecured note isn't backed by any collateral and subsequently presents more risk to lenders. Due to the higher risk implied, these notes' interest rates are higher than with secured notes.

Conversely, a [secured note](/securednote) is a loan backed by the borrower's assets, for example, a mortgage or car loan. On the off chance that the borrower defaults, these assets will go towards the repayment of the note. Consequently, collateral assets must be worth in some measure as much as the note. Extra instances of collateral that can be pledged incorporate stocks, bonds, jewelry, and work of art.

## Unsecured Note and Credit Rating

Credit rating agencies will frequently rate debt issuers. For instance, on account of [Fitch](/fitch-ratings), this agency will offer a letter-based [credit rating](/creditrating) that mirrors the possibilities that the issuer will default, based on internal (i.e., the stability of cash flows) and outside (market-based) factors.

### Investment Grade
- **AAA:** Companies of incredibly high quality (solid, with steady cash flows)
- **AA:** Still high quality; somewhat more risk than AAA
- **A:** Low default risk; fairly more helpless against business or economic factors
- **BBB:** Low expectation of default; business or economic factors could adversely influence the company

### Non-Investment Grade
- **BB:** Elevated weakness to default risk, more powerless to adverse changes in business or economic circumstances; still financially adaptability
- **B:** Degrading financial circumstance; highly speculative
- **CCC:** Real possibility of default
- **CC:** Default is presumably
- **C:** Default or default-like interaction has started
- **RD:** Issuer has defaulted on a payment
- **D:** Defaulted

## Special Considerations

[Liquidation](/liquidation) happens when a company is ruined and can't pay its obligations when they come due. As company operations reach a conclusion, its excess assets go towards paying creditors and shareholders who purchased stakes as well as made loans as the company expanded. Every one of these gatherings has a priority in the order of claims to company assets.

The most senior claims have a place with secured creditors, trailed by unsecured creditors, including bondholders, the government (in the event that the company owes taxes), and employees (assuming the company owes them unpaid wages or different obligations). At last, shareholders receive any leftover assets, beginning with those holding preferred stock followed by holders of common stock.

## Highlights

- An unsecured note is a corporate debt that doesn't have collateral connected and is, consequently, a riskier prospect for an investor.
- Companies sell the unsecured notes through private positions to fund-raise for purchases, share buyback, and other corporate purposes.
- It's not the same as debentures, unsecured corporate debt that frequently have insurance policies to payout in case of a default.
