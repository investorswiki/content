# Fixed Income Forward
## What Is a Fixed Income Forward?

A fixed income forward is a derivatives contract to buy or sell [fixed-income](/fixedincome) securities at some date from now on, however at a price accepted today.

Fixed income alludes to a type of investment wherein real return rates or periodic income is received at normal spans and in all actuality unsurprising levels. Investors might utilize [forward contracts](/forwardcontract) on fixed-income securities to lock in a bond price today while taking ownership or selling the security itself later on.

## How a Fixed Income Forward Works

The risk in holding fixed income forward contracts is that market interest rates for the underlying bonds can increase or diminish. These changes influence the bond's yield and in this manner its price. [Forward rates](/forwardrate) then become the focal point of investor consideration, especially assuming the market for the fixed-income security is considered [volatile](/volatility). A forward rate is the interest rate that is applicable to a financial transaction that will occur from here on out.

> The buyer of a forward contract is betting that the price will rise over the forward price among today and the forward date. The seller anticipates the inverse.

## Special Considerations
### Pricing a Fixed Income Forward

To compute the price of a fixed income forward contract you deduct the [present value (PV)](/presentvalue) of coupon payments, over the life of the contract, from the bond price. This value is accumulated by the risk-free rate over the life of the option. The [risk-free rate](/risk-freerate) addresses the interest an investor would anticipate from a totally risk-free investment over a predetermined period.

The value of the contract is the bond price, less the current value of coupons, less the current value of the price which will be paid at expiration (bond price - PV coupons - PV price paid at expiration).

### Profiting from a Fixed Income Forward

Profiting from a fixed income forward relies upon which side of the contract the investor is on. A buyer enters the contract trusting the market price of the bond will be higher in the future since the difference between the contracted price and the [market price](/market-price) addresses profit. The seller expects that the bond price will fall.

While the number of [coupon](/coupon) payments for the life of the bond might surpass the life of the contract, consideration is just on the payments due during the contract period. This payment limitation is brought about by certain bonds having maturities that are significantly longer than the duration of the contract. Contract participants are hedging for price developments over a more limited period.

Fixed income forward contracts are most loved instruments for investors who are looking to [hedge](/hedge) interest rate or other risks in the bond market. Other traders are drawn to the fixed income forward market to profit from inconsistencies between the forward and [spot markets](/spotmarket) for bonds and other debt instruments.

## Fixed Income Forward versus Fixed Income Future

Fixed income derivatives might be traded on [exchanges](/exchange), where the underlying bond and terms of the contract are normalized. Dissimilar to a forward contract that trades [over-the-counter (OTC)](/otc), a normalized fixed income derivative is an exchange-traded [futures contract](/futurescontract). These exchanges distribute these rates alongside the types of bonds accepted as payment. Otherwise, forwards and futures operate in comparative fashion.
