# Liquidity Risk
## What Is Liquidity Risk?

[Liquidity](/liquidity) is the ability of a firm, company, or even an individual to pay its debts without experiencing catastrophic losses. On the other hand, liquidity risk comes from the lack of marketability of an investment that can't be bought or sold rapidly to the point of preventing or limiting a loss. It is normally reflected in bizarrely wide [bid-ask spreads](/bid-askspread) or large price developments.

## Understanding Liquidity Risk

Common sense is that the more modest the size of the security or its issuer, the larger the liquidity risk. Drops in the value of stocks and different securities propelled numerous investors to sell their holdings at any price in the aftermath of the 9/11 assaults, as well as during the 2007 to 2008 global [credit crisis](/credit-crisis). This hurry to the exits caused augmenting bid-ask spreads and large price declines, which further contributed to market illiquidity.

Liquidity risk happens when an individual investor, business, or [financial institution](/financialinstitution) can't meet its short-term debt obligations. The investor or entity may not be able to change over a [asset](/asset) into cash without surrendering capital and income due to a lack of buyers or a [inefficient market](/inefficientmarket).

## Liquidity Risk in Financial Institutions

Financial institutions rely on borrowed money to a significant degree, so they're normally examined to determine whether they can meet their debt obligations without realizing great losses, which could be catastrophic. Institutions, hence, face severe consistence requirements and stress tests to measure their financial stability.

The [Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation](/fdic) (FDIC) delivered a proposal in April 2016 that made a net stable funding ratio. It was planned to assist with expanding banks' liquidity during periods of financial stress. The ratio shows whether banks own an adequate number of excellent assets that can be handily changed over into cash in one year or less. Banks depend less on short-term funding, which will in general be more unstable.

During the 2008 financial crisis, many big banks failed or faced insolvency issues due to liquidity issues. The FDIC ratio is in accordance with the international [Basel standard](/basel_accord), made in 2015, and it reduces banks' vulnerability in the event of another financial crisis.

## Liquidity Risk in Companies

Investors, managers, and creditors use liquidity measurement ratios while choosing the level of risk inside an organization. They frequently look at short-term [liabilities](/liability) and the liquid assets listed on a company's financial statements.

In the event that a business has too much liquidity risk, it must sell its assets, get extra revenue, or track down one more method for lessening the error between accessible cash and its debt obligations.

## Real-World Example

A $500,000 home could have no buyer when the real estate market is down, however the home could sell over its listed price when the market gets to the next level. The owners could sell the home for less and lose money in the transaction on the off chance that they need cash rapidly so must sell while the market is down.

Investors ought to consider whether they can change over their short-term debt obligations into cash before investing in long-term illiquid assets to hedge against liquidity risk.
