# Asset Valuation Review (AVR)
## What Is Asset Valuation Review (AVR)?

The term [asset valuation](/assetvaluation) survey (AVR) alludes to a cycle that lays out an estimate of the value of a failed [bank's](/bank) [assets](/asset). Banks might fail for a number of reasons. The most common occurrence is the point at which the value of their assets dips under [market value](/marketvalue) — well below their liabilities.

The AVR cycle sets the base price that a regulatory body will acknowledge from other financial institutions that need to purchase the assets from a failed bank.

## Understanding the Asset Valuation Review (AVR)

Banks are an important part of any [economy](/economy). They give banking services to the overall population, issue loans, make [liquidity](/liquidity) in the market, alongside other financial services, for example, [currency exchange](/currency-exchange) and giving safety deposit boxes. These institutions might be in a difficult situation when there are issues in the economy — all of which can lead to failure.

At the point when a bank fails, it can as of now not meet its financial [obligations](/commitment) to its creditors. These are the substances that it owes money to, as well as depositors. As indicated above, banks fail for a number of reasons including [insolvency](/insolvency), or when they can't pay their creditors. Perhaps of the most common justification for why banks fail, however, is on the grounds that the value of their assets falls such a long ways below their market value that their [liabilities](/responsibility).

At the point when this occurs, the fitting regulatory body — federal or state — should make arrangements to sell off the bank's assets. This requires a survey of these assets, which is called an asset valuation survey. The AVR is the interaction by which a failed bank's assets are valued. In the United States, a failed [financial institution](/financialinstitution) is gone over to the [Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation](/fdic) (FDIC) so the bank can be liquidated or merged with a better institution.

The resolution interaction includes gathering data on the failed bank's assets and liabilities, informing the public and other financial institutions that the bank has failed, and is attempting to track down other financial institutions to purchase the failed bank.

Laying out the value of a failed financial institution's assets can be a muddled undertaking, especially when the FDIC is uncertain of the intricacies engaged with the bank. This is, at any rate, until the agency inspects the bank's books.

The regulator evaluates the value of the bank's [portfolio](/portfolio) of assets and [assigns](/dole out) a price to each type of loan gathering. By arranging assets into various pools, the regulator can cross-match the various pools to various banks relying upon their levels of interest. Due to the way that most banks have a large portfolio of assets, for example, loans, the asset valuation survey utilizes a sampling method to estimate the value of the assets.

The sample is commonly a stratified random sample, and the interaction is automated however much as could be expected to guarantee that the valuation is completed rapidly. The regulator might spend additional time assessing the value of a failed bank's largest loans.

## Special Considerations

Many banks failed around the hour of the [Great Depression](/great_depression). This was one of the fundamental justifications for why the FDIC was made. In 1993, when the agency originally opened, upwards of 4,000 banks failed in the United States. By that point, depositors lost as much as $140 billion. The FDIC protected deposits that bank customers wouldn't have the option to recuperate without it.

At the point when a bank fails, the FDIC generally steps in to give financial assistance, for example, [capital loss](/capitalloss) coverage, to draw in different banks into undertaking the transaction. The goal is to end the [liquidation](/liquidation) process as fast as conceivable with the least financial impact to the [deposit insurance fund](/deposit-insurance-fund).
