# Free Rider Problem
## What Is the Free Rider Problem?

The free rider problem is the burden on a shared resource that is made by its utilization or abuse by individuals who aren't paying their fair share for it or aren't paying anything by any means.

The free rider problem can happen in any community, large or small. In a urban area, a city council might discuss whether and how to force suburban workers to add to the upkeep of its streets and walkways or the protection of its police and fire services. A public radio or broadcast station gives airtime to raising support in order to cajole donations from audience members who aren't contributing.

## Figuring out the Free Rider Problem

The free rider problem is an issue in economics. It is viewed to act as an illustration of a [market failure](/marketfailure). That is, it is an inefficient distribution of goods or services that happens when a few people are permitted to consume too much the shared resource or pay not exactly their fair share of the costs.

Free riding prevents the production and consumption of goods and services through conventional [free-market](/freemarket) methods. To the free rider, there is minimal incentive to add to a collective resource since they can partake in its benefits even on the off chance that they don't. As an outcome, the producer of the resource can't be adequately compensated. The shared resource must be financed in another manner, or it won't be made.

## At the point when the Free Rider Problem Arises

The free rider problem as an economics issue just happens under certain conditions:

- At the point when everybody can consume a resource in unlimited sums.
- At the point when nobody can limit any other individual's consumption.
- At the point when somebody needs to create and keep up with the resource. That is, it's anything but a natural lake, it's a pool, and somebody needed to embrace its construction and maintenance.

Financial specialists point out that no business would intentionally deliver goods or services under these conditions. At the point when the free rider problem looms, businesses step back. Either the shared resource won't be given, or a public agency must give it utilizing taxpayer funds.

On the positive side, certain individuals in each community will show that they feel a responsibility to pay their fair share. A blend of a high feeling of trust, positive reciprocity, and a feeling of collective duty makes them ready to pay their fair share.

## Past Economics

The free rider problem can crop up when the resource is shared by all and free to all. Like air. Assuming that a community sets voluntary pollution standards that urge all occupants to cut back on carbon-based fuels, many will answer positively. Yet, some will won't roll out any improvement in their habits. Assuming enough follow the standards, the air quality will improve and every one of the inhabitants will benefit similarly, even the free riders.

## Answers for the Free Riding Problem

Networks that face a free riding problem might try any of several arrangements.

- Government resolves the problem by gathering and distributing tax dollars to finance public services. Hypothetically, taxes are proportionate to income, so fair cost-sharing can be accomplished.
- Networks can transform their public resource into a private or club resource, charging duty to ensure each and every individual who utilizes it adds to it.
- Networks can impose a small fee on everybody. This will limit over-consumption and, over the long run, may even spike unselfish behavior. That is, many individuals might like making a small contribution to a resource that they use.

## Highlights
- Free riding is viewed as a failure of the conventional free market system.
- The problem happens when a few individuals from a community fail to contribute their fair share to the costs of a shared resource.
- Their failure to contribute makes the resource economically infeasible to create.
