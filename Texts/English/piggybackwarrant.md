# Piggyback Warrants
## What Are Piggyback Warrants?

Piggyback warrants are a type of sweetener used to tempt investors to invest in the company giving the primary warrant and piggyback warrant.

## Seeing Piggyback Warrants

Piggyback warrants are ordinarily acquired following the [exercising](/exercise) of another [warrant](/warrant). This acts as a sweetener to an investor in light of the fact that, when they exercise the original warrant, the piggyback warrants offer them the chance to obtain even more shares at a fixed price assuming the company keeps on getting along nicely and the share price rises. Piggyback warrants likewise give the possibility to future capital to the responsible company whenever exercised.

The original or primary warrant is what an investor purchases or gets from the responsible company. The piggyback warrant is appended to the primary warrant. It becomes possibly the most important factor assuming the primary warrant is exercised. The piggyback warrant will normally have an alternate (and generally higher) exercise price than the primary warrant. In this way, the piggyback warrant might become productive assuming the underlying share price keeps on rising following the practicing of the primary warrant. The piggyback warrant might have a further [expiry date](/expirationdate) than the primary warrant, or it very well may be something similar.

A warrant is a type of security issued by a company that gives the holder the right, however not the obligation, to buy shares from the company at a predefined price inside a predetermined time span.

Warrants can be bought or sold, with their value fluctuating as the [underlying share](/underlying-resource) price varies. When the underlying share price moves over the exercise price of the warrant, holders might be tempted to exercise the warrant and buy the shares at the exercise price. For instance, on the off chance that a company issues $9 warrants and after a year their stock is trading at $10, investors can exercise the warrant to buy stock at $9 even however the stock is as of now trading at $10.

This is conceivable in light of the fact that the company issues new shares when a warrant is exercised. Subsequently, warrants are [dilutive](/weakening) in nature, expanding the number of shares outstanding. The company utilizes the funds it gets from individuals practicing the warrants to fund its business.

A piggyback warrant works similarly. Yet this type of warrant is connected to a primary warrant and will happen after the primary warrant is exercised.

## Piggyback Warrant Example

Expect a company has joined a piggyback warrant to a $9 primary warrant. The piggyback warrant regularly has a higher exercise price than the original warrant, so expect the piggyback warrant is exercisable at $12. The original warrant and the piggyback warrants might have a similar expiry date, or the piggyback warrants might terminate sometime in the future.

Assuming that the holder exercises their warrant at $9, on the grounds that the underlying stock price is above $9, then, at that point, the $12 piggyback warrants appear. The holder currently has the option to sell those warrants to another investor, or they can hold them and hope the stock price moves above $12. Assuming the stock price moves above $12, it is beneficial to exercise the piggyback warrant and buy the stock at $12.

In the event that the original warrant isn't exercised before it terminates, then, at that point, there is no piggyback warrant. In the event that the price of the underlying stock doesn't reach $12 before the piggyback warrant lapses, then, at that point, the warrant becomes worthless and fails to exist. Prior to expiry or being exercised, warrants can be bought or sold, like a [option contract](/optionscontract).
