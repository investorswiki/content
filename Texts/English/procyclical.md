# Procyclic
## What Is Procyclic?

Procyclic portrays a state where the behavior and actions of a quantifiable product or service move in tandem with the cyclical condition of the [economy](/economy).

## Figuring out Procyclic

[Economic indicators](/economic_indicator) can have one of three distinct connections to the economy: [Countercyclic](/countercyclicalstock) (indicator and economy move in inverse bearings), non-cyclic (indicator has no importance to the state of the economy), or procyclic.

Procyclic alludes to a condition of a [positive correlation](/positive-correlation) between the value of a decent, a service, or an economic indicator and the overall state of the economy. As such, the value of the upside, service, or indicator will in general move in a similar bearing as the economy, developing when the economy develops and declining when the economy declines.

A few instances of procyclic economic indicators are [gross domestic product](/gdp) (GDP), labor, and marginal cost. Most [consumer goods](/consumer-goods) are additionally considered procyclic in light of the fact that consumers will generally buy more discretionary goods when the economy is looking great.

Policies and fiscal behavior ordinarily fall into procyclic designs in periods of [boom and bust](/boom-and-bust-cycle). At the point when there is economic success, numerous individuals from the population will take part in behavior that falls in accordance with that growth as well as effectively broadens the period.

## Procyclic Example

In the lead up to the housing and [financial crisis](/great-downturn) of the late 2000s, there was a collective expectation for progressing financial gain. Consumers participated in seriously spending, borrowers looked for mortgages for homes that could have been outside of their means to repay, financial institutions energized such behavior, and government policies did barely anything to stop such trends. However long the market collectively upheld the "[boom](/boom)" nature and fed the economy, this went on until the terrible debt and different issues turned out to be too great to overlook, and the markets collapsed.

The economic climate changed when the "bust" part of the [cycle](/economic-cycle) hit. Consumer spending dropped, banks and loan companies clasped down on their lending practices, [foreclosures](/abandonment) spread across the market on homes with passed mortgages, and federal legislation was immediately drafted to keep everything from reoccurring. These were all procyclic reactions to the action within reach.

The further the economy gets away from that crisis period, the additional spending increments, and certain legislation that was considered onerous by financial institutions may be questioned. Such behavior is procyclic on the grounds that, except if there is a motivation to act in an unexpected way, there is a longing to eliminate what might be viewed as requirements on decision when the market appears to be prosperous.

The issue with rigorously procyclic reactions to the economy is they don't consider ground breaking behavior that would prepare the market for the declines that will ultimately return. Assuming precaution legislation is just upheld during times of crisis, probably, the behavior that contributed to the collapse of the market will be rehashed.
