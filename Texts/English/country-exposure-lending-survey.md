The survey started in 1977 and was known as the FR 2036 report. Then, in 1984, it became designated as a [Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council](/ffiec) (FFIEC) report and was renamed the FFIEC 009. It has been amended over the course of the years to give more subtleties and to add things.
