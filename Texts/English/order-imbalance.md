# Order Imbalance
## What Is an Order Imbalance?

Order imbalance is a situation coming about because of an excess of buy or sell orders for a specific security on a trading exchange, making it difficult to match the orders of buyers and sellers. For securities that are supervised by a [market maker](/marketmaker) or specialist, shares might be brought in from a predefined reserve to add liquidity, briefly clearing out excess orders from the inventory so the trading in the security can resume at an orderly level. Extreme instances of order imbalance might cause [suspension of trading](/suspended_trading) until the imbalance is settled.

## Figuring out Order Imbalances

Order imbalances can frequently happen when major news hits a stock, for example, an earnings release, change in guidance, or [merger and acquisition](/mergersandacquisitions) activity. Imbalances can move securities to the upside or downside, yet most imbalances straighten out inside a couple of moments or hours in a single daily session. More modest, less liquid securities can have imbalances that last longer than a single [trading session](/tradingsession) since there are less shares in the hands of less individuals.

Investors can safeguard themselves against the unstable [price changes](/price-change) that can emerge from order imbalances by utilizing limit orders while putting in trades, as opposed to market orders. A market order is just one to buy or sell at the best price that anyone could hope to find at that point, while a limit order is one where the investor needs to buy or sell at a specific price.

## Special Considerations

Different incidents that can lead to order imbalances incorporate holes of data or reports that can possibly influence the shares of a public company. For instance, there may be legislation picking up speed that could influence the company's operations and [business model](/businessmodel). Companies that utilization more up to date technology and platforms that have dominated existing laws might be especially defenseless to this as regulators play make up for lost time and, simultaneously, bring rules that can cut into their [profit margins](/profitmargin).

As each trading day attracts to a close, order imbalances can emerge as investors race to lock in shares close to the closing price. This can especially become possibly the most important factor assuming that the stock price is seen at a discount on that specific trading day.

> Investors who need to try not to buy or selling in the midst of such order imbalances could try to time their orders in advance of the wave of buyers and sellers that might come in.

In the event that there is a notice of an order imbalance with too numerous buyer orders, holders of the stock could immediately jump all over the chance to sell a portion of their shares and make the most of the increased demand. The expectation is they could see a lucrative [return on investment](/returnoninvestment) with possibly higher prices. Alternately, buyers could endeavor to exploit an excess of sell orders when prices have been briefly discounted due to the imbalance.
