# Swap Rate
## What Is a Swap Rate?

A swap rate is the rate of the fixed leg of a swap as determined by its specific market and the gatherings in question. In a [interest rate swap](/interestrateswap), it is the [fixed interest rate](/fixedinterestrate) exchanged for a benchmark rate like [LIBOR](/libor) or the [Fed Funds Rate](/fed-funds-fates) plus or minus a spread. It is likewise the exchange rate associated with the fixed portion of a currency swap.

> - Swap rate means the fixed rate that a party to a swap contract demands in exchange for the obligation to pay a short-term rate, for example, the Labor or Federal Funds rate.
> - At the point when the swap is placed, the fixed rate will be equivalent to the value of floating-rate payments, calculated from the agreed counter-value.
> - Swaps are commonly quoted in a swap spread, which computes the difference between the swap rate and counter-party rate.

## How Does the Swap Rate Work?

Swap rates are applied to various types of swaps. An interest rate swap alludes to the exchange of a floating interest rate for a fixed interest rate. A currency swap alludes to the exchange of interest payments in a single currency for those in another currency. In the two types of transactions, the fixed element is alluded to as the swap rate.

## What Does an Interest Rate Swap Tell You?

In an interest rate swap, one party will be the payer and the other will be the beneficiary of the fixed rate. The cash flow of the fixed-rate leg of the swap is set when the trade is attempted. The cash flow for the floating rate leg is set periodically on the rate [reset dates](/reset-date), which are determined by the reset period of the floating rate leg.

The most common index for the floating rate leg is the three-month Libor. This can either be paid quarterly or compounded and paid semi-yearly. The rate above or below the picked Libor mirrors the [yield curve](/yieldcurve) and [credit spread](/creditspread) to be charged.

Interest rate payments among fixed and floating rate legs are gotten toward the finish of every payment period and just the difference is exchanged.

## What Does a Currency Swap Tell You?

There are three types of interest rate exchanges for a currency swap:

1. The fixed rate of one currency for the fixed rate of the subsequent currency.
1. The fixed rate of one currency for the floating rate of the subsequent currency.
1. The floating rate of one currency for the floating rate of the subsequent currency.

The swap can incorporate or prohibit a full exchange of the [principal amount](/principal) of the currency at both the beginning and the finish of the swap. The interest rate payments are not gotten on the grounds that they are calculated and paid in various currencies. Whether or not or not the principal is exchanged, a swap rate for the conversion of the principal must be set.

On the off chance that there is no exchange of principal, the swap rate is basically utilized for the calculation of the two notional principal currency amounts on which the interest rate payments are based. In the event that there is an exchange, where the swap rate is set can have a financial impact since the exchange rate can change between the beginning of the agreement and its decision.
