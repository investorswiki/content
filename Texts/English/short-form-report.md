## What Is a Short-Form Report?

A short-form report is a concise summary of a [audit](/audit) that has been performed on a company's [financial statements](/financial-statements). The report generally goes before a company's summary balance sheet or financial statements when they are mentioned by another party.

## Understanding a Short-Form Report

The short-form report frequently comprises of two sections. The primary section portrays the scope of the audit, alluding to what financial statements the [auditor](/auditor) has inspected, while the second one presents the discoveries of the audit, illustrating the [auditor's opinion](/auditors-assessment) on whether the financial statements of the company are authentic and accurate.

The short-form report is basically a condensed variant of the long-form report. The last option gives extra information about an auditor's activity and assessment, including any suggestions for the client, assessments on the financial status of the company, as well as a percentage change in the accounts on the financial statements.

A short-form report generally costs less money to deliver in light of the fact that it requires the auditor less investment to prepare. It very well might be utilized without help from anyone else or related to a more definite long-form report or complete [auditor's report](/auditorsreport) when more information is mentioned.

However concise, the short-form report actually must maintain severe rules. These reports are held to the reporting requirements illustrated by the [Securities and Exchange Commission](/sec) (SEC) and the [American Institute of Certified Public Accountants](/american-institute-of-certified-public-accountants) (AICPA).

The short-form report's concise length may not be adequate to give all helpful information assuming that the auditor issues any assessment other than "unqualified." A [unqualified opinion](/unqualified-assessment) means the auditor feels the financial statements are accurate and meet [generally accepted accounting principles](/gaap) (GAAP) standards and other statutory requirements.

A [qualified opinion](/qualifiedopinion), then again, doesn't address a clean bill of wellbeing. It shows that the auditor feels the financial statements, overall, are accurate, yet additionally contained a couple of issues that legitimacy referencing, even in the event that they didn't compromise the exactness of the [accounting](/accounting) data.

At the point when an issue is sufficiently common to compromise the precision of the accounting data, the auditor will issue either a disclaimer or [adverse opinion](/adverseopinion) all things being equal.
