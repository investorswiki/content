# Reverse Survivorship Bias
## What Is Reverse Survivorship Bias?

Reverse survivorship bias depicts a situation where there is a propensity for low entertainers to remain in the game, while high entertainers are inadvertently dropped from the running. This is something contrary to [survivorship bias](/survivorshipbias), which happens when just strong and effective individuals from a group get by and remain in the group.

Reverse survivorship bias should be visible when some cycle becomes locked-in to [path dependency,](/path-dependency, for example, the dominance of VHS over Betamax video cassette tapes; or the dominance of the QWERTY console, which is poor to different designs.

## Understanding Reverse Survivorship Bias

Reverse survivorship bias can be applied to various settings ranging from the housing market to stock indexes and, surprisingly, investors' ways of behaving and capabilities.

Though survivorship bias can bias returns or consequences of a group up, reverse survivorship bias can make the contrary difference and push the overall return of the group descending. This is due to the best entertainers, who would've lifted overall outcomes, being dropped from the group. The phenomenon happens while calculating performance dependent exclusively upon past performances, without taking into account extenuating conditions, for example, the economic standpoint at which choices were made.

Reverse survivorship bias can be credited, now and again, to [path dependency](/path-dependency). Path dependency explains the continued utilization of a product or practice in light of historical preference or use. The utilization of a product or practice might endure even if fresher, more efficient alternatives are accessible. Path dependency happens in light of the fact that it is frequently simpler or more financially savvy to continue along a generally set path as opposed to make a completely new one.

Survivorship bias frequently happens while comparing the performance of portfolio managers. This bias pushes returns higher on the grounds that main the outstanding managers stay in business and can be estimated. Terrible managers can't be estimated in light of the fact that they never again exist. Survivorship bias can likewise pertain to the companies in a benchmark index, as companies that have failed or have lagged will be dropped from the index and never again count in its calculation.

## Illustration of Reverse Survivorship Bias in Finance

An illustration of reverse survivorship can be seen in the [Russell 2000 index](/russell2000) that is a subset of the 2000 smallest securities from the [Russell 3000](/russell_3000). The "failure" stocks stay small and in the small-cap index while the winners leave the index once they become too big and effective.

Consequently, the Russell 2000 basically gathers the somewhat fruitless stocks that don't advance to the [Russell 1000](/russell_1000index), or the subset of the Russell 3000 stocks that addresses the biggest 1,000 publicly traded American companies by [market capitalization](/marketcapitalization).
