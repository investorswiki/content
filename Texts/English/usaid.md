The U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) is an independent federal agency that gives civilian aid to foreign countries. By giving development and philanthropic assistance, the agency expects to additional American interests abroad while further developing lives in the creating world.

## Figuring out the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID)

In 1961, President John F. Kennedy marked the Foreign Assistance Act into law and made USAID by executive order. The agency is entrusted with directing the federal government's civilian [foreign aid](/foreign-aid) programs, which incorporate catastrophe relief, technical assistance, poverty mitigation, and economic development.

While USAID is independent, it is subject to the guidance of the President, the Secretary of State, and the National Security Council. The agency's administrator and appointee administrator are named by the president and confirmed by the Senate.

USAID is responsible for carrying out more than $20 billion in combined annual appointments, the majority of which come from the U.S. State Department. The agency gives assistance to in excess of 120 countries. The main 10 beneficiaries, arranged by funding, are: Jordan, Afghanistan, Ethiopia, Yemen, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Nigeria, Syria, South Sudan, Kenya, and Iraq. Sub-Saharan Africa gets 39% of USAID distributions, with the majority of funding going toward wellbeing and compassionate efforts.

## History of USAID

U.S. civilian assistance to foreign nations started in the nineteenth century with casual "technical missions," in which specialists — frequently with government assistance — ventured out to Asia and Latin America to spread information on industrial strategies, economic policy, disinfection, and different fields. In 1919, Congress shaped the American Relief Administration to give philanthropic assistance to post-war Europe.

Following World War II, the [Marshall Plan](/marshall-plan) saw the U.S. spend generally $13.3 billion (or $143 billion of every 2017 dollars) to modify war-desolated European economies. The Cold War prompted competition between the Soviet Union and the U.S. to win the blessing of "third-world" countries (that is, outside the first-world West or second-world [communist](/socialism) coalition). While a lot of this work was centered around military aid, civilian assistance likewise had an influence.

President Harry S. Truman based upon the Marshall Plan by making international aid a key part of U.S. foreign policy. The goal was to make markets for the U.S. by decreasing poverty and expanding production in agricultural nations. It was in this setting that President Kennedy ordered the State Department to make an independent agency to organize civilian foreign aid.
