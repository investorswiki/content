Utilizing a bid-wanted announcement to get bids may not help the [seller](/seller) receive the highest price for a security, yet giving a lot higher level of privacy is probable.

## Bid Wanted and Municipal Bonds

The [municipal bond ](/municipalbond)market is one in which traders will frequently experience the term bid wanted. One of the more famous platforms for the trading of municipal bonds, offered by Bloomberg, is truth be told called Muni Bid Wanted.

Since municipal bonds are not traded through a central [clearinghouse](/clearinghouse), every transaction is negotiated straightforwardly among buyers and sellers, with a dealer frequently going about as an intermediary for the seller's sake. The trade is induced by sellers proclaiming to the market, or to individual customers, that they need bids on a specific sort of bond. At the point when a seller sets off a bid wanted auction they will receive a rundown of entries; the dealer can then choose whether or not to acknowledge the offer.

Even in the event that a bid is the highest, a dealer of municipal bonds doesn't need to acknowledge it, assuming that they feel it's deficient; all things considered, they can decide to incorporate, or keep the bond on their books â€” that is, buy it from the actual seller, a cycle called a "last look."

## Big Wanted and Abusive Practices

This bilateral nature of the bid wanted auction process has driven a few onlookers of the municipal bond market to blame it for experiencing bias, and some have called for reform of the municipal bond market structure and trading process. In 2019, the SEC Fixed Income Market Structure Advisory Committee issued a statement censuring the abuse of the assimilating system called [pennying](/sub-pennying).

Pennying happens when the dealer, subsequent to exploring the auction data received back in a bid wanted, either matches the best price or executes the bond at a price that is somewhat better (i.e., a penny more). From the get go, this practice seems to benefit the customer, as the dealer is giving to some degree as great a price as was gotten through the auction interaction. Be that as it may, over the long run, this practice hurts seriousness, the Committee contended.

For instance, the utilization of pennying to deliberately assimilate orders stops aggressive pricing or participation in the auction cycle by different dealers who fear that the submitting dealer is going to "step in front of" their triumphant prices or is in any case utilizing the auction cycle exclusively for price discovery purposes. In this way, contending dealers face lessened incentives to put their best foot forward or even present a price into the auction. This cycle would likewise seem to give the submitting dealer an unfair advantage in the auction.
