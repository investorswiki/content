## History of Unemployment Compensation

The primary unemployment compensation system was presented in the United Kingdom with the National Insurance Act of 1911 under the Liberal Party government of H.H. Asquith. The measures were intended to counteract the rising impression of the Labor Party among the nation's working-class population.

The National Insurance Act provided the British working classes with a contributory system of insurance against illness and unemployment; nonetheless, it simply applied to wage earners. The groups of wage earners and those earning non-wage income needed to depend on different sources of support. Socialists — who figured such insurance would keep workers from starting a transformation — condemned the benefit, yet employers and Tories saw it as a "means to an end."

The British unemployment compensation scheme depended on [actuarial](/actuarial-science) principles, and it was funded by a fixed amount contributed by workers, employers, and taxpayers. Following one week of unemployment, the worker was eligible to receive seven shillings each week for as long as 15 weeks in a year. Nonetheless, the benefits were limited to particular industries that tended to have more unstable employment requirements, like shipbuilding, and it didn't make provision for any wards. By 1913, around 2.5 million individuals were insured under the British scheme for unemployment benefits.

In the United States, unemployment compensation started at the state level when Wisconsin enacted it in 1932 to mitigate the effect of the [Great Depression](/great_depression). In 1935, President Franklin D. Roosevelt marked the Social Security Act and laid out it from one side of the country to the other. Initially, employers of less than eight employees were exempt from having the coverage. That number dropped to four out of 1954 and was diminished to one of every 1970.

## Special Considerations

The system is called [Employment Insurance](/employment-insurance) (EI) in Canada and is funded by premiums paid by the two employers and employees. Canada's most memorable national unemployment system was laid out in 1940 by the Unemployment Insurance Act, likewise provoked by the effects of the Great Depression.

The law was expanded and changed in 1971 lastly supplanted in 1996 by the Employment Insurance Act, which changed the program's name to stress that it plans to advance employment as opposed to support unemployment.
