# Asset-Backed Commercial Paper Money Market Fund (AMLF)
## What Was the Asset-Backed Commercial Paper Money Market Fund Liquidity Facility (AMLF)?

The Asset-Backed Commercial Paper Money Market Fund (AMLF) was a lending program that the Federal Reserve Board made during the level of the 2008-2009 financial crisis to give new funding to U.S. financial institutions. The AMLF gave funding that permitted financial institutions to purchase [asset-backed commercial paper](/asset_backed_commercial_paper) from money market mutual funds to prevent default on investors' redemptions.

## Understanding the Asset-Backed Commercial Paper Money Market Fund Liquidity Facility (AMLF)

The Asset-Backed Commercial Paper Money Market Fund (AMLF) started operations on Sept. 19, 2008. Multi week sooner, [Lehman Brothers](/lehman-brothers), the fourth-biggest investment bank in the United States, petitioned for financial protection. The collapse of Lehman Brothers caused serious disturbances in short-term credit markets, as redemption demands by investors flooded.

While money markets are regularly viewed as conservative and liquid investments, they momentarily turned out to be very illiquid. Some money market funds put an impermanent freeze on investor [redemptions](/redemption), a rare move that indicated just the way in which seriously the markets were shaken.

Doing so would hopefully prevent funds from liquidating further assets, which would flatten asset prices even further and potentially add to the deteriorating of the financial crisis.
