# Interval Fund
## What Is an Interval Fund?

An interval fund is a modern type of [closed-end mutual fund](/closed-endinvestment) that periodically offers to buy back a percentage of outstanding shares from [shareholders](/shareholder). Shareholders are not, nonetheless, frequently required to sell their shares back to the fund.

This can be diverged from traditional closed-end funds that raise a recommended amount of capital just at one point in time, frequently through an IPO. After every one of the shares have sold, the offering is "closed" to new assets — consequently, the name. No new investment capital flows into the fund.

## Understanding Interval Funds

Despite the fact that shares of a traditional closed-end fund might exchange on the secondary market, interval fund shares commonly don't trade on the [secondary market](/secondarymarket), however numerous interval funds really do offer shares available to be purchased at current [net asset value](/nav) (NAV) on a continuous basis.

Periodic repurchase offers come at preset intervals of three, six, or twelve months, as illustrated in the fund's [prospectus](/prospectus) and [annual report](/annualreport). The repurchase price depends on the per-share NAV out on the town determined (and announced in advance) by the fund. Note that most frequently, shareholders in the fund have the option to recover their shares at the intervals and are not required to do as such.

The repurchase announcement will indicate a date by which you must acknowledge the repurchase offer and the percentage of all outstanding shares the fund will buy — normally 5%, and some of the time up to 25%. Since repurchase is finished on a [pro-rata](/pro-rata) basis, there is no guarantee investors can reclaim the number of shares they need during a given redemption interval.

Fees for interval funds tend to be higher than for different types of mutual funds, as do returns0. [Minimum investments](/minimum_investment) are frequently somewhere in the range of $10,000 and $25,000 and have [expense ratios](/expenseratio) as high as 3%.

Interval funds are regulated principally under Rule 23c-3 of the [Investment Company Act of 1940](/investmentcompanyact) and are subject to the rules of the [Securities Act of 1933](/securitiesact1933) and the [Securities Exchange Act of 1934](/seact1934).

1. Investors can sell their shares back to the firm at net asset value (NAV) rather than at a discount or premium, dissimilar to other closed-end funds.
