# Product Lifecycle Management (PLM)
## What Is Product Lifecycle Management (PLM)?

Product lifecycle management (PLM) alludes to the treatment of a decent as it travels through the common stages of its [product life](/product-life-cycle): development and presentation, growth, maturity/stability, and decline.

This taking care of includes both the manufacturing of its great and the marketing. The concept of product life cycle illuminates business navigation, from pricing and promotion to expansion or cost-cutting.

## Figuring out Product Lifecycle Management (PLM)

Effective product life cycle management unites the many companies, departments, and employees engaged with the product's production to streamline their activities, with the ultimate goal of creating a product that beats its rivals, is exceptionally profitable, and endures as long as consumer demand and technology permit. It works out positively past just setting up a [bill of materials (BOM)](/bill-of-materials).

PLM systems assist organizations with adapting to the rising complexity and engineering challenges of growing new products. They can be viewed as one of the four foundations of a manufacturing corporation's data technology structure, the others being the management of communications with their clients ([customer relationship management [CRM]](/customer_relation_management)), their dealings with providers ([supply chain management [SCM]](/scm)), and their resources inside the enterprise ([enterprise resource planning [ERP]](/erp)).

Distinguishing which stage of its [life cycle](/lifecycle) a product is in decides the way that it will be marketed. Another product (one in the presentation stage), for instance, should be made sense of, while a mature product should be separated. PLM can influence more fundamental components of a product, too. Even after it arrives at maturity, a product can in any case develop — particularly on the off chance that it is refreshed or augmented somehow or another.

## Benefits of Product Lifecycle Management

Sound product lifecycle management has many benefits, for example, getting the product to market quicker, putting a higher quality product on the market, further developing product safety, expanding sales opportunities, and lessening errors and waste. Specific computer programming is available to help with PLM through capabilities like document management, design integration, and cycle management.

Different benefits include:

- Further developed product quality and reliability
- Reduced prototyping costs
- More accurate and opportune [requests for quote (RFQ)](/demand for-quote), i.e., sales from providers
- Quick identification of sales opportunities and revenue commitments
- Savings through the reuse of original data
- A structure for product enhancement
- Reduced squander
- Further developed ability to oversee seasonal change
- Further developed forecasting to reduce material expenses
- Boosted supply chain cooperation

## A History of Product Lifecycle Management (PLM)

The concept of a product having stages of life (and the need to oversee them) emerged as soon as 1931. Around 1957, an employee of Booz Allen Hamilton, the advertising agency, speculated a five-step life cycle for goods, beginning with the presentation phase, rising through growth and maturity, and eventually hitting saturation and decline.

One of the principal recorded applications of modern PLM happened with American Motors Corporation (AMC) in 1985. Searching for a method for speeding up its product development cycle to better contend with its bigger rivals in 1985 — while coming up short on their bigger spending plans — AMC chose to underscore reinforcing the product lifecycle of its prime products (particularly Jeeps). Following that strategy, subsequent to introducing its minimized Jeep Cherokee, the vehicle that sent off the modern game utility vehicle (SUV) market, AMC started development of another model that eventually appeared as the Jeep Grand Cherokee.

The first part in quite a while journey for quicker product development was the appearance of computer-helped design (CAD) programming systems that made engineers more productive. The second part of this work was the new communication system that permitted clashes to be settled quicker, as well as lessening expensive engineering changes since all drawings and documents were in a central database.

The product data management was powerful to such an extent that after AMC was purchased by Chrysler, the system was expanded all through the enterprise, associating everybody in question in designing and building products. By embracing PLM technology, Chrysler had the option to turn into the vehicle business' least expense maker by the mid-1990s.

## Features
- PLM includes all stages, including the development and manufacturing of a product, to its marketing and customer segmentation.
- The principal benefits of PLM incorporate shortening product development times, knowing when to increase or reduce manufacturing efforts, and how to concentrate marketing efforts.
- Product lifecycle management (PLM) handles a company's approach to the different phases of a product's development through to its ultimate decline.
