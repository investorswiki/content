# Limit Order Information System (LOIS)
## What Is a Limit Order Information System?

A limit order data system is an electronic system (LOIS) involved by experts in the [stock market](/stockmarket). A limit order data system records price and size statements for exchange-listed securities. The data delivered by this system is utilized by supporters and experts to find the best market for making a trade in light of the fact that the service conveys data about where a security is traded, order amounts, and bid and offer prices.

## Understanding a Limit Order Information System (LOIS)

A limit order data system is utilized to find the best securities prices accessible and produces data about securities traded on participating exchanges like the Nasdaq and New York Stock Exchange. A [limit order](/limitorder) is an order to buy or sell a stock at a specific price and incorporates data like order amounts, bid price, offer price, and the exchange on which the security is listed. Limit orders assist with safeguarding buyers or sellers of a stock from selling at a price that is higher or lower than wanted.

## Limit Orders

A limit order is a take-profit order placed with a bank or brokerage to buy or sell a set amount of a financial instrument at a predetermined price or better; on the grounds that a limit order isn't a [market order](/marketorder), it may not be executed assuming the price set by the [investor](/investor) can't be met during the period of time in which the order is left open.

While the execution of a limit order isn't guaranteed, it guarantees that the investor doesn't pass up on the opportunity to buy or sell at the target price point in the event that it is managed in the market. Contingent upon the heading of the position, a limit order is some of the time alluded to as a [buy limit order](/buy-limit-order) or a sell limit order. For instance, a buy limit order that specifies the buyer isn't willing to pay more than $30 per share, while a sell limit order might require the share price to be no less than $30 for the sale to take place.

## Order Management System

A [Order Management System](/oms), or OMS, is a computer software system utilized in a number of industries for order entry and processing. Orders can be received from organizations, consumers, or a mix of both, contingent upon the products. Offers and pricing might be done through indexes, sites, or broadcast network promotions.

One more use for order management systems is as a software-based platform that works with and deals with the order execution of securities. Order management systems, at times referred to in the financial markets as trade order management systems, are utilized on both the buy-side and the sell-side, albeit the usefulness given by buy-side and sell-side OMS contrasts marginally. Ordinarily, just exchange individuals can interface straightforwardly to an exchange, and that means that a sell-side OMS as a rule has exchange network, while a buy-side OMS is worried about interfacing with sell-side firms.
