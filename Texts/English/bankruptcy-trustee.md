## What Is a Bankruptcy Trustee?

A bankruptcy trustee is a person designated by the United States Trustee, an officer of the Department of Justice, to address a debtor's estate in a bankruptcy continuing. Bankruptcy trustees assess and set proposals about different debtor expectations as per the U.S. Bankruptcy Code.

Nonetheless, a bankruptcy judge has the ultimate authority on the distribution of assets. A bankruptcy trustee works with the [bankruptcy court](/bankruptcy-court) to make any move. The [trustee](/trustee) can't act without endorsement by the court.

## Figuring out Bankruptcy Trustee Responsibilities

A trustee's liabilities contrast in light of the type of bankruptcy continuing they are joining in. In a [Chapter 7](/chapter7) bankruptcy continuing, the action is basically a liquidation. The trustee will deal with the sale of the assets and afterward regulate the distribution of the proceeds to creditors.

With a [Chapter 11](/chapter11) continuing, the debtor, generally a business owner, desires to rise out of bankruptcy and proceed with operation.

## What Is Chapter 7?

Chapter 7 of Title 11 of the U.S. bankruptcy code controls the course of asset liquidation. A named trustee will liquidate nonexempt assets to pay creditors. After the exhaustion of proceeds from the liquidation, the trustee and court discharge the excess debt.

There are qualification requirements to file a Chapter 7 bankruptcy. A debtor must not have had a Chapter 7 bankruptcy discharged in the first eight years, for instance, and the candidate must [pass a means test](/bapcpa). The Chapter 7 cycle is otherwise called a straight or liquidation bankruptcy.

## Characterizing Chapter 11

Chapter 11 is a form of bankruptcy which includes a reorganization of a debtor's business affairs, debts, and assets. Named after the U.S. bankruptcy code 11, corporations generally are the elements that file for Chapter 11 since this continuing takes into consideration additional time (corporations call for investment for [debt restructuring](/debtrestructuring)). Chapter 11 gives a debtor a new beginning, subject to the satisfaction of their obligations under the reorganization plan.

As Chapter 11 is the most complex of all bankruptcy cases and generally the most costly, a company would think about reorganization solely after careful analysis and exploration of any remaining alternatives.

## Chapter 13 and Restructuring Debts

Chapter 13 bankruptcy empowers individuals with an ordinary income to rebuild their obligations to repay their debt after some time. In such a plan, the debtor doesn't look to earn general forgiveness of their outstanding debts. Rather, the debtor offers up a repayment plan that utilizes fixed installment payments.

Chapter 13 bankruptcy formerly was called a wage earner's plan since relief under it was simply accessible to individuals who earned a normal wage. Subsequent statute changes expanded it to incorporate any individual, including the self-employed and those operating a unincorporated business.
