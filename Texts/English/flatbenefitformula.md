# Flat Benefit Formula
## What Is a Flat Benefit Formula?

A flat benefit formula is one method for computing a pension payout from an employee's [defined benefit plan](/definedbenefitpensionplan). In a flat benefit formula, the employer duplicates an employee's months or long periods of service by a foreordained flat rate.

This method might be compared with the [unit benefit formula](/unitbenefitformula), which pays a percentage of the employee's salary for every extended period of service; and the [variable benefit plan](/variable-benefit-plan), in which the pension payout changes relying upon how well the plan's investments perform.

## Seeing Flat Benefit Formulas

Flat benefit formula is one of the three essential ways of computing how much an employee will receive as a pension benefit from a defined benefit (DB) plan. The other two methods of calculation are regularly alluded to as unit benefit and variable benefit.

A defined benefit plan is an employer-sponsored retirement plan where employee benefits are registered utilizing a formula that thinks about several factors, like length of employment and salary history. The company controls [portfolio management](/portfoliomanagement) and [investment risk](/riskmanagement) for the plan. There are likewise limitations on when and by what method an employee can pull out funds without punishments. A defined benefit plan is likewise alluded to as a [pension](/pensionplan). In a defined benefit plan, the employer adds to a retirement fund, which offers a set payout upon retirement. In a defined benefit plan that utilizes a flat benefit formula, the benefit comes from duplicating the employee's years or months of service by a flat foreordained dollar amount.

## Model

A flat benefit formula takes the employee's tenure at a work environment as the key factor in the formula that decides how much an employer will pay toward an employee's defined benefit plan.

For instance, a defined benefit plan might give a flat benefit of $400 for each extended time of service. For an employee with 35 years of service, the employer computes the annual benefit as follows:

- Years * flat compensation figure = annual retirement benefit
- The calculation yields: 35 * $400= $14,000 each year.

Flat benefit formulas are more normal among defined benefit plans for hourly workers and ordinarily bring about a lower pension payment than different methods of computing benefits.

## Flat Benefit Compared to Unit Benefit and Variable Benefit

A unit benefit formula considers both the length of employment as well as the employee's salary. At the hour of retirement, the employer will commonly work out the benefit by duplicating the months or long stretches of service, their last average earnings over a set period of time, and a foreordained percentage. One more formula might make the calculation in light of a percentage of wages earned all through the employee's career with the employer.

For instance, consider an employer that offers a 2 percent unit benefit plan, and that works out benefits in view of the average earnings throughout recent long stretches of employment. If an employee with a last average salary of $120,000 and 35 years of service resigns, their annual retirement benefit still up in the air with the accompanying calculation:

- Years * average earnings * compensation percentage = annual retirement benefit
- The calculation yields: 35 * 120,000 *.02 = $84,000

A variable benefit formula, as its name demonstrates, is tied to investment performance. While the common defined benefit plans offer a set return consistently, in this case, the benefit will vacillate due to changes in the market.

## Features
- The flat benefit formula is a straight-forward methodology for computing the pension benefits owned to defined benefit plan participants.
- The flat benefit formula pays out a fixed annual amount in view of an employee's tenure at the company and a flat benefits rate.
- Flat benefits ordinarily pay out lower amounts than different methodologies, and are generally common among hourly employees in a pension plan.
