# Political Futures
## What Are Political Futures?

Political futures are a type of [futures contract](/futurescontract) used to hypothesize on the outcome of political occasions. Despite the fact that they are comparable in function to commodity futures contracts, political futures are as of now illegal in the United States.

## Understanding Political Futures

Political futures markets are a type of [prediction market](/prediction-market) in which participants hypothesize by buying "shares" in a specific determined outcome. For instance, an investor may be a political future in which they profit in the event that a given political candidate wins their impending election. Different investors would buy shares in the contrary outcome, and would remain to benefit assuming that candidate loses.

Political futures are like [binary options](/binary-choice), in that the outcomes must be unambiguous and mutually exclusive. For example, the inquiry "Will Joe Biden win re-appointment in 2024?" would be a suitable subject for a political futures contract. Then again, an inquiry, for example, "The number of Model 3s that will Tesla (TSLA) make in 2020?" wouldn't be a suitable inquiry, in light of the fact that the response can't be decreased to a binary outcome, for example, "Yes" or "No."

In the event that the investor's prediction is right, they receive a payout, while erroneous predictions don't receive anything. Justifiably, more hazardous wagers are associated with higher expected adjustments, as well as the other way around.

Until the past 2020 presidential elections, participants were limited to contracts of $500 and could [speculate](/hypothesis) on the outcome of the 2020 presidential election.
