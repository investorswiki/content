Those terms and conditions are non-negotiable, meaning the more fragile party in the contract must consent to the contract as it is as opposed to mentioning provisions be added, eliminated, or changed.

For instance, digital adhesion contracts marked online have been tested in court for covering statements or making it challenging to peruse certain provisions, so a digital adhesion contract must now be as close to a paper contract as could be expected.

## Enforceability of Adhesion Contracts

For a contract to be treated as an adhesion contract, it must be introduced as a "live with or without it" deal, providing one party no ability to arrange due to their inconsistent bargaining position. Adhesion contracts are subject to examination, however, and that investigation normally comes in one of two forms.

Courts have customarily utilized the doctrine of reasonable expectations to test whether an adhesion contract is enforceable.

Unconscionability is simpler to contend in the event that the provider is creating a critical gain from the agreement, particularly assuming the amount of profit is somehow or another tied to the more fragile party's lack of bargaining power. A few legal specialists have pushed back on this approach as it has suggestions in terms of the freedom of contract — the legal concept that individuals can uninhibitedly decide the provisions of a contract without government obstruction.
