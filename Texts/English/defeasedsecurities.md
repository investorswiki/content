# Defeased Securities
## What Are Defeased Securities?

Defeased securities are securities that have been secured by another asset, for example, cash or a cash equivalent in a [sinking fund](/sinkingfund), by the debt-giving firm which can then invalidate its [balance sheet](/balancesheet) obligation.

Defeasance, all the more generally, is any provision in a contract that voids a bond or loan on a balance sheet when the borrower sets to the side cash or other okay bonds sufficiently adequate to service the debt.

## Grasping Defeased Securities

A defeased security is a [bond](/bond) which, after its issuance, has its outstanding debt [collateralized](/collateralization) with cash equivalents or [risk-free securities](/riskfreeasset).

The funds utilized as collateral are adequate to meet all payments of [principal](/principal) and interest on the outstanding bonds as they become due. If, for reasons unknown, the funds utilized for [defeasance](/defeasance) are deficient to satisfy the future payment of the outstanding debt, the issuer would keep on being legally committed to make a payment on such debt from the pledged incomes.

For instance, the U.S. government could place the funds important to pay off a series of [Treasury bonds](/treasurybond) in a trust account specifically made to pay the outstanding bonds upon maturity. The government sets to the side these funds to guarantee that it has sufficient cash to pay its bonds when they are due. Usually, defeased securities are additionally [retractable](/retractablebond).

Securities that can be defeased will frequently carry a lower yield than comparable securities, as obligations on the securities are guaranteed by a fund that has been set to the side to dispense payments to the outstanding bondholders.

At the point when a municipal authority chooses to recover an existing bond right on time due to falling [interest rates](/interestrate) in the markets, it issues another bond that mirrors the lower financing rate. Issuers like to finance their debts at the most minimal cost conceivable; thus, it is entirely expected for higher-coupon bonds to be retired prior to maturity for cheaper bonds.

Nonetheless, due to a [call protection](/callprotection) fastened to [callable bonds](/callablebond), a municipal issuer is restricted from buying back outstanding bonds for a while. During this lockout period, when bondholders are protected from early redemption, the issuer utilizes the proceeds from the new issues to buy okay [Treasury bills](/treasurybill). The bills are kept in an escrow account until the call protection period terminates, at which point the Treasuries will be sold to pay off the interest and principal obligations of the existing or defeased bonds.

Corporate [bond indentures](/trust_indenture) frequently contain defeasance provisions which permit a company that recently issued a bond to deliver an escrow account with Treasury securities to the bond trustee. This account is pledged as collateral to guarantee the interest payments and principal repayment on the debt security. The interest and principal payments from the Treasury debt closely match the interest and principal obligations to be paid on the outstanding bond.

After the escrow account has been given, the responsible company is presently not obligated for servicing the debt. All things considered, the Treasury escrow account becomes responsible. A corporate issuer will frequently defease its existing securities when it might want to retire its debt yet doesn't have a [optional redemption clause](/required redemption-plan) on the bonds.
