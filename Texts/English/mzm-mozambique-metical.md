The currency's name, the metical, comes from the Arabic word **mithqal**, a unit of weight and an alternative name for the gold **dinar** coin that saw use all through a lot of Africa until the nineteenth century. In 2006, the country [re-valued](/revaluation) and once again issued the "new metical", under the currency symbol MZN and retired the MZM totally in 2012.

## Understanding the Mozambique Metical

Mozambique's central bank, the Banco de Mo\u00e7ambique, issues and controls the Mozambique Metical (MZM). The metical has had two issuances. The main supplanted the Mozambican escudo at par on June 16, 1980.

The plural of metical is **meticais**. The Mozambique metical subdivides into 100 **centavos** is addressed by the symbol MTn or MT. Banknotes circled in denominations of 50, 100, 500, and 1,000 meticais. Coins had denominations of 50 centavos, 1, 2.5, 10, and 20 meticais.

[Hyperinflation](/hyperinflation) caused fast [devaluation](/devaluation) of the MZM, bringing about another issue of banknotes in 2003 that had higher denominations, coming to up to 200,000 and, surprisingly, 500,000 meticais. The country's economy proceeded to battle, and by 2005 the metical turned into the lowest-valued currency in the world in comparison to the United States dollar ([USD](/usd)).

Gone on downward pressures constrained the [redenomination](/redenomination) of the Mozambique metical at a rate of 1000:1 on July 1, 2006. To make up for the lower value, new banknotes in denominations of 20, 50, 100, 200, 500 and 1,000 meticais and coins in denominations of 1, 5, 10, 20, 50 centavos and 1, 2, 5 and 10 meticais flowed. These became known as the "new metical", with the currency symbol MZN. Until December 31, 2006, the country progressed, and both the old and new notes were [legal tender](/legal-tender). During the conversion, the new currency was locally abbreviated as MTn yet has since usually returned to MT. By December 31, 2012, the old meticals were presently not redeemable for new meticals and at this point not utilized in exchange.

On October 1, 2011, Banco de Mo\u00e7ambique issued another series of banknotes that were like the 2006 series. Notwithstanding, the new notes had enhanced security features to prevent duplicating. The front sides of the bills all feature a picture of Samora Mois\u00e9s Machel, Mozambique's most memorable President after independence in 1975.

In the years somewhere in the range of 2007 and 2017, the new metical hit new record lows against the U.S. dollar. It arrived at an all-time low of 78.45:1 in October 2016. This drop in value was due in part to the discovery of recently hidden loans conceded to three state-owned companies. The decline drove the International Monetary Fund ([IMF](/imf)) to halt budget support.
