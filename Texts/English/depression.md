## What is a depression?
A depression is an extreme economic downturn that goes on for an extended period of time, portrayed by a precarious contraction in [gross domestic product](/gdp) (GDP), employment and other key economic indicators. There is no official proportion of the length and depth of an economic contraction that is a depression, and they are viewed as rare events. A depression can be viewed as a more serious and longer-enduring variant of a [recession](/recession).
## More profound definition
A depression affects an economy and a whole society, and normally influences more than one country. Depressions are described by the inaccessibility of credit, unmistakable declines in income, increased debt loads and defaults, a monstrous stoppage in retail and discount deals, declines in output, and the loss of value of a country's currency. Huge unemployment is a central sign of a depression. A depression normally decreases territorial or even global trade.
Like a recession, a depression is ignited by a monetary emergency, [stock market crash](/stock-market-crash) or the collapse of a [asset bubble](/bubble), combined with big declines in consumer confidence. Not at all like recessions, they are not viewed as a normal part of the business cycle. A recession is generally set off by similar peculiarities as a depression: as the business cycle arrives at its pinnacle and prices surpass underlying asset values, causing a market crash. Investors, business individuals and consumers pull back, spending and credit evaporates, and recession sets in. The difference is that a depression endures significantly longer, and recovery is substantially more troublesome.
The National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER) officially declares the starting dates and ending dates of recessions in the United States, however it plays no comparative official part for depressions. Financial experts generally concur that a depression is portrayed by a period of GDP contraction that endures longer than two years and an overall decline in GDP greater than 10 percent.
Since the reasons for a depression are perplexing, the arrangements are generally extremely muddled, requiring broad economic intervention by governments and [central banks](/centralbank). Governments send off special programs to animate job creation and lift wages, to reestablish consumer confidence. Central banks seek after extremely simple monetary policy, as well as negative interest rates, and make special drives to give [liquidity](/liquidity) and invigorate investment.
## Depression model
The most eminent depression in modern history is the Great Depression, which started with stock market crashes in 1929, and by certain measures went on until 1941. There was a consistent increase in consumer debt all through the 1920s, incorporating several asset bubbles in real estate and stocks. A series of stock market crashes in 1929, including the Black Thursday crash on October 24th, 1929, ignited far reaching panic and cleared out the investments of both expert investors and ordinary residents.
Over half of the banks in the U.S. failed, unemployment moved to in excess of 25 percent in the mid 1930s, and output fell abruptly. By certain measures, GDP contracted around 30 percent somewhere in the range of 1929 and 1933. The federal government initiated a wide assortment of aid programs under President Franklin Delano Roosevelt, and furthermore made the foundation of the welfare state, including [Social Security](/socialsecurity). A few financial specialists trust that main the entry of the U.S. into World War II and the going with industrial expansion eventually pulled the economy out of depression.
