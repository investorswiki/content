## What Is a Lock Period?

A lock period alludes to a window of time, commonly 30 to 90 days, during which a mortgage lender must keep a specific loan offer open to a borrower. During this period, the borrower prepares for closing, and the lender processes the loan application.

A [mortgage rate lock](/mortgage_rate_lock) is an agreement between a lender and a borrower that permits the borrower a guaranteed interest rate on the mortgage during the lock period, generally at the predominant market interest rate. A loan lock gives the borrower protection against a rise in interest rates during the lock period.

A lock period offers the borrower peace of brain with regards to protection from rising [interest rates](/interestrate) while the lender processes the loan application. Processing times change by jurisdiction, yet the length of the lock ought to generally mirror nearby average endorsement periods. During that time, rates can rise or fall.

Assuming that rates rise during the lock period, the borrower ought to be protected against [interest rate risk](/interestraterisk), the likelihood of interest rate vacillation.

Yet again on the off chance that the lender can't endorse the application during the lock period, however, the borrower will be presented to interest rate risk. To expand the lock period, a borrower might decide to pay a fee, or [lock deposit](/mortgage_rate_lock_deposit).

Lock periods include several important variables and a borrower ought to know about the compromises that happen when changes are made. By and large, it is a valuable instrument for the borrower and one worth seeking after.
