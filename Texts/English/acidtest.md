# Acid-Test Ratio
## What Is the Acid-Test Ratio?

The acid-test ratio, usually known as the [quick ratio](/quickratio), utilizes a firm's balance sheet data as an indicator of whether it has adequate short-term assets to cover its short-term liabilities.

## Figuring out the Acid-Test Ratio

In certain circumstances, analysts like to utilize the acid-test ratio as opposed to the current ratio (otherwise called the [working capital ratio](/workingcapital)) on the grounds that the acid-test method overlooks assets, for example, inventory, which might be challenging to liquidate quickly. The acid test ratio is in this manner a more conservative measurement.

Companies with an acid-test ratio of under 1 need more [liquid assets](/liquidasset) to pay their current liabilities and ought to be treated with alert. Assuming the acid-test ratio is a lot of lower than the current ratio, it means that a company's current assets are highly dependent on inventory.

This is definitely not a terrible sign in all cases, be that as it may, as some business models are intrinsically dependent on inventory. Retail stores, for instance, may have exceptionally low acid-test ratios without fundamentally being in harm's way. The acceptable reach for an acid-test ratio will fluctuate among various industries, and you'll observe that correlations are most significant while dissecting peer companies in a similar industry as one another.

For most industries, the acid-test ratio ought to surpass 1. Then again, an exceptionally high ratio isn't great 100% of the time. It could demonstrate that cash has accumulated and is idle, instead of being reinvested, returned to shareholders, or generally put to useful use.

Some tech companies create gigantic cash flows and as needs be have acid-test ratios as high as 7 or 8. While this is certainly better than the alternative, these companies have drawn analysis from [activist investors](/activist-financial backer) who might would rather that shareholders receive a portion of the profits.

## Computing the Acid-Test Ratio

The numerator of the acid-test ratio can be defined in different ways, yet the fundamental consideration ought to acquire a reasonable perspective on the company's liquid assets. Endlessly cash equivalents ought to be incorporated, as ought to short-term investments, like marketable securities.

Accounts receivable are generally included, however this isn't suitable for each industry. In the construction industry, for instance, accounts receivable may find opportunity to recover than is standard practice in different industries, so including it could cause a firm's financial position to appear to be significantly more secure than it is in reality.

One more method for ascertaining the numerator is to take all current assets and deduct illiquid assets. Most importantly, inventory ought to be deducted, keeping as a main priority that this will negatively skew the image for retail businesses in view of the amount of inventory they carry. Different components that show up as assets on a balance sheet ought to be deducted in the event that they can't be utilized to cover liabilities in the short term, like advances to providers, [prepayments](/prepaidexpense), and deferred tax assets.

The ratio's denominator ought to incorporate every current liability, which are debts and obligations that are due in one year or less. It is important to note that time isn't figured into the acid-test ratio. Assuming that a company's accounts payable are almost due yet its receivables won't come in for a really long time, that company could be on a lot shakier ground than its ratio would demonstrate. The inverse can likewise be true.

## Acid-Test Ratio Example

A company's acid-test ratio can be calculated utilizing its balance sheet. Below is an abbreviated variant of Apple Inc's. (AAPL) balance sheet as of Jan. 27, 2022, showing the parts of the company's current assets and current liabilities (all figures in huge number of dollars):
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td> Cash and cash equivalents</td><td> 37,119</td></tr>
<tr>
<td> Short-term marketable securities</td><td> 26,794</td></tr>
<tr>
<td> Accounts receivable</td><td> 30,213</td></tr>
<tr>
<td> Inventories</td><td> 5,876</td></tr>
<tr>
<td> Vendor non-trade receivables</td><td> 35,040</td></tr>
<tr>
<td> Other current assets</td><td> 18,112</td></tr>
<tr>
<td> Total current assets</td><td> 153,154</td></tr>
<tr>
<td></td><td></td></tr>
<tr>
<td>Accounts payable</td><td>74,362</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>Other current liabilities</td><td>49,167</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>Deferred revenue</td><td>7,876</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>Commercial paper</td><td>5,000</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>Term debt</td><td>11,169</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>Total current liabilities</td><td>147,574</td></tr>
</tbody>
</table>
To acquire the company's liquid current assets, add endlessly cash equivalents, short-term marketable securities, accounts receivable, and vendor non-exchange receivables. Then partition current liquid current assets by total current liabilities to work out the acid-test ratio. The calculation would seem to be the following:

>
> Apple's ATR = ($37,119 + 26,795 + 30,213 + 35,040)/($123,529) = 1.05
>

Not every person ascertains this ratio the equivalent. There is no single, firm method for determining a company's acid-test ratio, yet it is important to comprehend how data suppliers come to their end results.

## Highlights
