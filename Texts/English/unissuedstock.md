# Unissued Stock
## What Is Unissued Stock?

Unissued stock are company [shares](/shares) that don't flow, nor have they been put available to be purchased to either employees or the overall population. In that capacity, companies don't print [stock certificates](/stockcertificate) for unissued shares. Unissued shares are ordinarily held in a company's treasury. Their number typically makes little difference to shareholders.

## Grasping Unissued Stock

At the point when a company opens up to the world, it approves a certain number of shares to be made in its charter or articles of incorporation. These shares are alluded to as [authorized stock](/authorizedstock). Authorized stock is contained all stock that has been made, including shares available to be purchased to investors and issued to employees, as well as any shares not available to be purchased. The former is called [outstanding stock](/outstandingshares), while the last option is alluded to as unissued shares. Companies don't print up certificates for unissued stock, which are held in the company's treasury.

The number of unissued shares can be calculated by taking total shares authorized for issuance and deducting this from total shares outstanding, plus [treasury stock](/treasurystock) from the total number of authorized shares. Treasury stocks are the shares repurchased by a company.

Unissued shares are not pertinent to stockholders, as in these shares don't meet all requirements for voting rights nor do they receive [dividends](/profit). In any case, this can change, as they address the possibility for a [dilution](/dilution) in the value of existing shareholder ownership — and subsequently share value — should the company decide to issue extra shares of stock from now on.

Analysts and investors closely monitor a company's plans for issuance of beforehand unissued shares. Funding plans that call for issuance of shares could be dilutive to the company's [earnings per share](/eps) (EPS).

However they address a possible source of ownership and earnings dilution for investors, unissued shares are excluded from completely diluted earnings per share computations. In any case, earnings per share estimations in all actuality do take into account the potential for convertible securities to be changed over into equity as well as stock options conceded yet not yet worked out.

## Unissued Stock versus Treasury Shares

Unissued stock is generally not equivalent to treasury stock. Treasury stock addresses any shares that have previously been issued and sold yet have thusly been [repurchased by the company](/sharerepurchase). Yet, the lines between the two might be marginally obscured, as certain companies might decide to list these shares as unissued stock.

Companies that decide to list treasury shares as unissued stock have [corporate charters](/corporatecharter) that consider the issuance of a large number of stock shares to give maximum flexibility in the event future stock sales are required. A company could reveal in the notes of its financial statements that it has the authorization to issue 10 million shares, yet just a small portion of that amount may be both issued and outstanding.

We should look at a real model. A 2016 8-K recorded with the [Securities and Exchange Commission](/sec) (SEC) by Dollar Tree (DLTR) states: "Shares purchased under the share repurchase authorizations are generally held in treasury or are canceled and returned to the situation with authorized however unissued shares."
