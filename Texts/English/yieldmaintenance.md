# Yield Maintenance
## What Is Yield Maintenance?

Yield maintenance is a kind of [prepayment penalty](/prepaymentpenalty) that permits investors to accomplish a similar yield as though the borrower made all scheduled interest payments up until the maturity date. It directs that borrowers pay the [rate differential](/interest-rate-differential) between the loan interest rate and the predominant market interest rate on the prepaid capital for the period staying to loan maturity.

Yield maintenance premiums are intended to make investors not interested in [prepayment ](/prepayment)(the settlement of a debt or installment loan before its official due date). Moreover, it makes refinancing ugly and uneconomical to borrowers.

## Grasping Yield Maintenance

At the point when a borrower gets financing, either by giving bonds or by applying for a new line of credit (e.g., mortgage, car loan, business loan, and so on), the lender is periodically paid interest as compensation for the utilization of their money for a while. The interest that is expected comprises a rate of return for the lender who projects earnings in view of the rate.

For instance, an investor who purchases a 10-year bond with a $100,000 [face value](/facevalue) and an annual [coupon rate](/coupon-rate) of 7%, means to be credited annually by 7% x $100,000 = $7,000. Similarly, a bank that supports a $350,000 at a fixed interest rate hopes to receive interest payments month to month until the borrower finishes the mortgage payments years down the line.

Be that as it may, there are circumstances in which the borrower pays off the loan early or calls in a bond prior to the maturity date. This threat of a premature return of the principal is known as [prepayment risk](/prepaymentrisk) (in financial language, "prepayment" means the settlement of a debt or installment loan before its official due date). Each debt instrument conveys it, and each lender faces it, somewhat. The risk is that the lender will not get the interest income stream for as long a period as they depended on.

> The most common justification behind loan prepayment is a drop in interest rates, which gives an opportunity to a borrower or bond issuer to refinance its debt at a lower interest rate.

To remunerate lenders if a borrower repays the loan sooner than scheduled, a [prepayment](/prepayment) fee or premium, known as yield maintenance, is charged. In effect, the yield maintenance permits the lender to earn its original yield without experiencing any loss.

Yield maintenance is most common in the commercial mortgage industry. For instance, we should envision a building owner who's applied for a new line of credit to buy a contiguous property. It's a 30-year mortgage, however five years in, interest rates have fallen extensively, and the owner chooses to refinance. He acquires money from one more lender and pays off his old mortgage. Assuming the bank that issued that mortgage forced a yield maintenance fee or premium, it would have the option to reinvest the money returned to them, plus the penalty amount, in safe Treasury securities and receive similar cash flow as they would in the event that they had received all scheduled loan payments for the whole duration of the loan.

## The most effective method to Calculate Yield Maintenance

The formula for working out a yield maintenance premium is:

**Yield Maintenance = Present Value of Remaining Payments on the Mortgage x (Interest Rate - Treasury Yield)**

The Present Value factor in the formula can be calculated as (1 - (1+r)^-n/12^)/r

where r = Treasury yield

n = number of months

For instance, expect a borrower has a $60,000 balance staying on a loan with 5% interest. The excess term of the loan is precisely five years or 60 months. In the event that the borrower chooses to pay off the loan when the yield on 5-year Treasury notes drops to 3%, The yield maintenance can be calculated along these lines.

Step 1: PV = [(1 - (1.03)^-60/12^)/0.03] x $60,000

PV = 4.58 x $60,000

PV = $274,782.43

Step 2: Yield Maintenance = $274,782.43 x (0.05 - 0.03)

Yield Maintenance = $274,782.43 x (0.05 - 0.03)

Yield Maintenance = $5,495.65

The borrower should pay an extra $5,495.65 to prepay his debt.

If [Treasury yields](/treasury-yield) go up from where they were the point at which a loan was taken out, the lender can create a gain by accepting the early loan repayment amount and lending the money out at a higher rate or investing the money in higher-paying treasury bonds. In this case, there is no yield loss to the lender, however it will in any case charge a prepayment penalty on the principal balance.

## Features
- The formula for computing a yield maintenance premium is: Yield Maintenance = Present Value of Remaining Payments on the Mortgage x (Interest Rate - Treasury Yield).
- Yield maintenance is planned to relieve lenders' prepayment risk, or to deter borrowers from settling their debts ahead of schedule.
- Yield maintenance is a sort of prepayment fee that borrowers pay to lenders, or bond issuers to investors, to make up for the loss of interest coming about because of the prepayment of a loan or the calling in of a bond.
