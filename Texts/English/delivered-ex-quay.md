# Delivered Ex Quay (DEQ)
## What Is Delivered Ex Quay?

In international trade, DEQ or "delivered ex quay" was a contract particular where the seller needed to deliver the goods to the quay or wharf at the destination port. In 2010, delivered ex quay was replaced with delivered at terminal (DAT). Starting around 2020, delivered at place dumped (DPU) unseated DAT.

> A replacement of the term "delivered ex quay" (DEQ), "delivered at terminal" is a more extensive term, as the "terminal" alluded to can be any place, whether on a stream or a hub for one more sort of transportation route.

## Grasping Delivered Ex Quay (DEQ)

Delivered ex quay (DEQ) was a legal term as defined by the [Incoterms](/incoterms), the International Commercial Terms distributed by the International Chamber of Commerce. These terms, all with three-letter shortened forms, connect with common contractual practices in international trade and are utilized as standard things to characterize certain contract terms.

The "D" (delivered") portion of the Incoterms is onerous to the seller as the seller needs to bear all risks and costs until the thing is properly delivered as indicated. Delivered at terminal (DAT) was defined as a legal term by the Incoterms in 2010. As opposed to DEQ, DAT was accessible to all ship modes and different terminals (not just quays or wharves). DPU expands the definition of location. For example, it can incorporate the buyer's premises.

Delivered ex quay signified things to be delivered at a wharf, and was subsequently applicable to goods delivered through streams (whether inland or sea). It very well may be indicated as either duty paid (where the seller was responsible for all costs, like customs duty and taxes, associated with the delivery) or unpaid (where the buyer would expect these costs).

## Delivered Ex Quay (DEQ) versus Delivered Ex Ship (DES)

Delivered ex quay was an alternative to [delivered ex ship](/des) (DES), which have both been replaced with DPU. With a DES particular, the seller makes the goods accessible on board a ship at the destination port. DEQ changed the particular so the goods must be delivered to the wharf.

For DEQ to be applicable, the seller would must have an import license or in any case be legally permitted to deliver in the destination country. All legal conventions required for shipping goods to the wharf in the destination country, including all the documentation required for the buyer to take delivery of the goods, must be completed by the seller. The more [onerous](/onerouscontract) terms for a seller of such a contract would be taken on in light of the fact that it would be an incentive for the buyer to contract with that company.
