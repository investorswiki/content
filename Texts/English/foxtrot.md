## What Is a Fox-Trot Economy?

A "fox-trot economy" alludes to a pattern of [economic growth](/economicgrowth) where periods of fast expansion are trailed by periods of slow growth. Economic growth happens when an economy's ability to deliver more goods and services increments starting with one period then onto the next, which can result from such things as additional workers entering the labor force or advances in technology.

## Understanding a Fox-Trot Economy

The ability to grow an economy and make economic growth can happen quickly or all the more leisurely, and it might even diminish. Various factors can influence the rate of growth in an economy, and the rate will typically change over the long haul. Despite the fact that there are no substantial rules that accurately foresee precisely the way in which an economy will develop, patterns of economic growth can in any case be portrayed, and the fox-trot economy is one such pattern.

The term "fox-trot economy" is ascribed to investment strategist Jeffrey Saut, an executive at Raymond James. He authored and advocated the expression in the mid 2000s to depict economic growth at that point.

The term depends on the famous fox-trot traditional dance. In a notable rendition of this dance, participants complete strides in a pattern of two fast advances that are trailed by two sluggish ones. An economy that goes through a period of fast growth followed by a period of slow growth, while as yet showing overall growth all through the cycle, reflects the fast-step, slow-step developments of the fox-trot, as the artists keep on moving all through the dance.

## The Impact of a Fox-Trot Economy

A fox-trot economy can be trying for investors. Albeit the expectation in a fox-trot economy is that economic growth will get back in the future, distinguishing the timing of the return to quick growth is testing.

In a fox-trot economy, greater economic vulnerability in regards to potential financial or [economic shocks](/economic-shock) can bring about volatility in the rate of macroeconomic growth, which thus can lead to bring down rates of return on numerous assets and higher risk premiums on business borrowing. Business analysts have reported clear connections, both hypothetically and observationally, from the [volatility](/volatility) of economic fundamentals to stock market volatility.

In a fox-trot economy, corporate [earnings](/earnings) may show higher volatility than is regular over a normal [business cycle](/businesscycle) with level economic growth. This can straightforwardly impact an organization's valuation. Quick growth followed by more lukewarm growth might make companies cut payroll and remain unreasonably wary about investment plans, even however the economy, as a general rule, is developing, but at a more slow pace. Investors, businesses, and consumers might shift a greater amount of their savings and investments to additional relatively stable foreign markets.

In like manner, the demand for borrowing and lending influences an economy's interest rates, and as economic growth eases back and companies borrow less, interest rates might decline, leaving savers with a lower rate of return even as they might want to save additional to protect themselves from economic volatility. The loss of return on savings and the decline in positions might impact the demand for goods and services from an economy's residents.

As a rule, corporations, investors, and market participants favor unsurprising, consistent growth, as it is simpler to oversee and plan from. On the other hand, numerous traders and investors favor volatility, as increased volatility can enhance profits in the event that an investor comprehends the [technical](/technicalanalysis) and [fundamentals](/fundamentalanalysis) behind the market developments.
