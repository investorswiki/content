The positive earnings, in any case, are a fundamental signal that recommends that the stock will resume its uptrend.

Most pullbacks include a security's price moving to an area of technical support, for example, a [moving average](/movingaverage) or [pivot point](/pivotpoint), before continuing their uptrend. [Traders](/stock-trader) ought to carefully watch these key areas of support since a breakdown from them could signal a [reversal](/reversal) as opposed to a pullback.

The stock might experience a pullback the next day as short-term traders secure in profits. In any case, the strong earnings report recommends that the business underlying the stock is ever figuring things out. Buy and hold traders and investors will probably be drawn to the stock by the strong earnings reports, supporting a supported uptrend in the close term.

Likewise, it very well may be a negative settlement, another contender delivering a product or some other event that will affect the company underlying the stock.

These events, while occurring outside of the chart, in a manner of speaking, will show up more than several meetings and initially will appear to be similar as a pullback. Therefore, traders utilize moving averages, trendlines and trading bands to flag when a pullback continues onward and is at risk of entering reversal domain.

## Limitations in Trading Pullbacks

In the event that the price action breaks the trendline for your time period, you might be taking a gander at a reversal as opposed to a pullback.

In this case, it isn't an ideal opportunity to enter a bullish position. Of course, adding other technical indicators and fundamental data sweeps to the mix will increase a trader's confidence in distinguishing pullbacks from true reversals.
