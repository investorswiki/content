Probably the most common instances of securities incorporate stocks, bonds, options, mutual funds, and ETF shares. Securities have certain tax suggestions in the United States and are under tight government regulation.
### Characteristics of Financial Securities
- Securities are fungible. As such, they are assets that can be exchanged rapidly and effectively for others of a similar type. Just like any one nickel can be supplanted by some other, any share of a company's stock can be supplanted by some other share of a similar company's stock. While the two nickels and a company's shares can change in value over the long haul, at any one moment in time, all nickels are worth a similar amount, and all shares of a specific company's stock are worth a similar amount.

## The 4 Types of Securities
Financial securities are separated into one of four general classes — debt securities, equity securities, hybrid securities (which have characteristics of both debt and equity securities), and derivative securities.
### 1. Debt Securities
Debt securities — like [corporate bonds](/corporatebond), [government bonds](/treasurybond), and certificates of store — are basically loans. They act like IOUs from a government or corporation to the debt security holder.
Owners of debt securities loan a certain amount of money (the principal) to another party. That party is then committed to pay pre-determined interest payments to the owner at customary stretches per the terms indicated in their agreement until the instrument develops, when the debtor must pay back the security owner in the amount of the principal.
The purpose of a debt security (like a [bond](/bond)) is twofold. On one hand, it permits a corporation, government, or other entity (the borrower) the transitory utilization of the security owner's capital. Then again, it permits the security owner to receive standard interest payments for a while in exchange for the transitory utilization of their money before having it returned to them in full at a certain settled upon date.
### 2. Equity Securities
Equity securities show partial ownership of an entity — frequently a business. The most common illustration of an equity security is a share of a company's stock. Shares of [mutual funds](/mutualfund) are additionally viewed as equity securities, as are shares of certain [ETFs](/indexfund) (those that do exclude debt securities like bonds).
While people purchase debt securities to receive periodic payments in exchange for the impermanent utilization of their money, people for the most part purchase equity securities as investments to realize capital gains over the long haul. An equity security is an asset, so assuming its value builds, the party that holds it can sell it for a profit.
While most equity securities normally don't qualifies their holders for periodic payments, some do, and these payments are called [dividends.](/profit) Companies that pay dividends utilize a small percentage of their profits to pay shareholders a certain amount of money per share — as a rule once per quarter or one time each year. Since holders of equity securities are partial owners of an entity, they are likewise frequently qualified for certain voting rights with regards to a portion of that entity's business choices.
Generally, equity securities offer higher likely returns than debt securities in light of the fact that a company or entity's value is technically boundless, though a bond's interest payments and maturity date are fixed and pre-determined.
Equity securities likewise accompany greater risk, in any case. While a company or entity's potential value is boundless, that value could likewise change in a negative course, bringing about capital losses for shareholders. All in the event that a business fails, its shareholders are simply qualified for their portion of anything value stays after the business has paid its creditors and satisfied its all obligations per the terms of the bankruptcy.
### 3. Hybrid Securities
Hybrid securities act like debt securities here and there and like equity securities in alternate ways. The most common type of hybrid security is a convertible bond. These act like bonds in that they include standard payments, yet they contrast from bonds in that they can likewise be changed over into a specific number of shares of a stock at the holder's prudence. Another model is an equity warrant, which is an option issued straight by an entity to its shareholders to buy or sell a security at a specific cost prior to a specific date.
### 4. Derivative Securities
A [derivative](/derivative) is a security whose value depends on a specific asset or group of assets (like a stock or commodity). A derivative generally appears as a contract between two gatherings connecting with the purchase or sale of a specific asset or pool of assets. Derivatives are frequently utilized by people and institutions to relieve risk, however they can likewise be utilized hypothetically by investors to bring in money.
One common derivative is a futures contract, which is an agreement to buy or sell an asset at a pre-determined future date at a specific cost. If somebody somehow managed to purchase a futures contract that qualified them for purchase a bundle of roughage for $35 dollars in 90 days, yet when 90 days had passed, bunches of feed were worth $45, the buyer would realize a $10 gain. Forward contracts act in much the same way, however they are more adaptable and normally carry more risk for both buyer and seller.
Options contracts are additionally common. These act like futures, yet rather than the buyer being committed to purchase or sell a specific security at a specific price at a specific point in time, they basically have the option to do as such.
Another common derivative is a [swap](/swaps), which is an agreement between two gatherings to exchange one cash flow for another. One cash flow is normally fixed (like a fixed interest rate), and the other is generally variable (like a variable interest rate). Once in a while, companies swap loan interest rates in various currencies to exploit exchange rates.
