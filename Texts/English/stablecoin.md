# Stablecoin
A stablecoin is a type of [cryptocurrency](/cryptocurrency) that is intended to keep a stable market price. As of late, this type of digital currencies has filled in prominence, and we presently have various stablecoin projects.
Albeit the specific instruments differ starting with one coin then onto the next, stablecoins should be to some degree resistant to market volatility, so they shouldn't experience huge price changes.
Numerous stablecoins have their values fixed by pegging them to the price of another asset. While the vast majority of them are [pegged](/pegged-currency) to the US dollar, there are stablecoins pegged to the price of other cryptocurrencies, or even commodities, similar to silver or gold. By being pegged to true assets, these coins keep away from the wild price swings brought about by the high levels of [volatility](/volatility), exceptionally common in cryptocurrency markets.

### Collateralized versus non-collateralized stablecoins
Collateralized stablecoin companies are expected to really hold the assets against which their coin is pegged (e.g., US dollar or gold). So they issue new units in light of the value of their holdings. This model is the basis of most stablecoins. Conspicuous models incorporate USD Coin (USDC), Paxos (PAX), and TrueUSD (TUSD), where every token is backed on a 1:1 ratio by money held in the bank accounts. So these companies possibly issue new stablecoin units when they receive the equivalent value in fiat currency.
Some stablecoins are [pegged](/pegged-currency) to other cryptocurrencies rather than fiat or commodities, and these are frequently alluded to as crypto-collateralized stablecoins. The peg of these coins is kept up with through over-collateralization and stability systems. An unmistakable model is DAI, the stablecoin stamped in the Maker [DAO](/decentralized-independent association) ecosystem.
Non-collateralized stablecoins, then again, utilize calculations to control the supply of tokens to keep the price fixed at a foreordained level. The goal of these coins is to keep a stable value by algorithmically extending and contracting its [circulating supply](/circulating-supply) in response to market behavior.

### Why stablecoins?
The thought behind stablecoins is to give a portion of the upsides of both fiat currency and cryptocurrency universes. As of now, stablecoins are for the most part utilized as a hedge against the high volatility of cryptocurrency markets, yet contingent upon the specific situation, they can likewise be utilized as a stable currency that gives increased transparency and decentralization. Additionally, when compared to traditional fiat currencies, they present quicker transactions and lower fees - making them very helpful for regular payments and international transfers.
