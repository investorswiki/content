## Breaking Down Accretive

Overall finance, accretion alludes to the change in the price of a bond or security. In fixed-income investments, the word accretive might be utilized to depict the increase in value owing to interest accrued however not paid. For instance, discounted bonds earn interest through accretion, until they arrive at maturity. In such cases, acquired bonds are acquired [at a discount](/at-a-discount) when compared to the [current face](/current_face) value of the bond, otherwise called the par. As the bond develops, the value increases, in view of the [interest rate](/interestrate) that was in effect at the hour of issuance.

## Determining the Rate of Accretion

The rate of accretion is determined by partitioning the discount by the number of years in the term.

Contingent upon the type of bond purchased, interest might be paid out at customary spans (every year, semi-yearly, and so forth), or it could be paid in lump sum, upon maturity.

The bond pays the [original face](/original_face) value, otherwise called the [accreted value](/accreted-value), of $1,000, in a lump sum upon maturity.

In corporate finance acquisition deals are frequently accretive. In the first place, we should assume that the earnings per share of Corporation X is listed as $100, and earnings per share of Corporation Y is listed as $50. At the point when Corporation X obtains Corporation Y, Corporations X's earnings per share increase to $150- - delivering this a half accretive deal.
