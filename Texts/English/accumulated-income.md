## What Is Accumulated Income?

Accumulated income, usually alluded to as [retained earnings](/retainedearnings), incorporates the portion of net income that is retained by a corporation after some time, as opposed to being distributed as [dividends](/profit). Any accumulated income is regularly utilized by the corporation to reinvest in its principal business or to pay down its debt.

## Figuring out Accumulated Income

Accumulated income alludes to the portion of net income that is accumulated and utilized for reinvestment purposes or to pay down debt as opposed to being paid out as dividends. Accumulated income is in many cases invested in areas inside the corporation that will set out growth open doors, for example, [research and development](/randd) (R&D), new technology or machinery, and different forms of capital expenditures.

Accumulated income shows up under the [shareholder's equity](/shareholdersequity) section on the corporation's [balance sheet](/balancesheet). It is calculated by adding net income (or loss) from the [income statement](/incomestatement) to the beginning retained earnings balance. Any paid dividends, including cash and stock dividends, are deducted from that sum. In the event that a company has a net loss surpassing the initial accumulated income balance, there will be a [deficit](/deficit), affecting investing, and capital spending.

## How Accumulated Income Is Used

A business needs accumulated income to assist with funding its operations. This is particularly important for a developing business, which commonly requires a substantial amount of working capital to pay for its continuous investments in receivables and inventory, as well as [fixed asset](/fixed-asset-turnover) purchases. The amount of accumulated income will in general be most minimal in sluggish growth businesses, where the management team has no internal need for the money thus chooses to send it to investors as dividends.

According to a hypothetical point of view, accumulated income or retained earnings assumes a central part in capital structure and [capital budgeting](/capitalbudgeting) choices. At the point when the dust settles toward the year's end, a business can generally do one of two things with excess cash. It can either furrow it back into the business to improve or develop naturally or it can return capital to its actual owners, whether they are equity shareholders or creditors.

Businesses with growth possibilities greater than their cost of capital ought to, in theory, put the money back into the business to create [capital investment](/capital-investment) growth. On the off chance that the shareholders are happy with growth given a level of risk, they don't raise their cost of funds. Be that as it may, when a business is facing crumbling financial possibilities, investors disapprove of these businesses holding too much cash since it frequently gets squandered on risky endeavors and paltry pet ventures.
