# Smithsonian Agreement
## What Is the Smithsonian Agreement?

The Smithsonian Agreement was an impermanent agreement negotiated in 1971 among the ten leading developed nations in the world, to be specific Belgium, Canada, France, West Germany, Italy, Japan, the Netherlands, Sweden, the United Kingdom, and the United States. The deal made adjustments to the system of fixed exchange rates laid out under the [Bretton Woods Agreement](/brettonwoodsagreement) and successfully made another standard for the dollar, as the other industrialized nations pegged their currencies to the U.S. dollar.

## The Smithsonian Agreement Explained

The Bretton Woods Agreement was a confounded system in light of gold that started to disentangle during the 1960s, as the global stock of gold became lacking to fulfill the global need for international reserves. The Smithsonian Agreement brought about a partial cheapening of the U.S. dollar, yet it was sufficiently not to address the underlying issues of the Bretton Woods Agreement, and it endured just 15 months before the more extensive system imploded.

The Smithsonian Agreement became important when then-U.S. President Richard Nixon stopped permitting foreign central banks to exchange U.S. dollars for gold in Aug. 1971. A sharp leap in the U.S. inflation rate in the late 1960s had made the existing system unsteady and was driving a shift to foreign currencies and gold to the detriment of the U.S. dollar. The move by President Nixon set off a crisis, which prompted an appeal from the [International Monetary Fund](/imf) for negotiations among the [Group of Ten](/groupoften) (G-10). This negotiation, thusly, prompted the Smithsonian Agreement in Dec. 1971.

The agreement devalued the U.S. dollar by 8.5% relative to gold, raising the price of an ounce of gold from $35 to $38. The other G-10 countries agreed to revalue their currencies against the U.S. dollar too. President Nixon adulated the agreement as "the main monetary agreement in world history."

Notwithstanding, the [par value system](/parvalue) kept on decaying. Examiners pushed numerous foreign currencies facing their now-higher valuation limits, and the value of gold was driven higher too. At the point when the U.S. unilaterally chose to devalue its dollar by 10% in February 1973, raising the price of gold to $42 per ounce, it was too much for the system. By 1973, most major currencies had shifted from a fixed to a [floating exchange rate](/floatingexchangerate) relative to the U.S. dollar.

## End of the Gold Standard

The decision by President Nixon to "[close the gold window](/nixon-shock)" was the finish of the U.S. commitment to set a fixed price for gold. The U.S. dollar was currently a [fiat currency](/fiatmoney). The decisions finished the shift away from the [gold standard](/goldstandard), which started in the mid 1930s when Congress sanctioned a joint resolution that banned creditors from demanding repayment in gold. Then, at that point President Franklin D. Roosevelt requested people to return high-category gold and gold certificates to the Federal Reserve at a fixed cost.

- The Smithsonian Agreement just endured 15 months, as examiners drove the dollar lower and countries abandoned the peg for floating exchange rates.
- The Smithsonian Agreement was carried out in Dec. 1971 and made ready for another dollar standard, as other industrialized countries pegged their currencies to the U.S. dollar.
- The agreement became vital when U.S. President Richard Nixon stopped permitting foreign central banks to exchange U.S. dollars for gold.
