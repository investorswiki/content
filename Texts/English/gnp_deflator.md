# Gross National Product (GNP) Deflator
## What Is the Gross National Product (GNP) Deflator?

The gross national product deflator is an economic metric that accounts for the effects of inflation in the current year's [gross national product](/gnp) (GNP) by switching its output over completely to a level relative to a [base period](/baseperiod).

The GNP deflator can be mistaken for the more regularly utilized [gross domestic product (GDP) deflator](/gdppricedeflator). The GDP deflator involves a similar equation as the GNP deflator, yet with nominal and real GDP as opposed to GNP.

## Figuring out the Gross National Product (GNP) Deflator

The GNP deflator is basically the adjustment for [inflation](/inflation) that is made to nominal GNP to deliver real GNP. The GNP deflator gives an alternative to the [Consumer Price Index](/consumerpriceindex) (CPI) and can be utilized related to it to examine a few changes in trade flows and the effects on the welfare of individuals inside a relatively open market country.

The CPI is based upon a [basket of goods](/basket_of_goods) and services, while the GNP deflator incorporates each of the last goods delivered by an economy. This permits the GNP deflator to all the more accurately capture the effects of inflation since it's not limited to a more modest subset of goods.

## Working out the Gross National Product (GNP) Deflator

The GNP deflator is calculated with the accompanying formula:

The outcome is communicated as a percentage, as a rule with three decimal spots.

The initial step to computing the GNP deflator is to decide the base period for analysis. In theory, you can work with GDP and foreign earnings data for the base period and current periods, and afterward separate the figures required for the deflator calculation. Be that as it may, nominal GNP and real GNP figures, as well as the deflator outlined after some time, can typically be gotten to through releases from [central banks](/centralbank) or other economic elements.

In the United States, the[ Bureau of Economic Analysis](/bea) (BEA), the St. Louis Federal Reserve Bank, and others give this data, as well as different indicators that track comparative economic statistics that measure basically exactly the same thing yet through various formulations. So really ascertaining the GNP deflator is typically superfluous. The more important task is the way to decipher the data that the GNP deflator is applied to.

## Deciphering GNP Figures

The GNP deflator, as referenced, is just the inflation adjustment. The higher the GNP deflator, the higher the rate of inflation for the period. The significant inquiry having an inflation-adjusted gross national product — the real GNP — really tells you.

The real GNP is essentially the genuine national income of the country being measured. It doesn't care where the production is situated in the world as long as the earnings return home.

In terms of differences between real GNP and real GDP, [real GDP](/realgdp) is the preferred measure of U.S. economic wellbeing. Real GNP shows how the U.S. is doing in terms of its foreign investments notwithstanding domestic production.

## Features
- The gross national product (GNP) deflator is an economic metric that accounts for the effects of inflation in the current year's GNP.
