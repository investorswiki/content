# Hyperledger Composer
## What Is Hyperledger Composer?

Hyperledger Composer is a set of [open source tools](/open-source) that allows business owners, operators, and designers a way to create [blockchain](/blockchain) applications and [smart contracts](/smart-contracts) aimed at tackling business issues and/or working on operational efficiencies. It is an example of a commercial application of [blockchain-as-a-service](/blockchainasaservice-baas) (BaaS). Hyperledger Composer is one of the several [Hyperledger](/hyperledger) projects facilitated by The Linux Foundation in collaboration with corporate individuals.

As of August 2019, the Hyperledger Composer project is in deprecated status, meaning that while it is still being used, the maintainers are not generally actively growing new features or offer help. Composer has been combined into [Hyperledger Fabric](/hyperledger-fabric) v1.4+.

## Understanding Hyperledger Composer

Hyperledger Composer is implicit Javascript, a platform-free programming language that also supports the utilization of underlying libraries and utilizations available capabilities and contents to make the utilities more scalable and reusable. Composer is an application development framework which streamlines and speeds up the creation of Hyperledger fabric blockchain applications.

Utilizing Hyperledger Composer, a business person with no technical information can easily collaborate with a designer to build specific features. They incorporate characterizing the business rules based on which blockchain transactions will be handled, characterizing the assets that are exchanged in blockchain-based use cases, and characterize controls for participants, their personalities, jobs and access levels for playing out the various sorts of transactions.

Similarly, a designer utilizing Hyperledger Composer can easily build and design core parts of the blockchain which incorporate the network's digital assets, transaction logic, participants and access controls. Composer supports sharing, reusability and scalability of parts across various organizations. One can easily generate the required contents and APIs necessary for business implementation utilizing Hyperledger Composer. It also supports use cases and real-time testing, which can even be performed through the electronic Composer playground without the requirement for local installations.

Utilizing Hyperledger Composer, it is workable for an individual to create and run a sample blockchain, and grant restricted consent to various participants. For instance, one can easily build a "Perishable Goods Network" that facilitates trading of things like products of the soil, incorporate participants like farmers, transporters and merchants, characterize individual jobs for each participant, characterize and execute terms of agreement between the participants, track shipments, acknowledge, monitor and report status of goods at various stage in the supply chain, and payments management.

## Special Considerations

Hyperledger Composer offers a ton of advantages which remember the faster creation of blockchain applications for easy advances, smooth and low-cost modeling and testing allowing the client to build, test and send various options and then execute the one that offers the best fit, and reusability of existing apps and APIs that reduce both exertion and costs.

Business Network Archive is central to Hyperledger Composer's architecture, and it maintains the core data and functionality of the business network that incorporates the business model, transaction logic and access controls. Composer Playground is the electronic interface that enables modeling the business requirements and capabilities, functional testing, as well as organization testing on a live blockchain. A LoopBack connector that supports various APIs and integration capabilities allows a variety of client applications as well as non-blockchain applications an easy medium to interface with the Hyperledger Composer.

## Features
- Composer was meant to facilitate creation of open-source blockchain application that cultivated collaboration between inside organizations and business networks.
- Hyperledger composer is a business-situated set of instruments for creating enterprise blockchain applications, under the umbrella of the Hyperledger project.
- Work on composer was halted in summer 2019, and is currently part of the more extensive Hyperledger Fabric platform.
