## What Is a Price Maker?

A price maker is a company that can direct the price it charges for its goods since there are no perfect [substitutes](/substitute). These are generally [monopolies](/monopoly) or companies that produce goods or services that contrast from what contenders offer.

The price maker is a profit maximizer on the grounds that it will increase output exclusively for however long its [marginal revenue](/marginal-revenue-mr) is greater than its [marginal cost](/marginalcostofproduction) â€” at the end of the day, for however long it is delivering a profit.

## Figuring out the Price Maker

In a free enterprise system, prices are enormously determined by supply and demand. Buyers and sellers apply influence over prices, bringing about a state of [equilibrium](/equilibrium). In any case, in a monopolistic environment, one company has absolute control over the supply delivered into the market, permitting that business to direct prices.

Without competition, the seller might keep prices falsely high without concern for price competition from another provider. This scenario commonly puts consumers in a difficult situation since they have no real way to look for less expensive alternatives.

## Types of Price Makers

In a multiplant monopoly, firms with numerous production plants and different marginal cost capabilities pick the individual output level for each plant.

In a [bilateral monopoly](/bilateralmonopoly), there is a single buyer, or [monopsony](/monopsony), and a single seller. The outcome of a bilateral monopoly relies upon which party has greater negotiation power: One party might have all the power, both may track down an intermediate solution, or they might perform vertical integration.

In a multiproduct monopoly, as opposed to selling one product, the monopoly sells several. The company must consider how changes in the price of one of its products influence its other products.

In a [discriminating monopoly](/discriminating-monopoly), firms might need to charge various prices to various consumers, contingent upon their readiness to pay. The level of discrimination has different degrees. At the principal level, perfect discrimination, the monopolist sets the highest price that every consumer will pay. At the subsequent level, nonlinear price fixing, the price relies upon the amount bought by the consumer. At the third level, market segmentation, there are several separated consumer bunches where the firm applies various prices, for example, student discounts.

In a [natural monopoly](/natural_monopoly), as a result of cost-mechanical factors, it is more efficient to have one firm responsible for all the production on the grounds that long-term costs are lower. This is known as subadditivity.

## Regulatory Bodies and Antitrust Laws

Government agencies, for example, the [Federal Trade Commission (FTC)](/ftc) and the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) implement federal [antitrust laws](/antitrust) and advance free trade.

Any proposed corporate [merger](/merger) must initially meet the regulatory bodies' endorsement. Proposed mergers that might actually smother competition and make an unfair marketplace are commonly dismissed. The [Herfindahl-Hirschman Index](/hhi), a calculation measuring the degree of concentration in a given market, is one device that regulators use while settling on conclusions about an expected merger.
