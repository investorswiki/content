# One Percent Rule
## What Is the One Percent Rule?

The one percent rule, some of the time adapted as the "1% rule," is utilized to determine assuming the month to month rent earned from a piece of [investment property](/investment-property) will surpass that property's month to month [mortgage payment](/mortgage). The goal of the rule is to guarantee that the rent will be greater than or — to say the least — equivalent to the mortgage payment, so the investor essentially breaks even on the property.

The one percent rule can give a baseline to laying out the level of rent that commercial property owners charge on real estate space. This rent level can apply to a wide range of tenants in both residential and commercial real estate properties.

Purchasing a piece of property for investment requires an intensive analysis of various factors. The one percent rule is just one measurement device that can assist an investor with checking the risk and potential gain that may be accomplished by investing in a property.

## How the One Percent Rule Works

This simple calculation increases the purchase price of the property plus any vital repairs by 1%. The outcome is a base level of month to month rent. It's likewise contrasted with the potential month to month mortgage payment to give the owner a better comprehension of the property's month to month cash flow.

> This rule is just utilized for quick assessment since it doesn't consider different costs associated with a piece of property, like upkeep, insurance, and taxes.

## Illustration of the One Percent Rule

An investor is hoping to get a [mortgage loan](/mortgage) on a rental property with a total payoff value of $200,000. Utilizing the one percent rule, the owner would work out a $2,000 month to month rent payment: $200,000 increased by 1%. In this case, the investor would look for a mortgage loan with regularly scheduled payments of not exactly and positively something like $2,000.

## The One Percent Rule versus Different Types of Calculations

The one percent rule likewise helps give an investor a base point from which to consider different factors with respect to the ownership of a property. A second important calculation is the **gross rent multiplier**, which utilizes the month to month rent level to determine the amount of time it will take to pay off the investment. This calculation is accomplished by partitioning the total borrowed value by the month to month rent.

In the case of the home with a value of $200,000, the investor would isolate $200,000 by $2,000. This gives the investor a 100-month payoff period, which means a little over 8.3 years. Investors can likewise utilize the [gross rent multiplier](/gross-pay multiplier) while considering the payment schedule terms of a loan taken for the property.

The **70% rule** suggests that an investor shouldn't pay over 70% of the property's estimated value after repairs less costs.

## Special Considerations

In working out the gross rent multiplier, a buyer must likewise consider the rental rates in the area where the property is found. In the event that the standard rate for rent in the area is under $2,000 for the buyer in this model, the investor could need to consider decreasing the rent to guarantee that they view as a tenant.

One more important factor to consider is [maintenance on the property](/maintenance-costs). The property owner is responsible for upkeep and repairs. While a deposit could cover substantial damages, the owner genuinely should budget a predetermined amount of the rent for savings toward maintenance. This can add to profits assuming it's unused, and the money would be accessible when any maintenance needs emerge.

Overall, investing in real estate can be lucrative for long-term investors. The base rent that an owner charges on a property sets the level of payments expected by tenants. Owners normally raise rent yearly to oversee inflation and different costs associated with the property, yet the base rate is an important level that determines the overall return on an investment.
