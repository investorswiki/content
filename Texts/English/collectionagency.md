# Collection Agency
## What Is a Collection Agency?

A collection agency is a company utilized by [lenders](/lender) or [creditors](/creditor) to recover funds that are past due, or from accounts that are in default. Frequently, a creditor will hire a collection agency after it has made various failed endeavors to collect its receivables. A lender might re-appropriate the debt-collection activity to an outsider (the collection agency), or it might have an internal department or a debt-collection subsidiary that would handle the job.

## How a Collection Agency Works

When a [borrower](/distressedborrower) defaults on their debts or neglects to make scheduled loan payments, the creditor will report this delinquency to a [credit bureau](/creditbureau). Then, at that point, not exclusively will the borrower's credit history be discolored, yet in addition their debt will be gone over to a collection agency within three-to-six months of default.

### At the point when a Borrower Pays

Assuming the borrower pays their [debt](/debt) because of the collection agency's efforts, then, at that point, the creditor pays the collection agency a percentage of the funds, or assets, that it recovers. Depending on the original agreement went into with the creditor, the debtor might need to pay the full debt at the same time or a portion of it at a time.

### At the point when a Borrower Does Not Pay

On the off chance that the borrower actually will not, or can't cover their [arrearage](/arrearage), the collection agency can refresh the borrower's credit report with a "collection" status, which prompts a drop in the individual's [credit score](/credit_score). A low credit score can influence an individual's possibilities obtaining a loan in the long term, as an account under debt collection can remain on their credit report for quite some time.

Collection agencies convey various strategies to try to recover funds, like the following:

- Calling the debtor's personal and office phones
- Mailing various late-payment notification to the debtor
- Contacting a debtor's family, friends, and neighbors to affirm the debtor's contact information
- Appearing at the individual's front entryway

## Debt Collection Agency Regulations

Outsider collection agencies — however not creditors' in-house collection departments — are limited by the [Fair Debt Collection Practices Act](/fair-debt-collection-practices-act-fdcpa) (FDCPA), of which a few rules are refered to below.

A debt collector may not do the following:

- Continue to collect an old debt that has been charged off as "uncollectible" — the debtor has either sought financial protection or can't be found
- Sue or take steps to sue a borrower in light of their debt
- Legally hold onto assets from a debtor — except if the collection agency has won a claim against a debtor
- Physically hurt or take steps to hurt a debtor in an endeavor to extract a payment
- Contact an individual at work assuming they have expressly stated that their employer doesn't endorse such calls

A debt collector may, in any case, do the following:

- Endeavor to collect a debt on which the statute of constraints — ordinarily somewhere in the range of four and six years from the primary day of default — has run out
- Call an individual between 8 a.m. also, 9 p.m. as it were
- Contact the debtor's employer about overdue child support and alimony, federal [student loans](/student-debt), or duties
