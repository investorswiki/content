# Franked Investment Income
## What Is Franked Investment Income?

Franked investment income (FII) is income that is received as a tax-free distribution by one company from another. This income is commonly tax-free to the getting firm and is typically distributed as a dividend. Franked investment income was presented in the interest of keeping away from double taxation of corporate income.

According to the point of view of the company that makes the distribution, the FII is alluded to as franked payment, and the term is most generally utilized in Australia and New Zealand.

## Figuring out Franked Investment Income

[Double taxation](/double_taxation) of dividends happens when both a company and a shareholder pay tax on a similar income. The company pays taxes on profits and in this way disseminates a [dividend](/dividend) out of its after-tax profits. Shareholders must then pay tax on the dividend received. Taxpayers in countries (for the most part Oceanic or European countries) with franked investment income will normally claim the fitting credit while filing their taxes through [dividend imputation](/dividendimputations).

Franked investment income will be income distributed as dividends to a company from earnings on which corporation tax has previously been paid by the distributing company. In the event that ABC company pays franked investment income to XYZ company, XYZ company doesn't need to pay tax on the income. This is on the grounds that the tax was assessed on ABC company before the income was paid. Basically, the tax paid on this income is additionally ascribed to the getting firm. When the responsible company has paid [corporate tax](/corporatetax) on the income being distributed, the tax payment is credited additionally to the companies who receive the [franked dividend](/frankeddividend).

Using tax credits called "imputed tax credits," the tax specialists are told that a company has previously paid the required income tax on the income it circulates as dividends. The shareholder or getting entity then, at that point, doesn't need to pay tax or pays a decreased tax on the franked dividend income. In New Zealand, for instance, full imputation means giving 28 pennies of imputation credits for each 72 pennies of franked investment income that is received by the shareholder. At this ratio, all resident shareholders who pay income tax at the rate of 28% or less won't need to pay any further income tax.

Then again, shareholders who pay the highest tax rate of 33% will be required to pay a further 5 pennies for each $1.00 of gross income, leaving them with a net 67 pennies of cash.

The dividend beneficiary grosses up the dividends by adding the imputed tax credits on the FII to the amount of dividend received. The investment tax is applied to this sum to determine the gross tax liability. At long last, the imputed credit is deducted from the [tax liability](/taxliability) to determine the genuine tax payable.

## Types of Franked Dividends

There are two distinct types of [franked dividends](/frankeddividend): fully franked and partially franked. At the point when a stock's shares are fully franked, the company pays tax on the whole dividend. Investors receive 100% of the tax paid on the dividend as franking credits. Conversely, shares that are not fully franked may bring about tax payments for investors.

Businesses now and then claim tax deductions, maybe due to losses from going before years. That permits them to try not to pay the whole tax rate on their profits in a given year. At the point when this occurs, the business doesn't pay sufficient tax to legally join a full tax credit to the dividends paid to shareholders. Subsequently, a tax credit is connected to part of the dividend, making that portion franked. The remainder of the dividend stays untaxed, or unfranked. This dividend is then supposed to be partially franked. The investor is responsible for paying the leftover tax balance.
