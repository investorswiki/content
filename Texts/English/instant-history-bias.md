## What Is Instant History Bias?

Instant history bias, otherwise called "refill bias," is a phenomenon by which conflicting reporting practices can unduly blow up the apparent performance of a [hedge fund](/hedgefund).

To assist with combatting this unreasonable incentive, hedge fund databases have started to limit the degree to which hedge fund managers can refill their outcomes â€” and some have precluded inlaying through and through.
