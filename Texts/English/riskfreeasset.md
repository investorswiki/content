# Risk-Free Asset
## What Is a Risk-Free Asset?

A risk-free [asset](/asset) is one that has a certain future return — and virtually no possibility of loss. Debt obligations issued by the U.S. Department of the Treasury (bonds, notes, and particularly [Treasury bills)](/treasurybill) are viewed as risk-free on the grounds that the "full faith and credit" of the U.S. government backs them. Since they are so safe, the return on risk-free assets is extremely close to the current [interest rate](/interestrate).

Numerous scholastics say that, with regards to investing, nothing can be 100% guaranteed — as there's no such thing as a risk-free asset. Technically, this might be correct: All [financial assets](/financialasset) carry some degree of risk — the risk they will drop in value or become worthless altogether. Nonetheless, the level of risk is little to such an extent that, for the average investor, it is appropriate to think about [U.S. Treasurys ](/treasurybond)or any government debt issued by a from stable Western nation to be risk-free.

## Understanding a Risk-Free Asset

At the point when an investor takes on an investment, there is an anticipated return rate expected relying upon the duration the asset is held. The risk is demonstrated by the fact that the [actual return](/actualreturn) and the anticipated return might be altogether different. Since market fluctuations can be difficult to predict, the obscure aspect of the future return is viewed as the risk. Generally, an increased level of risk indicates a higher chance of large fluctuations, which can translate to significant gains or losses relying upon the ultimate outcome.

Risk-free investments are viewed as sensibly certain to gain at the level predicted. Since this gain is essentially known, the [rate of return](/rateofreturn) is often much lower to reflect the lower amount of risk. The [expected return](/expectedreturn) and actual return are probably going to be about something similar.

While the return on a risk-free asset is known, this doesn't guarantee a profit concerning [purchasing power](/purchasingpower). Contingent upon the length of time until maturity, [inflation](/inflation) can make the asset lose purchasing power even on the off chance that the dollar value has ascended as predicted.

## Risk-Free Assets and Returns

[Risk-free return i](/risk-freereturn)s the theoretical return attributed to an investment that gives a guaranteed return zero risk. The risk-free rate represents the interest on an investor's money that would be expected from a risk-free asset when invested over a predefined period of time. For instance, investors ordinarily utilize the interest rate on a three-month U.S. T-bill as a proxy for the short-term risk-free rate.

The risk-free return is the rate against which other returns are measured. Investors that purchase a security with some measure of risk higher than that of a risk-free asset (like a U.S. Treasury bill) will naturally demand a higher level of return, in view of the greater chance they're taking. The difference between the return earned and the risk-free return represents the [risk premium](/riskpremium) on the security. In other words, the return on a risk-free asset is added to a risk premium to measure the total expected return on an investment.

## Reinvestment Risk

While they're not risky in that frame of mind of being probably going to [default](/defaultrisk), even risk-free assets can have an Achilles' heel. Also, that's known as [reinvestment risk](/reinvestmentrisk).

For a long-term investment to continue to be risk-free, any reinvestment essential must likewise be risk-free. Also, often, the exact rate of return may not be predictable from the start for the entire duration of the investment.

For instance, say a person invests in six-month Treasury bills twice every year, supplanting one batch as it matures with another one. The risk of achieving each predetermined returned rate for the six months covering a particular Treasury bill's growth is essentially nothing. Notwithstanding, interest rates might change between each instance of reinvestment. So the rate of return on the subsequent Treasury bill that was purchased as part of the six-month reinvestment interaction may not be equivalent to the rate on the first Treasury bill purchased; the third bill may not rise to the second's, etc. In such manner, there is some risk over the long term. Every individual T-bill's return is guaranteed, but the rate of return north of a decade (or however long the investor seeks after this strategy) isn't.

## Highlights
- A risk-free [asset](/asset) is one that has a certain future return — and virtually no possibility they will drop in value or become worthless altogether.
- Over the long-term, risk-free assets may likewise be subject to reinvestment risk.
- Risk-free assets are guaranteed against nominal loss, but not against a loss in purchasing power.
- Risk-free assets tend to have low rates of return, since their safety means investors don't should be compensated for taking a chance.
