# End Loan
## What Is an End Loan?

An end loan is a specific type of long-term loan an individual obtains to pay off a short-term [construction loan](/construction-loan) or other interim financing structure. Such short-term loans are involved by builders as start-up financing to send off the construction of homes or other real estate properties.

## How an End Loan Works

Despite the fact that end loans might have interest-only features that postpone the repayment of principal, sooner or later, they start to amortize. This varies from construction loans or different forms of interim financing, which are commonly interest-only vehicles that require full repayment of principal and accrued interest, endless supply of funds from the end [loan](/loan).

An end loan may be part of a combination of construction or end loan, which allows a borrower to deal with just one lender. This can improve on desk work on the grounds that a borrower need only file a single credit application.

Besides, the borrower generally must pay only one set of loan settlement costs. In any case, there are likewise hindrances to dealing with a single lender. The greatest downside to this form of one-stop shopping is that borrowers can't chase after the best deal after the interim construction financing runs its course. Albeit this package deal might feature ideal terms for one of the loans, it rarely presents low rates for both.

## How Borrowers Use End Loans

End loans assist construction with loaning borrowers pay off their whole original balance, upon the completion of a project. This is a welcome relief on the grounds that the construction loan frequently conveys high [interest rates](/interestrate).

Construction loans likewise will generally carry their own sets of prickly limitations. For instance, they might require the borrower to pay off the whole balance before a given project's completion date, or they might commit the borrower to assign a certain percentage of their payments towards interest.

Construction loans are frequently taken out by builders or home purchasers focusing on custom-build their own homes. When construction wraps up, the borrower may then refinance the loan. Borrowers are ordinarily drawn to this financing model on the grounds that the refinanced loan frees them from the constantly high interest rates associated with construction loans. By utilizing an end loan to pay off the construction loan, the borrower sets aside cash, in view of the difference in interest rates.
