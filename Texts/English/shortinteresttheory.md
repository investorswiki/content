# Short Interest Theory
## What Is Short Interest Theory?

Short interest theory states that high levels of short interest are a [bullish indicator](/bull). Along these lines, devotees of this theory will look to buy vigorously shorted stocks and profit from their anticipated rise in price.

This approach conflicts with the predominant perspective on most investors, who see [short selling](/shortsale) as an indication that the shorted stock is probably going to decline. Thusly, short interest theory can be seen as a contrarian approach to investing.

## Seeing Short Interest Theory

Short interest theory depends on the mechanics of short selling. At the point when investors short a stock, they really borrow that stock from a [broker](/broker) and afterward immediately sell it for cash. Eventually, when the broker requests to be reimbursed, the investor must do as such by buying the shares in the open market and returning those shares to the broker.

Short sellers bring in money on the off chance that the price of the shares they shorted declines after they sold their shares. In that scenario, the short seller can buy back the shares at a lower price and return them to the broker, stashing the difference as profit.

In any case, what occurs assuming that shares rise in price after the initial sale? Assuming that occurs, the investor needs to buy them back at a higher price, bringing about a loss. On the off chance that a large number of shares of a stock have been shorted and investors see that its price is continuously rising, they could panic and try to buy the stock to limit their risk that its price will rise even higher. This situation of panicked buying is known as a [short squeeze](/shortsqueeze).

Short interest theory looks to profit from these short sellers' quandary. Supporters of the short interest theory accept that vigorously shorted stocks are bound to rise since short sellers may be forced to buy stock in high volumes during a short squeeze. This type of buying is known as [short covering](/shortcovering).

Short interest theory investors could basically accept that the short sellers are off-base in their expectation that the stock's price will decline. On the other hand, they could endeavor to make a short squeeze by buying and holding shares that have been shorted to drive their price up. This broadly happened in mid 2021 with a small bunch of vigorously shorted stocks, which were known as image stocks and became famous buys among a few social media users. In one or the other event, short interest theory investors hope to benefit from the disappointment of short sellers' expectations with respect to the stock price to work out as expected.

One approach that utilizations short interest to recognize stocks with potential for share appreciation is the [short interest ratio](/shortinterestratio) (SIR). The short interest ratio is the ratio of shares sold short to [average daily trading volume (ADTV)](/averagedailytradingvolume). For instance, assuming that XYZ has 1,000,000 shares sold short and an ADTV of 500,000, then its SIR is two. This means that it would hypothetically take no less than two full trading days for the short sellers in XYZ to cover their short positions.

Investors can utilize the SIR to rapidly tell how intensely shorted a company is. For adherents of the short interest theory, SIR can be utilized to figure out which companies offer the most potential price appreciation. A high SIR demonstrates a stock that is vigorously shorted relative to it trading volume, which proposes that at any rate a portion of the shorts might wind up in a position where they need to cover their positions.

## Speculative Example of Short Interest Theory

On the off chance that Stock A has 50 million shares outstanding and 2.5 million of its shares have been sold short, then, at that point, its short interest is 5%. In the event that Stock B has 40 million shares outstanding, of which 10 million have been sold short, then its short interest is 25%.

As per the short-interest theory, Stock B has a higher likelihood of expanding in price than Stock A, it are generally indistinguishable from expect the stocks. This is on the grounds that Stock B is bound to be a target of short covering brought about by a short squeeze.

## Highlights
- Short interest theory is the view that vigorously shorted stocks are bound to rise from now on.
- The foundation of short interest theory is the way that short sellers are once in a while forced to forcefully buy shares to cover their positions.
- It is a contrarian approach in light of the fact that most investors view short interest as a bearish indicator.
