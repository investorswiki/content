# Cloud
In computer science, the term cloud alludes to a shared pool of resources, which are made accessible to different users through the Internet. Such resources are typically connected with data storage and computing power, yet may likewise incorporate various types of services, applications, organizations, and servers.
Typically, cloud-based resources are effectively and helpfully accessible and can be reconfigured dynamically to fit numerous reasons, with fluctuating levels of scalability. Today, cloud computing technology is widely spread across several areas of human life. Several services and applications are worked over a cloud.
For example, on-request web-based features like Netflix are utilizing cloud computing capacities to scale productively and give the best client experience conceivable. Famous online informing and voice call applications, like Skype and WhatsApp, are additionally utilizing cloud computing to permit great communication between their users. Different models incorporate the cloud-based arrangements given by Microsoft Office 365 and Google G Suite, which are helping a huge number of individuals worldwide, making it simple to work and team up in real-time from anyplace and whenever.
Peter Mell and Timothy Grance of the US National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) portray cloud computing as a technology made out of three service models, and four sending models.
The three cloud computing service models include:
- Infrastructure as a service (IaaS): offers fundamental computing resources like data processing, data storage, and networking capacities. These can be founded on cloud computing services like Amazon EC2, Microsoft Azure, and Google Compute Engine.
- Platform as a service (PaaS): gives platforms permitting customers to create and send acquired or purchaser made applications to a cloud computing platform. AWS Elastic Beanstalk, Heroku, and Google App Engine are a few instances of PaaS models.
- Software as a service (SaaS): joins infrastructure and software running in the cloud. The users gain admittance to a provider's software applications and databases, while the cloud provider completely deals with the underlying infrastructure and platforms that run the applications. Salesforce, Microsoft Office 365, and Slack are instances of SaaS models.

The four cloud computing organization models include:
- Public cloud: a cloud that might be owned and worked by businesses, legislative institutions, or other third-party cloud service providers. Public clouds are intended for open use by the public.
- Private cloud: a cloud that virtualizes and circulates the IT infrastructure for exclusive use by a single organization and its consumers or business units (i.e., not open to the overall population).
- Community cloud: a cloud that virtualizes and disseminates the IT infrastructure for a specific group or community of consumers, which have the viable objectives and concerns (e.g., security requirements, policy, compliance contemplations, and so on.).
- Hybrid cloud: a combination of at least two different cloud infrastructures (public, community, or private).
