# Efficient Market Hypothesis (EMH)
The efficient market hypothesis (EMH) is an economic theory specifying that the financial markets mirror all suitable information on the price of assets at some random time. Initially developed by economist Eugene Fama during the '60s, the theory states that it is almost unimaginable for investors to gain an edge over the market over the long haul. Assets will be valued at their fair price, as undeniably realized information will be traded on until it fails to be helpful.
While talking about efficient markets, scholars recognize three levels of accessible information: **weak**, **semi-strong** and **strong**.
**Weak** suggests that current prices consider every single historical datum, and, subsequently, that technical analysis is irrelevant. Nonetheless, it omits different sorts of information, and doesn't dismiss the idea that methods like [fundamental analysis](/fundamentalanalysis) or broad research can be utilized to gain an edge.
The **semi-strong** form directs that all public information has proactively been figured into the price (news, statements by companies, and so on.). Accordingly, advocates of this branch accept that even fundamental analysis can't yield any advantage. The best way to gain an advantage over the market is to take advantage of private information, which isn't yet known to the public.
Ultimately, the **strong** form holds that all public and private information is reflected in an asset's price - on top of historical performance and public information, any data accessible to insiders, too, will be exploited. This form holds that there is no possible way for any market participant to gain an edge with an information, as the market will as of now have considered it.
EMH is a long-laid out theory, however it isn't without its faultfinders. Empirical data has not appropriately proven or disproven the legitimacy of the hypothesis, however a huge number trust there to be a plenty of emotional factors at play that cause the undervaluation or overvaluation of stocks.

## Highlights

- The efficient market hypothesis (EMH) or theory states that share prices mirror all information.
- Defenders of EMH place that investors benefit from investing in a low-cost, passive portfolio.
- The EMH estimates that stocks trade at their fair market value on exchanges.
