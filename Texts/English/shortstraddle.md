# Short Straddle
## What Is a Short Straddle?

A short straddle is an options strategy contained selling both a [call option](/calloption) and a [put option](/putoption) with a similar strike price and [expiration date](/expiration-date). It is utilized when the trader accepts the underlying asset won't move essentially higher or lower over the existences of the options contracts. The maximum profit is the amount of [premium](/premium) collected by composing the options. The potential loss can be unlimited, so it is typically a strategy for further developed traders.

## Seeing Short Straddles

Short straddles allow traders to profit from the lack of movement in the [underlying asset](/underlying-asset), as opposed to putting down directional wagers expecting a big move either higher or lower. Premiums are collected when the trade is opened with the goal to let both the put and call lapse worthless. Notwithstanding, chances that the underlying asset closes precisely at the strike price at the expiration are low, and that leaves the short straddle owner at risk for [assignment](/assignment). Be that as it may, as long as the difference between asset price and strike price is not exactly the premiums collected, the trader will in any case create a gain.

Advanced traders could run this strategy to exploit a potential decline in [implied volatility](/iv). Assuming implied volatility is surprisingly high without an undeniable justification for it being like that, the call and put might be [overvalued](/overvalued). In this case, the goal is trust that volatility will drop and afterward close the position for a profit without waiting for expiration.

## Illustration of a Short Straddle

More often than not, traders use [at the money](/atthemoney) options for straddles.

In the event that a [trader](/trader) composes a straddle with a [strike price](/strikeprice) of $25 for an underlying stock trading close $25 per share, and the price of the stock leaps up to $50, the trader would be committed to sell the stock for $25. In the event that the investor didn't hold the underlying stock, they would be forced to buy it on the market for $50 and sell it for $25 for a loss of $25 minus the premiums received while opening the trade.

There are two potential [breakeven points](/breakevenpoint) at expiration at the strike price plus or minus the total premium collected.

For a stock [option](/option) with a strike price of $60 and a total premium of $7.50, the underlying stock must close somewhere in the range of $52.50 and $67.50, excluding [commissions](/commission), for the strategy to break even.

A close below $52.50 or above $67.50 will bring about a loss.
