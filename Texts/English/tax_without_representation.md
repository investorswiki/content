# Taxation Without Representation
## What Is Taxation Without Representation?

The phrase taxation without representation portrays a general population that is required to pay taxes to a government authority without having anything to do with that government's policies. The term has its starting point in a trademark of the American colonials against their British rulers: "Taxation without representation is oppression."

## Figuring out Taxation Without Representation

Opposition to taxation without representation was one of the primary reasons for the American Revolution.

The British Parliament started taxing its American settlers straightforwardly in 1760's, apparently to recover losses incurred during the Seven Years' War of 1756 to 1763. One particularly scorned tax, forced by the [Stamp Act of 1765](/stampduty), required pilgrim printers to pay a tax on reports utilized or made in the states, and to demonstrate it by fastening an embossed revenue stamp to the records.

Violators were attempted in bad habit admiralty courts without a jury. The denial of a trial by peers was a subsequent injury, in the minds of pioneers.

### Rebel Against the Stamp Act

Settlers believed the tax to be unlawful in light of the fact that they had no representation in the Parliament that passed it and were denied the right to a trial by a jury of their friends. Delegates from nine of the 13 states met in New York in October 1765 to form the Stamp Act Congress, better known as the Continental Congress of 1765.

William Samuel Johnson of Connecticut, John Dickinson of Pennsylvania, John Rutledge of South Carolina, and other conspicuous colonials met for 18 days. They then approved a "Declaration of the Rights and Grievances of the Colonists," expressing the representatives' joint position for different settlers to peruse. Resolutions three, four, and five focused on the agents' loyalty to the crown while expressing their issue with taxation without representation.

### Trial Without a Jury

A later resolution questioned the utilization of [admiralty courts](/admiralty-court) that directed trials without juries, refering to a violation of the rights of every free Englishman.

The Congress eventually drafted three petitions addressed to King George III, the House of Lords, and the House of Commons.

### After the Stamp Act

The petitions were initially overlooked however blacklists of British imports and other financial tensions by the homesteaders at long last prompted the cancelation of the Stamp Act in March 1766.

It was too late. Following quite a while of expanding pressures, the American Revolution started on April 19, 1775, with fights between American homesteaders and British soldiers in Lexington and Concord.

On June 7, 1776, Richard Henry Lee acquainted a resolution with Congress pronouncing the 13 states free from British rule. Benjamin Franklin, John Adams, and Thomas Jefferson were among the agents decided to word the resolution.

### A Statement of Intent

The initial segment was a simple statement of intent, including the declaration that all men were made equivalent and have unalienable rights to life, liberty, and the quest for happiness. A subsequent section listed the pilgrims' complaints and declared their determination to accomplish independence. The last passage broke down the pioneers' binds with Britain.

Following discussion, the Second Continental Congress adopted the Declaration of Independence on July 4, 1776, with the signing happening principally on Aug.2, 1776.
