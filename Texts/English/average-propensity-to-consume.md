# Average Propensity to Consume
## What Is Average Propensity to Consume?

Average propensity to consume (APC) measures the percentage of income that is spent instead of saved. This might be calculated by a single individual who needs to know where the money is going or by an economist who needs to follow the spending and saving habits of a whole nation.

Regardless, the propensity to consume can be determined by isolating average household consumption, or spending, by average [household income](/household_income), or earnings.

## Understanding Average Propensity to Consume

From the broader economic view, a high average propensity to consume is generally really great for the economy. At the point when the average propensity to consume is high, consumers are saving less and spending more on goods or services. This increased demand drives economic growth, business expansion, and broad employment.

Low-income households are frequently viewed as having a higher average propensity to consume than high-income households. Low-income households might be forced to spend their whole income on necessities with negligible disposable income staying to save. On the other hand, high-income households with higher cash flow after their necessities are met ordinarily have a generally lower average propensity to consume.

Economists frequently measure economy forecasts on activities by the middle-income households. The spending and savings examples of this demographic frequently show a degree of confidence or negativity about their very own financial circumstances and the economy as a whole.

> At the point when clarified as a decimal, average propensity to consume goes from zero to one. At zero (or 0%), all income is being saved. At one (or 100%), all income is being consumed.

## Propensity to Consume versus Propensity to Save

The sum of the average propensity to consume and the average propensity to save is generally equivalent to one. All a household or a nation must either spend or save its income.

The inverse of the average propensity to consume is the [average propensity to save](/average-propensity-to-save) (APS). That figure is just the total of income minus spending. The outcome is known as the savings ratio.

Prominently, the savings ratio is regularly founded on its percentage of disposable income, or after-tax income. An individual determining personal penchants to consume and save ought to most likely utilize the disposable income figure too for a more reasonable measure.

## Illustration of Average Propensity to Consume

Assume a nation's economy has a [gross domestic product](/gdp) (GDP) equivalent to its disposable income of $500 billion for the previous year. The total savings of the economy was $300 billion, and the lay was spent on goods and services.

The nation's APS is calculated to be 0.60, or $300 billion/$500 billion. This shows the economy allocated 60% of its disposable income to savings. The average propensity to consume is calculated to be 0.40, or (1 - 0.60). Subsequently, the nation burned through 40% of its GDP on goods and services.

APS can incorporate saving for retirement, a home purchase, and other long-term investments. Thusly, it very well may be a proxy for national financial wellbeing.

> As per the Bureau of Economic Analysis, the average household in the United States saved 6.2% of their disposable income in March 2022. This is more than 2% lower than just three months prior.

## Special Considerations

The [marginal propensity to consume](/marginalpropensitytoconsume) (MPC) is a connected concept. It measures the change in the average propensity to consume.

Assume that the nation in the previous model increased its GDP to $700 billion and its consumption of goods and services rose to $375 billion. The economy's average propensity to consume increased to 53.57%.

The nation's consumption increased from $200 billion to $375 billion. On the other hand, the nation's GDP increased from $500 billion to $700 billion. The nation's marginal propensity to consume is 87.5% ($375 billion - $200 billion)/($700 billion - $500 billion). The marginal propensity measures the directional trend of how an entity is using its money. In this case, 87.5% of new growth was additionally consumed.

## Highlights
- Higher average propensity to consume signals greater economic activity as consumers are demanding goods and services.
- On the other hand, lower average propensity flags a slowing economy as less goods are required and job stability is at risk.
- The average propensity to consume is the percentage of income spent, while the average propensity to save is the percentage of income saved.
- Average propensity of consumption is most educational when followed after some time or compared across nations or individuals.
- Income, whether individual or national, must be either spent or saved.
