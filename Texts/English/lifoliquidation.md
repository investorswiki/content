# LIFO Liquidation
## What Is a LIFO Liquidation?

A LIFO liquidation is the point at which a company sells the most recently acquired inventory first. It happens when a company that utilizes the [last-in, first-out ](/lifo)(LIFO) inventory costing method exchanges its more established LIFO inventory. A LIFO liquidation happens when current sales surpass purchases, bringing about the liquidation of any inventory not sold in a previous period.

## How a LIFO Liquidation Works

The LIFO method is a financial practice wherein a company sells the latest inventory purchased first. LIFO matches the latest costs against current incomes. A few companies utilize the LIFO method during periods of inflation when the cost to purchase inventory increments over the long haul. The LIFO method gives tax benefits as the higher costs associated with new inventories apparently offset profits, bringing about a lower tax burden.

## LIFO Liquidation Example

ABC Company utilizes the LIFO method of inventory accounting for its domestic stores. It purchased 1 million units of a product yearly for quite some time. The per-unit cost is $10 in year one, $12 in year two, and $14 in year three, and ABC sells every unit for $50. It sold 500,000 units of the product in every one of the initial three years, leaving a total of 1.5 million units close by. Accepting that demand will stay consistent, it just purchases 500,000 units in year four at $15 per unit.
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Year of Purchase</td><td>Cost per unit</td><td>Quantity</td><td>Total Cost</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>1</td><td>$10</td><td>1,000,000</td><td>$10,000,000</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>2</td><td>$12</td><td>1,000,000</td><td>$12,000,000</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>3</td><td>$14</td><td>1,000,000</td><td>$14,000,000</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>4</td><td>$15</td><td>500,000</td><td>$7,500,000</td></tr>
</tbody>

Regardless of its forecast, consumer demand for the product expanded; ABC sold a million units in year four. Under the LIFO method, 500,000 units from year four are liquidated, bringing about incomes of $25 million, [COGS](/cogs) of $7.5 million, and gross profits of $17.5 million; and 500,000 units from year three are liquidated, bringing about incomes of $25 million, COGS of $7 million, and gross profits of $18 million.
