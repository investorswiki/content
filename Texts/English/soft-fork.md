# Soft Fork
## What Is a Soft Fork?

In [blockchain](/blockchain) technology, a soft fork is a change to the software protocol where just beforehand legitimate transaction blocks are made invalid. Since old hubs will perceive the new blocks as substantial, a soft fork is backwards-viable. This sort of fork requires just a majority of the diggers moving up to implement the new rules, rather than a [hard fork](/hard-fork) that requires all hubs to upgrade and settle on the new variant.

## Seeing Soft Forks Usage

New transaction types can frequently be added as soft forks, requiring just that the participants (for example source and receiver) and diggers comprehend the new transaction type. This is finished by having the new transaction appear to more established clients as a "pay-to-anyone" transaction (of a special form) and getting the diggers to consent to dismiss blocks including these transactions except if the transaction approves under the new rules. This is the manner by which pay-to-prearrange hash (P2SH) was added to [bitcoin](/bitcoin).

A soft fork can likewise happen on occasion due to a brief difference in the blockchain while diggers utilizing non-upgraded hubs disregard another consensus rule their hubs have close to zero familiarity with.

Soft forks require no hubs to upgrade to keep up with consensus, since all blocks with the new soft forked-in rules additionally follow the old rules, accordingly old clients acknowledge them. Soft forks can't be switched without a hard fork since a soft fork by definition just permits the set of substantial blocks to be a legitimate subset of what was legitimate pre-fork. On the off chance that users upgrade to a post-soft fork client and for reasons unknown a majority of excavators switch back to the pre-soft fork client, the post-soft fork client users would break consensus when a block went along that didn't follow their clients' new rules. For a soft fork to work, a majority of the mining power should be running a client perceiving the fork. The more excavators that acknowledge the new rules, the safer the network is post-fork. Assuming you have 3/4 of diggers perceiving the fork, 1/4 blocks made aren't guaranteed to follow the new rules. These 1/4 blocks will be legitimate to old hubs that aren't aware of the new rules, however they will be overlooked by new hubs.

Soft forks have been utilized on the bitcoin and [ethereum](/ethereum) blockchains, among others, to carry out new and upgraded functionalities that are backward viable.
