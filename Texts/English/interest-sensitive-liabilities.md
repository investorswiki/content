# Interest Sensitive Liabilities
## What Are Interest Sensitive Liabilities?

Interest sensitive liabilities are types of short-term deposits with variable interest rates that a bank holds for customers. Interest sensitive liabilities make up a lot of the assets of most banks, incorporating [money market](/moneymarket) certificates, savings accounts, and the [Super NOW account](/supernowaccount).

## Grasping Interest Sensitive Liabilities

Two major types of interest rates exist: [fixed rate](/fixedinterestrate) and [variable rate](/variableinterestrate). For instance, a fixed interest rate is an interest rate on a liability, for example, a loan or a mortgage, which continues as before for the whole term or a predefined part of the term. Variable interest rates on a loan or security will vacillate after some time, in light of an underlying benchmark interest rate or index, which periodically changes. Variable rates are otherwise called floating interest rates.

For consumers, benefits of fixed interest rates incorporate consistent payments over the long haul as the interest rates on fixed-rate loans stay something similar, making it simpler to budget for what's to come. Burdens can incorporate missing out on lower initial rates in variable loans. Variable interest rates on mortgages (frequently called adjustable-rate mortgages or ARMs) start low and fixed for the initial not many long stretches of the loan and adjust following this period.

As verified above, interest-sensitive liabilities are variable rate [deposits](/bank-deposits) (i.e., the deposits are sensitive to interest rate changes). This means that their value changes with time. The goal of banks is to keep customer deposits however long they can, as it is the way they loan money to different customers, earning interest on those loans, which mean profits. Earning interest on deposits is attractive for customers as it allows a return on their money, as an investment, as opposed to just sitting in an account inactively.

## Common Interest Sensitive Liability Products

Instances of interest-sensitive liabilities incorporate money market certificates, savings accounts, and the Super NOW account.

Money market certificates have high liquidity and extremely short maturities, going in duration from overnight to just under a year. Common money market instruments incorporate eurodollar deposits, negotiable [certificates of deposit](/certificateofdeposit) (CDs), bankers acknowledgments, U.S. Treasury bills, commercial paper, municipal notes, federal funds, and [repurchase agreements](/repurchaseagreement) (repos).

Savings accounts are less complex products. Dissimilar to [checking accounts](/checkingaccount), savings accounts really do bear some interest (a humble rate). Banks or financial institutions might limit the number of withdrawals from a savings account every month and can charge fees except if the account keeps a certain average month to month balance (e.g., $100).

Made in 1982, Super NOW accounts offer higher interest rates than [Negotiable Order of Withdrawal](/nowaccount) (NOW) accounts yet at the same time offer a lower rate than a money market account.

## Interest Sensitive Liabilities and Regulation Q

Regulation Q of the [Monetary Act of 1980](/monetary-control-act) started eliminating [interest-rate ceilings](/interestrateceiling) by 1986. This stage out, combined with the elimination of most early withdrawal punishments, increased the volatility of demand deposit holdings in customer accounts. Demand deposits are essential to a bank for making loans and earning interest (profit) on those loans. These changes brought about banks changing the management of their [interest rate risk](/interestraterisk).
