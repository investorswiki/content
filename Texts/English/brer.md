# Before Reimbursement Expense Ratio
## What Is a Before Reimbursement Expense Ratio?

The before reimbursement expense ratio is the percentage of total assets a mutual fund must pay to cover operating expenses, measured before managers repay any of those fees.

## Understanding the Before Reimbursement Expense Ratio

The before reimbursement expense ratio, or gross expense ratio, measures the annual [operating expenses](/operating_expense) charged to investors in a [mutual fund](/mutualfund) as a percentage of that fund's assets.

The calculation happens before thinking about any expected reimbursements to investors from fund managers. The expense ratio calculated subsequent to deducting reimbursements is the after reimbursement expense ratio, or net expense ratio.

A mutual fund's operating expenses incorporate [management fees](/managementfee), transaction fees, [12B-1 fees](/12b-1fees), and other business costs. A portion of these expenses, for example, most management fees, are calculated as percentages of net assets. Thusly, they don't add to shifts in a mutual fund before reimbursement expenses ratio year to year.

Different fees, for example, transaction fees, don't address an anticipated percentage of the fund's total assets in a given year. Those fees produce the yearly shift in before reimbursement expense ratios. In light of those fees, the before reimbursement expense ratio will in general go up in lean years, when returns are low however certain fees don't diminish, and down in great years, when returns are high and those equivalent fees don't increase.

On the off chance that a mutual fund has committed to a capped expense ratio in its [prospectus](/prospectus) or basically chooses for keep it seriously low, it will repay investors a portion of operation expenses to help returns and simultaneously produce a lower, [after reimbursement expense ratio](/arer).

## Impact of the Before Reimbursement Expense Ratio

The after reimbursement expense ratio is the one with an immediate impact on investors' earnings, yet the before reimbursement expense ratio likewise merits consideration.

Most reimbursements are discretionary, implying that just on the grounds that managers chose to repay a portion of the mutual fund's operating expenses this year, investors can't be certain they'll do likewise next year. Investors need to keep an eye on the gross expense ratio to prepare themselves for that scenario.

Further, the before reimbursement expense ratio is a better measure of the genuine practicality of the company. Assuming they are hoping to invest in a mutual fund and they've limited it down to two that show comparative returns and net expense ratios, contrasting gross expense ratios can be an effective method for seeing which fund is genuinely getting along nicely and which is on life support.

An ostensibly small difference among gross and net [expense ratios](/expenseratio) can have a big effect in earnings. A 1.25% gross expense ratio may not seem to be much since it addresses a percentage of total assets. On a mutual fund with a 5% annual return, it would consume 25% of the fund's profits. Utilizing reimbursements to arrive at a net expense ratio of 0.75% would keep an extra 10% of the annual return in shareholders' pockets.
