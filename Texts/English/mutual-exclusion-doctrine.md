# Mutual Exclusion Doctrine
## What Is the Mutual Exclusion Doctrine?

The mutual exclusion doctrine is an agreement between federal, state, and nearby taxing specialists commanding mutual exclusion in taxation of government [bond](/bond) interest. In this way the interest paid on any security issued by the federal government isn't taxable at the state or nearby level.

Then again, any debt issued by state or nearby municipalities is free from federal taxation also. The freedom from state and nearby taxes additionally makes interest from governmental issues more agreeable for conservative investors living on [fixed incomes](/fixedincome).

## Grasping the Mutual Exclusion Doctrine

The mutual exclusion doctrine has been in place for quite a long time and is a major justification behind the notoriety of [municipal bonds](/municipalbond) with high-income investors seeking federal tax relief. Federal income tax is typically a lot higher than state or nearby taxes, and much of the time decides state and neighborhood tax rates. Accordingly any investment income that is free of federal taxation is generally interesting to rich people in high tax brackets. Also, municipal bond interest is exempt from the federal [alternative least tax](/alternativeminimumtax) (AMT), which hit high earners seriously prior to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (TCJA).

State rules change on taxation of municipal bond income. Generally, in any case, most states exempt municipal bond income that is earned on any bonds issued inside the state. For instance, in the event that a resident of San Diego purchases a Los Angeles municipal bond, the state of California would exempt the San Diego owner from tax on the Los Angeles bond income. In any case, assuming a similar investor bought Philadelphia municipal bonds, they would be taxed by California.

## A few Cities Also Exclude Bond Tax

Numerous urban communities that have an income tax, including New York City, likewise exempt qualifying municipal bonds from taxation under this arrangement. This can be important to individuals who work in New York City yet live outside the city, since New York taxes all income earned with the city limits, no matter what the worker's residence.

## Investors Must Consider Taxable Equivalent Yield

One downside to mutual exclusion is that bond issuers are very much aware of the tax savings inherent in their offerings, so the price and yield are adjusted appropriately. To decide whether a tax-free bond is a better investment than a taxable bond, investors work out the "[taxable equivalent yield](/taxequivalentyield)."

### Model

For instance, say a tax-free municipal bond issued in your own state yields 2.5 percent, and a bank certificate of deposit (CD) is paying 3 percent annually. Investing $10,000 in the CD yields $300 in annual interest, while the bond just pays $250. Be that as it may, suppose you're in the 39.6 percent tax bracket. After taxes, your income on the CD is decreased to $181, giving the municipal bond a better taxable equivalent yield.

## Highlights
- The mutual exclusion doctrine states that interest earned on government bonds can't be taxed at numerous levels (for example state and federal or neighborhood).
- Holders of such securities need to consider the taxable equivalent yield to evaluate their net return potential accurately.
- This rule applies predominantly to holders of municipal bonds, and generally helps higher-income taxpayers.
