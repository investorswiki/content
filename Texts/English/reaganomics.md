By the late 1980s, working class incomes were barely higher than they had been a decade before and the poverty rate had actually increased."

Moreover, a large number of the results of the Reagan time wouldn't be genuinely perceived for the rest of the Reagan presidency. For instance, the deregulation of the financial services industry would play a major part in the [Savings and Loan crisis](/sl-crisis), as well as the financial collapse of 2008.
