# Indexed Annuity
## What Is an Indexed Annuity?

An indexed annuity is a type of [annuity contract](/annuitycontract) that pays an interest rate based on the performance of a predefined market index, for example, the [S&P 500](/sp500). It contrasts from [fixed annuities](/fixedannuity), which pay a fixed rate of interest, and [variable annuities](/variableannuity), which base their interest rate on a portfolio of securities picked by the annuity owner. Indexed annuities are once in a while alluded to as equity-indexed or fixed-indexed annuities.

## How Indexed Annuities Work

Indexed annuities offer their owners, or [annuitants](/annuitant), the opportunity to earn higher yields than fixed annuities when the financial markets perform well. Ordinarily, they additionally give some protection against market declines.

The rate on an indexed annuity is calculated based on the [year-over-year](/year-over-year) gain in the index or its average month to month gain over a year period.

While indexed annuities are linked to the performance of a specific index, the annuitant will not be guaranteed to receive the full reward of any rise in that index. One explanation is that indexed annuities frequently set limits on the likely gain at a certain percentage, regularly alluded to as the "participation rate." The participation rate can be pretty much as high as 100%, meaning the account is credited with the entirety of the gain, or as low as 25%. Most indexed annuities offer a participation rate somewhere in the range of 80% and 90% â€” to some extent in the early years of the contract.

In the event that the stock index gained 15%, for instance, a 80% participation rate means a credited yield of 12%. Many indexed annuities offer a high participation rate for the main little while, after which the rate changes descending.

### Yields and rate caps

Most indexed annuity contracts likewise incorporate a yield or rate cap that can additionally limit the amount that is credited to the accumulation account. A 7% rate cap, for instance, limits the attributed yield to 7% regardless of how much the stock index has gained. Rate caps ordinarily range from a high of 15% to as low as 4% and are subject to change.

In the model over, the 15% gain reduced by a 80% participation rate to 12% would be additionally reduced to 7% in the event that the annuity contract determines a 7% rate cap.

Whenever the stock index declines, the insurance company credits the account with a base rate of return. A commonplace least rate guarantee is around 2%. Some can be essentially as low as 0% or as high as 3%.

### Adjusted values

At specific spans, the insurer will change the value of the account to incorporate any gain that happened in that time span. The principal, which the insurer guarantees, never declines in value except if the account owner takes a withdrawal. Insurers utilize several unique methods to change the account's value, for example, a year-over-year reset or a point-to-point reset, which incorporates at least two years' worth of returns.

Likewise with different types of annuities, the owner can start getting customary income by annuitizing the contract and guiding the insurer to begin the [payout phase](/payoutphase).
