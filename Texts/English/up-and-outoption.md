# Up-and-Out Option
## What Is an Up-and-Out Option?

An up-and-out option is a type of [knock-out](/knock-outoption) barrier option that ceases to exist when the price of the underlying security rises over a specific price level, called the barrier price.

In the event that the price of the underlying doesn't rise over the barrier level, the option acts like some other option — it gives the holder the right yet not the obligation to exercise their [call](/calloption) or [put option](/putoption) at the strike price at the very latest the expiration date determined in the contract.

## Understanding Up-and-Out Options

Considered a [exotic option](/exoticoption), an up-and-out option is one of two types of knock-out barrier options. (The other type of knock-out barrier option is a down-and-out option.) Both kinds come in put and call assortments. A [barrier option](/barrieroption) is a type of option where the payoff, and the actual presence of the option, relies upon whether the underlying asset arrives at a predetermined price.

A knock-out will terminate worthless if the underlying arrives at a certain price, limiting profits for the holder and limiting losses for the writer. The critical concept for a knock-out option is that if the [underlying asset](/underlying-asset) arrives at the barrier at **any** time during the option's life, the option is knocked out and won't return into reality. It doesn't make any difference on the off chance that the underlying moves back below pre-knock-out levels.

For instance, an up-and-out option has a [strike price](/strikeprice) of $80 and a knock-out price of $100. At the option's inception, the price of the stock was $75, yet before the option was exercisable, the price of the stock came to $100. This valuation means the option automatically terminates worthless on the grounds that it hit or surpassed the barrier level — it doesn't make any difference where the underlying trades before the [exercise](/exercise) date.

A barrier option can on the other hand be built as a [knock-in](/knock-inoption). Rather than knock-outs, a knock-in option has no value **until** the underlying arrives at a certain price.

Up-and-outs can likewise measure up to [down-and-out options](/daoo). With a down-and-out option, on the off chance that the underlying falls below the barrier price, the option ceases to exist.

## Using Up-and-Out Options

Huge institutions or [market markers](/marketmaker) make these options by means of direct agreements with clients seeking them. For instance, a portfolio manager can involve them as a more affordable method to [hedge](/hedge) against losses on a short position. The hedge would be less costly than buying [vanilla call options](/vanillaoption). Nonetheless, it would be an imperfect hedge on the grounds that the buyer would be unprotected assuming the security price increased over the barrier price.

Pricing actually relies upon every one of the normal options measurements — the knock-out feature adding an extra aspect. Since options trade over the counter, there is typically limited liquidity for such instruments. This means the buyer should acknowledge the [premium](/option-premium) (cost) offered to them (or probably endeavor to arrange a better price with the seller). Vanilla option premiums can give a baseline estimate to work off of. Typically, an up-and-out call option ought to have a lower premium than a vanilla call option with a similar expiration and strike.

## Illustration of an Up-and-Out Option

For instance, accept that an institutional investor is interested in buying calls on Apple Inc. (AAPL) in light of the fact that they accept the price will rise. They need to buy 100 contracts, so they need to keep the cost as low as could be expected. They consider buying an up-and-out option since they will quite often be less expensive than comparable vanilla calls.

Say that Apple stock is trading at $200. The investor accepts the price will rise above $200 throughout the next 90 days however likely won't rise above $240. They choose to buy a [at-the-money](/atthemoney) up-and-out option with a strike price of $200, an expiration in 90 days, and a knock-out level of $240.

A vanilla option expiring in 90 days with a $200 strike is trading for $11.80 (or $1,180 per contract, which includes 100 shares). The investor needs to buy 100 contracts, for a total cost of $118,000.

They have received a quote that a [investment bank](/investment-banking) will offer them the up-and-out for $8.80, for a total cost of $88,000 ($8.80 x 100 shares x 100 contracts). This saves the firm $30,000 on premium costs.

The investor's [breakeven](/breakevenpoint) is $200 plus the cost of the option ($8.80), or $208.80. Apple stock requirements to move above $208.80 within the next 90 days in order for the investor to cover the cost of the options. They bring in money in the event that the price of Apple trades above $208.80 yet in addition remains below $240.

On the off chance that, whenever before expiration, the price of Apple stock contacts $240, the options cease to exist and the investor loses the premium they paid ($88,000).

## Features
- Up-and-out options are typically less expensive than vanilla options since a chance of is being knocked out of the option (which makes the up-and-out option worthless).
- A down-and-out option is comparable, with the exception of it ceases to exist in the event that the price of the underlying dips under the barrier price.
- An up-and-out option is a type of options contract that ceases to exist in the event that the underlying moves over a certain price point, called the barrier.
