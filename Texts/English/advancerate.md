# Advance Rate
## What Is an Advance Rate?

An advance rate is the percentage of the value of the [collateral](/collateral) that a [lender](/lender) will stretch out as a loan. The advance rate assists a borrower with figuring out what sort of collateral to offer that would be useful to secure the ideal loan amount and limits a lender's loss exposure while accepting collateral that can vary in value.

## Figuring out an Advance Rate

Collateral assists lenders with limiting risk and offer affordable [interest rates](/interestrate) to borrowers. By setting an advance rate, a lender can build a cushion into the loan transaction by guaranteeing that assuming that the value of the collateral drops and the loan goes into [default](/default2), there is as yet adequate protection from the principal loss of the loan. On the off chance that a lender has an advance rate of 75%, and the value of the collateral introduced is $100,000, then, at that point, the maximum loan the borrower can receive is $75,000.

Collateral assists borrowers with getting a better rate for their loan and possibly a bigger loan altogether. Common types of collateral incorporate real estate (counting [home equity](/home_equity)), automobile vehicles, cash accounts, investments, insurance policies, future payments or receivables, assets, or machinery and equipment.

The advance rate works in much the same way to the [loan-to-value (LTV) ratio](/loantovalue). LTV is one more lending risk assessment ratio frequently utilized by financial institutions and different lenders prior to endorsing a mortgage. High LTV ratios are generally considered to be higher risk, hence costing the borrower more and possibly requiring the borrower to purchase mortgage insurance. The LTV ratio can be calculated as the Mortgage Amount/Appraised Value of the Property.

## Advance Rate in the Context of Assessing Credit Risk

Deciding the advance rate for a borrower generally comes after the lender investigates the overall financial condition of the borrower. This analysis centers around the ability of the lender to repay the proposed loan, as per the specific terms and conditions given. To decide a borrower's [credit risk](/creditrisk), lenders, like commercial banks, frequently start with a structure, called "the five Cs." These comprise of a candidate's credit history, their capacity to repay, their capital, the loan's conditions, and associated collateral. When these factors are thought about, the collateral is then appraised. When appraised and not entirely set in stone, the advance rate is chosen.

Credit risk assessment happens in instances of consumer loans as well as all through the [bond market](/bondmarket). Following careful consideration of a bond guarantor's risk of default, a credit rating agency, like Fitch, Moody's, or Standard and Poor's, doles out a rating, which relates to the backer's risk level and comparing potential for reward.
