# Decentralized Applications (dApps)

Decentralized Applications (**DApps**) are applications that run on a distributed computing system, that is to say, a blockchain network. While there are different approaches to defining a DApp, they are typically depicted as applications that have the accompanying qualities:
- Open Source - The source code is intentionally made available to the public, implying that anybody can confirm, use, copy, and alter the code.
- Decentralized - Since DApps run on blockchain networks, they are not controlled by a single entity or authority. All things being equal, they are kept up with by numerous users (or hubs).
- Cryptographically secure - The application is protected by cryptography, implying that every one of the data is recorded and kept up with in a public blockchain. There is no single point of disappointment.

There are numerous issues in legacy applications that the DApps try to address. The principal benefit of picking a DApp over a traditional app is that the last option utilizes a centralized architecture by storing their data on servers controlled by a single entity. This means they have a single point of disappointment, which is defenseless to technical issues and malicious assaults.
A compromised centralized server might bring down the whole network of the application, making it for a brief time or permanently unusable. Other than that, centralized systems experience the ill effects of data leakage or theft frequently, endangering the companies and individual users.
There is a great assortment of DApps, with various use cases. They might incorporate gaming, social media platforms, cryptocurrency wallets, and financial applications ([DeFi](/defi)).
Decentralized applications fuel their own activity through a tokenized system (digital tokens made using smart contracts). Tokens can be specific for a specific DApp (e.g., the Steem token utilized on Steemit), or they can be native to the blockchain that has the DApp, as on account of CryptoKitties utilizing ether (ETH).
Summarizing, DApps are planned as open-source extends that run on top of a blockchain network. Thus, the distributed idea of these networks gives transparency, decentralization, and resistance to assaults.

## Features
- Since dApps are decentralized, they are free from the control and obstruction of a single authority.
- Decentralized applications — otherwise called "dApps" or "dapps" — are digital applications that run on a blockchain network of computers as opposed to depending on a single computer.
- Benefits of dApps incorporate the protecting of client privacy, the lack of control, and the flexibility of development.
- Downsides incorporate the possible powerlessness to scale, challenges in fostering a UI, and hardships in making code changes.
## FAQ
### What Are Ethereum dApps?
These are decentralized applications that are fueled and developed utilizing the Ethereum platform. Ethereum dApps utilize smart contracts for their logic. They are sent on the Ethereum network and utilize the platform's blockchain for data storage.
### What Are Examples of Centralized and Decentralized Apps?
Notable instances of centralized apps are Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, and Netflix. Banks and other financial institutions utilize centralized apps to permit their customers online access to their accounts.Peepeth, a social network alternative to Twitter, is an illustration of a decentralized app. Cryptokitties is a dApp game that permits users to buy and sell virtual cats. MakerDAO is a decentralized credit service supporting the [stablecoin](/stablecoin) Dai and permits users to open a collateralized debt position (CDP).
### What Is the Difference Between a Centralized and Decentralized App?
A centralized app is owned by a single company. The application software for a centralized app lives on at least one servers controlled by the company. As a client, you'll interface with the app by downloading a copy of the app and afterward sending and getting data to and fro from the company's server.A decentralized app (otherwise called a dApp or dapp) works on a blockchain or peer-to-peer network of computers. It enables users to take part in transactions straightforwardly with each other rather than depending on a central authority. The client of a dApp will pay the engineer an amount of [cryptocurrency](/cryptocurrency) to download and utilize the program's source code. The source code is known as a smart contract, which permits users to complete transactions without uncovering personal data.
