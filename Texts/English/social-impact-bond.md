# Social Impact Bond (SIB)
## What Is a Social Impact Bond (SIB)?

A social impact bond (SIB) is a contract with the public sector or overseeing authority, by which it pays for better social outcomes in certain areas and passes on part of the savings accomplished to investors. A social impact bond isn't a [bond](/bond), essentially, since repayment and [return on investment (ROI)](/returnoninvestment) are contingent upon the accomplishment of wanted social outcomes. On the off chance that the objectives are not accomplished, investors receive neither a return nor repayment of principal. SIBs get their name from the way that their investors are commonly those who are interested in the financial return on their investment, yet in addition in its social impact.

## Understanding Social Impact Bonds (SIBs)

Social impact bonds will generally be risky investments, as they are completely dependent upon the progress of the social outcome. Not at all like normal bonds, social impact bonds are not impacted by factors, for example, [interest rate risk](/interestraterisk), [reinvestment risk](/reinvestmentrisk), or [market risk](/marketrisk). Be that as it may, they are as yet subject to [default](/defaultrisk) and inflation risk. It very well may be difficult to determine the progress of social impact bonds, as they are based on social impact, which is frequently more diligently to evaluate and measure. There are a lot a bigger number of factors than ordinary bonds, which are similarly simple to measure because they are based on hard data. Hence, it's hard for social impact bonds to get government funding.

The main social impact bond was issued in 2010 by Social Finance Ltd. Up until this point, social impact bonds have just been issued by the public sector, however in theory, [private sector](/private-sector) organizations can likewise issue them. The trend of investing in the social environment and society has risen in recent years and has turned into a way for investors to reward the community, as well as a way for companies to grow their [social responsibility](/socialresponsibility). It's a method for expanding community contribution and awareness of social issues. Most social impact bonds seek [environmental, social, and governance (ESG)](/environmental-social-and-governance-esg-measures) closes.

## A Social Impact Bond in Practice

In 2010, Peterborough Prison in the United Kingdom issued one of the primary social impact bonds anyplace in the world. The bond raised 5 million pounds from 17 social investors to fund a pilot project to reduce re-insulting rates of short-term detainees. The relapse, or re-conviction, rates of detainees released from Peterborough were to be compared with the relapse rates of a control group of detainees north of six years. Assuming Peterborough's re-conviction rates were somewhere around 7.5% below the rates of the control group, investors would receive a rising return that is straightforwardly proportional to the difference in relapse rates between the two groups and is capped at 13% every year more than eight years.

In 2017, the Ministry of Justice announced that the Peterborough Social Impact Bond was fruitful. Compared to a control group, it had reduced repeat offenses by short-sentenced guilty parties by 9%, outperforming the bond's target of 7.5%. Subsequently, investors received a return of just around 3% every year.
