# Prospect Theory
## What Is the Prospect Theory?

Prospect theory expects that losses and gains are valued in an unexpected way, and along these lines individuals go with choices in light of perceived gains rather than perceived losses. Otherwise called the "[loss-aversion](/loss-brain science)" theory, that's what the overall concept is assuming two decisions are put before an individual, both equivalent, with one introduced in terms of expected gains and the other in terms of potential losses, the former option will be picked.

## How the Prospect Theory Works

Prospect theory has a place with the [behavioral economic](/behavioraleconomics) subgroup, portraying how individuals settle on a decision between probabilistic alternatives where risk is implied and the likelihood of various outcomes is obscure. This theory was planned in 1979 and further developed in 1992 by Amos Tversky and Daniel Kahneman, considering it all the more mentally accurate of how decisions are made when compared to the expected utility theory.

The underlying clarification for an individual's behavior, under prospect theory, is that in light of the fact that the decisions are independent and particular, the likelihood of a gain or a loss is sensibly assumed as being 50/50 rather than the likelihood that is really introduced. Basically, the likelihood of a gain is generally perceived as greater.

Tversky and Kahneman suggested that losses cause a greater emotional impact on an individual than does an equivalent amount of gain, so given decisions introduced two different ways — with both offering the same outcome — an individual will pick the option offering perceived gains.

For instance, expect that the final product of getting $25. One option is being given $25 outright. The other option is being given $50 and afterward offering back $25. The utility of the $25 is the very same in the two options. Nonetheless, individuals are probably going to decide to receive straight cash in light of the fact that a single gain is generally seen as more positive than initially having more cash and afterward experiencing a loss.

## Special Considerations

As indicated by Tversky and Kahneman, the certainty effect is shown when individuals incline toward certain outcomes and underweight outcomes that are just probable. The certainty effect prompts individuals staying away from risk when there is a prospect of a definite gain. It likewise adds to individuals seeking risk when one of their options is a certain loss.

The confinement effect happens when individuals have given two options the same outcome, yet various courses to the outcome. In this case, individuals are probably going to cancel out comparative data to ease the cognitive burden, and their decisions will fluctuate contingent upon how the options are outlined.

## Illustration of Prospect Theory

Consider an investor who is given two pitches for the same [mutual fund](/mutualfund). The primary advisor presents the fund to Sam, highlighting that it has an average return of 10% throughout the previous three years. Meanwhile, a subsequent advisor lets the investor know that the fund has had better than expected returns over the course of the past decade, however has been in decline throughout the previous three years.

Prospect theory says that albeit the investor has been pitched precisely the same mutual fund, they are probably going to buy from the primary advisor. That is, the investor is bound to buy the fund from the advisor that communicates the fund's [rate of return](/rateofreturn) in terms of just gains, while the subsequent advisor introduced the fund as having high returns, yet in addition losses.

## Prospect Theory FAQs
### Theory's meaning could be a little more obvious.

Prospect theory says that investors value gains and losses in an unexpected way. That is, assuming an investor is introduced an investment option in view of possible gains, and one more in light of likely losses, the investor will pick an investment where potential gains are introduced.

### Why Is Prospect Theory Important?

It's helpful for investors to figure out their predispositions, where losses will quite often cause greater emotional impact than the equivalent gain. The prospect theory portrays hows decisions are made by investors.

### What Are the Main Components of Prospect Theory?

Prospect theory is part of the behavioral economic subgroup. It depicts how individuals pursue choices between alternatives where risk is implied and the likelihood of various outcomes is obscure. There is a certainty effect displayed in the prospect theory, where individuals look for certain outcomes, underweighting just probable outcomes.

### Who Proposed Prospect Theory?

Prospect theory was first presented in 1979 by Amos Tversky and Daniel Kahneman, who later developed the thought in 1992. The pair said that the prospect theory was better at accurately portraying how decisions are made, compared to the expected utility theory.

### How Did Kahneman and Tversky Respond?

Kahneman and Tversky recommended that losses have a greater emotional impact than a gain of the same amount. That's what they said, given decisions introduced two different ways — with both offering the same outcome — an individual will pick the option offering perceived gains.

## Primary concern

Prospect theory says that individuals will acknowledge an investment when the gains are introduced, versus the losses. That is, investors weigh potential gains more than expected losses.

## Highlights
- The certainty effect says individuals favor certain outcomes over probable ones, while the segregation effect says individuals cancel out comparative data while settling on a choice.
- Prospect theory is otherwise called the loss-abhorrence theory.
- The prospect theory says that investors value gains and losses in an unexpected way, putting more weight on perceived gains versus perceived losses.
- An investor gave a decision, both equivalent, will pick the one introduced in terms of likely gains.
- The prospect theory is part of behavioral economics, recommending investors picked perceived gains since losses cause a greater emotional impact.
