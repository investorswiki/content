A sector fund is an investment fund that invests exclusively in businesses that operate in a particular industry or [sector](/sector) of the economy. Sector funds are commonly structured as [mutual funds](/mutualfund) or [exchange traded funds](/etf) (ETFs).

## Understanding a Sector Fund

Sector funds center around one area of the market, known as a sector, by investing in companies that operate in the fund's picked sector. A sector comprises of one line of business that gives something very similar or comparative product. A few common sectors incorporate the [financial sector](/financial_sector) or the [technology sector](/technology_sector). JPMorgan is in the financial sector while Apple is in the technology sector. Sector funds permit investors to take targeted wagers on the [appreciation](/appreciation) capability of a particular industry category.

Certain sectors might offer high growth potential due to economically driven investing impetuses; be that as it may, investing in a specific sector has a high risk potential and more [volatility](/volatility) as it is a concentrated investment with no economic [diversification](/diversification).

Sector funds truly do offer the advantage of some diversification through numerous holdings in a portfolio; nonetheless, overall sector funds will have [idiosyncratic risks](/idiosyncraticrisk) that influence the whole portfolio due to their targeted sector exposure. Assuming one sector performs ineffectively, the fund zeroed in on that sector will do as such too, with no offset from investments in a sector that is performing great.

A sector fund will have portfolio requirements requiring the portfolio manager to pick investment securities for the fund that fall inside the fund's targeted objective. The investment manager won't be permitted to invest in some other sectors per the command of the firm. In the event that the strategy of the fund is to change, the investment manager needs to tell the investors, as they might be investing in the fund/sector as part of a more extensive portfolio strategy.

A few sectors and sector fund investing categories might require greater [due diligence](/duediligence) than others, as certain sectors are regularly associated with [market cycles](/market_cycles). Consumer cyclical stocks, for instance, incorporate companies associated with automotive, housing, amusement, and retail activities. These companies and market sub-sectors in all actuality do well when an economy is developing yet inadequately when an economy isn't. Consumer staples stocks, incorporating companies engaged with home utilities, food, drink, and household things are known to be more stable through a wide range of market cycles.

## Sector Funds and Beta

By and large, one method for following the risks and volatility of a sector is by following its [beta](/beta). From 2017 to 2020, the [Standard and Poor's](/sp) (S&P) technology sector index reported one of the highest sector betas at 1.03, and the utilities sector one of the least betas at 0.17. The technology sector reported a return of half in 2019, beating the [S&P 500 Index's](/sp500) return of 31.5%. The return of the utilities sector was 26.4%, just below the Index's return, true to form by its lower beta.

## Sector Fund Investing

Investing in specific sector funds is a seriously simple cycle as there are many funds that [actively](/activemanagement) or [passively](/passivemanagement) invest in various sectors of the market. An active sector fund would actively conclude which shares ought to be in the portfolio in view of their expert analysis. They might incorporate or eliminate companies from their portfolio frequently.

Passive sector funds regularly track an index. The S&P has various sector indexes for tracking, which are:

- S&P 500 Consumer Discretionary Index
- S&P 500 Consumers Staples Index
- S&P 500 Energy Index
- S&P 500 Financials Index
- S&P 500 Healthcare Index
- S&P 500 Industrials Index
- S&P 500 Information Technology Index
- S&P 500 Materials Index
- S&P 500 Real Estate Index
- S&P 500 Communication Services Index
- S&P 500 Utilities Index

It is typically educated to invest small portions concerning your investment allocation into sector funds due to their volatility and to consolidate sector fund investing as a larger part of your portfolio to add diversity. For instance, an investor could follow a core-satellite investment strategy, by which an investor picks a core holding, whether a [blue chip](/bluechip) company or a diversified index fund, that is allocated a large portion of the investment capital, and afterward picks satellite investments, for example, a sector fund, which compromise a small allocation of investment capital.
