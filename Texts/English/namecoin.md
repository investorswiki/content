# Namecoin (NMC)
## What Is Namecoin (NMC)?

Namecoin is "a peer-to-peer naming system in view of Bitcoin." It's a token for a blockchain initially forked from Bitcoin's blockchain. A fork is a change in a blockchain that makes the new branch noncompatible to the original branch. Namecoin was developed as a blockchain and token for a decentralized domain name system (DNS).

The producers of Namecoin portray it as "an experimental open-source technology which improves [decentralization](/decentralizedmarket), security, restriction resistance, privacy, and speed of certain parts of the internet infrastructure like DNS and personalities."

## Grasping Namecoin (NMC)

Namecoin utilizes the concept of data name/value pairs joined to a coin. A name/value pair is a data value and a name used to distinguish the value in a database. In this case, the name/value pair is a PC lucid numeric address with a comprehensible name. A token for the name/value pair is made, and the token holder possesses the name/value pair. In this way, a Namecoin is utilized to lay out ownership of a domain name.

### Namecoin History

The thought for fostering a tokenized domain name system was first presented in 2010 in an Internet Relay Chat (IRC) room, #bitcoin-dev, where users examined the merits of a bitcoin-like DNS system that came to be known as bitdns. Namecoin was presented in April 2011, by Vincent Durham (an anonymous name) on a similar Bitcoin Forum used to report Bitcoin.

## How Is Namecoin Different From Bitcoin?

Namecoin highlights several Bitcoin similitudes, presently the top digital currency by market capitalization. Namecoin's fork was initiated to make a better approach to lay out ownership of the comprehensible addresses assigned to the machine-intelligible addresses utilized on the web — domain names.

The primary difference among Bitcoin and Namecoin is the purpose of the technology. Bitcoin creators wanted a reasonable alternative currency; Namecoin creators wanted a domain naming system. Along these lines, there are different consensus and protocol rules that exist inside each project. Certain elements are vital while going through with financial transactions that are excessive while finishing name registrations for new internet domains.

Since Namecoin uses the equivalent [proof-of-work](/proof-work) (PoW) algorithm as Bitcoin, you can blend mine Namecoins without extra hardware (and with next to no extra power) in the event that you are now mining Bitcoin. Both Bitcoin and Namecoin are limited to a total of 21 million coins. The critical difference in Namecoin is that tokens are spent as domain names are registered. The cost of one domain name to Namecoin's usable supply is .01 NMC. This means there are 2.1 billion domain names (or different purposes) accessible utilizing Namecoin.

## Objectives of Namecoin

Namecoin's engineers indicated several expected purposes and applications for this experimental token. Most importantly, the designers hope to safeguard free discourse rights online by making the web more resistant to restriction.

> Namecoin is a key/value pair registration and transfer system in light of Bitcoin technology. This means Namecoin can be utilized to record and transfer erratic names or keys in a secure fashion. It can likewise join data to these names.

There are horde ways that Namecoin endeavors to do this. For instance, it tends to be utilized to join recognizing data —, for example, email addresses, cryptocurrency public addresses, or specific keys — to different ways of not entirely set in stone by the client. It can likewise be utilized for of giving decentralized website certificate validation.

Namecoin can be utilized in Tor and other anonymizing web platforms to produce human-significant Tor .onion domains. Later on, the token and its underlying technology could likewise be utilized for file marks, getting voting procedures, notary services, and laying out proof of presence for people and elements.

On account of their connections with the Namecoin network, these names are challenging to edit or seize, meaning they are resistant to outside influence. Moreover, the creators of Namecoin indicate that queries don't produce network traffic. The consequence of this is that Namecoin offers further developed privacy abilities too.

## Features
- Namecoin endeavors to supplant existing domain name server technology with blockchain technology.
- Namecoin is a blockchain with a token forked initially from Bitcoin software, used to address ownership of a domain name.
- It was developed to decentralize the internet infrastructure, reduce control, and increase privacy and security.
## FAQ
### Is Namecoin an Altcoin?
The cryptocurrency community definition of an altcoin is one that isn't Bitcoin. Some remember Ethereum for the definition also, so Namecoin is an altcoin.
### What Is Namecoin Worth?
Namecoin's designers suggest that you don't buy NMC for investing or currency purposes as being utilized this way isn't expected. Notwithstanding, NMC has gone somewhere in the range of $.20 and $2.81 starting around 2017.
### Does Namecoin Still Exist?
Namecoin is as yet a substantial token. You can purchase NMC on a few decentralized exchanges, however the token is best utilized for its planned purpose.
