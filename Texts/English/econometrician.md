# Econometrician
## What Is Econometrician?

An econometrician is an individual who utilizes [statistics](/statistics) and mathematics to study, model, and foresee economic principles and outcomes. They depend on statistical and other quantitative measures and mathematical recipes to create objective outcomes in the study of economics.

## Figuring out Econometricians

An econometrician is a type of quantitative [economist](/economist) who coordinates statistics and mathematics into economic analysis.

Econometricians utilize highly particular math and statistics to create quantifiable outcomes. Individuals employed as econometricians commonly have advanced degrees in statistics and economics, albeit a few universities truly do offer specific degrees in econometrics. When employed at financial firms, for example, [hedge funds](/hedgefund) or [high-frequency trading](/high-frequency-trading) (HFT) shops, econometricians are known as "quants."

Interest for advanced data analysis capacities is energizing a boom for workers with econometrician skills. Past core data manipulation abilities, numerous econometricians are likewise knowledgeable in designing and sharing data-supported business and economic speculations. Those equipped for selling research-based thoughts that meet business objectives are in short supply.

## Econometrics

[Econometrics](/econometrics) is the application of statistical methods to economic data and is depicted as the branch of economics that expects to give empirical substance to economic principles. Statistical methods, for example, OLS [regression](/regression) are utilized to assess data sets. Econometricians practice the science of econometrics.

All the more definitively, it is the quantitative analysis of genuine economic peculiarities. Econometricians are those equipped for utilizing this developing assortment of social and data sciences.

The fundamental device for econometrics is the [multiple linear regression](/mlr) model. The econometric theory stresses statistical theory and mathematical statistics while investigating and controlling econometric methods. Econometricians try to find assessors that have positive statistical properties, including impartiality, proficiency, and consistency â€” various data sets will test an econometrician's experience in perceiving these common data management predispositions.

The super scholastic diaries that distribute research on econometrics are **Econometrica**, the **Journal of Econometrics**, the **Review of Economics and Statistics**, **Econometric Theory**, the **Journal of Applied Econometrics**, among various other industry and scholarly distributions.

Progressively, universities and industry professionals are anticipating that econometricians should accept their analysis the extra mile by giving it setting, which is more receptive for non-specialized disciplines. It's normal for econometricians to study data design too.

## Highlights
- Econometricians are quantitative economists prepared in statistical and mathematical methods.
- Econometricians investigate data sets to model outcomes or make expectations utilizing methods like linear regression.
- Econometricians might be employed at universities as scholarly economists or, more than likely work in financial firms, for example, investment banks or hedge funds, where they go by the term "quants."
