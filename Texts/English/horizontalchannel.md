# Horizontal Channel
## What Is a Horizontal Channel?

Horizontal channels are [trendlines](/trendline) that associate variable pivot highs and lows to show the price contained between the upper line of [resistance](/resistance) and lower line of [support](/support). A horizontal channel is otherwise called a price range or sideways trend.

## How a Horizontal Channel Works

A horizontal channel or sideways trend resembles a [rectangle](/rectangle) pattern. It comprises of somewhere around four contact points. This is on the grounds that it needs somewhere around two lows to interface, as well as two highs. Buying and selling pressure is equivalent, and the predominant course of price action is sideways. Horizontal channels form in periods of price consolidation.

Price is built out in a [trading range](/tradingrange) by the pivot highs (resistance) and pivot lows (support). Trend lines are drawn on pivots to give a visual image of price action. Another high in the price over the horizontal channel is a technical buy signal. A new low in price below the horizontal channel (or rectangle pattern) is a technical sell signal.

There are three types of channels: horizontal, ascending, and descending channels. Channels that are calculated up are called [ascending channels](/ascendingchannel). Channels that are calculated down are called [descending channels](/descendingchannel). Ascending and descending channels are likewise called trend channels in light of the fact that the price moves more predominantly in one course.

The horizontal channel is a natural chart pattern found on each time period. Buying and selling powers are comparative in a horizontal channel until a [breakout](/breakout) or [breakdown](/breakdown) happens. This type of channel joins several forms of [technical analysis](/technicalanalysis) to give traders exact points for entering and leaving trades, as well as controlling risk.

To distinguish horizontal channels:

1. Physically glance through charts to find channel patterns.
1. Use stock screeners, like Finviz.com, or a service that naturally perceives channel patterns.
1. Buy into a service that gives a daily rundown of chart patterns.

## Trading a Horizontal Channel

Horizontal channels give a reasonable and systematic method for trading by giving buy and sell points. Here are the trading rules for entering [long](/long) or [short](/short) positions.

- At the point when the price raises a ruckus around town of the channel, sell your existing long position or take a short position.
- At the point when the price is in the channel, sit idle assuming you have no trades open or hold onto your current trades.
- At the point when the price stirs things up around town of the channel, [cover](/shortcovering) your existing short position or take a long position.

## Horizontal Channel Example

Lift Credit, Inc. (ELVT) shares traded inside a horizontal channel since [gapping](/hole) lower on Oct. 30, 2018. Over this period, traders had the opportunity to short sell the stock at the channel's upper resistance line three times (red bolts).

Alternately, traders got the opportunity to buy the stock at the channel's lower support line on three events (green bolts). [Stop-loss orders](/stop-lossorder) would sit just over the channel's upper resistance line for short positions and just underneath the lower support line for long positions, while profits would be taken at the opposite side of the channel.
