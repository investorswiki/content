## What Is Hacktivism?

Hacktivism is a social or political activist act that is carried out by breaking into and unleashing devastation on a secure computer system. Hacktivism is a mix of "hacking" and "activism" and is said to have been instituted by the hacktivist group Cult of the Dead Cow.

## Grasping Hacktivism

Hacktivism is typically directed at corporate or government targets. Individuals or groups that carry out hacktivism are alluded to as hacktivists. Hacktivists' targets incorporate strict organizations, fear mongers, street pharmacists, and pedophiles.

An illustration of hacktivism is a [denial of service attack](/denial-service-attack-dos) (DoS) which closes down a system to prevent customer access. Different models include furnishing citizens with access to government-blue-penciled web pages or giving privacy-safeguarded means of communication to undermined groups, (for example, Syrians during the Arab Spring).

Hacktivists' methods might incorporate distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks, which flood a website or email address with such an excess of traffic that it briefly closes down; data theft; website ruination; computer infections and worms that spread protest messages; assuming control over social media accounts, and taking and unveiling [sensitive data](/personally-recognizable information-pii).

There is conflict inside the hacktivist community over which procedures are suitable and which are not. For instance, while hacktivists might claim supporting free discourse as an important reason, the utilization of DoS attacks, website ruinations, and data theft that impede or prevent free discourse might be in conflict with that goal.

The methods hacktivists use are unlawful and are a form of cybercrime. Yet they frequently are not prosecuted in light of the fact that they are rarely investigated by law enforcement. It very well may be difficult for law enforcement to recognize the hackers and damages that follow will generally be minor.

Hacktivist attacks themselves are not rough and don't put protestors at risk of physical mischief, not at all like participating in a street protest, yet hacktivism could prompt brutality at times.

Hacktivism likewise makes it conceivable to support geologically far off causes without going there and permits geologically distributed individuals with common goals to join together and act in support of a shared goal.

> Hacktivism might be utilized as a substitute for or supplement to traditional forms of activism, for example, demonstrations and protest walks. Possess Wall Street and the Church of Scientology protests included both the physical presence of supporters in the streets and online attacks.
