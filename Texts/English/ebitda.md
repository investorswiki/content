## What Is EBITDA?
EBITDA is the abbreviation for earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and [amortization](/amortization). As its name suggests, it is income before interest expenses, tax payments, and costs for depreciation, and amortization are deducted.
For companies that are highly leveraged (having much more debt than equity generally demonstrates that interest costs can be high), have a high corporate tax rate, and have costs tied to the weakening value of equipment and elusive assets, making sense of income on an EBITDA basis can be helpful in light of the fact that it bars expenses for interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization.
For certain companies that report low net income or a loss, executive management will say in their reports that profit was high or losses were smaller on an EBITDA basis to redirect the consequences of the primary concern. Like [EBIT](/ebit), EBITDA isn't a measure of standard under generally accepted accounting principles.
##
## Step by step instructions to Calculate EBITDA
EBITDA is calculated by adding costs for interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization to [net income](/netincome). These details can be found in a company's [income statement](/incomestatement), which is part of the financial statement recorded quarterly and every year with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Nonetheless, a few companies don't place costs tied to depreciation and amortization in the income statement and on second thought remember that detail for one more part of the financial statement.

EBITDA might be valuable for companies that have numerous organizations and have been around for quite a while. The Coca-Cola Company, which was founded in 1892, operates in numerous countries and has equipment and machinery that devalue in value as more up to date advancements are developed and adjusted. Furthermore, since the company has been in operation for over a century, it is probably going to hold a large number and brand names that have lost value due to obsolescence or lack of purpose. However, Coca-Cola does exclude depreciation and amortization in its income statement. All things being equal, those appear on its cash flow statement to account for depreciation and amortization on the value of its property, plants, and equipment.
A few companies that have opened up to the world beginning around 2010 or somewhere in the vicinity, however, put depreciation and amortization in their income statement and contend that on an EBITDA basis, their profit was high or their losses restricted. The ride-sharing app Uber Technologies makes characterizing EBITDA a stride further by making its own measure, the "Adjusted EBITDA," which incorporates adding back to its net loss such things as loss from equity method investments, stock-based compensation expense, and other income or expenses.
Below are table instances of Uber's quarterly income statement, and the clear calculation shows that EBITDA in the second from last quarter of 2021 was a loss of $1.997 billion. Yet, Uber's Adjusted EBITDA method shows a $8 million profit, which incorporates things not in the common EBITDA formula. Different expenses were the greatest factor in its Adjusted EBITDA calculation.
Uber's approach to EBITDA demonstrates the way that a company's executive management can utilize non-GAAP measures to clarify profitability for investors. Yet, regardless of what measure Uber uses to highlight or to convey profitability to investors, the income statement's primary concern figure shows a loss, moderated by a large expense outside its normal operations.
In any case, it's important to comprehend how each company deciphers EBITDA by perusing the notes remembered for the financial statement or press release. As Uber shows, the company remembers a more extensive scope of things for its Adjusted EBITDA calculation.
