Current raiders like to call themselves [activist investors](/activist-investor).

> Raiders target companies that are bungled, have over the top costs, could be run all the more profitably as a private company, or experience different issues that can be fixed to make it more significant.

These [private equity firms](/privateequity), hedge funds, and rich people purchase a sufficiently big share of a company's voting rights to influence its [board of directors](/boardofdirectors) (B of D) and put public pressure on its management to apply the changes they need. As a large portion of the companies they target are failing to meet expectations, raiders frequently prevail with regards to scrounging up support from different shareholders, too, expanding their influence and the probability that their requests to quickly fill investors' pockets will be met.

Game plans incorporate utilizing their voting power to introduce handpicked individuals to the B of D**,** situating the company for a sale or merger, or breaking up the target company and [selling off its assets](/asset-sales).

Consider a company with a market value of $100 million, no debt, and $25 million in real money; or a [enterprise value](/enterprisevalue) of $75 million. In the event that the market value of the company's [tangible assets](/tangibleasset) were $200 million, a raider may be enticed to mount a hostile bid to capture the gigantic gain that could be realized by selling off the assets.

One more approach sporadically used to make a quick buck is introducing debt-subsidized share buybacks. On the other hand, raiders might buy [outstanding shares](/outstandingshares) under the misrepresentation of pushing for changes that current leadership isn't managable to. By then, they can then offer to sell back those shares [at a premium](/at-a-premium) price to make money for themselves.

## History of Raiders

Raiders were especially common in the United States from the 1970s to the 1990s, before [publicly traded corporations](/publiccompany) adopted [takeover defenses](/against takeovermeasure).

Notwithstanding the proceeded with discussion that encompasses numerous raiders, in recent years their part in corporate America has been recast as a means to an end that fills in as a counterbalance to poor management at publicly-traded companies.
