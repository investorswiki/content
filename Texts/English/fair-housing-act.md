Landlords may not preclude tenants from making reasonable changes to a home or common use areas, without regard to the tenants, in the event that it is important for the disabled person to utilize the home. In any case, where it is reasonable, the landlord might expect that the tenant return the property to its condition when the renter moved in. Landlords may not decline to make reasonable facilities to rules, practices, policies, and services on the off chance that it is vital for the disabled person to utilize the housing. For instance, an outwardly impaired tenant must be permitted to keep an aide canine, no matter what the pet policy.
