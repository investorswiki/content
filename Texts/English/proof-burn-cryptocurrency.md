# Proof of Burn (Cryptocurrency)
## What Is a Proof of Burn for Cryptocurrency?

Proof of burn is one of the several [consensus mechanism](/consensus-mechanism-cryptocurrency) algorithms carried out by a [blockchain](/blockchain) network to guarantee that all participating hubs come to an agreement about the true and legitimate state of the blockchain network. This algorithm is carried out to stay away from the possibility of any cryptocurrency coin double-spending.

Proof of burn follows the principle of "burning" the coins held by the miners that grant them mining rights.

## Figuring out Proof Systems

The blockchain is the primary database of a [cryptocurrency](/cryptocurrency). It holds all transaction-related data on [blocks](/block-bitcoin-block) and those blocks act as the data storage units of the blockchain. A block is written just when the blockchain hubs settle on a set of transactions that the hubs consider legitimate.

Due to the autonomous and decentralized nature of the blockchain network, an automated mechanism is required to guarantee that the participating hubs settle on just legitimate transactions. This important task is performed by consensus-mechanism algorithms.

### Proof of Work

The most notable type of consensus-producing algorithms is called [proof of work](/proof-work) (POW). In a POW system, miners are rewarded for refreshing the blockchain. This involves utilizing computing power to tackle a mathematical equation and results in a monetary reward. Bitcoin, the original and most well known cryptocurrency, utilizes a POW system.

The more a miner pays for the computing equipment required to tackle the cryptographic riddle, the higher the chance that they will score the right to mine the blocks. Nonetheless, a POW approach requires expensive mining hardware gadgets, and this method is hampered by high power consumption.

Since the POW method is so asset escalated, it's not exceptionally efficient. Therefore, POW currencies, including Bitcoin, aren't exceptionally helpful as a fungible instrument.

### Proof of Stake

[Proof of stake](/proof-stake-pos) (POS) is another algorithm that apportions mining rights to miners proportional to their stakes held in the cryptocurrency.

In this system, the blockchain is kept up with by a haphazardly chosen group of validators who "stake" the native network tokens by getting them into the blockchain to create and support blocks.

Tragically, the more complex construction of POS systems makes them more powerless against assaults, and on the grounds that benefits flow progressively to the biggest coin holders, in a POS system, the more extravagant you are, the more extravagant you get.

### Proof of Burn

Proof of burn (POB) is an alternative consensus algorithm that attempts to address the high energy consumption issue of a POW system.

POB is much of the time called a POW system without energy squander. It works on the principle of permitting miners to "burn" virtual currency tokens. They are then, at that point, granted the right to compose blocks in relation to the coins burnt.

Iain Stewart, the innovator of the POB algorithm, utilizes a similarity to portray the algorithm: burnt coins resemble mining rigs. In this relationship, a miner burns their coins to buy a virtual mining rig that empowers them to mine blocks. The more coins burned by the miner, the greater their virtual mining "rig" will be.

To burn the coins, miners send them to a certainly un-spendable address. This cycle doesn't consume numerous resources (other than the burned coins) and guarantees that the network stays active and light-footed. Contingent on the implementation, miners are permitted to burn the native currency or the currency of an alternate chain, like Bitcoin. In exchange, they receive a reward in the native currency token of the blockchain.

You can convey transactions to the network that will burn your own cryptocurrency coins. Different participants can mine/burn on top of your block, and you can likewise take the transactions of different participants to add them to your block. Basically, all of this burning activity keeps the network lithe, and participants are rewarded for their activities (both burning their own coins and burning others' coins).

To forestall the possibility of unfair benefits for early adopters, the POB system has executed a mechanism that advances the periodic burning of cryptocurrency coins to keep up with mining power. The power of burnt coins "rots" or decreases to some extent each time another block is mined. This advances customary activity by the miners, rather than a one-time, early investment. To keep a competitive edge, miners may likewise have to periodically invest in better equipment as technology advances.

## Illustration of Proof of Burn

POB implementation can be modified. For instance, Slimcoin, a virtual currency network that utilizes POB, permits a miner to burn coins that not just gives them the right to seek the next block yet in addition allows them the opportunity to receive blocks during a more drawn out time period, for basically a year.

Basically, Slimcoin's POB implementation consolidates three algorithms: POW, POS, and the core POB concept. The method involved with burning coins uses POW; the more coins one burns the more chances one has to mine, subsequently guaranteeing POS; and the whole ecosystem follows the POB concept.

## Highlights
- Proof of burn is the third effort to make a system to dissuade fraudulent activity on a blockchain, while likewise working on the working of the blockchain as a device for transactions.
- Cryptocurrencies utilize several methods to approve the data stored on their blockchains, including a method called "proof of burn."
- Proof of work and proof of stake are likewise methods for forestalling fraudulent activity on a blockchain; proof of work is the system employed by the original and most famous cryptocurrency, Bitcoin.
