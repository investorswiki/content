## What Is an Excess Margin Deposit?

An excess margin deposit is the [collateral](/collateral) held in a margin account that is in excess of the base level required to keep up with that account's great standing. [Margin traders](/margin) who fail to keep up with excess margin deposits might wind up subject to [margin calls](/margincall).

## Understanding Excess Margin Deposits

In the United States, [Regulation T](/regulationt) of the [Federal Reserve](/federalreservebank) oversees the initial deposits important to lay out a margin trading account. Likewise, the [Financial Industry Regulatory Authority](/finra) (FINRA) is responsible for controlling margin maintenance requirements, which are the base levels of collateral required in margin accounts. The value of collateral in a margin trading account that surpasses these regulatory requirements is known as the account's excess margin deposit.

As indicated by Regulation T, a margin trader can borrow up to half of the purchase price of a stock, given that that stock is itself eligible for trading on margin. A few stocks, for example, securities with tiny [market capitalizations](/marketcapitalization), might be banished from margin trading by and large.

This half level is known as the [initial margin](/initialmargin). Nonetheless, individual [brokerage firms](/brokerage-organization) have the circumspection to change this rule gave their own standards are more rigid than those of Regulation T. For instance, a broker would be permitted to utilize 30% as their initial margin, however they wouldn't be permitted to utilize a more aggressive standard, for example, 70%.

When a stock has been purchased on margin, FINRA regulations expect that the collateral deposited in the margin account doesn't fall below 25% of the market value of the securities purchased. Here once more, brokerage firms have the flexibility to change their requirements as long as their standards are more rigid than those required by FINRA, for example, 35% rather than 25%.

## Illustration of an Excess Margin Deposit

To outline, consider a scenario wherein an investor purchases $20,000 worth of [securities](/security). To finance the purchase, the investor borrows $10,000 from their brokerage firm utilizing a margin trading account. To support this purchase, the investor deposits an extra $10,000 into the account to act as collateral.

Assuming the market value of the securities falls to $18,000, the equity in the investor's margin account would decline to $8,000 ($18,000 worth of stocks minus the $10,000 loan). In the event that the investor's brokerage firm has a maintenance requirement of 25%, the investor's account would have to have something like $4,500 of equity to stay on favorable terms (25% of $18,000). Since the $8,000 of equity is greater than the maintenance requirement of $4,500, the investor's margin account is still on favorable terms.

The excess margin deposit, in this case, is, thusly, $3,500 ($8,000 of equity minus the $4,500 maintenance requirement). Utilizing excess margin comes down to whether the excess margin is something you need to use for an alternate investment opportunity or leave it in the account in case the trade moves against you.

## The Bottom Line

- The initial margin least is half of the trade.
- The Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) controls margin requirements.
- In margin trading, the excess margin deposit is the difference between the current value of an account and its [minimum maintenance requirement](/maintenancemargin).
## FAQ
### Could Margin Trading Put You in Debt?
Margin can totally put you in debt and is one reason there is a separate endorsement process for those mentioning margin. Despite the fact that it is at last up to the brokerage how much margin they need to stretch out to an investor, the investor ought to be very wary while taking part in trades utilizing margin. Typically, a brokerage will liquidate your account before it goes negative (and you owe them an excess of the principal lost), however at times, similar to when there are enormous price swings or a trade is intensely margined and goes south, the brokerage can't act sufficiently fast to cover the loss. It's important to note that a brokerage charges exorbitant interest rates on margin loans.
### Who Pays Initial Margin?
The Federal Reserve Board's Regulation T specifies that the base percentage price of a security that must be covered with cash or collateral while utilizing a margin account is half. Individual brokerages can set margin requirements higher than the Fed's requirements, (for example, 70% or 80%) yet they can't be lower, for example, 10%. The initial margin is paid for by the account holder (the investor), not the brokerage.
### How Do I Calculate Excess Margin?
Excess margin is a simple calculation that happens once a trade's margin requirements have been met. It can vacillate in light of the price of the security (which influences the amount of margin required). See the above model for a careful clarification of how to compute excess margin.
### Might You at any point Pay Off Margin Loan Without Selling?
You can, yet the brokerage will generally liquidiate every one of your holdings to cover your margin loan on the off chance that you are in a margin call, as it is the fastest way for them to recover their percentage. Albeit the investor is "constrained" into selling at a troublesome time, it might actually be better for them long-term as it brings down the amount owed which thus brings down the amount of interest accrued while they pay off the margin loan.
### What Is Margin Excess or Deficit?
Margin excess is the amount of funds left over in the wake of setting a margin trade. This amount is derived from the amount the brokerage expects as margin, with the excess margin being the amount remaining. So in the event that a margin trade requires $1,000, and your account has $1,200, the margin excess would be $200.
