## What Is a Collar?

A collar, otherwise called a hedge covering or [risk-reversal](/riskreversal), is an options strategy executed to safeguard against large losses, however it likewise limits large gains.

An investor who is as of now long the underlying makes a collar by buying a [out-of-the-money](/outofthemoney) put option while at the same time composing an out-of-the-cash [call option](/calloption). The put safeguards the trader in case the price of the stock drops. Composing the call produces income (which in a perfect world ought to offset the cost of buying the put) and permits the trader to profit on the stock up to the [strike price](/strikeprice) of the call, yet not higher.

## Figuring out a Collar

An investor ought to think about executing a collar assuming that they are currently long a stock that has substantial unrealized gains. Furthermore, the investor could likewise think about it on the off chance that they are [bullish ](/bull)on the stock over the long term, yet are uncertain of shorter-term possibilities. To safeguard gains against a downside move in the stock, they can carry out the collar option strategy. An investor's most ideal situation is the point at which the underlying stock price is equivalent to the strike price of the written call option at expiry.

The protective collar strategy includes two strategies known as a protective put and covered call. A [protective put](/protective-put), or married put, includes being long a put option and long the underlying security. A [covered call](/coveredcall), or buy/compose, includes being long the underlying security and short a call option.

The purchase of an out-of-the-cash put option shields the trader from a possibly large descending move in the stock price while the composition (selling) of an out-of-the-cash call option creates premiums that, preferably, ought to offset the premiums paid to buy the put.

The call and put ought to be similar expiry month and similar number of contracts. The purchased put ought to have a strike price below the current market price of the stock. The written call ought to have a strike price over the current market price of the stock. The trade ought to be set up for pretty much nothing or zero out-of-pocket cost assuming the investor chooses the individual strike prices that are equidistant from the current price of the owned stock.

Since they will risk forfeiting gains on the stock over the covered call's strike price, this isn't a strategy for a very bullish on the stock. investor.

## Collar Break Even Point (BEP) and Profit Loss (P/L)

An investor's [breakeven point](/breakevenpoint) (BEP) on a collar strategy is the net of the premiums paid and received for the put and call deducted from or added to the purchase price of the underlying stock contingent upon whether there is a credit or debit. Net credit is the point at which the premiums received are greater than the premiums paid and net debit is the point at which the premiums paid are greater than the premiums received.

The maximum profit of a collar is equivalent to the call option's strike price less the underlying stock's purchase price per share. The cost of the options, whether for a net debit or credit, is then calculated in. The maximum loss is the purchase price of the underlying stock less the put option's strike price. The cost of the option is then considered in.

- Maximum Profit = (Call option strike price - Net of Put/Call premiums) - Stock purchase price
- Maximum Loss = Stock purchase price - (Put option strike price - Net of Put/Call premiums)

## Collar Example

Expect an investor is long 1,000 shares of stock ABC at a price of $80 per share, and the stock is currently trading at $87 per share. The investor needs to briefly hedge the position due to the increase in the overall market's volatility.

The investor purchases 10 put options (one option contract is 100 shares) with a strike price of $77 and a premium of $3.00 and composes 10 call options with a strike price of $97 with a premium of $4.50.

- Cost to execute collar (Buy $77 strike Put and compose $97 strike call) is a net credit of $1.50/share.
- Breakeven point = $80 + $1.50 = $81.50/share.

The maximum profit is $15,500, or 10 contracts x 100 shares x (($97 - $1.50) - $80). This scenario happens assuming the stock prices goes to $97 or above.

Alternately, the maximum loss is $4,500, or 10 x 100 x ($80 - ($77 - $1.50)). This scenario happens on the off chance that the stock price drops to $77 or below.
