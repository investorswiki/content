# Renko Chart
## What is a Renko Chart?

A Renko chart is a type of chart, developed by the Japanese, that is fabricated utilizing price movement instead of both price **and** normalized time spans like most charts are. Being named after the Japanese word for blocks, "renga," since the chart seems to be a series of bricks is thought. Another block is made when the price moves a predetermined price amount, and each block is positioned at a 45-degree point (up or down) to the prior block. An up block is regularly colored white or green, while a down block is commonly colored black or red.

## What Does a Renko Chart Tell You?

Renko charts are intended to filter out minor price movements to make it simpler for [traders ](/trader)to center around important trends. While this makes [trends](/trend) a lot more straightforward to spot, the downside is that a price information is lost due to simple block construction of Renko charts.

The most vital phase in building a Renko chart is choosing a **box size** that addresses the greatness of price movement. For instance, a [stock](/stock) may have a $0.25 box size or a currency might have a 50 [pip](/pip) box size. A Renko chart is then developed by putting a block in the next column once the price has outperformed the top or lower part of the previous block by the case size amount.

For the stock model, expect a stock is trading at $10 and has a $0.25 box size. In the event that the price climbs to $10.25, another block will be drawn. That block might be drawn once the price closes at $10.25 or higher. On the off chance that the price just reaches $10.24, another block won't be drawn. When a block is drawn it isn't erased. Assuming that the price ascends to $10.50 or higher (and closes there), another block will be drawn.

Renko blocks are not drawn adjacent to one another. Consequently, in the event that the stock drops back to $10.25 a down block isn't drawn next to the prior up box. The price would need to drop to $10 for a down block to show up below the prior up block.

While a fixed box size is common, ATR is likewise utilized. ATR is a measure of volatility, and in this way it changes after some time. Renko charts in light of ATR will involve the fluctuating ATR value as the container size.

Renko charts show a period pivot, yet the time spans are not fixed. One block to could require months to form, while several blocks might form soon. This shifts from [candlestick](/candlestick) or bar charts where another candle/bar forms at specific time stretches.

Expanding or decreasing the crate size will influence the "perfection" of the chart. Decreasing the container size will make more [swings](/swing), however will likewise highlight conceivable price reversals prior. A bigger box size will reduce the number of swings and noise yet will be slower to signal a price reversal.

Renko charts are effective in distinguishing [support](/support) and [resistance levels](/resistance) since there is significantly less noise than a candlestick chart. At the point when a strong trend forms, Renko traders might have the option to ride that trend for quite a while before even one block the other way forms.

Trading signals are ordinarily created when the heading of the trend changes and the blocks alternate tones. For instance, a trader could sell the asset when a red box shows up after a series of climbing white boxes. Likewise, in the event that the overall trend is up (heaps of white/green boxes) a trader might enter a long position when a white block happens after a couple of red boxes (a[ pullback](/pullback)).

## Illustration of How to Use Renko Charts
<!--1D097771E7014D61F1CC5B601FD79CD3-->
The chart shows a strong [uptrend](/uptrend) in a stock with a $2 box size. Boxes are drawn in view of closing prices, so highs and lows, as well as moves less than $2, are ignored. There is a short pullback, checked by a red box, however at that point the green boxes arise once more. Given the strong uptrend, this could be utilized as an opportunity to enter [long](/long). Consider an exit when another red (down) box forms.

After the uptrend, a strong [downtrend](/downtrend) forms. A comparative strategy could be utilized to enter [short](/short). Hang tight for a pullback set apart by the green (up) box. At the point when a red (down) block forms, enter a short position, as the price could be going lower again in arrangement with the longer-term downtrend. Exit when up block happens.

These are sample rules. A few traders might wish to see at least two blocks in a specific bearing before choosing to enter or exit.

## The Difference Between Renko Charts and Heikin Ashi Charts

Heikin Ashi charts, likewise developed in Japan, can have a comparable focus on Renko charts in that both show supported periods of up or down boxes that highlight the trend. While Renko charts utilize a fixed box amount, Heikin Ashi charts are taking an average of the open, high, low, and close for the current and prior time span. Consequently, the size of each case or candle is an alternate size and mirrors the average price. Heikin Ashi charts are valuable for highlighting trends similarly that Renko charts are.

## Limitations of Using Renko Charts

Renko charts don't show as much detail as candlestick or [bar charts](/barchart) given their lack of dependence on time. A stock that has been [ranging](/rangeboundtrading) for a long period of time might be addressed with a single box, which doesn't convey all that happened during that time. This might be beneficial for certain traders, yet for nobody else.

Highs and lows are likewise ignored, just closing prices are utilized. This leaves out a ton of price data since high and low prices can shift significantly from closing prices. The utilization of just closing prices will reduce the amount of noise, yet it likewise means the price could break fundamentally before a new box(es) forms and cautions the trader. By then it very well may be too late to get out with a manageable loss. Along these lines, while utilizing Renko charts, traders frequently still use stop loss orders at fixed prices, and will not depend exclusively on Renko signals.

Since this type of chart was intended to follow the general price trend of an asset, there can frequently be [false signals](/false-signal) where the shade of the blocks changes too early, delivering a [whipsaw](/whipsaw) effect. For this reason it's important to utilize Renko charts related to different forms of technical analysis.

## Highlights
- Renko charts commonly just use [closing prices](/closingprice) in light of the chart time period picked. For instance, on the off chance that utilizing a week by week time span, week by week closing prices will be utilized to develop the blocks.
- Renko charts have a period pivot, yet the time scale isn't fixed. A few blocks might take more time to form than others, contingent upon how long it requires for the price to move the required box size.
- A block can be any price size, such a $0.10, $0.50, $5, etc. This is called the container size. Box size can likewise be founded on the [Average True Range](/atr) (ATR).
- Renko charts filter out [noise](/noise) and assist traders with all the more plainly seeing the trend, since all movements that are more modest than the case size are filtered out.
- Renko charts are made out of blocks that are made at 45-degree angles to each other. Successive blocks don't happen next to one another.
