Market participants can take advantage of a sideways market by expecting breakouts, either above or below the [trading range](/tradingrange), or by endeavoring to profit as price moves among support and resistance inside the sideways drift. Traders who utilize a range-bound strategy ought to ensure the sideways market is sufficiently wide to set a gamble reward ratio of no less than 2:1 — this means that for each dollar gambled, investors create two dollars of gain.

Numerous traders center around recognizing horizontal price channels that contain a sideways trend. In the event that the price has routinely rebounded from support and resistance levels, traders might try to buy the security when the price is approaching support levels and sell when the price is approaching resistance levels.

As the options' expiration date draws near, the option premiums are disintegrated by [time decay](/timedecay) — and at last in the event that the market stays sideways will decay to zero. Nonetheless, it's important to note that these options might lose the entirety of their value if the stock moves past these bounds, making the strategies less secure than buying and selling stock.
