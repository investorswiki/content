## What Is a Dividend ETF?

A dividend ETF is a [exchange-traded fund](/etf) (ETF) intended to invest in a basket of dividend-paying stocks. The fund manager will pick a portfolio of stocks, in light of a dividend index, that pays out [dividends](/dividend) to investors, in this way working as a [income-investing](/incomestock) strategy for people that purchase the ETF.

## Figuring out a Dividend ETF

Dividend ETFs are laid out to gain high yields while investing in high-dividend-paying common stocks, preferred stocks, or [real estate investment trusts](/reit) (REIT). Dividend ETFs might contain just U.S. domestic stocks, or they might be global dividend ETFs, which have an international concentration.

Most indexes used to make the dividend ETFs hold stocks with above-market dividend yields and a higher than average level of liquidity. These will shift, in any case, in light of the ETFs that a fund manager picks and their specific investment approach.

Dividend ETFs are inactively managed, meaning they track a specific index, yet the index is normally screened quantitatively to incorporate companies with a strong history of dividend increments as well as the greater [blue-chip](/bluechip) firms that are generally considered to carry less risk.

A dividend ETF's [expense ratio](/expenseratio) ought to be lower or equivalent to the least costly, no-load mutual fund. [No-load mutual funds](/no-loadfund), by definition, can be bought or reclaimed after a certain timeframe without a commission or sales charge. Dividend ETFs are generally suggested for the generally risk-unwilling stock investor who is income-chasing.

Investors can likewise [sell short](/shortselling), [buy on margin](/buying-on-margin), and purchase just one share, as ETFs have no base deposit requirements. Besides, expense ratios are lower than those of the average mutual fund for most ETFs.

The fundamental explanation investors purchase ETFs is that they are not difficult to buy and sell like stocks, they offer [diversification](/diversification), broad market exposure, and they have low costs due to their low expense ratios.

[Index ETFs](/index-etf) track a benchmark index like the S&P 500 as closely as could really be expected. Investors can buy and sell index ETFs over the course of the day on a major exchange, and investors gain exposure to various protections in a single exchange. Contingent upon which index the ETF tracks, index ETFs can incorporate both U.S. furthermore, foreign markets, specific sectors, or different asset classes, like little covers or blue-chips.

At long last, a [ETF of ETFs](/etf-of-etfs) tracks different ETFs rather than an underlying stock or index. An ETF of ETFs allows for more diversification than different ETFs.
