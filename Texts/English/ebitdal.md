# Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, Amortization, Losses (EBITDAL)
## What Is Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, Amortization, and Special Losses (EBITDAL)?

Earnings before interest, taxation, depreciation, amortization, and special losses is a non-[GAAP](/gaap) measure of a firm's income that considers special losses that the firm doesn't anticipate happening consistently. EBITDAL is a variation on the more commonly utilized EBITDA, which is basically an alternative calculation of net income.

## Figuring out Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, Amortization, and Special Losses (EBITDAL)

Earnings before interest, taxation, depreciation, amortization, and special losses (EBITDAL) is a variation of EBITDA, a commonly utilized non-[GAAP](/gaap) accounting measure that many companies use as a proxy for [net income](/netincome). EBITDAL is basically equivalent to net income with interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization, and losses added once again into income. Every one of these figures is expected to act as an indication of a firm's profitability and ought not be mistaken for the company's cash flows.

The deductions calculated into EBITDAL can be gathered into three categories of [operating costs](/working cost) plus one set of non-repeating costs. First are the financing costs which are manifest in interest payments. The subsequent category catches accounting decisions made by the company, which are reflected in taxes.

At last, EBITDAL factors non-cash expenses associated with the aging of equipment and different assets. These show up as depreciation and [amortization](/amortization) in a firm's financial reporting. One extra cost separates EBITDAL from its more normal partner, EBITDA. This is the special loss cost, which firms use to portray a non-repeating expense that they feel makes sense of a curiously poor set of financial outcomes.

## Special Losses in EBITDAL

Since EBITDAL isn't a GAAP measure, the special losses calculated into this figure are not defined by the [Financial Accounting Standards Board](/fasb) (FASB). The nearest that FASB comes to portraying these losses are the extraordinary and non-repeating things that the board permits firms to remember for their income statements.

The differentiation among extraordinary and non-repeating things can be a bit muddled in practice, and FASB rules require just that the two be reported diversely for tax purposes. In effect, they fill similar need as special losses. They are treated as sporadic expenses that [analysts](/expert) shouldn't anticipate repeating in future reporting periods and ought not be considered while projecting future earnings.

Special losses can go from the physical destruction created by a natural disaster to accounting losses brought on by a terrible investment or startling retirement of an asset. A firm that loses a uninsured plant due to a catastrophic flood can generally claim that loss as a [special item](/special-thing). It could likewise remember the costs of a lost claim for this category. A less substantial form of special loss could be a one-time write-down of a firm's [goodwill](/goodwill) due to some unanticipated negative event.
