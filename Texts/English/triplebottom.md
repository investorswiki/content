# Triple Bottom
## What is a Triple Bottom?

A triple base is a bullish [chart pattern](/pattern) utilized in technical analysis that is portrayed by three equivalent lows followed by a [breakout](/breakout) over the resistance level.

## What Does a Triple Bottom Tell You?

The triple base chart pattern ordinarily follows a delayed downtrend where bears are in control of the market. While the main base could essentially be normal price movement, the subsequent base is indicative of the bulls picking up speed and planning for a potential [reversal](/reversal). The third base demonstrates that there's strong support in place and bears may [capitulate](/capitulation) when the price breaks through [resistance levels](/resistance).

There are a couple of rules that are normally used to qualify triple bottoms:

1. There ought to be an existing [downtrend](/downtrend) in place before the pattern happens.
1. The three lows ought to be generally equivalent in price and scattered from one another. While the price doesn't need to be precisely equivalent, it ought to be sensibly close to a similar price, with the end goal that a [trendline](/trendline) is horizontal.
1. The [volume](/volume) ought to drop all through the pattern in a sign that bears are losing strength, while bullish volume ought to increase as the price breaks through the last resistance.

## Instructions to Trade a Triple Bottom

The price target for a double base reversal is ordinarily the distance between the lows and the breakout point added to the breakout point. For instance, in the event that the low is $10.00 and the breakout is at $12.00, the price target would be (12 - 10 = 2 + 12 = 14) $14.00. [Stop-loss](/stop-lossorder) points are typically placed just below the breakout point or potentially below the triple base lows.

The triple base is like the [double bottom](/doublebottom) chart pattern and may likewise look like [ascending](/ascendingtriangle) or [descending triangles](/descendingtriangle). Traders generally search for confirmation of a triple base utilizing other technical indicators or chart patterns. For instance, traders could note that the stock has an oversold [relative strength index (RSI)](/rsi) before a double base forms as well as search for a breakout to affirm that it's a triple base as opposed to a descending triangle or other bearish pattern.

## An Example of a Triple Bottom

The following chart shows an illustration of a triple base chart pattern.

In this model, Momenta Pharmaceuticals' stock shaped a triple base and broke out from trend line resistance. The difference between the third base and the breakout point was about $1.75, which meant a [take-profit](/take-profitorder) point of around $15.50 on the upside. The stop-loss point might have been placed at around $13.50 to limit [downside risk](/downsiderisk) also.

## The Difference Between a Triple Bottom and a Triple Top

The triple top is the contrary pattern of a triple base. Rather than a bullish reversal, a triple top is a bearish reversal pattern where price action knocks off resistance three times, posting three generally equivalent highs before diving down through resistance. All things considered, these are basically mirror patterns of a similar market phenomenon - a drawn out fight for control between the bears and bulls where one side arises successful. On the off chance that no champ arises, a triple base or top will basically turn into a more extended term [range](/range).

## Limitations of a Triple Bottom

There is in every case some vulnerability while trading charting patterns as you are working with likelihood. Likewise with most patterns, the triple base is simplest to perceive once the trading opportunity has passed. Double bottoms might fail and turn into a triple base, and the triple base and the [head and shoulders pattern](/head-shoulders) can, by definition, be indeed the very same. In any case, the most frequently refered to limitation of a triple base is essentially that it's anything but a great risk and reward tradeoff due to the placement of the target and stop loss. To increase the profit potential, traders might decide to put their stop loss inside the pattern and trail it up as the breakout happens. The issue with this is the probability of being stopped out in the reach for a small loss is higher.
