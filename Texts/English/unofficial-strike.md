# Unofficial Strike
## What Is an Unofficial Strike?

An unofficial strike is a work stoppage by [union](/labor-union) individuals that isn't embraced by the union and that doesn't follow the legal requirements for striking. Workers engaging in unofficial strikes have minimal legal recourse in the event that they are fired and don't receive strike pay. An unofficial strike is likewise called a wildcat strike or an unofficial industrial action.

## Understanding an Unofficial Strike

In the United States, an unofficial strike is illegal under the 1935 National Labor Relations Act (NLRA), and courts have held that employers are qualified for fire employees who engage in them.

Nonetheless, U.S. workers are qualified for request that the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) terminate their relationship with their labor union on the off chance that they feel that said union doesn't address their interests. At the point when workers do this, any strike action they might undertake a while later is technically unofficial however not illegal as terminating the relationship with the labor union eliminates the conflict between segments 7 and 9(a) of the NLRA.

## Reasons for an Unofficial Strike

Unofficial strikes happen when workers avoid their own union and make a move on their own initiative. This could happen in light of incidents or conditions that excite such immediate annoyance that the workers react before the normal channels of union action can swing into operation.

On the other hand, workers might make a strike move in resistance to union leadership on the off chance that they accept the union is failing to address their interests or has been co-selected either by management or outside components. Or on the other hand, essentially, on the off chance that the union disagrees with the demand of the employees and will not support them in their actions to cure what they see to be unjust [wages](/wage-cost) or [practices](/fair-labor-guidelines act-flsa).

For businesses, unofficial strikes can be particularly disruptive in light of the fact that they frequently happen all of a sudden; as opposed to as a to some degree expected step in a regulated course of labor-management relations managed under the NLRA and other existing laws. An unannounced strike can have immediate, serious ramifications for the target business, related businesses, and customers, particularly in the modern age of [just-in-time](/jit) (JIT) [supply chains](/supplychain).

Due to their inherently extralegal nature and the sometimes unstable emotional factors involved, unofficial strikes may likewise involve an increased risk of viciousness and property destruction directed toward the business, managers, and non-striking workers.

## Genuine Examples of Unofficial Strikes

A prominent unofficial strike was that of West Virginia teachers, who in 2018 wouldn't return to study halls until their demands for higher wages and more liberal healthcare benefits were met. This strike began as an official strike, yet since it failed to maintain the support of union leadership, later advanced into an unofficial strike. Despite being unofficial, the strike was fruitful and inspired other unofficial teachers' strikes in Kentucky, Oklahoma, and Arizona.

A few other outstanding wildcat strikes got going as unofficial strikes yet later gained the support of union leadership and became official. Models include the Baltimore municipal strike of 1974, in which municipal workers initiated a strike action for better working conditions and higher wages, and the Memphis sterilization strike of 1968, in which black disinfection workers in the isolation period city battled for better pay and more secure working conditions. Due to the racial factors at play in the Memphis strike, it turned into a part of the [Civil Rights](/civil-rights-act-1964) movement, drawing the consideration of black community leaders like Martin Luther King, Jr.

On an international level, quite possibly of the most popular unofficial strike happened in France. In May 1968, unofficial strike actions spread across the whole nation, causing the French president, Charles de Gaulle, to escape the country momentarily and bringing the [economy](/economy) and government to a halt. This was the main unofficial strike to influence a whole nation.
