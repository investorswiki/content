## What Is a Deposit Slip?

A deposit slip is a small paper form that a bank customer includes while depositing funds into a bank account. A deposit slip, by definition, contains the date, the name of the depositor, the depositor's [account number](/account-number), and the amounts being deposited.

## How Deposit Slips Work

After entering a bank, a customer can normally find a pile of deposit slips with designated spaces to fill in the required information to complete the deposit. The customer is required to finish up the deposit slip before moving toward the bank teller to deposit [funds](/fundsoffunds).

In the event that the customer utilizes a [deposit slip](/banking-and-protections industry-council fundamental) in the bank, the account number should be written at the lower part of the slip where indicated. The deposit slip informs the teller which bank account number to which the funds ought to be credited.

The slip likewise breaks down whether the deposit is included checks, cash, or on the other hand in the event that the depositor needs a specific amount of cash back from a check deposit. The bank agent commonly checks the funds received for the deposit against the amounts listed on the deposit slip to guarantee they match. The teller processes the slip alongside the things in the deposit and prints a receipt for the customer.

Also, deposit slips are much of the time included toward the rear of [checkbooks](/checkbook), which have the customer's account number and the bank routing number pre-imprinted on them.

## Benefits of Deposit Slips

Deposit slips offer protection to both the bank and the customer. Banks use them to assist with keeping a written ledger of funds deposited over the course of the day and to guarantee that no deposits are unaccounted for toward the finish of the business day.

For bank customers, a deposit slip fills in as a de facto receipt that the bank appropriately accounted for the funds and deposited the right amount and into the right account. On the off chance that the customer later checks the [account balance](/banking-and-protections industry-board essential) and finds the deposit was not counted accurately, the deposit slip fills in as proof that the bank recognized getting the funds from the customer.

Albeit the deposit receipt demonstrates the deposit was made, the receipt just shows the total of the deposit. Assuming there's a dispute with the bank, customers can request a copy of their deposit including the deposit slip to show the itemized amounts that made up the total deposit.

## Special Considerations

Deposit slips are turning into a relic of times gone by as banks have started eliminating deposit slips from their branches for new technology. Most banks don't need deposit slips for ATM deposits since the computer can peruse the check or count the cash and electronically credit the account associated with the ATM card.

ATM deposit receipts are accessible before finishing the deposit including receipts that contain pictures of the checks being deposited. Smartphone technology has advanced in that banks are offering applications that empower customers to examine paper checks as opposed to depositing them through a bank teller or ATM.
