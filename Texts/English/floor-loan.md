## What Is a Floor Loan?

A floor loan is a specific sort of loan planned specifically for real estate construction projects. Floor loans apply to structures that will be [occupied by tenants](/non-owner_occupied). The floor loan is the base amount that a lender consents to advance to empower the developer to initiate the development of a commercial property.

## How a Floor Loan Works

A floor loan doesn't function like a traditional loan or a [traditional mortgage, ](/mortgage)in which the borrower gets the funds completely in one lump sum. All things being equal, the floor loan is the partial amount of a bigger loan â€” the sum that the borrower and manufacturer need to really start the construction project.

The remainder of the loan, called the "holdback," is paid after the developer arrives at certain stages in the project that are settled on by the lender. For instance, a bank might consent to advance 70% of the total project cost, with the balance of 30% to be released upon the project achieving certain milestones. These milestones commonly incorporate an effective sale or lease of the majority of the project's units, getting a [occupancy permit](/use-and-occupancy-uo), and so forth.

Borrowers who fail to meet the requirements for the holdback could need to secure a [bridge loan ](/bridgeloan)or another form of gap financing or [mezzanine financing](/mezzaninefinancing) in the interim, which can be very costly: These loans are handled rapidly, however have extremely short terms and high interest rates.

## Floor Loans versus Construction Loans

The floor loan is many times the principal stage of a bigger construction loan or mortgage. A construction loan is a [short-term loan ](/shortterm)(a loan whose term is a year or less) used to finance the real estate project. The manufacturer takes out a construction loan to cover the costs of the project before getting long-term funding. Since they are considered decently [risky](/risk), construction loans as a rule carry higher interest rates than traditional mortgages do.

Home-purchasers who custom-form their own residence can take out [construction loans](/construction-loan), yet they can't opt for a floor loan as part of the cycle. Floor loans are just a part of construction loans for inhabitant occupied structures, not proprietor occupied ones. An individual homeowner can, be that as it may, refinance the construction loan into a permanent, longer-term mortgage, or just can take out another loan to pay off the construction loan.

On account of a real estate project that is a commercial piece of property (retail centers, office edifices, inns, and non-proprietor occupied apartment structures), the developer can fund the project with a construction loan and afterward take out a [commercial real estate loan](/commercial-real-estate-loan) to pay it off. (A commercial real estate loan is a specific sort of mortgage loan secured by a lien on commercial, instead of residential, property. In that capacity, it is inaccessible to individual home builders.)

Commercial real estate loans will generally have longer terms than construction loans, going from five to 20 years.
