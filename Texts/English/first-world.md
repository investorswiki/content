There can be a propensity toward involving the phrase as a method for ranking a few nations above others in terms of geopolitical significance.

## An Antiquated Model

There is a contention to be made that the model of sharing nations into first, second, or third worlds addresses an obsolete and outdated point of view.

Since the finish of the Cold War, the United States has turned into the world's just superpower and a rising number of countries have embraced or are currently taking on American-style a majority rules government and capitalism. These countries are neither horrifyingly poor nor really rich; rule of law and a vote based system are their characterizing features. Accordingly, it would be strange to portray them with the derogatory term of "third world" countries. Instances of these types of countries incorporate Brazil and India.

The original definition of "first world" as a country not lined up with the United States has likewise prompted a few odd orders of very prosperous and advanced nations. Oil-rich Saudi Arabia, which has a higher [per capita income](/income-per-capita) than first-world country Turkey, is still frequently technically opened as a second-or underdeveloped country, for instance — or if nothing else, denied the first-world designation.

Then there is the rising problem of wealth inequality. The high per-capital income associated with the main world frequently misrepresents an extremely uneven distribution of wealth in these nations. Several first-world countries have [poverty](/poverty)- stricken locales, where conditions are comparable to those in agricultural nations. For instance, occupants of Appalachia and other rural areas of the United States frequently lack resources and essentials for a base standard of living. Even certain segments of large urban areas, for example, the South Side of Chicago or northern Milwaukee's 53206 area, feature ruined conditions.
