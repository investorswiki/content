# Goods-in-Process
## What Is Goods-in-Process?

Goods-in-process is part of a [inventory](/inventory) account on the [balance sheet](/balancesheet) of a manufacturing company. It connects with partially completed goods that are some place in the manufacturing process and not yet ready available to be purchased.

Goods-in-process is otherwise called "work-in-process" or "[work-in-progress](/workinprogress)."

## Understanding Goods-in-Process

Not at all like a few different companies, manufacturers genuinely produce their inventory, sourcing [raw materials](/rawmaterials), and afterward moving them into production or assembly mode until they are completed and ready to sell to customers.

[Accounting rules](/accounting-standard) demand a breakdown of this process, requiring these companies to keep separate accounts for the goods they stock as they enter each stage of production.

Goods-in-process is one of three manufacturing inventory orders and can be described as an intermediate state between the other two: raw materials and finished goods. Inventory, a [current asset](/currentassets) on the company's balance sheet, is the total of the three states of production.

The mathematical accounting for goods-in-process toward the finish of any period is the beginning balance of good-in-process, plus the value of raw materials moved into the account, minus the ending balance of goods-in-process. Included in this account are costs of direct labor and material, as well as an allocation of manufacturing [overhead](/overhead).

> Goods-in-process uncovers the raw materials, labor, and overhead costs incurred for products that are at different stages of the production process.

When production of these goods is completed, they are moved to the finished inventory account and afterward, on, registered as [cost of goods sold](/cogs) (COGS). Normally, the goods-in-process sub-account conveys the littlest amount among the three inventory characterizations assuming that the company participates in high production volumes of anything it makes.

## Illustration of Goods-in-Process

Deere and Company (DE), a manufacturer of farming, snow removal, grass mowing, and construction equipment, purchases raw materials, mainly consisting of steel products, steel, and iron castings, forgings, plastics, gadgets, and ready-to-collect components, consistently. When these materials are transported in, factory floor machinists and assembly line workers begin to manufacture equipment out of them to sell to the company's customers.

When work commences on the raw materials, they are moved to the goods-in-process account. That remains the case until the materials are changed into the completed thing, at which point they are then gotten across to the finished goods account.

For its 2018 [fiscal year](/fiscalyear) (FY), Deere and Co. recorded an inventory value of $6.1 billion. In the [note to its financial statements](/footnote), this figure was broken down into $2.2 billion in raw materials and supplies, $0.8 billion in goods-in-process, or work-in-process, and $4.8 billion in finished goods and parts.

After a $1.6 billion adjustment to "[last-in, first-out](/lifo)" (LIFO) value, the inventory account totaled $6.1 billion. Note that the goods-in-process sub-account is a minor part of the total.

## Benefits of Goods-in-Process

Changes in goods-in-process can perceive us a great deal about how a company is faring. An uptick could indicate a race to the factory floor to take special care of an increase in [demand](/demand) for the company's products. That is generally a good omen for [shareholders](/shareholder), and when widespread, the overall economy.

Decreases are generally seen less well. What they will generally signal is a slowdown in production, reflecting weakening demand.

## Special Considerations

Investors ought to try to determine how a company measures goods-in-process and other inventory accounts. [Accountants](/accountant) once in a while utilize different calculation strategies, so goods-in-process are not generally comparable across companies.

## Highlights
- In the event that a company takes part in high production volumes of anything it makes, the goods-in-process sub-account ought to carry the littlest amount.
- When production commences on the raw materials, they are moved to the goods-in-process account. Then, at that point, when the work is complete and the thing is ready to be sold, they show up in the finished goods account.
- Goods-in-process is the cost of unfinished goods in the manufacturing process, including labor, raw materials, and overhead.
- It shows up as a current asset on a company's balance sheet alongside the other two manufacturing inventory groupings: raw materials and finished goods.
