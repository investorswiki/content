# Least Finance Charge
## Least Finance Charge: An Overview

A base finance charge is a month to month credit card fee that a consumer might be charged assuming the accrued balance on the card is low to the point that an interest charge under the base would somehow be owed for that billing cycle.

Most credit cards have a base finance charge of $1. Hence, the base finance charge possibly kicks in when a borrower conveys a tiny outstanding balance.

## Least Finance Charge Explained

The base finance charge is, straightforwardly, the least of a credit card client's interests. A credit card might accompany any or the following fees as a whole: an annual fee, fees for late payments, balance transfer fees, over-limit fees, cash advance fees, and foreign transaction fees.

With the exception of an annual fee, the above fees are all charged at per-utilization rates laid out by the company. In this way, no base charge is forced.

Also, of course, there are finance charges on the balance due on the card. As of mid-2020, interest rates on credit card balances range from 13.99% to 25.99%. The average is around 19% for another offer. The rate another customer is charged depends on the individual's credit history and may be increased later for any of different reasons (however the new rate can be charged exclusively to balances on new purchases, not outstanding balances.)

### Peruse the User's Agreement

Not all companies charge every one of the fees listed previously. In any case, on the off chance that a company flaunts in its advertising about its lack of one fee, like an annual fee, look nearer. The loss might be offset by different fees.

The base finance charge and any remaining fees and charges will be nitty gritty in the consumer's [credit agreement](/creditagreement).

Borrowers who don't carry a balance from one month to another on their credit cards don't need to worry about finance charges. Notwithstanding, most borrowers carry a balance, at any rate a portion of the time, and ought to closely follow the charges that they are causing.

The base finance charge is typically irrelevant, as the charges will quite often surpass the base.

### Illustration of Interest Fee Hit

For instance, consider a credit card client who pays a 20% annual [interest rate](/interestrate). Assuming that the charges are calculated month to month, the month to month rate would be 1.67%. This borrower would pay more than the month to month $1 least fee in the event that the balance was $60 or more toward the finish of the month to month billing cycle.

Albeit most cards have a month to month least finance charge, cards offered with an early on rate frequently defer this fee until the starting rate terminates.
