# Nasdaq Stock Exchange
## What Is the Nasdaq Stock Market?
The Nasdaq Stock Market (or Nasdaq Exchange) is the world's second-largest [centralized equity marketplace](/stock-exchange) after the [New York Stock Exchange (NYSE)](/nyse).
Appeared in February of 1971, the Nasdaq was the primary all-electronic stock exchange. All along, it didn't utilize a physical trading floor, rather selecting a transparent and expedient electronic trading system that diminished both bid-ask spreads and trading costs.
As the Nasdaq filled in prominence, it become the accepted home for technology-based growth companies in the U.S. This is partially due to the exchange's listing costs, which are lower than those of the NYSE and subsequently interesting to new or extending companies that need to allocate however much cash as could be expected to growth.
Today, the exchange is home to a large number of the world's most popular technology companies, including Apple, Meta (Facebook), Alphabet (Google), and Amazon.
## Is the Nasdaq a Dealer Exchange or an Auction Exchange?
Not at all like the NYSE, which works as an auction exchange, the Nasdaq works as a dealer exchange. This means that many market makers furnish liquidity in competition with each other.
Market makers do this by posting two prices for some random security at some random time — one at which they will buy the security and one at which they will sell it. By buying and selling at the same time, these market makers collect profit by means of the bid-ask spread for every security they trade. For example, in the event that a market maker bought a share of Stock A for $10 and sold a share of Stock A for $10.03, the bid-ask spread of $0.03 would comprise its profit.
In a dealer market, investors use brokers (the vast majority of which are electronic) to find the least asks for stocks they need to buy and the highest bids for stocks they need to sell. Market makers, overwhelmingly of securities and being willing to buy or sell them at some random time, furnish dealer markets with the truly necessary [liquidity](/liquidity) that allows individual investors to make trades rapidly at current market prices.
## Nasdaq Exchange versus Nasdaq Composite: What's the Difference?
At the point when you hear somebody examining the Nasdaq, they might be discussing one of two things — the Nasdaq exchange, which is the subject of this article, or the [Nasdaq Composite](/nasdaqcompositeindex), which is a [stock index](/marketindex). Not at all like an exchange, which is a genuine marketplace for the trading of equities and other [securities](/security), a stock index is essentially a hypothetical portfolio that investors use as a benchmark to measure market performance.
The Nasdaq composite is a stock index that endeavors to follow the performance of all of the stocks that trade on the Nasdaq exchange. These companies are weighted by [market capitalization](/capitalization), so those worth more (as estimated by the current value of all [outstanding shares](/outstandingshares)) influence the price of the composite more than those worth less.
The Nasdaq Composite is a well known benchmark for the U.S. stock market, yet it just remembers companies that trade for the Nasdaq exchange. Be that as it may, different indexes, similar to the [Wilshire 5,000](/wilshire5000equityindex), endeavor to incorporate all publicly traded U.S. companies, remembering those that trade for the NYSE. These "all out market" indexes might be better benchmarks for the American equity market on the loose than the Nasdaq Composite.
