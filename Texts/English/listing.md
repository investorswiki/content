# Listing
At the point when an exchange offers trading pairs for a specific asset, this action is known as "listing" the asset. In traditional markets, this means that a companies shares (or material asset) are available to be traded on that specific stock exchange. By and large, this means that the company being listed has passed certain thresholds for financial and regulatory practicality notwithstanding a degree of trust from the exchange. Consequently, by the act of listing, the exchange is signaling that the shares of company/asset are known to be of a base threshold of quality.
For cryptocurrency exchanges, a comparative articulation of trust in a project and its associated digital asset is communicated when an asset is listed with a trading pair with either Bitcoin (BTC) or one of the other major exchange pairs (counting BNB, Ethereum (ETH) or Ripple (XRP). It is likewise an indication that there is adequate liquidity in the associated trading pair to have the option to form an accurate price discovery.
