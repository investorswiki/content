# Breaking The Syndicate
## DEFINITION of Breaking The Syndicate

The term "breaking the syndicate" or "breaking syndicate" alludes to the disintegration of a group of investment bankers that made a syndicate to endorse - - or price, market and sell - - the issue of a specific security. Prior to termination of the agreement, the underwriters must sell the securities at the [offering price](/offeringprice). The syndicate generally terminates 30 days after the sale date, however can be broken before upon mutual agreement of the participants.

## BREAKING DOWN Breaking The Syndicate

[Syndicates](/syndicate) are typically broken for one of two reasons: 1) the issue has been effectively dispersed; or 2) the [underwriters](/underwriter) can't place the securities at the offer price. Assuming that the syndication is disintegrated prior to 30 days following the security sale date, group members are free to sell remaining holdings independent of original price limitations. The breaking of a syndicate likewise leaves underwriters free to trade securities on the secondary market.

## Underwriting Syndicates

At the point when a specific securities issue is too large for a single underwriter to make due, a group of underwriters will briefly meet up to form a syndicate. This is on the grounds that underwriters are normally required to buy the shares or equity from the responsible company to sell them to investors. Underwriting syndicates are ordinarily used to work with the bringing of [initial public offerings](/ipo) (IPOs) to market.

Syndicates benefit all concerned on the grounds that they permit companies to carry large issues of stock to the market while permitting investment banks to relieve their own risk in underwriting the issue by sharing that risk with different institutions. Securities underwriters risk being left with securities they can't sell since they are committed to hold any securities that can't be sold in an IPO or other offering. Syndication circulates this risk across various underwriters. In the interim, the issuer of the securities gains admittance to a large flood of cash, as well as the underwriting syndicates' sales channels, contacts, and some level of protection from market risk, since it will be the underwriter who retains losses in the event that the issued security doesn't sell.

Syndicate members will commonly sign a contract that frames the terms of the syndication, including how much stock is dispensed to every underwriter, as well as different rights and obligations specific to every member. A lead underwriter will be placed at the head of the whole syndicate. This organization dispenses shares, sets the offering price, sorts out a timing schedule for the offering, and ensures the syndicate is consistent with [Financial Industry Regulatory Authority](/finra) (FINRA) and Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) regulations. The lead underwriter may likewise deal with the SEC and FINRA if important.
