## Understanding the Financial Services Modernization Act of 1999

This legislation is otherwise called the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, the law was enacted in 1999 and eliminated a portion of the last limitations of the Glass-Steagall Act of 1933, what separated commercial banking activities from investment banking. At the point when the financial industry started to battle during economic slumps, allies of deregulation contended that whenever allowed to collaborate, companies could lay out divisions that would be productive when their fundamental operations endured slowdowns. This would help financial services firms stay away from major losses and terminations.

Prior to the enactment of the law, banks could utilize alternate methods to get into the insurance market. Certain states made their own laws that conceded state-sanctioned banks the ability to sell insurance.

## Capacities Granted to Banks

The Financial Services Modernization of 1999 allowed banks, insurers, and securities firms to begin offering each other's products as well as to affiliate with one another. As such, banks could make divisions to sell insurance policies to their customers and insurers could lay out banking divisions. New corporate structures would should be made inside financial institutions to oblige these operations. For instance, banks could form financial holding companies that would incorporate divisions to conduct nonbanking business. Banks could likewise make auxiliaries that conduct banking activities.

The space the law conceded to form auxiliaries to give extra types of services incorporated a few limitations. The auxiliaries must stay inside size imperatives relative to their parent banks or in absolute terms. At the hour of the enactment of the law, the assets of auxiliaries were limited to the lesser of 45% of the consolidated assets of the parent bank or $50 billion.

The law included different changes for the financial industry, for example, requiring clear revelations on their privacy policies. Financial institutions were required to inform their customers what nonpublic information about them would be shared with outsiders and affiliates. Customers would be given a chance to opt out of allowing such information to be shared with outside parties.

## Financial Deregulation and the Great Recession

Financial deregulation under the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act was widely seen as a contributing factor to the financial crisis of 2008 and following [Great Recession](/great-recession). By wiping out the denial against the consolidation of deposit banking and investment banking, enacted under Glass-Steagall, the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act straightforwardly uncovered traditional deposit banking to the risky and speculative practices of investment banks and different securities firms.

Combined with the development and spread of exotic financial derivatives and the extreme (for the time) low interest rate policies of the Federal Reserve, this contributed to an environment of mounting systemic risk across the whole financial system during the 2000s leading up to the financial crisis of 2008. In the course of the Great Recession that followed, parts of the Glass-Steagall protections were reestablished under the [Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act](/dodd-forthcoming financial-administrative reform-bill) in 2010.
