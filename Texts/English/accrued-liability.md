## Types of Accrued Liabilities

## When Do Accrued Liabilities Occur?

Accrued liabilities emerge for a number of reasons or when occasions happen during the normal course of business. For example:

- [Taxes owed to governments](/back-taxes) might be accrued on the grounds that they are not due until the next tax reporting period.

Toward the finish of a calendar year, employee salaries and benefits must be recorded in the appropriate year, paying little mind to when the pay period closures and when paychecks are distributed. For instance, a fourteen day pay period might reach out from December 25 to January 7.

In spite of the fact that they aren't distributed until January, there is as yet one full seven day stretch of expenses for December. The salaries, benefits, and taxes incurred from Dec. 25 to Dec. 31 are considered accrued liabilities. These expenses are debited to mirror an increase in the expenses. In the mean time, different liabilities will be credited to report the increase in obligations toward the year's end.
