# Naked Put
## What Is a Naked Put?

A naked put is an options strategy wherein the investor composes, or sells, [put options](/putoption) without holding a short position in the [underlying security](/underlying-security). A naked put strategy is some of the time alluded to as an "uncovered put" or a "short put" and the seller of an uncovered put is known as a naked writer.

The primary utilization of this strategy is to capture the option's [premium](/premium) on an underlying security forecast as going higher, however one which the trader or investor wouldn't be disappointed to claim for essentially a month or perhaps longer.

## How a Naked Put Works

A naked put option strategy expects that the underlying security will vary in value, however generally rise over the course of the next month or somewhere in the vicinity. In view of this assumption, a trader executes the strategy by selling a put option with no relating [short position](/short) in their account. This sold option is supposed to be uncovered on the grounds that the initiator has no position with which to fill the terms of the option contract, should a buyer wish to [exercise](/exercise) their right to the option.

Since a put option is intended to make profit for a [trader](/trader) who accurately forecasts that the price of the security will fall, the naked put strategy is of no result assuming the price of the security really goes up. Under this scenario, the value of the put option goes to zero and the seller of the option will keep the money they received when they sold the option.

A seller of put options believes the underlying security should rise, with the goal that they wind up profiting. In any case, in the event that the price of the underlying security falls, they might wind up purchasing the stock in light of the fact that the option buyer could choose to exercise their right to sell somebody the security. Traders who like this strategy incline toward just to do this on underlying securities that they view well. On the off chance that they get the stock put to them, and it is a stock they like and see possibilities for, they wouldn't fret buying the stock and holding it for a least a month.

## Naked Put versus Covered Put

A naked put option strategy remains rather than a covered put strategy. In a covered put, the investor keeps a short position in the underlying security for the put option. The underlying security and the puts are separately shorted and sold in equivalent amounts.

At the point when executed thusly, a covered put works in practically the same manner as a [covered call](/coveredcall) strategy, with the primary difference being that the individual executing the covered put strategy hopes to profit from the gently declining price of a security, while a covered call trader hopes to profit from a somewhat rising price. That is on the grounds that the underlying position for covered puts is a short rather than a [long position](/long), and the option sold is a put as opposed to a call.

## Special Considerations

A naked put strategy is innately risky due to the limited [upside](/upside) profit potential and, theoretically, a huge downside loss potential. The maximum profit is just reachable assuming the underlying price closes simply at or over the [strike price](/strikeprice) at expiration. Further expansions in the cost of the underlying security won't bring about any extra profit.

The maximum loss, in the mean time, is theoretically critical on the grounds that the price of the underlying security can fall to zero. The higher the strike price, the higher the loss potential.

Be that as it may, in additional viable terms, the seller of the options will probably repurchase them a long time before the price of the underlying security falls too far below the strike price, in light of their risk tolerance and [stop-loss](/stop-lossorder) settings.

## Utilizing Naked Puts

On account of the risk implied, just experienced options investors ought to compose naked puts. The [margin](/margin) requirements are much of the time very high for this strategy too, due to the propensity for substantial losses.

Investors who immovably accept the price of the underlying security, typically a stock, will rise or remain the equivalent might compose put options to earn the premium. In the event that the stock perseveres over the strike price between the hour of composing the options and their [expiration date](/expirationdate), then, at that point, the options writer keeps the whole premium, minus commissions.

At the point when the price of the stock falls below the strike price before or by the expiration date, the buyer of the options vehicle can demand the seller take delivery of shares of the underlying stock. The options seller will then, at that point, need to go to the [open market](/open-market) and sell those shares at the market price loss, even however the options writer needed to pay the options strike price. For instance, envision the strike price is $60, and the open market price for the stock is $55 at the time the options contract is exercised. In this case, the options seller will cause a loss of $5 per share of stock.

The premium collected does fairly offset the loss on the stock, yet the potential for loss can in any case be substantial. The [breakeven point](/breakevenpoint) for a naked put option is the strike price minus the premium, offer the options seller some wiggle room.

## Highlights
- A naked put's breakeven point for the writer is its strike price, plus the premium received.
- A naked put has limited upside profit potential and, in theory, downside loss likely that exists from the current price of the underlying right down to in the event that it goes to zero.
- At the point when put options are sold, the seller benefits as the underlying security becomes more expensive.
- A naked put is the point at which a put option is sold without help from anyone else (uncovered) with practically no offsetting positions.
