For instance, consider an employee that procures $75,000 [gross income](/grossincome) in a given tax year. Assuming his effective tax rate is 24%, his tax liability for the year will be 0.24 x $75,000 = $18,000, leaving the employee with $75,000 - $18,000 = $57,000 take-home pay. Notwithstanding, assuming that employee contributes $15,000 towards their 401(k) plan, their [taxable income ](/taxableincome)will be reduced to $75,000 - $15,000 = $60,000, and their tax liability will be 0.24 x $60,000 = $14,400, under $18,000.
