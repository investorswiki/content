# Contract Theory
## What Is Contract Theory?

Contract theory is the study of how individuals and organizations build and foster legal agreements. It breaks down how parties with clashing interests build formal and casual contracts, even [tenancy](/tenancy voluntarily). Contract theory heaps of financial and [economic behavior](/behavioraleconomics) as various gatherings have various incentives to perform or not perform specific actions.

It is additionally helpful for understanding [forward contracts](/forwardcontract), and other legal contracts and their [provisions](/arrangement). It likewise incorporates a comprehension of letters of intent and notices of understanding.

## How Contract Theory Works

In an ideal world, contracts ought to give an unmistakable and specific comprehension of obligations and requirements, taking out the risk of questions or misconceptions happening later. In any case, that doesn't necessarily occur.

Contract theory covers the implied trust between the various gatherings and explores the formation of contracts within the sight of [asymmetric information](/asymmetricinformation), which happens when one party to an economic transaction has greater material information than the other party.

One of the most unmistakable applications of contract theory is the means by which to design employee benefits ideally. Contract theory inspects a decision producer's behavior under specific designs. Under these designs, contract theory means to include a [algorithm](/algorithm) that will upgrade the singular's decisions.

## Types of Contract Theory

Practice partitions contract theory into three models or types of structures. These models characterize the ways for the gatherings to make suitable moves in specific situations stated in the contract.

### Moral Hazard

A [moral hazard](/moralhazard) model depicts a principal who has an incentive to participate in risky behaviors in light of the fact that the associated costs are absorbed by the other contracting party.

For moral hazard to be available, there must be information imbalance and a contract that gives an opportunity to a party to change their behavior. To counter moral hazards, a few companies make employee performance contracts, which rely upon noticeable and confirmable actions to act as incentives for gatherings to act as per the principal's interest.

### Adverse Selection

A [adverse selection](/adverseselection) model depicts a principal who has more or better information than the other contracting party and consequently twists the market cycle.

Adverse selection is common in the insurance industry. A few insurers give coverage to policyholders who keep significant information during the application interaction to get protection. Without asymmetric information, these policyholders would likely not be insured or would be insured at unfavorable rates.

### Signaling

The signaling model is the point at which one party satisfactorily passes information and characteristics about itself on to the principal. In economics, signaling incorporates the transfer of information starting with one party then onto the next. The purpose of this transfer is to accomplish mutual satisfaction for a specific contract or agreement.

## History of Contract Theory

Kenneth Arrow directed the main conventional research on this subject in the field of economics during the 1960s. Since contract theory incorporates both behavioral incentives of a principal and an agent, it falls under a field known as law and economics. This field of study is additionally called the economic analysis of law.

In 2016, financial analysts Oliver Hart and Bengt Holmstr\u00f6m won the [Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences](/nobel-memorial-prize-in-economic-sciences) for their contributions to contract theory. The two were cheered for investigating "a considerable lot of its applications" and sending off "contract theory as a prolific field of fundamental research."

## Features
- Contract theory takes a gander at how people and organizations build and foster legal agreements.
- Contract theory takes a gander at how various gatherings attempting to come to an agreement work with clashing interests and various levels of information.
- Three models have been developed to characterize ways for the gatherings to make fitting moves under particular conditions stated in the contract: moral hazard, adverse selection, and signaling.
