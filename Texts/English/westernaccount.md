# Western Account
## What Is a Western Account?

A western account is a type of [agreement among underwriters (AAU)](/underwriting-agreement) in which every underwriter consents to share responsibility for just a specific portion of the overall [new issuance](/newissue). They are something contrary to an "[eastern account](/undividedaccount)," in which each [underwriter](/underwriter) shares responsibility for the whole issuance.

Western accounts are well known among certain underwriters since they reduce their effective [liability](/liability) should the new issuance demonstrate surprisingly troublesome. Then again, western accounts additionally limit the potential [upside](/upside) delighted in by underwriters if the new issuance is uncommonly fruitful.

## How Western Accounts Work

The western account is one of the manners in which that underwriters try to deal with the risk associated with carrying new securities to the public, for example, on account of a [initial public offering (IPO)](/ipo). These transactions are innately risky for the underwriters in question, since they are required to pay a certain amount of money to the [issuer](/issuer) of the security no matter what the price at which those securities can then be sold to the public. The profit of the underwriter depends on the [spread](/spread) between the price paid to the issuer and the price ultimately acquired from selling the new securities to the public.

To alleviate this risk, underwriters generally conduct new issuances as a team with each other, shaping what are known as [underwriting "consortiums."](/underwriter-organization) Of course, while uniting several underwriting firms thusly, it is important to plainly portray the rights and obligations of the gatherings in question. This is achieved through explicit agreements known as AAUs, which spread out which underwriter is responsible for what portion of the new issuance.

The western account, otherwise called a "partitioned account," is essentially one common illustration of an AAU structure. In it, every underwriter consents to take on liability for just the portion of the issuance that it takes into its own [inventory](/inventory). On the off chance that any of the [securities](/security) held by different underwriters fail to sell (or get disheartening prices), then, at that point, that risk is just brought into the world by the specific underwriter left holding that inventory.

## Illustration of a Western Account

XYZ Corporation is a conspicuous manufacturing company getting ready for its IPO. Its management team are specialists in their industry, yet are not particularly learned about the [financial markets](/financial-market). Thus, they hire a lead underwriter who thusly forms a consortium of firms who are by and large responsible for carrying out XYZ's IPO.

Under the terms of this transaction, XYZ is paid a sum by the underwriters that is equivalent to $25 per share. To profit from the transaction, the underwriting consortium must try to sell their shares to different investors for greater than $25 per share.

In shaping their consortium, XYZ's underwriters adopted an AAU displayed on the western account structure. In like manner, every one of the underwriting firms included just assumed responsibility for a specific portion of the recently issued shares. Hence, the ultimate profit or loss of the underwriters will change starting with one firm then onto the next.
