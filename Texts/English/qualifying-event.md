# Qualifying Event
## What Is a Qualifying Event?

A qualifying event is a change in life conditions that permits you to modify an existing health care coverage policy, or pursue another one, outside of open enrollment periods.

Without a qualifying event, you would have to hold on until the next open enrollment period before rolling out any improvements. Common instances of qualifying events incorporate the birth or adoption of a child, death of a spouse, or a change in marital status.

## How Qualifying Events Work

In the United States, most healthcare services are covered by private health care coverage plans, with the remainder given by government programs like Medicare and Medicaid. Many individuals receive health care coverage through their employers who might cover all or part of the [premiums](/insurance-premium), or they can purchase a plan through the [Health Insurance Marketplace](/health care coverage marketplace).

Regularly, you can pick the type and amount of coverage in light of your requirements during open enrollment periods. Open enrollment periods are commonly held toward the year's end with coverage starting toward the beginning of the next year. For instance, open enrollment for the Health Insurance Marketplace commonly runs from November through mid-December. When open enrollment is closed, you can't make changes to the type of insurance coverage chose, except if you experience a qualifying event.

Qualifying events, likewise commonly called qualifying life events, are conditions that can essentially impact what is going on —, for example, getting married, divorced, having a baby or taking on a child, and the death of a spouse. Numerous health care coverage contracts contain provisions expressing that, in the event that such an event happens, a special enrollment period will be set off and a policyholder can request changes to their insurance policy without expecting to hang tight for the next open enrollment period.

> Generally, you really want to demonstrate that a qualifying event happened by giving evidence —, for example, a birth certificate or documentation for a marriage or divorce. When this evidence has been accepted, most insurers expect that you request changes to coverage in 60 days or less.
