# Exchange Rate
## What Is an Exchange Rate?

An exchange rate is the value of one nation's [currency](/currency) versus the currency of another nation or economic zone. For instance, the number of U.S. dollars does it take to buy one [euro](/euro)? As of June 3, 2022, the exchange rate is 1.0721, meaning it takes $1.0721 to buy \u20ac1.

## Understanding the Exchange Rate

Normally, an exchange rate is quoted involving an abbreviation for the national currency it addresses. For instance, the abbreviation USD addresses the U.S. dollar, while EUR addresses the euro. To quote the currency pair for the dollar and the euro, it would be [EUR/USD](/eur-usd-euro-us-dollar-currency-pair). On account of the Japanese yen, it's [USD/JPY](/usd-jpy-us-dollar-japanese-yen-currency-pair), or dollar to yen. An exchange rate of 100 would mean that 1 dollar equals 100 yen.

Normally, exchange rates can be free-drifting or fixed. A free-drifting exchange rate rises and falls due to changes in the [foreign exchange market](/foreign-exchange-markets). A fixed exchange rate is [pegged](/currency-stake) to the value of another currency. For example, the Hong Kong dollar is pegged to the U.S. dollar in a scope of 7.75 to 7.85. This means the value of the Hong Kong dollar to the U.S. dollar will stay inside this reach.

Exchange rates can have what is called a [spot rate](/spot_rate), or cash value, which is the current market value. On the other hand, an exchange rate might have a forward value, which depends on expectations for the currency to rise or fall versus its spot price.

Forward rate values might vary due to changes in expectations for future interest rates in a single country versus another. For instance, suppose that traders have the view that the eurozone will ease monetary policy versus the U.S. In this case, traders could buy the dollar versus the euro, bringing about the value of the euro falling.

Exchange rates can likewise be different for a similar country. A few countries have restricted currencies, restricting their exchange to inside the countries' borders. At times, there is a coastal rate and an offshore rate. Generally, a better exchange rate can frequently be found inside a country's border versus outside its borders. Likewise, a restricted currency can have its value set by the government.

China is one major illustration of a country that has this rate structure. Furthermore, China's yuan is a currency that is controlled by the government. Consistently, the Chinese government sets a midpoint value for the currency, permitting the yuan to trade in a band of 2% from the midpoint.

## Exchange Rate Example

John is going to Germany from his home in New York and he needs to ensure he has 200 dollars' worth of euros when he shows up in Germany. He goes to the nearby currency exchange shop and sees that the current exchange rate is 1.20. It means assuming that he exchanges $200, he will receive \u20ac166.66 in return.

In this case, the equation is: dollars \u00f7 exchange rate = euro

-or then again-

$200 \u00f7 1.20 = \u20ac166.66

John has returned from the trip, and he currently needs to exchange his euros for dollars. He never utilized his \u20ac166.66 and presently sees the exchange rate has dropped to 1.15. He exchanges his \u20ac166.66, and on the grounds that the rate fell when he was away, he gets just $191.67. The explanation he gets less notwithstanding having similar value of euros is that the euro debilitated versus the dollar during his time away.

In this case, the equation is the inverse: euros x exchange rate = dollars

-or then again-

\u20ac166.66 x 1.15 = $191.66

In any case, not all currencies work the same way. For instance, the Japanese yen is calculated in an unexpected way. In this case, the dollar is set in front of the yen, as in USD/JPY.

The equation for USD/JPY is: dollars x exchange rate = yen

Suppose somebody heading out to Japan needs to change over $100 into yen, and the exchange rate is 110. The traveler would get \u00a511,000. To change over yen once again into dollars one necessities to separate the amount of the currency by the exchange rate.

$100 x 110 = \u00a511,000.00

-or then again-

\u00a511,000.00/110= $100
