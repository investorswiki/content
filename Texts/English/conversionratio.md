# Conversion Ratio
## What Is the Conversion Ratio?

The conversion ratio is the number of [common shares](/commonstock) received at the hour of conversion for every convertible security. The higher the ratio, the higher the number of common shares exchanged per convertible security. The conversion not entirely settled at the time the [convertible security](/convertible-security) is issued and affects the relative price of the security. The ratio is calculated by partitioning the convertible security's [par value](/parvalue) by the [conversion price](/conversionprice) of equity.

## Figuring out the Conversion Ratio

There are two principal types of [capital](/capital) raising support apparatuses: [debt](/debt) and equity. Debt must be paid back, however it is frequently less expensive to raise capital by giving debt than by getting equity due to tax considerations. [Equity](/equity) needn't bother with to be paid back, which is useful in troublesome times or when earnings growth is negative.

Raising capital with equity surrenders ownership, and ownership brings [voting rights](/votingright). Even however equity takes a secondary lounge to debt in terms of credit, [shareholders](/shareholder) benefit from share price appreciation when [earnings growth](/eps) is. The interest rate paid to debt holders remains the equivalent paying little heed to earnings performance.

Each raising money method enjoys its benefits and disadvantages. One way investors and companies exploit the two universes is through hybrid securites called [convertibles.](/convertibles) The conversion ratio lets investors know the number of common shares they that get in exchange for a [convertible bond](/convertiblebond) or stock. The company sets the conversion ratio and date at the hour of issue.

## Instances of the Conversion Ratio

The accompanying models show the discussion ratio on account of convertible bonds and convertible preferreds.

### Convertible Bonds

Convertible debt is a debt hybrid product with an embedded option that permits the holder to change over the debt into equity later on. The registration statement tells [investors ](/investor)the number of shares to be allowed.

For instance, one bond that can be switched over completely to 20 shares of common stock has a 20-to-1 conversion ratio. The conversion ratio can likewise be found by taking the bond's par value, which is generally $1,000, and separating it by the share price. A stock trading for $40 has a conversion ratio equivalent to $1,000 isolated by $40, or 25.

### Convertible Preferreds

Convertible stock is a hybrid equity product. Preferred stockholders receive a [dividend](/dividend) like a bond, which positions higher than equity in case of [liquidation](/liquidation), however they have no voting rights. Switching over completely to stock gives the [preferred shareholder](/preferredstock) voting rights and permits them to benefit from share price appreciation.

For instance, on the off chance that a company issues convertible preferred with a 5% dividend and a conversion ratio of five, the investor receives five common shares for each share of preferred shares. On the off chance that the preferred stock is trading at $100, the conversion break-even price on common shares not entirely settled by separating the price by the conversion ratio, which is $20.

In the two cases, the conversion ratio drives the price of the convertible.
