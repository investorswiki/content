Corporate and government structures likewise regularly make rules of succession to guarantee the orderly transfer of power under different conditions.

Under ideal conditions, all gatherings associated with succession have arranged and recorded [a plan](/succession-planning) so the process moves without a hitch, permitting any replacement to satisfy any new duties in a manner fully viable with any remaining elements in place.

## Succession in Estate Planning

In [estate planning](/estateplanning), wills and trusts provide control over the succession of a person's assets after they pass on. For instance, a personal, revocable trust provides an opportunity to move assets into an entity outside the estate while providing specific directions in regards to who holds the assets, as well as how and when those assets get distributed from here on out.

For estates where the deceased has no will, legislative rules govern who receives the assets of an estate through a process called [intestate succession](/intestate).

Unrelated people or organizations seldom receive property by means of these rules, even assuming the deceased made casual solicitations that they benefit from the estate. Under intestate succession laws, a few states will hold onto the assets of people who bite the dust without enduring family members.
