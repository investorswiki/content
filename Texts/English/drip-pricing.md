# Drip Pricing
## What Is Drip Pricing?

Drip pricing is a pricing technique where just part of a thing's price is advertised, with the total amount revealed toward the finish of the buying system. Drip pricing may initially keep mandatory [fees](/expense, for example, nearby lodging taxes, booking fees, or resort fees, or may exclude additional items that are required to utilize a product or service, for example, internet access, certain facilities, or conveniences.

These extra, frequently mandatory costs are revealed individually or "dripped."

## How Drip Pricing Works

The price listed in a newspaper ad, in an email, or on a website (the "title price") may not be what a decent or service eventually costs the consumer. Companies would prefer to show a lower price (and later make sense of that mandatory fees will make things look more extravagant) than scare away a customer with sticker shock.

Drip pricing can make comparison shopping more troublesome and punish dealers who are more transparent with their pricing.

The thinking behind its utilization is that a shopper might have put such a lot of time into the shopping system that when extra fees or charges are uncovered they have previously made up their minds to make a purchase.

Companies might use a price dipping approach to tempt a customer into starting the purchase interaction, at which point the customer probably shouldn't restart their pursuit, when they figure out the additional costs.

## Drip Pricing in Practice

Inns may display area pricing that does exclude [local taxes](/localtax) or resort fees, or may exclude the cost of services like access to the rec center or pool, or spa. Resorts might offer one price however the additional items for extra services might make sticker shock.

Companies use drip pricing for products that might face heavy [price competition](/serious pricing). This is on the grounds that consumers are probably going to shop around at the best cost for these types of things. This makes an incentive for companies to show the most reduced price conceivable, even on the off chance that the price they show isn't what the consumer will at last pay.

## Special Considerations

In the European Union, regulators have commanded that taxes, fees, and surcharges may not be dripped.
