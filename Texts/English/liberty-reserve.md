## What Was Liberty Reserve?

Liberty Reserve was formerly a company situated in Costa Rica that permitted individuals to send and receive secure payments without uncovering their account numbers or real personalities. Liberty Reserves (LRs) were the company's electronic currency, which could be changed over this way and that between U.S. dollars or Euros. Headed by Arthur Budovsky, who disavowed his American citizenship to make another life in Costa Rica, the company worked from 2006-2013 until specialists got serious about it when they found that it was a huge extravagant [money laundering](/moneylaundering) business.

## Understanding Liberty Reserve

Customers utilized Liberty Reserve's online exchange service to handle payment transactions and add or pull out funds from their accounts. An account could be set up essentially with a name and birth date, the two of which didn't need to be checked, and an email address. With next to zero oversight of international financial transactions in Costa Rica, Liberty Reserve was free to build a money exchange business where genuine, though unregulated, transactions could happen, yet in addition where unlawful money laundering could undoubtedly escape the eyes of the law. Every transaction fee was 1% of the handled amount or $2.99, whichever was less. At its pinnacle, Liberty Reserve served more than 1,000,000 customers worldwide, incorporating 200,000 in the U.S. furthermore, handled around 12 million transactions per year, which advanced Budovsky and his partners.

The [Patriot Act](/patriotact) empowered U.S. specialists to pursue Liberty Reserve in light of the fact that the company dealt with USD overseas. Part of the command of the Patriot Act was to ensure psychological oppressors couldn't utilize USD to finance their activities. In 2013 the U.S. seized and closed down Liberty Reserve, and after a year Budovsky and several other former Liberty Reserve workers were captured in Spain and removed to the U.S. to face charges of scheme to commit money laundering. From the start, Budovsky argued not liable to the charges, however at that point several months after the fact changed his supplication to blameworthy in a deal with examiners. A portion of the former workers of the company received somewhat light punishments and sentences. The driving force, Budovsky, then again, was condemned in 2016 to 20 years of imprisonment.
