For instance, a rundown of specific public orders anticipating execution on the [Chicago Board Options Exchange](/cboe) (CBOE) could be alluded to as the "order book official".

## Order Book Official and Market Makers

A market maker, who acts as a [dealer](/dealer) with his/her own inventory, and an order book official, who handles the book of customer limit orders.

[Market makers](/marketmaker) (MMs) post and keep up with continuous two-sided markets, i.e., [bids and offers](/bid-and-ask), for a given options contract and trade for their own accounts. MMs additionally can't deal straightforwardly with the public, and must trust that orders will come into the floor by means of broker or exchange official.

The order book official monitors these orders for an assigned group of options and ensures the market stays liquid and fair. OBOs may not act as dealers and don't hold inventory. A [floor broker](/floorbroker) is a middleman acting as an agent for clients, in a roundabout way giving them the best access conceivable to the exchange floor.
