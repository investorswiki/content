## What Is a P/E 30 Ratio?

A P/E ratio of 30 means that a company's stock price is trading at 30 times the company's earnings per share. The P/E ratio ([price-to-earnings ratio](/price-earningsratio)) is the valuation ratio of a company's market value per share divided by a company's [earnings per share (EPS)](/eps).

At the most fundamental level, a P/E ratio identifies for one dollar of earnings what investors will pay for one unit of stock. For instance, a business said to be trading at a P/E ratio of 30:1 would indicate investors will pay $30 in [market price](/market-price) for every $1 in earnings. As a relative value indicator, investors can get a sense of which securities are trading (or priced) luxuriously relative to other businesses that might offer a better bargain for the same level of risk.

## P/E 30 Ratio Explained

A P/E of 30 is high by historical stock market standards. This type of valuation is normally placed on just the [fastest-developing companies](/growthcompany) by investors in the company's early stages of growth. Once a company becomes more mature, it will develop more leisurely and the P/E tends to decline.

In financial circles, the P/E ratio is often a hot topic, with analyst and market prognosticators opining on market trends and whether P/E ratios are higher or lower than historical standards. Albeit the measure actually enjoys a fair amount of attention, insiders realize it tends to be gamed. All things considered, a number of extensions and alternative metrics have filled in importance. The digitization of companies and markets further complicates traditional interpretations of the ratio.

## Understanding the P/E Ratio

Investors often need to compare how the share price of one company compares to that of another. Yet, just taking a gander at the stock price is like comparing apples to oranges since companies have different numbers of shares outstanding, and even on the off chance that they had the same share float, companies operate in different industry segments or are at different stages in the corporate life cycle. Fortunately, financial analysts have developed a number of tools for such purposes of comparison. The price-to-earnings ratio, or P/E, is one of the most widely used metrics.
