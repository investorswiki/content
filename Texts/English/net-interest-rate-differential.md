# Net Interest Rate Differential (NIRD)
## What Is the Net Interest Rate Differential (NIRD)?

The net interest rate differential (NIRD), in international currency ([forex](/forex)) markets, is the total difference in the interest rates of two distinct national economies.

For example, in the event that a trader is long the [NZD/USD pair](/nzd-usd-new-zealand-dollar-us-dollar-currency-pair), they will claim the New Zealand currency and borrow the U.S. currency. The New Zealand dollars in this case can be set in a New Zealand bank earning interest while at the same time applying for a new line of credit for the equivalent [notional amount](/notionalvalue) from a U.S. bank. The net interest rate differential is the after-tax, after-charge difference in any interest earned and any interest paid while holding the currency pair position.

## The Net Interest Rate Differential Explained

For the most part, a [interest rate differential](/interest-rate-differential) (IRD) measures the difference in interest rates between two comparative interest-bearing assets. Traders in the forex market use interest rate differentials while pricing forward exchange rates. In view of the [interest rate parity](/interestrateparity), a trader can make an expectation representing things to come exchange rate between two currencies and set the premium, or discount, on the current market exchange rate fates contracts. The net interest rate differential is specific to use in currency markets.

The net interest rate differential is a key part of the [carry trade](/currencycarrytrade). A carry trade is a strategy that foreign exchange traders use trying to profit from the difference between interest rates, and on the off chance that traders are [long](/long) a currency pair, they might have the option to profit from a rise in the currency pair. While the carry trade procures interest on the net interest rate differential, a move in the underlying currency pair spread could undoubtedly fall (as it has by and large) and risk clearing out the benefits of the carry trade leading to losses.

The currency carry trade stays one of the most well known [trading strategies](/trading-strategy) in the currency market. The best approach to initially execute a carry trade is to figure out which currency offers a high yield and which offers a lower one. The most well known carry trades include buying [currency pairs](/currencypair) like the AUD/JPY and the NZD/JPY since these have interest rate spreads that are ordinarily exceptionally high.

## Net Interest Rate Differential and the Carry Trade

The NIRD is the amount the investor can hope to profit utilizing a carry trade. Say an investor borrows $1,000 and changes over the funds into British pounds, permitting them to purchase a British bond. If the purchased [bond yields](/bond-yield) 7% and the equivalent U.S. bond yields 3%, then the IRD equals 4%, or 7% minus 3%. This profit is guaranteed provided that the exchange rate among dollars and pounds stays consistent.

One of the primary risks implied with this strategy is the vulnerability of currency changes. In this model, assuming the British pound were to fall comparable to the U.S. dollar, the trader might experience losses. Moreover, traders might utilize [leverage](/leverage, for example, with a factor of 10-to-1, to further develop their profit potential. In the event that the investor leveraged borrowing by a factor of 10-to-1, they could create a gain of 40%. In any case, leverage could likewise cause bigger losses assuming there are huge developments in exchange rates that conflict with the trade.
