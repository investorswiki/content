# Alternative Mortgage Transaction Parity Act (AMTPA)
## What Is the Alternative Mortgage Transaction Parity Act (AMTPA)?

The Alternative Mortgage Transaction Parity Act (AMTPA) was an act of Congress in 1982 that superseded many state laws preventing banks from composing certain home loans other than conventional fixed-rate mortgages.

The Act prompted the availability of different new "exotic" mortgages, for example, [adjustable-rate mortgages](/arm) (ARMs), [option ARMs](/paymentoptionarm), interest-only mortgages, and balloon payment mortgages.

## How the Alternative Mortgage Transaction Parity Act (AMTPA) Works

AMPTA is many times refered to as a root source of the sub-prime mortgage crisis of 2007, and a classic illustration of the cost of sincere goals. Before AMPTA, most states had rules precluding banks from thinking of home loans other than conventional fixed-rate mortgages. These limitations, alongside the period's twofold digit inflation and interest rates, made it troublesome in the event that certainly feasible for low-income families to bear the cost of homes.

AMPTA was the second legislative initiative to address the housing affordability problem. In 1980 Congress passed the [Depository Institutions Deregulation and Monetary Control Act](/monetary-control-act) (DIDMCA), which wiped out state usury laws. With banks then able to charge higher interest rates to borrowers with poor credit, the housing market expanded. However, that law didn't address state limitations on the type of mortgages allowed. After two years, AMPTA did just that. Together the two laws prepared for new mortgage products.

## The Unintended Consequence of AMPTA

However, the potentially negative result of deregulation was that numerous borrowers in the mid 21st century got mortgages they failed to comprehend.

For instance, ARMs have a low "mystery" interest rate that eventually drifts with market rates, and can increase substantially following a couple of years. [Balloon mortgages](/balloon-mortgage) require an immense payment when the loan comes due. [Interest-only mortgages](/interestonlymortgage) have low regularly scheduled payments for the initial not many years, however when the rate eventually resets to incorporate principal, the payments can soar.

Option ARMs allow the borrower to come up short on for a couple of years, however the unpaid balance is attached to the loan principal, at times making it unthinkable for the borrower to build equity in the home. Besides, banks endorsed loans in view of a borrower's ability to make the initial low regularly scheduled payments, disregarding the later, higher payments.

## New Laws Address AMPTA Problems

As borrowers lost their homes due to defaulting on their mortgages, house prices started to spiral descending, making it even more hard for individuals to refinance their homes into additional affordable mortgages.

In 2007, Congress passed new legislation that required lenders to endorse mortgages in view of the completely indexed rate. In 2010, the [Dodd-Frank Act](/dodd-frank-financial-administrative change bill) required even stricter standards and lender accountability, in effect discrediting AMPTA. The rollbacks of Dodd-Frank in 2018 connected with bank "[stress tests](/bank-stress-test)" and didn't adjust the Act's mortgage rules.
