# Fiscal Cliff
## What Is a Fiscal Cliff?

The fiscal cliff alludes to a combination of lapsing tax cuts and in all cases government spending cuts that make an approaching imbalance in the federal budget and must be revised to deflect a crisis.

That's what the thought behind the fiscal cliff was in the event that the federal government permitted these two occasions to continue as expected, they would adversely affect an all around precarious economy, maybe sending it back into an official recession as it cut household incomes, increased unemployment rates, and sabotaged consumer and investor confidence. Simultaneously, it was anticipated that going over the fiscal cliff would altogether reduce the federal [budget deficit](/budget-deficit).

## The Fiscal Cliff Explained

Who actually first articulated the words "fiscal cliff" isn't clear. Some accept that it was first utilized by Goldman Sachs economist, Alec Phillips. Others credit Federal Reserve Chair [Ben Bernanke](/benbernanke) for taking the phrase mainstream in his comments in front of Congress. In any case, others credit Safir Ahmed, a columnist for the **St. Louis Post-Dispatch**, who, in 1989, composed a story enumerating the state's education funding and utilized the term "fiscal cliff."

In the event that Congress and President Obama didn't act to deflect this perfect tempest of legislative changes, America would have, in the media's terms, "fall over the cliff." Among different things, it would have prompted a tax increase the size of which has not been seen by Americans in 60 years.

## How Big Were We Talking?

The Tax Policy Center reported that middle-income families will pay an average of $2,000 more in taxes in 2013. Numerous [itemized deductions](/itemizeddeduction) were subject to deliberately get rid of, and famous tax credits like the [earned income credit](/earnedincomecredit) (EITC), [child tax credit](/childtaxcredit), and [American opportunity credits](/american-opportunity-tax-credit) (AOTC) were to be reduced. 401(k) and other retirement accounts were to be subject to higher taxes.

Your [marginal tax rate](/marginaltaxrate) is the tax you pay on each extra dollar of income you earn. As your income rises, your marginal tax rate (better known as your [tax bracket](/taxbracket)) rises. In 2012, the tax brackets were 10%, 15%, 25%, 28%, 33%, and 35%. On the off chance that Washington didn't act, those rates would have increased to 15%, 28%, 31%, 36%, and 39.6%, separately. (Note that 2021 tax brackets are 10%, 12%, 22%, 25%, 32%, 35%, and 37%).

Also, the Congressional Budget Office estimated that 3.4 at least million individuals would lose their positions. The October 2012 [unemployment rate](/unemploymentrate) of 7.9% addressed a huge improvement over the October 2009 rate of 10%. The Congressional Budget Office accepted that up to 3.4 million positions would be lost post fiscal cliff due to an easing back economy with cutbacks originating from cuts in the defense budget and different things. This might have brought about a rising unemployment rate up to 9.1% or more.

## What Are the Bush Era Tax Cuts?

At the core of the fiscal cliff were the [Bush Era Tax cuts](/bush-tax-cuts) passed by Congress under President George W. Bush in 2001 and 2003. These remembered a lower tax rate and a reduction for dividend and [capital gains taxes](/capital_gains_tax) as the biggest parts. These were set to terminate toward the finish of 2012 and addressed the biggest part of the fiscal cliff.

The expected expiration of the Bush-period tax cuts additionally impacted tax rates on investments. The [long-term capital gains](/long-term_capital_gain_loss) tax rate was to increase from 15 to 20%, and [qualified dividend](/qualifieddividend) rates to increase to the individual's marginal tax rate up from a fixed 15% under the current plan. This not exclusively would have impacted Wall Street investors, yet in addition retired people and [retail investors](/retailinvestor), who were pulling out funds from [qualified retirement plans](/qrp) and brokerage accounts.

The current estate and [gift tax](/gifttax) exemption of $5.12 million was additionally scheduled to drop to $1 million. At that point, the tax on estates valued more than $5.12 million was 35%. After the fiscal cliff, a 55% tax rate on estates more than $1 million would have applied.

## Social Security Payroll Tax Rates Would Have Increased

In 2010, Congress approved an impermanent reduction in the [Social Security](/socialsecurity) payroll tax. This 2% reduction brought the tax from 6.2% down to 4.2% on the first $110,000 in earnings. This transitory rate was set to lapse toward the finish of 2012, which would cost an individual making $50,000 each year an extra $20 each week in taxes. In any case, that might not have been the finish of the impact of the fiscal cliff on Social Security. Social Security has a great deal of moving parts, and legislators from the two sides of the walkway accepted that making changes to Social Security, notwithstanding the lapse of the payroll tax cut, could raise genuinely necessary revenue.

## Was There a Bright Side to This?

There were mainly two bullish contentions with respect to the fiscal cliff. In the first place, the Congress won't promptly permit it to work out, and second, that perhaps it wouldn't be so terrible assuming it worked out.

Taking a totally different track, there was likewise a contention that the cliff itself would be a long-term positive. Barely any contend that the U.S. needs to handle its deficits eventually, and this kind of "unpleasant medication" would be a cruel, however definitive, step that way. Albeit the short-term impact could be extreme (recession in 2013), the bullish contention would hold that the long-term gains (lower deficits, lower debt, better growth possibilities, and so forth,) would be worth the short-term torments.

As per the Congressional Budget Office, by 2022, the [budget deficit](/budget-deficit) would fall to $200 billion from its current level of $1.1 trillion. That would be generally welcome information, however to arrive, the nation would face close to 100% financial strife.

## How Could We Fix It?

Administrators met at the White House over this issue. The two sides called the meeting useful, however neither one of the sides indicated that a deal was inescapable. Liberals wanted to see more revenue (tax increases), particularly from the nation's affluent, as part of any deal. Conservatives inclined toward additional spending cuts, particularly to privileges like [Medicare](/medicare). While the two sides subscribed to various ways of thinking concerning taxation, each had indicated that they were able to compromise on large numbers of the more critical issues leading to Jan. 1.

Three hours before the 12 PM cutoff time on January 1, the Senate agreed on a deal to deflect the fiscal cliff. The key components of the deal remembered an increase for the payroll tax by two percentage points to 6.2% for income up to $113,700, and a reversal of the Bush tax cuts for individuals making more than $400,000 and couples making more than $450,000 (which involved the top rate returning from 35% to 39.5%).

Investment income was likewise impacted, with an increase in the tax on investment income from 15% to 23.8% for taxpayers in the top income bracket and a 3.8% surtax on investment income for individuals earning more than $200,000 and couples making more than $250,000. The deal additionally gave U.S. taxpayers greater certainty with respect to the [alternative least tax](/alternativeminimumtax) (AMT) and a number of famous tax breaks - like the exemption for interest on municipal bonds - stay in place.
