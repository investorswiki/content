## The Process of Series A Financing

After a beginning up, we should call it XYZ, has secured itself with a viable product or business model, it might in any case lack adequate revenue, if any, to extend. It will then contact or be drawn closer by VC or PE firms for extra funding. XYZ will then, at that point, furnish the potential Series An investors with itemized information on their business model and projections for future growth and revenue.

Typically, the funds looked for would be utilized to continue with expansion plans (hire extra personnel, software engineers, sales and support staff, new office space, and such). The funds can likewise be utilized to pay out initial seed or angel investors.

The potential Series An investors will then perform their due diligence (basically exploring the business model and financial projections to check whether they seem OK) and afterward form a decision about regardless of whether to invest. Keep in mind, this is a high-risk enterprise, as many new businesses don't make it. In the event that they choose to invest, it gets down to the bare essential: the amount to invest, what will they receive in return, and different conditions covering the investment.

In exchange for their investment, commonplace Series An investors will receive [common](/commonstock) or [preferred stock](/preferredstock) of the company, [deferred stock](/deferredshare), or deferred debt, or a mix of those. The whole investment is started on the valuation of the company, the amount it is worth, and the way in which that valuation might change after some time. Most Series An investors are searching for huge returns on their money, with 200% to 300% normal objectives over a long term period.

## An Example of Series A Financing

XYZ has developed novel software that permits investors to connect their accounts, make payments, investments, and move their assets between financial institutions, all on their mobile gadgets. Several VC funds show interest and welcome XYZ to examine their current financial condition, nitty gritty business model, projected revenues, and any remaining pertinent corporate and financial data.

The VC firms then, at that point, pore over the data to perceive how reasonable it is, eventually seeking to determine a future valuation for the company. Their decision is that XYZ will be worth $100 million in a three-year time span, however they are simply ready to invest $20 million in XYZ. But since the company isn't currently generating profits, the VC company can haggle for a larger share of ownership, say half. On the off chance that XYZ is fruitful and meets the projections of a $100 million valuation, the VC's $20 million-dollar investment will currently be worth $50 million, a return of 150% north of three years.

Depending on the amount of investment, Series An investors will likewise reasonable gain seats on the board of XYZ to permit them to all the more closely monitor the company's progress and management. Subsequent rounds of financing, known as Series B or Series C, may follow down the road, where every one of those investors must rethink the value of the company.

They will probably receive unexpected terms in comparison to the Series An investors, as probably, the company has proven to be a more appealing investment, and they are buying into a more settled enterprise. The last step in raising capital would be for XYZ to "open up to the world" through a [initial public offering](/ipo) (IPO), permitting people to buy XYZ's stock on public exchanges. Series A (B and C) investors are likewise then able to cash out in the event that they wish to.

Be that as it may, keep as a main priority, in the event that XYZ fizzles, the VC/PE's investment will probably be worthless.
