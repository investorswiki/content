# Triple Bottom Line (TBL)
## What Is the Triple Bottom Line (TBL)?

In economics, the triple primary concern (TBL) keeps up with that companies ought to focus on zeroing in as much on social and environmental worries as they do on profits. TBL theory posits that rather than one main concern, there ought to be three: profit, individuals, and the planet. A TBL tries to measure a corporation's level of commitment to [corporate social responsibility](/corp-social-responsibility) and its impact on the environment after some time.

In 1994, John Elkington — the acclaimed British management consultant and [sustainability](/sustainability) master — begat the expression "triple primary concern" as his approach to measuring performance in corporate America. The thought was that a company can be managed such that brings in money as well as works on individuals' lives and the prosperity of the planet.

## Grasping the Triple Bottom Line (TBL)

In finance, while discussing a company's [bottom line](/bottomline), we generally mean its profits. Elkington's TBL structure advances the goal of sustainability in business practices, in which companies look past profits to incorporate social and environmental issues to measure the full cost of carrying on with work. Triple-primary concern theory says that companies ought to concentrate on social and environmental issues as they do on financial issues.

TBL theory likewise says that assuming a company centers around finances just and doesn't look at how it collaborates socially, it can't understand the situation completely and subsequently can't account for the full cost of carrying on with work.

As per TBL theory, companies ought to be working at the same time on these three primary concerns:

- **Profit**: This is the traditional measure of corporate profit — the [profit and loss](/plstatement) (P&L) account.
- **People**: This measures how socially responsible an organization has been over its time.
- **Planet**: This measures how environmentally responsible a firm has been.

These practices could well bring about the best potential profits for the company, however to the detriment of miserable working and everyday environments for laborers, and damage to the natural environment and individuals who live in that environment.
