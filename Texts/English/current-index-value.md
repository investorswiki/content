# Current Index Value
## What Is Current Index Value?

The term current index value alludes to the latest value for the underlying [indexed rate](/indexed_rate) in a [variable rate](/variableinterestrate) loan. Variable rate loans depend on the indexed rate and a margin to compute the completely indexed rate that a borrower is required to pay. This value ought to reflect general market conditions as well as changes in light of those that happen in the [market](/market).

## Understanding Current Index Value

Current index values are utilized by lenders to compute the variable rate [loan](/loan) products. The rate borrowers pay on these loans is called the completely indexed rate. It is a function of both an indexed rate and a [margin](/margin). Lenders might offer an assortment of variable rate loan products with completely indexed rates that change at contrasting reset times.

Indexed rates are set by the lender and can be founded on different indexes including:

- a lender's [prime rate](/primerate)
- the [London Interbank Offered Rate](/libor) (LIBOR)
- the cost of funds index (COFI)
- the [cost of savings index](/cosiindex) (COSI)
- different [U.S. Treasuries](/ustreasury)

The lender concludes the indexed rate part and diagrams the terms in the loan contract. The picked index, nonetheless, doesn't change in the wake of closing.

The loan rate on a variable rate loan is calculated by adding the indexed rate and the borrower's margin. In a variable rate item's loan underwriting process, the underwriter relegates the borrower a margin in light of their credit profile or [credit rating](/creditrating). The borrower is required to pay the completely indexed rate, which changes with changes in the underlying indexed rate. For some variable rate credit products, the variable rate is [volatile](/unpredictability). This means it can change whenever. Subsequently, when the current index value changes, the borrower's rate changes.

## Special Considerations

[Adjustable-rate mortgages](/arm) (ARMs) incorporate both fixed and variable [interest](/interest).The [London Interbank Offered Rate](/libor) (LIBOR) is a common index utilized as the variable rate in mortgages. LOBOR will cease to exist toward the finish of 2021. Borrowers who take out ARMs pay a fixed rate for the initial not many years up until a predefined reset date happens.

This fixed-rate is generally applicable for the initial five years of the loan, after which the rate resets on an annual basis. This sort of loan is known as a [5/1 hybrid mortgage](/5-1_arm). Borrowers are charged interest at a variable rate at the reset date and each applicable period after that. The variable rate in an adjustable-rate mortgage is calculated similarly as standard variable rate products. The borrower pays an underlying indexed rate plus the margin.

In an adjustable-rate mortgage, the variable rate can be unstable, changing each time the underlying current index value changes or at whatever point the variable rate can be scheduled. With a scheduled variable rate, borrowers pay a [fully indexed rate](/fullyindexedinterestrate) that is reset at scheduled times. Most adjustable-rate mortgages with a scheduled reset date will reset like clockwork. Assuming the variable rate depends on a schedule, the borrower's interest rate will change to the current index value plus the borrower's margin on that specific date and the completely indexed rate will stay unchanged until the next reset date.
