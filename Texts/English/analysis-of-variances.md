# Analysis of Variances (ANOVA)
## What Is Analysis of Variances (ANOVA)?

Analysis of variances (ANOVA) is a statistical technique used to test for differences or correlations in the effects of independent variables on a dependent variable.

ANOVA is utilized in finance in more than one way, for example, to forecast the movements of security prices by first determining which factors influence stock fluctuations. This analysis can give important insight into the behavior of a security or [market index](/marketindex) under different conditions.

## Understanding an Analysis of Variances

Analysis of variances (ANOVA) statistical models were initially introduced in a scientific paper written by Ronald Fisher, a British mathematician, in the mid 20th century. He is credited with first introducing the term variance.

ANOVA testing doesn't just analyze the differences, it additionally takes a gander at the degree of variance, or the difference between them, in variable means. It is a way of investigating the statistical significance of the variables. ANOVA analysis is sometimes viewed as more accurate than [t-testing](/t-test) since it is more flexible and requires less observations. It is likewise better suited for use in additional complex examinations than those that can be assessed by conducting tests.

Additionally, ANOVA testing permits researchers to uncover relationships among variables, while a t-test doesn't. Variations of ANOVA testing incorporate One-Way ANOVA (used to look for statistically significant differences between at least two independent variables), [Two-Way ANOVA](/two-way-anova) (to uncover potential interaction of two independent variables on one dependent variable) and Factorial ANOVA, which typically includes surveying at least two factors or variables with two levels.

## Analysis of Variance in Finance

Analysis of variance testing is utilized in finance in more ways than one, for example, to forecast the movements of security prices by first determining which factors influence stock fluctuations. This analysis can give significant insight into the behavior of a security or market index under different conditions.

This type of analysis attempts to break down the different underlying factors that determine the price of securities as well as market behavior. For instance, it might actually show the amount of a security's rise or fall is due to changes in interest rates. A t-test and f-test are utilized to investigate the results of an analysis of variance test to determine which variables are of statistical significance.

## Analysis of Variance in Other Applications

In addition to its applications in the finance industry, ANOVA is likewise utilized in a wide variety of contexts and applications to test hypotheses in exploring clinical trial data.

For instance, to compare the effects of different treatment protocols on patient outcomes; in social science research (for instance to survey the effects of orientation and class on determined variables), in software engineering (for instance to evaluate database management systems), in manufacturing (to evaluate product and cycle quality metrics), and industrial design among other fields.

## Highlights
- ANOVA is utilized in a variety of applications, remembering for finance and financial markets to find and affirm correlations and associations between different factors.
- There are a variety of ANOVA techniques including one-way, two-way, and factor models.
- Analysis of variances (ANOVA) is a statistical method that breaks down the influence of at least one independent variables on a dependent variable of interest.
