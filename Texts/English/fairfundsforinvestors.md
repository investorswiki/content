Prior to the Fair Funds Provision, money recuperated by the [Securities and Exchange Commission](/sec) (SEC) as civil punishments exacted against regulatory violators was dispensed to the U.S. Depository; the SEC didn't reserve the privilege to disperse these funds back to investors who were exploited. The Fair Funds for Investors provision empowered the SEC to add civil money punishments to disgorgement funds for the relief of the casualties of stock cheats.

The provision laid out a fund that holds money recuperated from a SEC case. The fund then picks how to convey the money to defrauded investors. After the funds are dispensed, the specific fund is ended.

The Fair Funds for Investors provision has compensated investors who have been exploited by collusion among funds and brokers, loan fee fixing, undisclosed fees, false advertising, late trading, siphon and-dump schemes, mutual fund market timing, and different forms of securities fraud and manipulation.

Somewhere in the range of 2002 and 2013, the provision permitted the SEC to disperse $14.46 billion to investors who were misled by fraud.
