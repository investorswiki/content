# Yield Basis
## What Is Yield Basis?

The yield basis is a method of providing the cost estimate of a [fixed-income security](/fixed-incomesecurity) as a yield percentage, instead of as a dollar value. This permits bonds with differing attributes to be effortlessly compared. The yield basis is calculated by partitioning the coupon amount paid every year by the [bond](/bond) purchase price.

## Grasping Yield Basis

Dissimilar to stocks, which are quoted in dollars, most bonds are quoted with a yield basis. For instance, expect a company is listed with a 6.75% [coupon rate](/coupon-rate) and is set to mature a long time from the date of issuance. The $1,000 par bond is trading at a dollar value of 940.

The yield basis can be calculated utilizing the [current yield](/currentyield) formula introduced as:

>
> Coupon/Purchase Price
>

Following our model over, the coupon to be paid every year is 6.75% x $1,000 = $67.50. In this way, the yield basis is $67.50/$940 = 0.0718, or 7.18%. The bond will be quoted to investors as having a yield basis of 7.18%.

The yield quote tells a bond trader that the bond is currently trading [at a discount](/at-a-discount) on the grounds that its yield basis is greater than its coupon rate (6.75%). Assuming the yield basis is not exactly the coupon rate, this would demonstrate that the bond is trading [at a premium](/at-a-premium) since a higher coupon rate builds the value of the bond in the markets. A bond trader could then compare the bond to others inside a certain industry.

## Bank Discount Yield

The yield basis of a pure discount instrument can be calculated utilizing the [bank discount yield](/bankdiscountbasis) formula, which is:

>
> r = (Discount/Par Value) x (360/t) where
>
> r = Annualized yield
>
> Discount = Par value minus purchase price
>
> t = time left to maturity
>
> 360 = Bank convention for the number of days in a year
>

Dissimilar to the current yield, the bank discount yield takes the discount [value from par](/parvalue) and communicates it as a negligible portion of the par value, not the current price, of the bond. This method of ascertaining the yield basis accepts simple interest; that is, no compounding effect is calculated in. [Treasury bills](/treasurybill) are quoted exclusively on a bank discount basis.

For instance, expect a Treasury bill with a $1,000 face value is selling for $970. Assuming its chance to maturity is 180 days, the yield basis will be:

>
> r = [($1,000 - $970)/$1,000] x (360/180)
>
> r = ($30/$1,000) x 2
>
> r = 0.06 or 6%
>

As Treasury bills pay no coupon, the bondholder will earn a dollar return equivalent to the discount on the off chance that the bond is held until it matures.

## Special Considerations

While purchasing bonds, the investor should grasp the difference between the yield basis and the net yield basis. On the [secondary market](/secondarymarket), you can purchase bonds through a broker/seller, who could charge you a flat commission for this service. Be that as it may, in lieu of a commission, your broker might opt to sell bonds on a net yield basis.

Net yield means the yield likewise incorporates the broker's profit for the transaction. This is the broker's [markup](/markup), which is the difference between what the broker paid for the bonds and what the broker sells them for. On the off chance that a broker offers bonds on a net yield basis, they've proactively incorporated their markup. For instance, if an online broker sells you a bond with a 3.75% [yield to maturity (YTM)](/yieldtomaturity), their profit is embedded straightforwardly in the price you pay and there is no separate commission.

While comparing different bonds for a potential purchase, bond purchasers ought to ask their broker in the event that the bonds are on a net yield basis or on the other hand assuming that they charge a separate commission to execute the trade. Brokers could charge different fees, for example, a broker-helped fee for transactions not led online. Your overall cost for the trade may likewise incorporate [accrued interest](/accruedinterest), which is the interest accrued on the bond between the last payment and the settlement date.

## Features
- The yield basis method quotes the price of a fixed-income security (like a bond) as a yield percentage rather than a dollar value.
- The yield quote tells the bond trader whether the bond is currently trading at a discount or premium compared to different bonds.
- Purchasing a bond on a net yield basis means the yield likewise incorporates the broker's profit or markup for executing the trade.
- The yield basis method helps bond purchasers effectively compare the qualities of different bonds before making a purchase.
