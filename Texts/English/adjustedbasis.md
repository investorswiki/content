# Adjusted Basis
## What is adjusted basis?
Adjusted basis alludes to the amount you lose or gain when you sell property. Before you can decide your profit or loss from the sale or exchange of property, you must factor in things, for example, depreciation or money you invested in improvements to the property prior to selling it.
## More profound definition
The "basis" of a piece of property is essentially the cost to you of purchasing it. This incorporates the ticket price, the sales tax, different taxes and any associated fees. To decide adjusted basis, begin with the original purchase price and add amounts in light of things, for example, improvements made or legal fees paid and take away deductions taken for things like depreciation or loss.
A few things that increase basis incorporate the cost of improvements anticipated to last for longer than a year, impact fees and zoning costs. A few things that decline basis incorporate some tax credits, for example, residential energy credits or vehicle credits, insurance repayments from losses associated with casualty or theft, and deductions for depletion and depreciation.
The adjusted basis is calculated by taking the original cost, adding the cost for improvements and related expenses and taking away any deductions taken for depreciation and depletion.

## Adjusted basis model
Let's assume you buy a $150,000 home, paying $25,000 in cash and getting a $125,000 mortgage. While deciding the basis, begin with this $150,000 and add any associated fees, for example, real estate taxes the seller owed that you paid as part of the transaction. This figure is your basis.
To get your adjusted basis, add or deduct any associated costs or credits. For instance, assuming you invested $50,000 in home renovations, add this $50,000 to the basis to get an adjusted basis of $200,000. In the event that you had storm damage to your home and needed to pay $5,000 for rooftop repairs, add this amount to get an adjusted basis of $205,000.
Before you sell your rental property, decide its depreciation.
