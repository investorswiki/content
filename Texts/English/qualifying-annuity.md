# Qualifying Annuity
## What Is a Qualifying Annuity?

A qualifying annuity is like some other annuity, with the exception of the IRS has approved it for use inside a [Qualified Retirement Plan](/qrp) or [individual retirement account](/ira) (IRA). These annuities can be fixed, indexed, or variable relying on the plan support's investment objectives. As per [Employee Retirement Income Security Act](/erisa) (ERISA) rules, contributions made into a qualifying annuity are tax-deductible except if the plan or annuity has a [Roth](/rothira) feature.

## How a Qualifying Annuity Works

Qualifying annuities are not tax-deductible plans all by themselves; they must dwell inside a qualified plan or IRA to partake in this status. Qualifying annuities can be either the sole vehicle inside the plan or account, or they can be one of several different decisions that are offered too.

As a rule, the qualifying annuity is a variable contract and is the main vehicle offered inside the plan, with the variable subaccounts comprising the decisions accessible to plan participants.

## Types of Annuities
### Qualified and Non-Qualified

The products that go into qualified and non-qualified annuities are something similar. Notwithstanding, the rules for non-qualified annuities are unique, which is covered in IRS [publication 575](/irs-bar 575). One twist is that when a non-qualified annuity is partially or completely [surrendered](/give up period), the first dollars out are viewed as earnings for tax purposes and are hence taxed at ordinary income rates. When the earnings have been all removed, the excess cash — the original investment — can be taken out sans tax.

On the off chance that payments under a non-qualified plan are taken as periodic payments, part of every payment is treated as a return of the original investment for which no taxes are due. Part of the payout is considered [earnings](/earnings) and taxed at ordinary income rates. The exact percentages of earnings versus principal depend on the type of payout and the [beneficiary's](/recipient) age.

### Fixed and Variable

Annuities can be structured generally as either fixed or variable. [Fixed annuities](/fixedannuity) give ordinary periodic payments to the annuitant. [Variable annuities](/variableannuity) permit the owner to receive more huge future cash flows in the event that investments inside the annuity fund get along admirably and more modest payments assuming its investments do ineffectively. This accommodates less stable cash flow than a fixed annuity however permits the annuitant to receive the rewards of strong returns from their fund's investments.

## Special Considerations

There are numerous different contemplations, including sales fees, [commissions](/commission), and the length of the annuity. Regardless of whether an annuity is qualified, withdrawals before age 59\u00bd are subject to a 10% penalty. Since the non-qualified annuity is purchased with after-tax dollars, just the earnings would be subject to the penalty.
