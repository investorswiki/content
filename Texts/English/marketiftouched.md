# Market-If-Touched (MIT) Order
## What Is a Market-If-Touched (MIT) Order?

A market-if-touched (MIT) order is a [conditional order](/conditionalorder) that turns into a [market order](/marketorder) when a security arrives at a specified price, even if it does so just momentarily. While utilizing a buy market-if-touched order, a broker will hold on until the security arrives at the specified level before purchasing the asset. A sell market-if-touched order will [trigger](/trade-trigger) a market sell order when the security arrives at a specified sell price.

While a price is specified for when the market order will be sent, the real [fill](/fill) price of the order will differ in view of liquidity. Market orders take any price accessible once triggered, and accordingly may not fill at the specified price.

## Figuring out Market-If-Touched (MIT) Orders

A market-if-touched order permits investors to purchase or sell a security at an ideal value without actively monitoring the market. While like a stop order, MIT orders have a converse buy or sell activity compared to stop orders. For instance, a buy MIT order searches at the cost of an asset to fall while a [buy stop order](/buystoporder) initiates when the market value of the security increments past a specified level.

Assume that a stock is trading at $10.00 per share. As indicated by your analysis, the stock will be [undervalued](/undervalued) at $8.00 per share. You might place a MIT order at $8.00 per share. If the price moves to $8.00 or underneath — the trigger price — a market buy order will be conveyed and filled at the best price at that point. That price might be $8. It very well may be $8.02, $8.10, or $7.90, for instance. This means you can invest **near** the "undervalued" price without continually watching the market.

## Market-If-Touched Order Strategies

Market-if-touched orders are intended to exploit sudden or unexpected changes in price. When combined with stop or limit orders, these order types cover any scenario where you might wish to buy or sell shares in view of a [trigger price](/trade-trigger).

Short-term traders might be waiting at the cost to hit a key [support level](/support) before going into a [long position](/long). In this case, they can place a MIT buy order at the support level to naturally send a market purchase order once the price arrives at the support level. If the price doesn't arrive at the specified price, the order doesn't trigger and there is no trade.

Long-term investors might be waiting at the cost to arrive at a certain price where it could be "undervalued." In this case, they might place a MIT order at that price to naturally trigger a market buy order once the price arrives at the price level they consider to be undervalued.

As these models illustrate, market-if-touched orders are in many cases utilized related to different forms of [fundamental](/fundamentalanalysis) and [technical analysis](/technicalanalysis) that assist with setting a key trigger price. When that price is reached, the order type executes a market order, which is useful for people overseeing various opportunities, or the individuals who may not be promptly accessible to execute trades physically.

## Market-If-Touched Orders and Slippage

All market orders are subject to slippage. Slippage is getting a different price than expected on an order. For instance, expect that a trader places a MIT to sell a [thinly traded](/thinly-traded) stock at $50. If the stock doesn't ordinarily do a ton of [volume](/volume), there might be a large spread between the bid price and ask price.

Accept the [bid](/bid) is $49.80 and the [offer](/ask) is $50. If another person buys from the offer at $50 (touched) this will trigger the MIT sell order. Since it is a market order, it will search out the nearest bid to sell to. In this case, the order will fill at $49.80, expecting the bid quantity at $49.80 is of equivalent or greater size than the sell order.

If the sell order is larger than the quantity being bid at $49.80, then the market order will take every one of the shares at $49.80 and afterward keep searching for shares to sell to at lower prices. The next bid might be $49.71. The sell order will sell to those bids too, endeavoring to fill the remainder of the sell order. The interaction will keep, seeking out extra shares to sell to at lower prices, until the sell order is filled.

A similar interaction can happen while buying, where the trader winds up buying at a higher price than their trigger price.

It is likewise conceivable that the trader could see [price improvement](/priceimprovement) on their order, getting a better average price than the trigger price. This could occur if the price [gaps](/hole) through the trigger price. At the point when the stock re-opens the next trading day, the market order will be sent, possibly getting a greatly improved fill price than the trigger price.

## Illustration of a Market-If-Touched Order to Buy a Stock

Assume a trader takes a gander at a chart of Meta, formerly Facebook, (META) and concluded that they wanted to enter the stock if the price tumbles to $130. They could place a [limit order](/limitorder), which will place at a bid at $130 and will just fill at $130 or lower.

Our trader would rather not risk the price contacting $130, and afterward moving higher without their limit order at $130 being filled. So all things being equal they place a MIT with a trigger price of $130. If $130 is touched — a single order is handled at $130 — the MIT will initiate conveying a market buy order, taking anything price it can get. The offer when $130 is touched might be $130.10, in which case the market buy order will fill at $130.10.

The market order part of the MIT order demonstrates an earnestness with respect to the trader to get in. They would rather not pass up a great opportunity if their trigger price is touched. This means they might pay a marginally higher price than somebody utilizing a limit order at $130. The trade-off is that the MIT order is somewhat bound to be filled than the limit order.
