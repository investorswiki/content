# Retracement
  Retracement measures the percentage increase or diminishing a stock maneuvers in a similar bearing in the wake of hitting another high or low. For instance, if a stock maneuvers from a low of $50 to a high of $100 - - a 50-point rise - - then, at that point, it hits $75 - - a 25-point move from $100 - - the move from $100 to $75 (25 points), even however it's gone lower, really followed half of the original 50-point gain from $50 to $100.
Since $75 is higher than the $50 low - - however clearly not generally so high as $100 - - the stock is as yet considered as having advanced. Subsequently by hitting $75, the stock has backtracked half of the original gain to $100.
One more method for putting it (without the math) is: After an advance, a retracement is a decline that follows the path of (backtracks) a portion of the previous advance. After a decline, a retracement is an advance that backtracks a portion of the previous decline. Retracements normally cover 1/3 to 2/3 of the previous move.
