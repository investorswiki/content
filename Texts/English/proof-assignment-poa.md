# Proof of Assignment (PoA)
## What Is Proof of Assignment (PoA)?

Proof of Assignment (PoA) is a cryptographic [consensus mechanism](/consensus-mechanism-cryptocurrency) that requires less power and can run on somewhat low-end hardware compared to its forerunners. PoA claims to score higher than traditional consensus [algorithms](/algorithm) like Proof of Work (PoW) and Proof of Stake (PoS), which seem to consume more energy and require substantially really computing power and memory to function.

PoA's working mechanism allows regular [Internet of Things](/internet-things) (IoT) applications to be used for fundamental, limited-limit mining functions.

## Grasping Proof of Assignment (PoA)

A consensus mechanism is a shortcoming open minded algorithm that is utilized in distributed computer networks and [blockchain](/blockchain) applications to accomplish the fundamental agreement on a single data value or a single state of the network among decentralized processes or multi-specialist systems, for example, with [cryptocurrencies](/cryptocurrency). It is likewise helpful in record-keeping and planning among a series of distributed associated gadgets, for example, with the IoT.

Major household apparatuses, like vacuum cleaners, washing machines, and coolers, as well as other regularly utilized customer gadgets products, including smartwatches and printers, presently come fitted with advanced microprocessors, microcontrollers, and memory modules that are viable with interfacing with the internet and one another â€” the fundamental concept of the IoT. It makes these gadgets suitable for catching, processing, and trading data in [real-time](/real_time) with different systems and networks.

With their locally available processing power, IoT-viable gadgets can be used for cryptocurrency mining. Mining is a mathematical activity performed by computers through which new crypto coins are created and blockchain transactions are verified. Nonetheless, since the accessible memory and processing power in these gadgets is limited, their contribution to mining stays small. The working mechanism of the PoA algorithm works with this sort of "lightweight" mining.

## Illustration of Proof of Assignment (PoA)

One project utilizing PoA goes by the name of IOTW. IOTW claims it can handle a throughput of north of 1 million transactions each second, albeit this is not yet clear in practice.

The IOTW blockchain utilizes the PoA consensus algorithm and has presented [micro mining](/micro-mining-cryptocurrency), which allows for lightweight mining to be performed on IoT gadgets by killing the requirement for transaction ledger storage and maintenance at the gadget level. All things being equal, the ledger storage and maintenance is moved to at least one pre-laid out trusted [nodes](/ace node-cryptocurrency) on the blockchain network.

The asset compelled IoT gadgets perform the limited, affordable, and simple task of finding an eligible [hash](/hash) value, and send it over to the trusted node(s). These network nodes collect such transactional data transferred to them, approve it, and afterward make a block layout with a suitable number of approved transactions.

## Benefits of Proof of Assignment (PoA)

PoA offers many implied benefits. Household gadgets, right off the bat, can be used to add to mining, offering a realistic solution to issues of scalability and delayed transaction processing looked by present-day well known cryptocurrency networks.

What's more, gadget owners can schedule when their gadgets add to mining during the gadget's idle time. They may likewise enthusiastically share or sell the data produced and handled by their gadgets for earning crypto coins, as this data can be valuable to a diversified group of substances engaged with market research, study of consumption examples and town planning.

At long last, low power consumption keeps such mining contribution a sensibly conservative activity, contingent upon the network setup and working mechanism.

## Features
- PoA can allow simple gadgets to accomplish consensus as it is more efficient and less energy and asset subordinate than traditional PoW or PoS consensus algorithms.
- Proof of Assignment (PoA) is a cryptographic consensus algorithm used to affirm agreement on a distributed and decentralized network.
- Optimized for planning the state of gadgets associated with the Internet of Things (IoT), in PoA each IoT gadget is required to perform simple however vital cryptographic tasks, known as "Micro Mining."
