The Canada Pension Plan is like the [Social Security](/socialsecurity) program in the United States. It gives workers a series of regularly scheduled payments in retirement. The size of those payments relies upon an individual's earnings during their working years.

On June 20, 2016, Canada's priests of finance agreed to increase the CPP. The deal increased how much working Canadians would get from the CPP — from one-fourth of the employees' eligible earnings to one-third, with a lift to the earnings limit. Changes will be progressively eased in step by step more than seven years — from 2019 to 2025 — with the goal that the impact is estimated and piecemeal.

The enhancement has the following elements:

- The income replacement level will be raised to one-third of employees' income.
