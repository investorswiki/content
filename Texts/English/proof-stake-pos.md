# Proof-of-Stake (PoS)
Proof of Stake (PoS) is a consensus mechanism where block validators are chosen in view of the number of coins they are staking. In this case, the term staking alludes to the act of validators committing funds to the system. So validators can partake during the time spent delivering new blocks assuming they lock their coins.
The locked funds will then, at that point, act as [collateral](/collateral), implying that malicious validators will doubtlessly lose their stake and be removed from the network. Then again, legit validators will be rewarded as new blocks are created (manufactured). In this way, we might say that a PoS blockchain accomplishes distributed consensus as per the economic stake that validators focus on the network.
The PoS scheme was planned as an alternative to the Proof of Work (PoW) and, in that capacity, presents a couple of benefits and burdens. On PoW-based blockchains, as Bitcoin, the validators (diggers) must be [rewarded](/block-reward) in the event that they track down a legitimate solution for a cryptographic riddle. Such a solution makes them eligible to add the next block of transactions in the blockchain.
The Bitcoin network is secure in light of the fact that the mining system is profoundly competitive and exorbitant (requires a huge amount of calculation power). Notwithstanding, this is likewise one of the limitations of the PoW model since there is a ton of squandered resources that can't be utilized for anything more.
Conversely, blockchains that send the PoS model accomplish consensus in a cycle that chooses validators in view of a combination of factors. The implementation of block selection fluctuates, yet it generally considers the staking size "coin age" (how long coins are being staked). Generally speaking, the block selection utilizes a randomization mechanism, implying that validators alternate during the time spent manufacturing new blocks.
Dissimilar to PoW, the PoS model requires almost no calculation power, and validators can secure the network utilizing their individual machines as opposed to [specialized mining hardware](/asic). As an outcome, PoS systems can give increased levels of scalability, energy effectiveness, decentralization, and security.
Along with the traditional PoS model, there are likewise modified varieties, like the Leased Proof of Stake (LPoS) and the Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS) mechanisms. Other than that, we likewise have hybrid consensus systems, like the Hybrid PoW/PoS, which joins elements of both PoW and PoS models.

## Features
- The next block writer on the blockchain is chosen at random, with higher chances being assigned to hubs with bigger stake positions.
- While PoW mechanisms expect diggers to settle cryptographic riddles, PoS mechanisms require validators to hold and stake tokens basically.
- Proof-of-stake (POS) is viewed as safer in terms of the potential for an attack on the network, as it structures compensation such that makes an attack less profitable.
- With proof-of-stake (POS), cryptocurrency owners approve block transactions in view of the number of coins a validator stakes.
- Proof-of-stake (POS) was made as an alternative to Proof-of-work (POW), the original consensus mechanism used to approve a blockchain and add new blocks.
## FAQ
### Is Proof-of-Stake a Certificate?
Proof-of-stake is a consensus mechanism where cryptocurrency validators share the task of approving transactions. There are as of now no certificates issued.
### Will Bitcoin Be Converted to Proof-of-Stake?
It's possible that Bitcoin will change to proof-of-stake. Etherum started its presence utilizing PoW and is changing to PoS, yet the cycle can require a very long time to carry out in a generally settled cryptocurrency.
### What Is Proof-of-Stake versus Proof-of-Work?
Proof of Stake (POS) utilizes randomly chosen diggers to approve transactions. Proof of Work (POW) utilizes a competitive validation method to affirm transactions and add new blocks to the blockchain.
### How Do You Earn Proof-of-Stake?
Proof of Stake (POS) is an inherent consensus mechanism that is utilized by a cryptocurrency's network or validators. It can't be earned, yet you can assist with getting a network and earn rewards by utilizing a cryptocurrency client that partakes in PoS approving or turning into a validator.
