# Multinomial Distribution
## What Is the Multinomial Distribution?

The multinomial distribution is the type of [probability distribution](/probabilitydistribution) utilized in finance to determine things, for example, the probability a company will report [better-than-anticipated earnings](/earningssurprise) while contenders report disheartening earnings. The term depicts ascertaining the outcomes of analyses including independent occasions which have at least two potential, defined outcomes. The more widely known [binomial distribution](/binomialdistribution) is a special type of multinomial distribution where there are just two potential outcomes, like true/bogus or heads/tails.

In finance, analysts utilize the multinomial distribution to estimate the likelihood of a given set of outcomes happening.

## Figuring out Multinomial Distribution

The multinomial distribution applies to tests in which the accompanying conditions are true:

- The examination comprises of rehashed trials, for example, rolling a kick the bucket five times rather than just once.
- Every trial must be independent of the others. For instance, assuming you roll two dice, the outcome of one bite the dust doesn't impact the outcome of the other pass on.
- The likelihood of every outcome must be a similar across each occurrence of the examination. For instance, in the event that a fair, six-sided bite the dust is utilized, there must be a one of every six chance of each number being given on each roll.
- Every trial must deliver a specific outcome, like a number somewhere in the range of two and 12 if rolling two six-sided dice.

Remaining with dice, assume we run an examination in which we roll two dice 500 times. Our goal is to compute the likelihood that the analysis will deliver the accompanying outcomes across the 500 trials:

- The outcome will be "2" in 15% of the trials;
- The outcome will be "5" in 12% of the trials;
- The outcome will be "7" in 17% of the trials; and
- The outcome will be "11" in 20% of the trials.

The multinomial distribution would permit us to work out the likelihood that the above combination of outcomes will happen. Albeit these numbers were picked randomly, a similar type of analysis can be performed for significant examinations in science, investing, and different areas.

## Certifiable Example of the Multinomial Distribution

In investing, a portfolio manager or financial analyst could utilize the multinomial distribution to estimate the likelihood of (a) a [small-cap](/small-cap) index outflanking a [large-cap](/huge cap) index 70% of the time, (b) the enormous cap index outflanking the small-cap index 25% of the time, and (c) the [indexes](/index) having something similar (or rough) return 5% of the time.

In this scenario, the trial could occur over a full year of trading days, utilizing data from the market to check the outcomes. Assuming the likelihood of this set of outcomes is adequately high, the investor may be enticed to make a [overweight](/overweight) investment in the small-cap index.

## Highlights
- It's a likelihood distribution utilized in tries different things with at least two factors.
- The multinomial distribution is widely utilized in science and finance to estimate the likelihood of a given set of outcomes happening.
- There are various types of multinomial distributions, including the binomial distribution, which includes explores different avenues regarding just two factors.
- The multinomial distribution is utilized in finance to estimate the likelihood of a given set of outcomes happening, for example, the probability a company will report surprisingly good earnings while its rivals report disheartening earnings.
