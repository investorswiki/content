## What Is Industrial Organization?

Industrial organization is a field of economics dealing with the strategic behavior of firms, regulatory policy, [antitrust](/antitrust) policy and market competition. Industrial organization applies the economic [theory of price](/theory-of-price) to industries. Market analysts and different scholastics who study industrial organization look to increase comprehension of the methods by which industries operate, work on industries' contributions to economic welfare, and further develop government policy corresponding to these industries.

The "industrial" in industrial organization alludes to any huge scale business activity, like the travel industry or farming â€” not just manufacturing. Industrial organization is likewise now and again alluded to as "industrial economy."

## Grasping Industrial Organization

The study of industrial organization expands on the [theory of the firm](/theory-firm), a set of economic hypotheses that depict, make sense of and endeavor to foresee the idea of a firm in terms of its presence, behavior, structure and its relationship to the market.

In a 1989 paper, financial specialists Bengt Holmstrom and Jean Tirole suggested two simple conversation starters for a theory of the firm. The primary inquiry was the reason do firms exist, meaning what is the need that they fill in society or an economic system. The subsequent inquiry succeeds the first and connects with deciding the scale and scope of their operations.

Replies to these two inquiries form the basis of Industrial organization economics. Most importantly, industrial organization centers around how markets and industries rival each other by calculating in genuine entanglements, for example, government intervention in the marketplace, transaction costs, barriers to entry and that's just the beginning.

Some accept that since microeconomics centers around markets and how they operate, industrial organization is a subset of it. Rather, industrial organization is defined by its accentuation on market collaborations, for example, price competition, product putting, advertising, research and development and the sky is the limit from there.

All the more relevantly, the study of [oligopolies](/oligopoly) (where a modest bunch of big players overwhelm a market) gives industrial organization its justification behind being (though microeconomics centers around [perfect competition](/perfectcompetition) or extreme syndications).

As per a Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) white paper, it is simpler to give an illustration of industrial organization than it is to characterize it, however the white paper's creators actually managed to concoct this description: the "economics of imperfect competition." The imperfect competition referred to in this description leads to several inquiries connecting with the achievement or failure of a product or an organization. By examining the factors that contributed to progress or failure, industrial organization endeavors to respond to these inquiries.

## Industrial Organization Areas of Study

The following is a sample listing of points that the study of industrial organization can zero in on:

- [Market power](/market-power)
- Product differentiation
- Price separation
- Durable goods and experience goods
- Secondary markets and their relationship with primary markets
- [Collusion](/collusion)
- Flagging
- Mergers and acquisitions
- Antitrust and competition
- Industrial policy

## Industrial Organization and Policy

Several organizations exist to advance research and joint effort on the study of industrial organization. One such organization is the Industrial Organization Society (IOS), established in 1972 by Stanley Boyle and Willard Mueller to advance research on antitrust policy, regulatory policy, and competition and market power in certifiable markets. The **Review of Industrial Organization** is the official journal of the IOS. Alongside Northeastern University, the IOS has sponsored an annual International Industrial Organization Conference starting around 2003.

## Illustration of Industrial Organization

As referenced before, industrial organization is worried about breaking down industries and deciding responses connected with their development.

For instance, consider the smartphone industry. Apple Inc. (AAPL)) was the principal company to make smartphones in an appealing design and load it with highlights for the average consumer. In any case, the product's price - $499 for 4GB and $599 for 8GB - was restrictively costly. To guarantee mainstream adoption without scratching its profit edges, the Cupertino company tied up with network suppliers to settle the cost of a smartphone throughout some undefined time frame.

Apple's sales were on a vertical curve until Google and Samsung went along. They took advantage of the demand for smartphones by offering less expensive adaptations, loaded with comparable elements, into the market. The competition ended up being great for the overall industry and, over the long run, the gadget's market expanded past the United States. It envelops major markets in developed and emerging nations. The number of smartphone manufacturers has likewise detonated.

This genuinely simple account of the smartphone industry's growth brings about several inquiries.

Here are some:

- For what reason were Apple's telephones costly?
- What innovation did Samsung and Google attempt in the manufacturing system to make telephones less expensive?
- How and for what reason did network suppliers consent to the partnership with smartphone manufacturers?
- How did Apple endeavor to protect its turf and for what reason did it fail?
- What regulation contributed to the smartphone industry's prosperity?

Industrial organization studies such inquiries and endeavors to respond to them.

## Features
- It includes a study of various areas, from market power to product differentiation to industrial policy, that influence a firm's operations.
- Industrial organization is an analysis of factors, operational etc., that add to a firm's overall strategy and product placement.
