# Basis Trading
## What is Basis Trading?

With regards to futures trading, the term basis trading alludes generally to those trading strategies worked around the difference between the spot price of a commodity and the price of a futures contract for that equivalent commodity. This difference, in futures trading, is alluded to as the basis. Assuming that a trader anticipates that this difference should develop, the trade they will start would be termed "[long the basis](/long_on_the_basis)", and on the other hand, a trader enters "[short the basis](/shortthebasis)" when they conjecture that the difference will diminish.

## Understanding Basis Trading

Basis trading is common across futures commodities markets where producers hope to hedge the cost of production against the anticipated sale of the commodity they are delivering. The commonplace trade comes when one is halfway through a production cycle and hopes to lock in a good price for their product.

For instance, assume a corn rancher was two months from conveying a crop of corn and seen how ideal the weather patterns had been, that rancher could become worried about a potential price drop coming about because of an oversupply of corn. The rancher could sell an adequate number of futures contracts to cover the amount of corn he would have liked to sell. In the event that the spot price of the corn were $4.00 per bushel, and the futures contract that expired two months out were trading at $4.25 a bushel, then, at that point, the rancher could now lock in a price with +.25 penny basis. The rancher, as of now, is making a trade that is short the basis, since he is expecting the price of the futures contract to fall and subsequently draw nearer to the spot price.

The speculator who takes the contrary side of this trade will have purchased futures contracts for 25 pennies for each bushel higher than the spot price (the basis). Assuming that that speculator hedged their bet by selling contracts at the spot price ($4.00 per bushel), they would now have a position that is long the basis. That is on the grounds that they are protected from price developments in one or the other heading, yet they need to see the current month contract become even more affordable relative to the contract that lapses two-months after the fact. This speculator might be expecting that in spite of the great climate and positive developing conditions, consumer demand for ethanol and feed grain will overpower even the best supply expectations.

## Basis Trading in Practice

Basis trading is common among agricultural futures on account of the idea of these commodities. In any case, graining contracts isn't limited. However grain is a substantial commodity, and the grain market has a number of unique characteristics, basis trading is finished for precious metals, interest rate products, and indexes too.

In each case the factors are unique, however the strategies continue as before: a trader endeavors to benefit from an increase (long) or a reduction (short) in the basis amount. Such changes are not connected with real changes in supply and demand, yet rather the anticipation of such changes. Basis trading takes part in a sophisticated game of attempting to expect changes in the expectations of hedgers and speculators.

Basis trading, or the basis, as depicted here connecting with futures contracts, is a totally unexpected concept in comparison to the basis price or [cost basis](/costbasis) of a given security. The difference between these expressions and a futures trading basis ought not be confounded.

## Features
- The basis, in futures trading, isn't to be mistaken for the terms "basis price" or "cost basis" which are unrelated to the setting of basis trading.
- Basis trading endeavors to benefit from changes in the basis of futures contract prices.
- The basis is the difference between the spot price of a commodity and a futures contract that terminates at least two months after the fact.
