The current law, after a number of amendments, incorporates several social insurance and social welfare programs, including the issuance of Social Security benefits. Still up in the air by a specific set of criteria issued by the [Social Security Administration](/ssa) (SSA).

All payroll taxes under the [Federal Insurance Contributions Act](/fica) (FICA) or the [Self Employed Contributions Act](/seca) (SECA) (for self-employed individuals) fund Social Security and its benefits.

The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) collects tax deposits and officially entrusts them to the [Social Security Trust Fund](/social-security-trust-fund), which is actually comprised of two separate funds: the [Old-Age and Survivors Insurance (OASI) Trust Fund](/old-age-and-survivors-insurance-trust-fund) and the [Disability Insurance Trust Fund](/disability-insurance-trust-fund).

Next, your AIME is utilized to show up at your [primary insurance amount](/primary-insurance-amount) (PIA), the month to month amount you can start to collect when you arrive at full retirement age.

For individuals brought into the world in 1938 or later, the full retirement age progressively increases from 65 until it hits 67 for those brought into the world after 1959.
