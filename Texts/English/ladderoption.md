# Ladder Option
## What Is a Ladder Option?

A ladder option is a [exotic option](/exoticoption) that locks in partial profits once the underlying asset arrives at foreordained price levels or "rungs." This guarantees at any rate some profit, even if the underlying asset [retraces](/retracement) past these levels before the option terminates. Ladder options come in put and call assortments.

Try not to befuddle ladder options, which are specific types of [options contracts](/optionscontract), with long call ladders, long put ladders, and their short partners, which are options strategies that include buying and selling numerous options contracts at the same time.

## How a Ladder Option Works

Ladder options are like traditional option contracts that give the holder the right, however not the obligation to buy or sell the [underlying asset](/underlying-asset) at a foreordained price at or by a foreordained date. Nonetheless, a ladder option adds a feature that permits the holder to lock in partial profits at foreordained spans.

These spans are fittingly called "rungs" and the more rungs the price of the underlying asset crosses, the more profit locks in. The holder keeps profits in view of the highest bar accomplished (for calls) or the least bar accomplished (for puts) notwithstanding assuming the price of the underlying crosses back below (for calls) or above (for puts) those rungs before [expiration](/expirationdate).

Since the holder acquires non-returnable partial profits as the trade creates, total risk is a lot of lower than for traditional [vanilla options.](/vanillaoption) The trade-off, of course, is that ladder options are more costly than comparable vanilla options.

## Illustration of a Ladder Option

Consider a ladder [call option](/calloption) where the underlying asset price is 50 and the [strike price](/strikeprice) is 55. Rungs are set at 60, 65, and 70. Assuming the underlying price arrives at 62, the profit locks in at 5 (rung minus strike or 60 - 55). On the off chance that the underlying arrives at 71, the locked in profit increments to 15 (new crosspiece minus strike or 70 - 55), even assuming the underlying falls below these levels before the expiration date.

Similarly as with vanilla options, there is [time value](/timevalue) associated with ladder options. Consequently, the traded price for call options is generally over the [locked in profit](/lock_in_profits) amount, and declining as the expiration date draws near.

If the price of the underlying falls below any of the set off rungs, again for calls, it nearly doesn't make any difference to the price of the option in light of the fact that the partial profit is guaranteed. Albeit, this is a distortion in light of the fact that the lower the underlying moves below the highest set off rung, the more uncertain it will be to rally back to surpass that bar and arrive at the next rung.
