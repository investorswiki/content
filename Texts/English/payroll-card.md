# Payroll Card
## What is a payroll card?
While employers used to just pay with a money order or direct deposit into a worker's bank account, some are embracing new technology and utilizing payroll cards all things considered. The worker's salary is loaded onto a plastic card like a debit or credit card.
## More profound definition
A payroll card works the same way a debit or credit card or debit card does and is issued by the very payment processors that issue credit cards like MasterCard and Visa.
Payroll cards are accepted anyplace these credit cards are accepted. When your employer issues you a payroll card, your salary is loaded onto it every payday, meaning you don't need to get another card each pay period.
Along these lines, a payroll card is like a prepaid card. You can get cash from your card by bringing it into a bank and telling the bank teller how much money you need, similar as getting a cash advance from of a credit card.
