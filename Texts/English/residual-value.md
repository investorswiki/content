# Residual Value
## What Is Residual Value?

The residual value, otherwise called [salvage value](/salvagevalue), is the estimated value of a fixed asset toward the finish of its lease term or helpful life. In lease circumstances, the lessor involves the residual value as one of its primary methods for determining how much the lessee pays in periodic lease payments. When in doubt, the more drawn out the helpful life or lease period of an asset, the lower its residual value.

For investments, the residual value is calculated as the difference among profits and the cost of capital.

In accounting, owner's equity is the residual net assets after the deduction of liabilities. In the field of arithmetic, explicitly in regression analysis, the residual value is found by deducting the anticipated value from the noticed or estimated value.

## Instances of Residual Value

If you [lease](/lease) a vehicle for quite some time, its residual value is the amount it is worth following three years.

Moreover, consider the case of a business owner whose desk has a valuable life of seven years. How much the desk is worth toward the finish of seven years (its [fair market value](/fairmarketvalue) as determined by agreement or appraisal) is its residual value, otherwise called salvage value.

## Residual Value versus Resale Value

Residual value and resale value are two terms that are many times utilized while examining vehicle buying and leasing terms.

For instance, residual might be communicated along these lines: $30,000 MSRP * Residual Value of half = $15,000 value following 3 years. Thus, a vehicle with a MSRP of $30,000 and a residual value of half following three years would be worth $15,000 toward the finish of its lease.

Resale value is a comparable concept, however it alludes to a vehicle that has been purchased, as opposed to leased. So resale value alludes to the value of a purchased vehicle after depreciation, mileage, and damage. While residual value is pre-determined and based on MSRP, the resale value of a vehicle can change based on market conditions.

## Computing Depreciation/Amortization Using Residual Value

Residual value likewise considers along with a company's calculation of depreciation or amortization. Assume a company obtains another software program to follow sales orders inside. This software has an initial value of $10,000 and a helpful life of five years. To compute yearly amortization for the end goal of accounting, the owner requirements the software's residual value, or what it is worth toward the finish of the five years.

Accept this value is zero and the company utilizes the straight-line method to amortize the software. In this way, the company must deduct the residual value of zero from the $10,000 initial value and separation by the asset's helpful life of five years to show up at its yearly amortization, which is $2,000. Assuming the residual value were $2,000, the yearly amortization would be $1,600 ($10,000 - $2,000/5 years).

For substantial assets, like cars, PCs, and machinery, a business owner would utilize a similar calculation, just as opposed to amortizing the asset over its valuable life, he would devalue it. The initial value minus the residual value is likewise alluded to as the "depreciable base."
