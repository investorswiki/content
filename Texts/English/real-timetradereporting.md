## What Is Real-Time Trade Reporting?

Real-time trade reporting alludes to a regulatory requirement that [market makers](/marketmaker) (MMs) publicly report every transaction following it is completed. Real-time trade reporting further develops proficiency and transparency in the market.

Real-time trade reporting ought not be mistaken for [real-time quotes](/real-time-quote) (RTQs), which rather give bid and offer data about an asset's price and doesn't report trade subtleties or trading activity.

## Seeing Real-Time Trade Reporting

Real-time trade reporting is a requirement for market creators to report a transaction in something like 90 seconds of its execution publicly. Traded stocks are subject to real\u00ad-time trade reporting, and such reporting is implemented by the Financial Industry Regulatory Agency ([FINRA](/finra)), formerly known as the National Association of Securities Dealers ([NASD](/nasd)).

FINRA is a private corporation that acts as a self-regulatory organization. A non-governmental organization manages member exchange markets and brokerage firms. The government agency that acts as the ultimate regulator of the securities industry, including FINRA, is the Securities and Exchange Commission ([SEC](/sec)).

Real-time trade reporting is kept in the Trade Reporting and Compliance Engine ([TRACE](/trace)). TRACE furnishes individual investors and market experts with access to data on practically all [over-the-counter](/otc) (OTC) public and private trading activity. The TRACE program offers a consolidation of transaction data for public and private corporate bonds and agency debt, which incorporates asset-backed securities and mortgage-backed securities.

The TRACE system requires execution time to be reported as Eastern Time in Military Format. The TRACE Rules likewise require regulatory reports to be made in Eastern Time, even on the off chance that this means changing over both the time and date of execution to Eastern Time. Firms, nonetheless, are not required to affirm to their customers a trade date or execution time that is in Eastern Time.

## Why Real-Time Reporting Matters

Price transparency alludes to the availability of data about the [bid](/bid) and ask prices, as well as trading amounts, for a specific stock. Price transparency matters since understanding what others are bidding, asking, and trading can assist with deciding the supply and demand of a security, great, or service, and further decide its true value. Assuming the data ends up being lacking or inaccessible, that specific market might be considered inefficient.

At its core, [market efficiency](/marketefficiency) measures the availability of market data to give the maximum number of opportunities for buyers and venders of securities to effect transactions without expanding [transaction](/transaction) costs. A lack of price transparency puts consumers and investors in a difficult spot. For instance, in healthcare, patients frequently don't have the foggiest idea what a specific medical system really costs, leaving them without much, if any, opportunity to arrange a better price.
