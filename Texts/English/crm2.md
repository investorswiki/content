# CRM2
## What Is CRM2?

CRM2, short for Client Relationship Model 2, alludes to rules for Canadian investment dealers and advisors that require greater transparency about the cost and performance of client accounts. The regulations, which were completely executed in mid-2017, were the second phase of a change of the client relationship model by the [Canadian Securities Administrators (CSA)](/csa). The CSA is the umbrella organization that blends regulations across Canada's areas and domains. CRM2 is useful since it further develops how financial data is revealed to investors.

## How CRM2 Works

CRM2 is intended to make greater transparency for Canadian investors by furnishing them with a reasonable gander at their account performance and the costs required to accomplish that performance. The two reports that must be remembered for a financial backer's portfolio are as follows:

### Investment Performance Report

The new disclosures under CRM2 incorporate a clearer account performance report utilizing standard measurement periods. The report is intended to assist investors with perceiving how their portfolio is performing and the way in which that performance connects with their long-term financial objectives.

The return on the account will be reported utilizing a [money-weighted rate of return](/money-weighted-return) to give a more personal perspective on a financial backer's progress towards their financial objectives. MWR is a comprehensive method of computing a portfolio's rate of return since all cash flow debits and credits are factored into the calculation. Those cash flow changes could incorporate [dividends](/profit), withdrawals, deposits, and the sale price of the security.

### Cost Report

The summary cost report shows the last 12 months of fees, including an itemized rundown of any charges to the account. One of the most fascinating changes due to CRM2 is the introduction of fees in terms of dollars paid as opposed to as rates. In spite of the fact that there is no mathematical difference between the two styles, seeing fees in dollars interestingly — especially on the off chance that the accounts have not performed well — may cause sticker shock for a few Canadian investors.

For instance, a fund that charges a 1% fee probably won't give off an impression of being large chunk of change. In any case, on the off chance that a financial backer's return is 5% and they're being charged 1% each year, following several years it can amount to a considerable cost that diminishes the long-term rate of return on the fund. Uncovering the costs in dollars gives greater lucidity to investors so they can see the actual cost year-to-year. Some investment funds and advisors can without much of a stretch charge 2% to 3% in fees every year, no matter what the fund's performance.

## What CRM2 Means for Investment Advisors

With fees being made explicit in dollar terms, Canadian investment advisors need to show that they are offering some benefit for the fees that they charge. There might actually be many Canadian investors who begin seeing lower-cost options, for example, [robo-advisors](/roboadvisor-roboadviser), which have no human association in investment selection. Investors could likewise opt for low-cost [passively managed](/passivemanagement) portfolios. A passive fund is a basket of securities where a portfolio manager isn't actively buying and selling securities. In many cases, a passive fund could follow a stock index, for example, the [S&P 500](/sp500). Numerous [exchange-exchanged funds (ETFs)](/etf) are passively managed.

There is, of course, likewise an opportunity for high performing advisors to involve CRM2 as a method for pulling in clients from poor performing contenders. Be that as it may, on the off chance that an advisor isn't offering some incentive for the fees they're charging, then, at that point, CRM2 could be terrible information for them. Regulators contend that while the act of making sense of and legitimize their fees to clients might be difficult, advisors ought to currently have the option to make sense of and legitimize their value.

## What CRM2 Means for Investors

Canadian investors as of now could figure outperformance and costs all alone, however it was a longer and more complex cycle than it ought to have been. CRM2 accomplishes crafted by working out direct and indirect costs, as well as standardizing performance reporting. For investors, CRM2 makes it simpler to assess the value that they're getting from their advisors.

The simplicity of evaluation additionally opens the door for comparison shopping while searching for investment counsel. As such, CRM2 assists with furnishing investors with pursuing more-informed decisions about their investments.

## CRM2 versus MFDA

In mid-2018, the [Mutual Fund Dealers Association of Canada (MFDA)](/mutual-fund-dealers-association) distributed a discussion paper that supported for the disclosure of total fund costs to clients on top of the CRM2 disclosures. Certain investments that are not securities are not required to be remembered for the CRM2 reporting, for example, a [GIC or guaranteed investment certificate](/gic), which is like a U.S. certificate of deposit. Such disclosure would enable clients to settle on better investing choices. This disclosure, illustrated in a MFDA bulletin named "Discussion Paper on Expanding Cost Reporting," would increase present expectations compared to CRM2.
