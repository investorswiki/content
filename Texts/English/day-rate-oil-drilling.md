# Day Rate (Oil Drilling)
## What Is the Day Rate (Oil Drilling)?

Day rate alludes to all in daily costs of renting a drilling rig. The operator of a drilling project pays a day rate to the drilling contractor who gives the rig, the drilling work force and other [incidentals](/incidentalexpenses). The oil companies and the drilling contractors typically settle on a flat fee for each contract, so the day rate is determined by separating the total value of the contract by the number of days in the contract.

## Step by step instructions to Calculate Day Rate (Oil Drilling)

To ascertain the [day rate](/dayrate) (oil drilling), partition the total value of the contract by the number of days in the contract.

## What Does Day Rate (Oil Drilling) Tell You?

Day rate (oil drilling) is a metric that investors in the oil and gas industry watch to assess the overall wellbeing of the industry. The day rate makes up generally half the cost of an oil [well](/exploratory-well). Of course, the price of oil is the main measurement by a wide margin in the oil and gas industry.

All things considered, investors can gain experiences into the oil [supply and demand](/law-of-supply-demand) picture by watching metrics like day rate and [rig utilization](/rig-utilization-rate-rur) notwithstanding global inventories. Day rate changes, which can be wide, are utilized by investors as an indicator of the wellbeing of the drilling market. For instance, on the off chance that day rates fall, investors might accept it as a sign to exit oil and gas positions.

> - The day rate incorporates the cost of drilling an oil well, including the cost to run the rig, supplies, and employees.
> - These costs generally make up half the total cost of an oil well.
> - Will in general have a positive correlation with oil prices and rig utilization rates.

## Illustration of How to Use Day Rate (Oil Drilling)

Day rates can be utilized to evaluate the current demand for oil, at last shining understanding into where oil prices are going. An increase in the price of oil increases the number of projects that can recuperate their extraction costs, making troublesome developments and unconventional oil reserves doable to remove. The more projects greenlit on an economic basis, the more competition there is for the finite number of oil rigs accessible for rent - so the day rate rises. At the point when oil prices falter and fall, the day rate that rigs can command drops.

To act as an illustration of real day rates - Transocean marked a contract in December 2018 with Chevron to give drilling services. The contract is for one rig, will span five years and is worth $830 million. The effective day rate for the rig is $455,000:

## The Difference Between Day Rate (Oil Drilling) and Utilization Rate

Like the day rate, the rig utilization rate is a key measurement for determining the overall soundness of the oil and gas sector. The day rate spreads out a large part of the costs of drilling a well, while the utilization rate is the number of wells that are being utilized.

Investors utilize both of these metrics and a fall in each could signal a slowdown in oil demand. High utilization rates mean a company is utilizing a large part of its fleet, proposing oil demand, and at last, oil prices are on the rise. There is a positive correlation between oil prices and both day rates and rig utilization.

## Limitations of Using Day Rate (Oil Drilling)

The strength of the [correlation](/correlation) between oil prices and day rates isn't reliable. The correlation is strong when oil prices and rig utilization are both high. In this situation, day rates increase practically in lockstep with prices. In an environment of rising oil prices and high utilization, the day rates in a long-term contract will shoot up even quicker than short term contracts as rig operators demand a premium for being locked in on a project.

In a low price environment with falling utilization, nonetheless, the day rate might plunge a lot quicker than the oil prices as rigs enter low offers on long contracts just to keep occupied in a likely slowdown. Due to the [volatility](/volatility) and the changing strength of the correlation, investors and traders can flip between seeing day rates as a leading or a lagging indicator at oil costs and the soundness of the oil and gas industry as a whole.
