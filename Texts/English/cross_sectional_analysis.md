# Cross-Sectional Analysis
## What is Cross-Sectional Analysis?

Cross-sectional analysis is a type of analysis where an investor, [analyst](/analyst) or [portfolio manager](/portfoliomanager) compares a specific company to its industry peers.

Cross-sectional analysis is in many cases sent trying to survey performance and investment opportunities utilizing data points that are past the standard [balance sheet](/balancesheet) numbers.

## How Cross-Sectional Analysis Works

While conducting a cross-sectional analysis, the analyst utilizes comparative metrics to distinguish the [valuation](/valuation), debt-load, future outlook or potentially [operational efficiency](/operationalefficiency) of a target company. This permits the analyst to assess the target company's effectiveness in these areas, and to settle on the best investment decision among a group of competitors inside the industry as a whole.

Analysts carry out a cross-sectional analysis to recognize special qualities inside a group of comparable organizations, as opposed to lay out connections. Frequently cross-sectional analysis will stress a specific area, for example, a company's [war chest](/warchest), to uncover hidden areas of strength and weakness in the sector. This type of analysis depends on information-assembling and tries to comprehend the "what" rather than the "why."

## The Difference Between Cross-Sectional Analysis and Time Series Analysis

Cross-sectional analysis is one of the two all-encompassing comparison methods for stock analysis. Cross-sectional analysis sees data collected at a single point in time, as opposed to throughout some stretch of time. The analysis starts with the foundation of research objectives and the definition of the factors that an analyst needs to measure. The next step is to distinguish the cross-segment, like a group of friends or an industry, and to set the specific point in time being assessed. The last step is to conduct analysis, in view of the cross-segment and the factors, and reach a resolution on the performance of a company or organization. Basically, cross-sectional analysis shows an investor which company is best given the metrics she cares about.

Time series analysis, otherwise called trend analysis, centers in around a single company after some time. In this case, the company is being decided with regards to its past performance. Time series analysis shows an investor whether the company is improving or more regrettable than before by the measures she cares about. Frequently these will be works of art like [earning per share (EPS)](/eps), debt-to-equity, [free cash flow](/freecashflow, etc. In practice, investors will for the most part utilize a combination of time series analysis and cross-sectional analysis before settling on a choice. For instance, taking a gander at the EPS extra time and afterward likewise checking the industry benchmark EPS.
