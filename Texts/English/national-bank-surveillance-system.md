# National Bank Surveillance System (NBSS)
## What Was the National Bank Surveillance System (NBSS)?

The National Bank Surveillance System (NBSS) was a computerized monitoring system developed to collect data and assess the [financial performance](/financialperformance) of [national banks](/national-bank). The off-site surveillance system was first settled by the U.S. [Office of the Comptroller of the Currency](/office-comptroller-currency-occ) (OCC), a federal agency that regulates the execution of laws connecting with national banks, in 1975. The OCC has phased out its utilization of the NBSS and supplanted it with the Uniform Bank Performance Report (UBPR).

## Grasping the National Bank Surveillance System

The National Bank Surveillance System (NBSS) went about as an early warning system. Its task is to recognize [banks](/bank) showing indications of financial difficulty, cautioning regulators with the goal that they can make a move and step in before the situation turns monstrous.

The National Bank Surveillance System's (NBSS) primary tool was its quarterly Bank Performance Report, which compares each bank to a group of its [peers](/peer-group) to foster an accurate image of how they are separately faring. Data was frequently obtained from [Call Reports](/callreport), financial wellbeing refreshes that banks are committed to file on a [quarterly](/quarter) basis.

The off-site surveillance system dissected and predicted [capitalization ratios](/capitalization-ratios), [equity](/equity) ratios, and other quantifiable snippets of data to endeavor to comprehend which banks are at risk for disappointment. Preferably, the National Bank Surveillance System (NBSS) would inform the OCC of any red banners before it is too late.

The purpose of the OCC is, as its maxim broadcasts, "guaranteeing a safe and sound national banking system for all Americans." The OCC [charters](/corporatecharter), regulates, and directs all U.S. national banks, directing nearby audits and tough oversight of their operations. As indicated by the OCC, banks are regularly subject to a full-scope, on location examination each 12 or 18 months. In theory, banks featured by the National Bank Surveillance System (NBSS) system as showing distress ought to have their on location [examinations](/bank-examination) pushed forward to a previous date.

## History of the National Bank Surveillance System

The National Bank Surveillance System (NBSS) made its presentation after the disappointment of two national banks in the mid 1970s. The OCC, facing significant investigation for not predicting these deficiencies, charged a study to be led by accounting firm Haskins and Sells. The report, issued in 1975, suggested that banks give more updates and supported the creation of a computerized off-site system, noticing that the cost and troublesomely of dissecting Call Reports through computer had dropped fundamentally over the course of the last decade.

Then the [savings and loan (S&L) crisis](/sl-crisis) reared its head. Somewhere in the range of 1986 and 1995, a bigger number of than 1,000 savings and loan associations in the United States imploded. This overwhelming chain of occasions made plainly off-site surveillance was not adequate to accurately predict bank disappointment and ought not be a substitute for continuous, periodic on location examinations.

Studies since the 1980s have found that regular on location examinations settle on for more accurate Decision Reports, as they permit bank examiners to examine [loans](/loan) closely and urge banks to report loan losses in a more ideal fashion.

Changes to the National Bank Surveillance System (NBSS) during the 1990s permitted regulators to all the more closely monitor banks between periodic on location examinations to decide if an extra, unscheduled examination was justified to keep an eye on a specific bank. In the long run, the National Bank Surveillance System (NBSS) was changed into the Uniform Bank Surveillance System (UBSS), and the Bank Performance Report turned into the [Uniform Bank Performance Report](/uniform-bank-perf) (UBPR).

## Features
- The NBSS's quarterly Bank Performance Report compared each bank to a group of its friends, making it simpler to spot those showing indications of financial difficulty.
- Computerized systems empowered regulators to rapidly and systematically dissect the colossal measures of data that banks report on their Call Reports.
- The National Bank Surveillance System (NBSS) was a computerized monitoring system developed to collect data and assess the financial performance of national banks.
- The off-site surveillance system was made in 1975 by the U.S. Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC). The OCC presently utilizes the UBPR all things considered.
