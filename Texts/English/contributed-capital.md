## What Is Contributed Capital?

Contributed capital, otherwise called [paid-in capital](/paidincapital), is the cash and different assets that shareholders have given a company in exchange for stock. Investors make capital contributions when a company issues equity shares in light of a price that shareholders are willing to pay for them. The total amount of contributed capital or paid-in-capital addresses their stake or ownership in the company.

Contributed capital may likewise allude to a company's balance sheet thing listed under stockholders' equity, frequently displayed alongside the balance sheet entry for extra paid-in capital.

## Understanding Contributed Capital

Contributed capital is the total value of the stock that shareholders have bought directly from the issuing company. It includes the money from initial public offerings (IPOs), direct listings, direct public offerings, and secondary offerings — including issues of preferred stock. It likewise includes the receipt of fixed assets in exchange for stock and the reduction of a liability in exchange for stock.

Contributed capital can measure up to extra paid-in capital, and the difference between the two values will rise to the premium paid by investors well beyond the [par value](/parvalue) of the company's shares. The par value is just an accounting value of every one of the shares to be offered and isn't equivalent to the market value that investors are willing to pay.

> At the point when companies repurchase shares and return capital to shareholders, the shares bought back are listed at their repurchase price, which diminishes shareholders' equity.

[Preferred shares](/inclination shares) some of the time have par values that are more than marginal, yet most common shares today have par values of just a couple of pennies. Along these lines, "extra paid-in capital" will in general be representative of the total paid-in capital figure and is in some cases shown without anyone else on the balance sheet.

### Capital Contributions

It's important to distinguish that capital contributions, which are an injection of cash into a company, can come in different forms other than the sale of equity shares. For instance, an owner could apply for a line of credit and utilize the proceeds to make a capital contribution to the company. Businesses can likewise receive capital contributions in the form of non-cash assets like buildings and equipment. These situations are a wide range of capital contributions and increase owners' equity. In any case, the term **contributed capital** is commonly saved for the amount of money received from **issuing shares** and not different forms of capital contributions.

## Calculating Contributed Capital

Contributed capital is reported in the shareholder's equity section of the balance sheet and generally split into two unique accounts: common stock and extra paid-in capital account. As such, contributed capital includes the par value — or nominal value — of the stock, found in the common stock account, and the amount of money far beyond the par value that shareholders were willing to pay for their shares — the share premium — found in the extra paid-in capital account.

The common stock account is otherwise called share capital account, and the extra paid-in capital account is otherwise called the [share premium account](/sharepremiumaccount).

## Illustration of Contributed Capital

For instance, a company issues 5,000 $1 par value shares to investors. The investors pay $10 a share, so the company brings $50,000 up in equity capital. Subsequently, the company records $5,000 to the common stock account and $45,000 to the paid-in capital in excess of par. Both of these accounts included equivalent the total amount stockholders were willing to pay for their shares. All in all, the contributed capital equals $50,000.
