# Anti-Dumping Duty
## What Is an Anti-Dumping Duty?

An anti-dumping duty is a protectionist tariff that a domestic government imposes on foreign imports that it accepts are priced below fair market value. Dumping is a cycle wherein a company exports a product at a price that is fundamentally lower than the price it regularly charges in its home (or its domestic) market.

To safeguard their particular economy, numerous countries impose duties on products they accept are being unloaded in their national market in light of the fact that these products can possibly undermine neighborhood organizations and the nearby economy.

## Grasping Anti-Dumping Duties

In the U.S., the International Trade Commission (ITC)- an independent government organization is entrusted with forcing anti-dumping duties. Their actions depend on proposals they receive from the U.S. Department of Commerce and examinations by the ITC as well as the Department of Commerce.

As a rule, the duties imposed on these goods surpasses the value of the goods. Anti-dumping duties are ordinarily imposed when a foreign company is selling a thing essentially below the price at which it is being created.

While the goal of anti-dumping duties is to save domestic positions, these tariffs can likewise lead to higher prices for domestic consumers. Furthermore, in the long-term, anti-dumping duties can reduce the international competition of domestic companies creating comparative goods.

The World Trade Organization (WTO) is an international organization that arrangements with the rules of trade between nations. The WTO likewise works a set of international trade rules, including the international regulation of anti-dumping measures. The WTO doesn't mediate in that frame of mind of companies took part in dumping. All things being equal, it centers around how governments can — or can't — react to the practice of dumping. As a rule, the WTO agreement permits governments to act against dumping "in the event that it causes or compromises material injury to a laid out industry in the region of a contracting party or materially hinders the foundation of a domestic industry."

This intervention must be justified to uphold the WTO's commitment to free-market principles. Anti-dumping duties can possibly distort the market. In a free market, governments can't typically determine what is a fair [market price](/market-price) for any great or service.

In the wake of leading a survey, after one year the U.S. announced that it would be monumental a total of 522% combined anti-dumping and countervailing import duties on certain steel imported from China. In 2018, China recorded an objection with the WTO testing the tariffs imposed by the Trump administration.
