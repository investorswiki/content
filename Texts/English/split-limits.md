# Split Limits
## What Is a Split Limit?

A split limit is a [insurance](/insurance) policy provision that states different maximum dollar amounts the insurer will pay for various parts of a claim. These policies, likewise alluded to as split [liability](/liability) policies, are normally part of the automobile insurance industry and generally accompany three types of claims: real injury per person, substantial injury per accident, and property damage per accident.

## Grasping Split Limits

Most [vehicle insurance](/collision protection) companies have policies that cover various types of [claims](/insurance_claim) utilizing the split limit approach. This means there are three unique dollar amounts that cover every accident or occurrence including your vehicle. As referenced over, these categories are:

- **Real injury per person:** The maximum an insurer will pay to a single person for medical substantial injury in an accident.
- **Real injury per accident:** The maximum amount a company will pay to all parties harmed in a single accident.
- **Damage to property per accident:** The amount an insurance company pays to cover all damage to property in one accident.

The liability limits set by insurance companies are generally communicated in numbers. For instance, a split limit policy might impose limits like 100/300/50. This means the policy pays $100,000 per person per episode for substantial injury, with a maximum of $300,000 per occurrence. The limit for [property](/property) damage per episode, in the interim, would be $50,000 under this policy.

However, what occurs in the event that one person looks for $250,000 in damages for their wounds? The maximum the split limit policy will pay is $100,000, even if by some stroke of good luck one person is harmed in the accident. The main way the split limit policy will pay the $300,000 maximum is in the event that three unique individuals each have $100,000 in claims.

Split limit policies will generally be more cost-viable options for insured parties. Since they offer smaller [insurance coverage](/insurance-coverage), split limit policies will quite often command lower [premiums](/premium).

## Split Limit versus Combined Single Limit Policies

To get more extensive coverage, insured parties can pay something else for a [combined single limit](/combined-single-limits) (CSL). A CSL policy is something contrary to a split limit, limiting the coverage for all parts of a claim to one dollar amount.

For instance, the CSL policy might state that it will pay out $300,000 for a single claim. In that case, it doesn't make any difference whether one person claims $300,000 in [medical expenses](/medical-expenses) or whether three harmed parties each claim $100,000 in medical bills. The combined single limit maximizes at $300,000 one way or the other.

Having a single-limit policy can dispose of the requirement for an umbrella policy, however since this coverage is more costly, looking at the cost of the two is shrewd. Carefully consider what [assets](/asset) would be uncovered in the event that you are sued. Retirement accounts are generally exempt and, in certain states, your home can't be sold off to pay a judgment. This is an important part of financial and [estate planning](/estateplanning) that is much of the time worth getting a professional evaluation.

## Split Limit versus Umbrella Liability Policies

The coverage gave under a split limit or combined limit policy may not be sufficient. To get more extensive coverage, consider purchasing a personal [umbrella liability policy](/umbrella-insurance-policy). This type of insurance gives extra coverage after your automobile and [homeowners insurance](/homeowners-insurance) are exhausted.

For instance, say you're held obligated for an extravagant accident. You're found to blame for a five-vehicle automobile accident and get sued for $2 million. The $300,000 policy will barely leave a mark on the amount you owe whether it's a split limit policy or a combined single limit policy. In this case, the umbrella policy is really smart to ensure you're completely covered.
