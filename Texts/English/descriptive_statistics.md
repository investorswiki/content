# Descriptive Statistics
## What Are Descriptive Statistics?

Descriptive statistics are brief descriptive coefficients that summarize a given data set, which can be either a representation of the whole population or a sample of a population. Descriptive statistics are broken down into measures of central propensity and measures of variability (spread). Measures of central propensity incorporate the mean, median, and mode, while measures of variability incorporate standard deviation, variance, least and maximum variables, [kurtosis](/kurtosis), and [skewness](/skewness).

## Grasping Descriptive Statistics

Descriptive statistics, in short, help depict and comprehend the elements of a specific data set by giving short summaries about the sample and measures of the data. The most recognized types of descriptive statistics are measures of center: the [mean](/mean), [median](/median), and [mode](/mode), which are utilized at practically all levels of math and statistics. The mean, or the average, is calculated by adding every one of the figures inside the data set and afterward separating by the number of figures inside the set.

For instance, the sum of the accompanying data set is 20: (2, 3, 4, 5, 6). The mean is 4 (20/5). The mode of a data set is the value showing up most frequently, and the median is the figure arranged in the data set. It is the figure isolating the higher figures from the lower figures inside a data set. Notwithstanding, there are more uncommon types of descriptive statistics that are still vital.

Individuals utilize descriptive statistics to reuse hard-to-comprehend quantitative experiences across a large data set into scaled down depictions. An understudy's grade point average (GPA), for instance, gives a decent comprehension of descriptive statistics. The possibility of a GPA is that it takes data points from a great many exams, classes, and grades, and averages them together to give a general comprehension of an understudy's overall scholarly performance. An understudy's personal GPA mirrors their mean scholastic performance.

## Types of Descriptive Statistics

All descriptive statistics are either measures of central propensity or measures of [variability](/variability), otherwise called measures of dispersion.

### Central Tendency

Measures of central propensity center around the average or middle values of data sets, though measures of variability center around the dispersion of data. These two measures use diagrams, tables and general conversations to assist individuals with grasping the meaning of the investigated data.

Measures of central propensity depict the center position of a distribution for a data set. A person examines the frequency of every data point in the distribution and portrays it utilizing the mean, median, or mode, which measures the most common examples of the dissected data set.

### Measures of Variability

Measures of variability (or the measures of spread) aid in dissecting how scattered the distribution is for a set of data. For instance, while the measures of central propensity might provide a person with the average of a data set, it doesn't portray how the data is distributed inside the set.

So while the average of the data perhaps 65 out of 100, there can in any case be data points at both 1 and 100. Measures of variability assist with conveying this by portraying the shape and spread of the data set. Range, [quartiles](/quartile), absolute deviation, and variance are instances of measures of variability.

Consider the accompanying data set: 5, 19, 24, 62, 91, 100. The scope of that data set is 95, which is calculated by taking away the least number (5) in the data set from the highest (100).

## Features
- Descriptive statistics comprises of two essential categories of measures: measures of central inclination and measures of variability (or spread).
- Descriptive statistics summarizes or portrays the qualities of a data set.
- Measures of variability or spread portray the dispersion of data inside the set.
- Measures of central propensity depict the center of a data set.
## FAQ
### Might descriptive statistics at any point be utilized to make deduction or prediction?
No. While these descriptives assist with understanding data credits, inferential statistical strategies — a separate branch of statistics — are required to comprehend how variables communicate with each other in a data set.
### What are mean and standard deviation?
These are two commonly employed descriptive statistics. Mean is the average level saw in some piece of data, while standard deviation portrays the variance, or how scattered the data saw in that variable is distributed around its mean.
### For what reason do we want statistics that essentially portray data?
Descriptive statistics are utilized to portray or summarize the qualities of a sample or data set, like a variable's mean, standard deviation, or frequency. Inferential statistics can assist us with understanding the collective properties of the components of a data sample. Realizing the sample mean, variance, and distribution of a variable can assist us with grasping the world around us.
