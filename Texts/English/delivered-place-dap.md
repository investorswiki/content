# Delivered-at-Place (DAP)
## What Is Delivered-at-Place (DAP)?

Delivered-at-place (DAP) is an international trade term used to portray a deal wherein a seller consents to pay all costs and experience any expected misfortunes of moving goods offered to a specific location. In delivered-at-place agreements, the buyer is responsible for paying [import duties](/import-duty) and any applicable taxes, including clearance and nearby taxes, when the shipment has shown up at the predetermined destination.

The phrase "delivered-at-place" was presented in the International Chamber of Commerce's (ICC) eighth publication of its [Incoterms](/incoterms) — international commercial terms — in 2010.

## How Delivered-at-Place (DAP) Works

Delivered-at-place basically means that the seller faces every one of the risks challenges costs of conveying goods to a settled upon location. This means the seller is responsible for everything, including bundling, documentation, export endorsement, loading charges, and ultimate delivery. The buyer, thusly, assumes control over risk and responsibility as of the unloading of the goods and clearing them for import.

A delivered-at-place agreement is applicable for any form, or combination of forms, of transportation and normally records the place where the buyer takes on financial obligations — for instance, "Delivered-at-place, Port of Oakland."

At the point when it was presented in 2010, DAP replaced the term [Delivery Duty Unpaid (DDU)](/delivereddutyunpaid) and, while DDU might in any case be utilized conversationally, DAP is currently the official term utilized in international trade.

## Special Considerations

The fundamental driver behind the ICC and the Incoterms is the requirement for a reasonable comprehension of counter-party liabilities in international contracts, especially with regards to who ships what to where. With the ICC giving substantial definitions, contracts can allude to the Incoterms, and the signing parties have a shared comprehension of obligations. The Incoterms are updated to work on utilizations and eliminate obsolete terms. Delivered-at-place was one of those simplifications, as the definition applies no matter what the method of transport.

> The ICC was established in 1919 and has delivered eight updates of its international commercial terms starting around 1936.

Even with the reasonable rules for DAP arrangements, there are still situations that outcome in debates, for example, when the carrier of the goods causes [demurrage](/demurrage) — a charge for neglecting to dump in time — because of not getting the legitimate clearance from one of the gatherings. In these cases, the shortcoming ordinarily lies with whichever party was not right in giving ideal documentation, yet determining that can be troublesome, as documentation requirements are defined by the national and nearby specialists controlling ports and change from one country to another. To be sure, international trade law can be complex even with the benefit of defined contract terms.
