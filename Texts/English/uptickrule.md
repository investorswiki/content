# Uptick Rule
## What Is the Uptick Rule?

The Uptick Rule (otherwise called the "in addition to tick rule") is a rule laid out by the [Securities and Exchange Commission](/sec) (SEC) that requires [short sales](/shortsale) to be led at a higher price than the past trade.

Investors take part in short sales when they anticipate that a securities price should fall. The tactic includes selling high and buying low. While short selling can further develop market liquidity and pricing effectiveness, it can likewise be utilized inappropriately to drive down the price of a security or to speed up a market decline.

## Understanding the Uptick Rule

The Uptick Rule keeps sellers from speeding up the downward force of a securities price currently in sharp decline. By entering a short-sale order with a price over the current bid, a short seller guarantees that an order is filled on an uptick.

The original rule was presented by the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as Rule 10a-1 and carried out in 1938. The SEC wiped out the original rule in 2007, however approved an alternative rule in 2010. The rule requires trading centers to lay out and uphold procedures that forestall the execution or display of a disallowed short sale.

### The Alternative Uptick Rule

The 2010 alternative uptick rule (Rule 201) allows investors to exit long positions before short selling happens. The rule is set off when a stock price falls something like 10% in one day. By then, short selling is permitted on the off chance that the price is over the current best bid. This expects to protect financial backer certainty and advance market stability during periods of stress and volatility.

The rule's "length of price test limitation" applies the rule until the end of the trading day and the following day. It generally applies to all equity securities listed on a national securities exchange, whether traded through the exchange or [over the counter](/over-the-countermarket).

## Exemptions to the Rule

For futures, there are limited exemptions to the uptick rule. These instruments can be shorted on a downtick since they are highly [liquid](/liquidity) and have an adequate number of purchasers ready to go into a [long position](/long), guaranteeing that the price will rarely be driven to outlandishly low levels.

To meet all requirements for the exemption, the futures contract must be considered to be "possessed by the seller." This means that as indicated by the SEC, that the person "holds a security futures contract to purchase it and has received notice that the position will be genuinely settled and unalterably will undoubtedly receive the underlying security."
