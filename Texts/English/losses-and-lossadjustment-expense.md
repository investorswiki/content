# Losses and Loss-Adjustment Expense

Losses and loss adjustment expense is the portion of an insurance company's [reserves](/reservefund) set to the side for unpaid losses and the costs of investigation and adjustment for losses. Reserves for losses and loss adjustment expenses are treated as liabilities. This figure additionally incorporates estimates for losses for insurance ceded to [reinsurers](/reinsurer).

## Breaking Down Losses and Loss-Adjustment Expense

Insurance companies set to the side a reserve to cover losses and loss adjustment expenses. It resembles an insurance company's blustery day fund. The reserves depend on an estimate of the losses an insurer might face throughout some stretch of time, implying that the reserves could be adequate or may fall short of covering its liabilities. Assessing the amount of reserves requires actuarial projections in light of the types of policies endorsed. Insurers have several objectives while processing a claim: guarantee that they follow the contract benefits illustrated in the policies that they endorse, limit the predominance and impact of fraudulent claims and create a gain from the premiums they receive.

Expenses associated with a particular claim are thought of "allocated," otherwise called allocated [loss adjustment expenses](/loss-adjustment-expense-lae) (ALA), while reserves not associated with a claim are alluded to as [unallocated loss adjustment expenses](/unallocated-loss-adjustment-expenses-ulae) (ULAE). Allocated loss adjustment expenses happen when the insurance company pays for an examiner to survey claims made on a specific policy. For instance, a driver with an automobile insurance policy might be required to take a damaged vehicle to an authorized third-party shop so a specialist can evaluate the damage. On account of a third-party survey of the vehicle, the cost associated with hiring that professional is an allocated loss adjustment expense. Other allocated expenses incorporate the cost of acquiring police reports or the cost required to assess whether a harmed driver is harmed.
