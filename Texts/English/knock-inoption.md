# Knock-In Option
## What is a Knock-In Option?

A knock-in option is a dormant option contract that begins to function as a normal option ("knocks in") just once a certain price level is reached before expiration. Knock-ins are a type of [barrier option](/barrieroption) that are classified as either a [down-and-in](/daio) or a [up-and-in](/up-and-inoption). A barrier option is a type of contract wherein the payoff relies upon the [underlying security's](/underlying-security) price and whether it hits a certain price within a predefined period.

## Understanding Knock-In Options

Knock-in options are one of the two main types of barrier options, with the other type being [knock-out options](/knock-outoption).

A knock-in option is a type of contract that isn't an option until a certain price is met. So on the off chance that the price is rarely reached, maybe the contract won't ever exist. Nonetheless, on the off chance that the underlying asset arrives at a predefined barrier, the knock-in option appears. The difference between a knock-in and knock-out option is that a knock-in option appears just when the underlying security arrives at a barrier, while a knock-out option quits existing when the underlying security arrives at a barrier.

Barrier options typically have less expensive [premiums](/premium) than traditional [vanilla options](/vanillaoption), fundamentally on the grounds that the barrier increases the possibilities of the option expiring worthless. A trader might pick the less expensive (relative to a comparable vanilla) barrier option on the off chance that they feel it is very logical the underlying will stir things up around town.

## Down-and-In Knock-In Option

Expect an investor purchases a down-and-in [put option](/putoption) with a barrier price of $90 and a [strike price](/strikeprice) of $100. The underlying security is trading at $110, and the option [expires](/expirationdate) in 90 days. In the event that the price of the underlying security comes to $90, the option appears and turns into a vanilla option with a strike price of $100. From there on, the holder of the option has the privilege to sell the underlying asset at the strike price of $100, even however it is trading below $90. This right gives the option value.

The put option remains active until the expiration date, even assuming the underlying security bounce back above $90. Nonetheless, in the event that the underlying asset doesn't fall below the barrier price during the life of the contract, the down-and-in option lapses worthless. Just in light of the fact that the barrier is reached doesn't guarantee a profit on the exchange since the underlying would have to remain below $100 (in the wake of triggering the barrier) in order for the option to have value.

## Up-and-In Knock-In Option

As opposed to a down-and-in option, an up-and-in option appears provided that the underlying arrives at a barrier price that is over the current underlying's price. For instance, expect a trader purchases a one-month up-and-in [call option](/calloption) on an underlying asset when it is trading at $40 per share. The up-and-in call option contract has a strike price of $50 and a barrier of $55. In the event that the underlying asset doesn't reach $55 during the life of the option contract, it lapses worthless. Nonetheless, assuming the underlying asset transcends, the call option would appear and the trader would be [in the money](/inthemoney).

## Features
- A knock-in option is a type of barrier option which is set off solely after the underlying asset's price arrives at a certain predefined barrier.
- There are two types of knock-in options: down-and-in and up-and-in. In the former, the option is set off provided that the underlying asset's price falls below a certain level. The last option type of option is set off solely after an underlying asset's price ascends to a certain level.
