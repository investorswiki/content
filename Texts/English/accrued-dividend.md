## Computing Accrued Dividends

At times, be that as it may, a company will be unable to pay dividends to its shareholders.

The amount of the dividend that will be paid in what's in store is situated in the statement of shareholders' equity. Accrued dividends on preferred stock, if any, might be found in the notes to financial statements.
