# B-Money
## What Is B-Money?

First revealed in 1998 by computer scientist Wei Dai, b-money was expected to be an anonymous, distributed [electronic cash](/electronic-money) system. Along these lines, it attempted to give a significant number of the very services and elements that contemporary cryptocurrencies today do too.

Despite the fact that [digital currencies](/digital-currency) have ascended higher than ever of noticeable quality around the world in the last several years, it's important to remember that cryptocurrency has a history dating back decades. While the most established of the current generation of virtual tokens is [Bitcoin (BTC)](/bitcoin), there were numerous important ancestors to Bitcoin. B-money was one of these early, proposed cryptocurrencies. B-money was rarely formally sent off.

## Figuring out B-Money

Wei Dai, a computer engineer and graduate of the University of Washington, published an exposition in 1998 introducing the concept of b-money. The paper gave the general diagram to the currency, which in numerous ways originates before the advanced digital currency world. Dai described b-money as "a scheme for a group of untraceable digital nom de plumes pay each other with money and to uphold contracts among themselves without outside help."

Dai's concept for b-money incorporated a number of specific highlights that have become common to cryptocurrencies today, remembering the requirement for computational work for order to work with the digital currency, the expectation that this work must be checked by the community in a collective ledger, and compensating workers for their feedback. To guarantee that transactions stayed organized, Dai recommended that collective bookkeeping would be essential, with cryptographic protocols assisting with confirming transactions. This proposal is basically the same as present-day [blockchain](/blockchain) technology. Further, Dai suggested the utilization of digital marks, or [public keys](/public-key), for authentication of transactions and enforcement of contracts.

Dai's concept for b-money included two proposals. The first was viewed as generally unfeasible and depended on a [proof-of-work](/evidence work) (PoW) function to produce b-money. The subsequent proposal all the more closely predicts the structure of numerous present day blockchain systems.

While Dai's work with b-money has maybe been eclipsed by later and effective cryptocurrency projects, he stays a primary figure in the early development of the industry. Without a doubt, the littlest unit of [ether](/ether-cryptocurrency), the digital currency of the [Ethereum](/ethereum) network, is called a "wei" to pay tribute to Dai's work and the b-money concept.

## How Is B-Money Different From Bitcoin?

B-money was rarely formally sent off; it stayed in presence just as a proposal (the equivalent of a [white paper](/whitepaper)). In any case, Dai's work didn't be ignored. To be sure, when Satoshi Nakamoto was creating Bitcoin approximately a decade after Dai delivered the proposal for b-money, the pseudonymous pioneer behind the biggest cryptocurrency in the world connected with Dai before some other designers. Alongside other cryptocurrency pioneers like Nick Szabo and Hal Finney, Dai upheld Nakamoto's plan.

While there are numerous similitudes between the b-money proposal and Bitcoin (and, thusly, numerous other subsequent digital tokens and coins also), the specific relationship between b-money and Bitcoin is hard to recognize. Dai has stated in recent years that "my comprehension is that the creator of Bitcoin...didn't even read my article before reevaluating the thought himself. He found out about it a short time later and credited me in his paper. So my association with the project is very limited."

Beyond that, there are numerous inside the cryptocurrency community who suspect that, because of the similitudes between b-money and Bitcoin, that Wei Dai may some time or another be revealed as the true identity of the secretive Satoshi Nakamoto.

## Objectives of B-Money

By making b-money, Dai longed for a community where there would be next to zero viciousness because the physical areas and real characters of individuals would be obscured from public information. Because there would be no viciousness, this community would have no requirement for a government.

Notwithstanding, Dai knew that for the institution of government to become permanently superfluous, a community would have to convey and execute in a peer-to-peer way. Dai said, "As of not long ago it's not satisfactory, even hypothetically, how such a community could operate. A community is defined by the cooperation of its participants, and efficient cooperation requires a medium of exchange (money) and a method for upholding contracts. Customarily these services have been given by the government or government-sponsored institutions and just to legal substances."

B-money's protocol was considered so that it could save the privacy of all participants while as yet going about as a medium of exchange and giving executable contracts to a community.
