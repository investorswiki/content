# Forex Arbitrage
## What Is Forex Arbitrage?

Forex arbitrage is the strategy of taking advantage of price disparity in the forex markets. It could be affected in different ways yet anyway it is carried out, the arbitrage tries to buy currency prices and sell currency prices that are at present dissimilar yet very liable to join quickly.

For instance, assume that the EURJPY forex pair was quoted at 122.500 by a bank in London, yet was quoted at 122.540 by a bank in Tokyo. A trader with access to the two quotes would have the option to buy the London price and sell the Tokyo price. At the point when the prices had later united at say, 122.550, the trader would close the two trades. The Tokyo position would lose 1 pip, while the London position would gain 5, so the trader would have gained 4 pips less transaction costs.
