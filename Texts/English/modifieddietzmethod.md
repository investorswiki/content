# Modified Dietz Method
## What Is the Modified Dietz Method?

The modified Dietz method is a method for measuring a portfolio's historical return that depends on a weighted calculation of its [cash flow](/cashflow). The method considers the timing of cash flows and expects that there is a steady [rate of return](/rateofreturn) over a predefined period of time.

The modified Dietz method is viewed as more accurate than the simple Dietz method, which expects that all cash flows come from the middle of the period of time being assessed.

## Grasping the Modified Dietz Method

The modified Dietz method is viewed as an accurate impression of a singular's personal rate of return from an investment. It considers the market value of the holdings toward the beginning of a period; its market value toward the finish of the period; all cash flows during that period, and the timeframe that each cash flow event was kept up with in the account.

The number accomplished by utilizing the modified Dietz method is sometimes called the [modified internal rate of return (MIRR)](/mirr), which is a measurement frequently utilized in capital budgeting choices.

Anything its utilization, the point of measuring internal rate of return is to bar outside factors that could skew the outcomes.

### Why This Method Was Adopted

Monetary industry guard dogs and investors are progressively seeking greater transparency into how investment returns are calculated and reported. The modified Dietz method is widely recognized as a step toward further developed investment portfolio attribution reporting, and it is presently ordinarily utilized in the investment management industry.

The method is a dollar-weighted analysis of a portfolio's return. That makes it is a more accurate method for measuring the return on a [portfolio](/portfolio) than the simpler geometric return method, however it can run into issues during periods of heavy [volatility](/volatility) or on the other hand in the event that there are various cash flows inside a particular period.

This approach to return calculation is like the dollar-weighted return method yet enjoys the benefit of not needing its solver to track down the specific rate of return.

The method is named after Peter O. Dietz, an intellectual and creator of compelling works during the 1960s on measuring the returns of pension fund investments. His original thought was to find a speedier approach to working out an IRR than the methods that were then accessible, which depended on PCs that were crude by the present standards.

Today, it's moderately simple to compute a true time-weighted return by working out a daily return and geometrically connecting to get a return for a month, a quarter, or some other time period. Nonetheless, the modified Dietz method stays valuable due to its performance attribution calculation benefits, which are inaccessible with time-weighted calculation methods.

This method for return calculation is a signature of modern portfolio management. It is one of the methodologies of working out returns suggested by the Investment Performance Council (IPC) as part of their Global Investment Performance Standards (GIPS). These standards are planned to give consistency in the manner portfolio returns are calculated universally.

## Features
- The method bars outer factors that could somehow or another skew the numbers.
- Cash flow, in this case, can be contributions, withdrawals, or fees.
- The modified Dietz method is currently widely involved by investment companies in reporting results to clients.
- It is viewed as a more accurate impression of the singular's rate of return.
