# Risk-Neutral Measures
## What Are Risk-Neutral Measures?

A risk neutral measure is a [probability](/risk-neutral-probabilities) measure utilized in mathematical money to aid in pricing derivatives and other financial assets. Risk neutral measures provide investors with a mathematical interpretation of the overall market's risk averseness to a specific asset, which must be considered to estimate the right price for that asset.

A risk neutral measure is otherwise called an equilibrium measure or equivalent martingale measure.

## Risk-Neutral Measures Explained

Risk neutral measures were developed by financial mathematicians to account for the problem of risk aversion in stock, bond, and derivatives markets. [Modern financial theory](/modernportfoliotheory) says that the current value of an asset ought to be worth the current value of the expected future returns on that asset. This appears to be legit, yet there is one problem with this plan, and that will be that investors are [risk averse](/riskaverse), or more afraid to lose money than they are anxious to make it. This propensity frequently brings about the price of an asset being fairly below the expected future returns on this asset. Thus, investors and scholastics must adapt to this risk aversion; risk-neutral measures are an endeavor at this.

## Risk Neutral Measures and the Fundamental Theorem of Asset Pricing

A risk-neutral measure for a market can be derived utilizing assumptions held by the fundamental theorem of asset pricing, a structure in financial math used to study certifiable financial markets.

In the fundamental theorem of asset pricing, it is assumed that there are never opportunities for [arbitrage](/arbitrage), or an investment that constantly and dependably brings in money with no upfront cost to the investor. Experience says this is a very decent assumption for a model of real financial markets, however there clearly have been exemptions in the history of markets. The fundamental theorem of asset pricing additionally expects that markets are complete, implying that markets are frictionless and that all entertainers have perfect data about the thing they are buying and selling. At last, it expects that a price can be derived for each asset. These assumptions are significantly less justified while contemplating certifiable markets, however it is important to work on the world while building a model of it.

Provided that these assumptions are met could a single risk-neutral measure at any point be calculated. Since the assumption in the fundamental theorem of asset pricing misshapes genuine conditions in the market, depending too much on any one calculation in the pricing of assets in a financial portfolio is important not.
