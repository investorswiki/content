## Understanding a Mortgage Pool

Mortgage pools are involved mortgages that will generally have comparative attributes — for example, they will for the most part have close to a similar maturity date and interest rate. When a lender finishes a mortgage transaction, it typically offers the mortgage to another entity, like Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac. Those elements then, at that point, package the mortgages together into a mortgage pool and the mortgage pool then acts as collateral for a [mortgage-backed security](/mbs).

Mortgage-backed securities are collateralized by a mortgage pool filled with comparable mortgages, while a [collateralized debt obligation (CDO)](/cdo) is collateralized by a pool of loans with shifting qualities, for example, varying maturities, districts, interest rates, or credit (risk) ratings. A CDO is a structured financial product that pools together cash flow-creating assets and repackages this asset pool into discrete [tranches](/tranches) that can be sold to investors. A collateralized debt obligation is named for the pooled assets — like mortgages, bonds and loans — that are basically debt obligations that act as collateral for the CDO. A pool of mortgages that backs a more complex mortgage-backed security or CDO, nonetheless, could comprise of mortgages of really shifting interest rates and qualities.

Terms for hard money loans are more limited than most mortgages; they range from a couple of months to three years, while conventional mortgages have 10-to 30-year terms. As a result of their more limited terms, [hard money loans](/hard_money_loan) are less helpless to being impacted by interest rate swings, and that means it is a more unsurprising and dependable cash flow.

Like referenced above, mortgage pool funds change, where some emphasis on specific property types, while some are more broad. These difference can impact risk and return, so it is important to research the different mortgage pools before making a plunge. Interesting points while picking which mortgage pool fund to invest in incorporate the geographic focal point of the portfolio, property type and lien position, [underwriting](/underwriting) criteria, liquidity, and management experience
