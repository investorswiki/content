# Refinance
## What Is a Refinance?

A **refinance,** or "refi" for short, alludes to the method involved with reconsidering and supplanting the terms of an existing [credit agreement,](/creditagreement) for the most part as it connects with a loan or mortgage. At the point when a business or an individual chooses to refinance a credit obligation, they effectively look to roll out favorable improvements to their interest rate, payment schedule, and/or different terms illustrated in their contract. Whenever approved, the borrower gets another contract that replaces the original agreement.

Borrowers frequently decide to refinance when the interest-rate environment changes substantially, causing expected savings on debt payments from another agreement.

## How a Refinance Works

Consumers generally look to refinance certain debt obligations to acquire better borrowing terms, frequently in response to shifting economic conditions. Common objectives from refinancing are to bring down one's fixed interest rate to reduce payments over the life of the loan, to change the duration of the loan, or to switch from a [fixed-rate mortgage](/fixed-rate_mortgage) to a [adjustable-rate mortgage](/arm) (ARM) or vice versa.

Borrowers may likewise refinance in light of the fact that their credit profile has improved, on account of changes made to their long-term financial plans, or to pay off their existing debts by [consolidating them](/debtconsolidation) into one low-evaluated loan.

The most common motivation for refinancing is the interest-rate environment. Since interest rates are cyclical, numerous consumers decide to refinance when rates drop. National [monetary policy](/monetarypolicy), the [economic cycle](/economic-cycle), and market competition can be key factors causing interest rates to increase or diminish for consumers and businesses. These factors can influence interest rates across a wide range of credit products, including both non-revolving loans and revolving credit cards. In an increasing rate environment, debtors with variable-interest-rate products wind up paying more in interest; the reverse is true in a falling-rate environment.

To refinance, a borrower must approach either their existing lender or another one with the request and complete another loan application. Refinancing in this way includes reexamining an individual's or a business' credit terms and financial situation. Consumer loans normally considered for refinancing incorporate mortgage loans, vehicle loans, and student loans.

Businesses may likewise try to refinance mortgage loans on commercial properties. Numerous business investors will assess their corporate [balance sheets](/balancesheet) for business loans issued by creditors that could benefit from lower market rates or a superior credit profile.

## Types of Refinancing

There are several types of refinancing options. The type of loan a borrower chooses to get relies upon the requirements of the borrower. A portion of these refinancing options include:

- **Rate-and-term refinancing**: This is the most common type of refinancing. [Rate-and-term](/rate_and_term_refi) refinancing happens when the original loan is paid and replaced with another loan agreement that requires lower interest payments.
- **Cash-out refinancing**: [Cash-outs](/cashout_refinance) are common when the [underlying asset](/underlying-asset) that collateralizes the loan has increased in value. The transaction includes pulling out the value or equity in the asset in exchange for a higher loan amount (and frequently a higher interest rate). All in all, when an asset increases in value on paper, you can gain access to that value with a loan as opposed to by selling it. This option increases the total loan amount however gives the borrower access to cash quickly while as yet keeping up with ownership of the asset.
- **Cash-in refinancing**: A cash-in refinance permits the borrower to pay down some portion of the loan for a lower [loan-to-value (LTV) ratio](/loantovalue) or more modest loan payments.
- **Consolidation refinancing**: at times, a consolidation loan might be an effective method for refinancing. A consolidation refinancing can be utilized when an investor gets a single loan at a rate that is below their current average interest rate across several credit products. This type of refinancing requires the consumer or business to apply for another loan at a lower rate and then pay off existing debt with the new loan, leaving their total outstanding principal with substantially lower interest rate payments.
