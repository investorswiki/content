## History of the Botswana Pula
<!--0CEA7196C8EAC68D9332AEF84F88627B-->
At the hour of its independence in 1966, Botswana (alongside neighbors Lesotho and Swaziland) kept on involving the South African rand as its currency as a member of the Rand Monetary Area (RMA). In 1973, the four countries started talks on another currency and banking treaty, known as the Rand Monetary Area agreement, that would have permitted the more modest economies to issue their own national currencies while continuing to acknowledge the rand as legal tender. Be that as it may, before the pact was endorsed in 1974, Botswana pulled out from talks and announced its expectations to set up its own central bank.

The pula appeared on August 23, 1976, a day that is celebrated yearly as Pula Day. The currency was initially pegged to the U.S. dollar, with P1 approaching $1.15. The South African rand was additionally pegged to the U.S. dollar at a similar rate, inferring parity between the pula and the rand. The pula basket was presented in 1980 after the rand moved off its dollar peg.

The Botswana pula is completely convertible after [foreign exchange controls](/exchangecontrol) were abrogated in 1999. Before the rand, Botswana utilized:

- British pound sterling from 1885 to 1920
- the South African pound from 1920 to 1961
- the South African rand from 1961 to 1976

The pula has gone through many changes since its presentation in 1976. The currency sent off with four [bank notes](/banknote) in the [denominations](/denomination) of P1, P2, P5 and P10, alongside five coins issued in denominations of 1t, 5t, 10t, 25t and 50t. Throughout the long term, the government presented higher value notes and coins, for example, P1 and P2 coins, attributable to their more successive use.

In 2000, the Bank of Botswana presented a P5 coin and another P50 note, which includes the representation of Sir Seretse Khama, the country's most memorable president. Additionally presented that year was the P100 note bearing the pictures of the three bosses — Bathoen I, Khama III and Sebele I — who acquired British protection over Bechuanaland (what is available day Botswana).

In August 2009, the Bank of Botswana presented another family of banknotes, including another P200 denomination. The P200 note includes a picture of a lady showing understudies, which is intended to underscore education and the contribution of ladies to the country's development.
