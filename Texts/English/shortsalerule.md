# Short-Sale Rule
## What is the Short-Sale Rule?

The short-sale rule was a trading regulation in place somewhere in the range of 1938 and 2007 that restricted the short selling of a stock on a [downtick](/downtick) in the market price of the shares.

## Understanding the Short-Sale Rule

Under the short-sale rule, shorts must be placed at a price over the latest trade, for example a [uptick](/uptick) in the share's price. With just limited special cases, the rule denied trading shorts on a downtick in share price. The rule was otherwise called the [uptick rule](/uptickrule), "in addition to tick rule," and tick-test rule."

The [Securities Exchange Act of 1934](/seact1934) authorized the [Securities and Exchange Commission](/sec) (SEC) to control the short sales of securities, and in 1938 the commission restricted short selling in a down market. The SEC lifted this rule in 2007, permitting short sales to happen (where eligible) on any price tick in the market, whether up or down.

In any case, in 2010 the SEC adopted the alternative uptick rule, which is set off when the price of a security has dropped by 10% or more from the previous day's close. At the point when the rule is in effect, short selling is permitted in the event that the price is over the current [best bid](/bestbid). The alternative uptick rule generally applies to all securities and stays in effect until the end of the day and the accompanying trading session.

## History of the Short-Sale Rule

The SEC adopted the short-sale rule during the [Great Depression](/great_depression) in response to a broad practice in which shareholders pooled capital and shorted shares, in the expectations that different shareholders would rapidly panic sell. The plotting shareholders could then buy a greater amount of the security at a discounted price, yet they would do as such by driving the value of the shares even further down in the short term, and diminishing the wealth of former shareholders.

The SEC started analyzing the possibility of dispensing with the short-sale rule adhering to the [decimalization](/decimalization) of the major stock exchanges in the mid 2000s. Since tick changes were contracting in greatness following the change away from fractions, and U.S. stock markets had become more stable, it was felt that the restriction was as of now excessive.

The SEC led a pilot program of stocks somewhere in the range of 2003 and 2004 to check whether eliminating the short-sale rule would make any negative impacts. In 2007, the SEC surveyed the outcomes and presumed that eliminating short-selling requirements would have no "pernicious impact on market quality or liquidity."

## Debate Around Ending the Short-Sale Rule

The abandonment of the short-sale rule was met with significant examination and contention, not least since it closely went before the 2007-2008 Financial Crisis. The SEC opened up the conceivable reinstatement of the short-sale rule to public comment and audit.

As referenced, in 2010 the SEC adopted the alternative uptick rule limiting short sales on downticks of 10% or more.
