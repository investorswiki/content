# Inward Arbitrage
## What is Inward Arbitrage?

Inward arbitrage is a form of arbitrage that includes improving a bank's cash by borrowing from the interbank market and afterward re-depositing the borrowed money locally at a higher interest rate. The [interbank market ](/interbankmarket)is a global network of banks, however the majority of the borrowing happens between bank to bank.

The primary characteristic of inward arbitrage is borrowing money globally at lower interest rates, then reinvesting the funds locally where interest rates are higher. The bank will bring in money on the spread between the interest rate on the nearby currency also the interest rate on the borrowed currency.

## How Inward Arbitrage Works

Inward arbitrage is something contrary to [outward arbitrage](/outwardarbitrage), which happens when the bank rearranges nearby currency into [Eurobanks](/eurobank) to earn more interest. Basically outward arbitrage is taking low-interest nearby funds and rearranging the money into foreign markets with higher interest rates to create a gain. In any case, both inward and outward arbitrage aim to increase the bank's spread through various [currency rates ](/currency-exchange)and accordingly, unique interest rates, to increase profit earned.

Inward arbitrage is profitable when a bank can borrow at a more favorable rate of interest than it could in the forex market. For example, inward arbitrage would happen if a U.S.- domiciled bank can borrow from the Interbank market at, say 2%, and afterward deposit the borrowed Eurodollars at an American bank earning 2.5%. The greater the difference between the two interest rates, the more profit can be produced using this strategy.

The goal of inward arbitrage is to earn a return with an exceptionally low, perhaps zero, risk on the profit. Inward arbitrage is just conceivable when the funds are able to be reinvested or reallocated into accounts with higher interest rates than their origination accounts. Nonetheless, in many instances of bank inward arbitrage, the technique is utilized as a method for overseeing liabilities, not be guaranteed to increase the bank's note. In many occurrences, [CDs](/certificateofdeposit) are the preferred form of carrying out inward arbitrage.

## Illustration of Inward Arbitrage

To act as an illustration of how inward arbitrage could function, Bank A could borrow $10,000 each from foreign Banks B, C, and D at interest rates of 1% and afterward reallocate the $30,000 into nearby Banks E and F, which offer interest rates of 1.25% and 1.35%, individually to earn an increased return on the rearranged funds. At the point when the interest rate of the rearranged funds out-earns the interest rates the bank must pay on the borrowed funds, the inward arbitrage has been effective.
