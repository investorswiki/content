## Ex-Distribution versus Ex-Dividend

Ex-distribution is like ex-dividend. Distributions and dividends are the two payments to a company's shareholders of a share of the profits. The difference is in the wording utilized by two types of corporations. C-corporations pay dividends while and S-corporations pay distributions.

In this way, when a company declares a [dividend](/dividend) or a distribution, it sets a date when a shareholder must be on the company's books to receive the payment. Assuming that you purchase a stock on or after its ex-dividend date, you won't receive that payment. All things being equal, the seller gets it. Assuming you purchase before the ex-dividend date, you get the dividend.

## Ex-Dividend Example

On Sept. 8, 2020, Company XYZ declares a dividend payable on Oct. 3, 2020, to its shareholders. XYZ reports that shareholders of record on the company's books prior to Sept. 18, 2020, are qualified for the dividend.

The stock will go ex-dividend one business day before the record date.

In this example, the record date falls on a Monday. Excluding ends of the week and occasions, the ex-dividend is set one business day before the record date or the opening of the market. In this case, that is the first Friday.

This means any individual who bought the stock on Friday or after wouldn't get the dividend. With a critical dividend, the price of a stock will most likely fall by that amount on the ex-dividend date.

## Special Considerations

A company might pay its shareholders a dividend as stock shares instead of cash. The stock dividend might be extra shares in the company or shares of a subsidiary that is being veered off.

The system for stock dividends might be unique in relation to cash dividends. The ex-dividend date is set the main business day after the stock dividend is paid (and is additionally after the record date).
