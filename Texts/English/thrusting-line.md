# Thrusting Line
## What Is a Thrusting Line?

Stock traders are continually on the watch for patterns that can be deciphered as an indication of where a stock they are watching will take next. The thrusting line is one such pattern.

The thrusting line is really a part of a two-[candlestick](/candlestick) pattern. The candlestick pattern, a rectangle with wick-like projections at the two closures, shows the movement of a stock in a single session, from its least price to its highest price. A two-candlestick pattern shows two cycles.

A thrusting line is a two-candle pattern in which the primary candle is a large down candle (with a longer wick at the base) and the subsequent candle is an up candle (with a longer wick at the top).

Where the subsequent candle opens and closes shows the strength of buying pressure, and whether that pressure is probably going to proceed. Put another way, the subsequent candle is endeavoring to thrust vertical into the selling pattern that occurred on the previous candle.

## Types of Thrusting Line Candlestick Patterns

A thrusting line is sorted in one of three ways: continuation, neutral, and reversal.

- On the off chance that the subsequent candle opens well below the [close](/closingprice) of the main candle and closes close to the close of the principal candle, it demonstrates a weak bullish move. The downward trend is probably going to proceed. Selling is probably going to resume on the accompanying sessions, or candles.
- Assuming that the subsequent candle opens below the close of the first yet closes close or somewhat over the close of the second, the pattern is neutral. The price could go higher or lower in the next session. The message is that the [bulls](/bull) managed to gain some ground yet the dealers were stronger on the prior day.
- Assuming the price of the subsequent candle opens close to the close of the main candle and closes close to the mid-point of the principal candle, it signals an upside reversal. The bulls have managed to eradicate a significant part of the prior loss. A few merchants are probably going to respite, and more buyers might bounce in. This pattern ought to lead to a further gain in price.

Two candles are not generally critical all by themselves. Most traders search for actionable patterns inside a longer timetable, expecting to spot a trend or a pullback in price that offers them a chance.

For instance, during a strong uptrend, a trader will search for a vertical reversal thrusting line to signal that the pullback is finished and it's a great opportunity to buy.

Then again, in the event that a downward continuation thrusting line creates, the trader might start a [short trade](/short), betting on a further decline.

## True Example of a Thrusting Line

The daily Meta, formerly Facebook, (META) chart shows two thrusting line patterns. In the two cases, the price dropped through a red downward candle. The accompanying daily candle opened lower however at that point continued to rally over the close of the principal down candle. The price didn't arrive at the mid-point of the primary candle, however it did close well over the close of the first. These are neutral to bullish thrusting patterns, and the price kept on moving higher on the accompanying candles, for the two patterns.

### The Thrusting Line versus the Piercing Pattern

The patterns are very comparable. In a thrusting line, the subsequent candle closes at or **below** the mid-point of the principal candle. A [piercing pattern](/piercing-pattern) is more bullish. The subsequent candle closes **above** the mid-point however below the open of the primary down candle.

### Limitations of the Thrusting Line Candlestick Pattern

Not all thrusting lines keep on creating as their watchers hope and expect they will.

Thrusting patterns are best utilized notwithstanding different forms of analysis, for example, trend analysis, other price action signals, and [technical indicators](/technicalindicator).

Regardless, a thrusting line can give just a short-term outlook at the cost course of a stock. The pattern doesn't give a [profit target](/profit-target) for how far the price could run. The trader must depend on another method to signal the right time for an exit from any trades made in view of these patterns.

## Features
- A thrusting line is a two-candle candlestick pattern that shows whether buying pressure on a stock is weakening, strengthening, or remaining neutral.
- The thrusting line distinguishes just a short-term pattern and isn't valuable in that frame of mind as long as possible.
- Traders watch the pattern to distinguish the right chance to buy a stock with the expectation that its price will keep on rising.
