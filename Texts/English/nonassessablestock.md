## What Is a Non-Assessable Stock?

A non-assessable stock is a class of stock where the responsible company isn't permitted to impose [levies](/levy) on its shareholders for extra funds to make further investments. The maximum liability the purchaser of the stock accepts at least for now that is equivalent to the initial purchase price of the shares. Stocks issued by U.S. companies and traded on U.S. exchanges (and practically any remaining exchanges) are generally non-assessable.

## Figuring out Non-Assessable Stock

A non-assessable stock is something contrary to a [assessable stocks](/assessablestock), a now-old type of [primary offering](/primaryoffering). Assessable stock was the primary type of equity issued in the late 1800s. Assessable stock was generally sold at a discount and permitted the issuer to gather extra funds from investors after their initial purchase of the stock.

For instance, a share of stock with a face value of $20 may be sold for $5. Sooner or later, the issuer would serve the investors with an assessment for additional funds â€” up to the whole discounted amount (In this model, $15). Assuming an investor would not pay, the stock returned to the responsible company.

As anyone might expect, assessable stock proved to be disagreeable. Most companies exchanged over to giving non-assessable stock in the mid 1900s, and the last assessable shares were sold during the 1930s.

In spite of the fact that equity was not generally sold [at a discount](/at-a-discount) compared to its share price, investors were more sure about buying non-assessable stocks since they no longer needed to worry about the possibility that the issuer would force them to invest more money in the stock after the initial transaction.

The biggest investment the purchaser of a non-assessable stock needs to make is the initial purchase price of the shares. The investor might lose the invested amount on the off chance that the stock price goes to zero. Nonetheless, the investor won't ever be required by the responsible company to make extra investments as a condition of their stock ownership.

At the point when a stock is non-assessable, it likewise means that assuming that the responsible company fails, the shareholders can't lose more money than they invested in any case.
