## What Is a Stub Quote?

A stub quote, otherwise called a placeholder quote, is an order to buy or sell shares that is intentionally set far lower or higher than the predominant [market price](/market-price). Stub quotes are utilized by [market makers](/marketmaker) who wish to satisfy their liquidity obligations without proposing for their orders to be executed.

## How Stub Quotes Work

Stub quotes are utilized by market makers who are required to buy and sell shares of a security however don't have any desire to do as such at its current market price. In this situation, market makers can enter stub quotes that are such a long ways from the predominant market price that they are probably not going to be accepted by other market participants.

Market makers and experts are required by the exchanges they participate in to make continuous two-sided markets (i.e., a [two-way quote](/twowayquote) with both a bid and an offer) to give liquidity in the names they are active in. The stub quote permits a market maker to satisfy this duty, however in a hesitant way, which can be disapproved of.

To represent, assume ABC Trading is a market maker for Example Corporation, whose stock is currently trading with a [bid-ask spread](/bid-askspread) of $40 to $40.50 per share. As a market maker, ABC Trading is required to buy and sell a certain amount of Example Corporation stock every day. Nonetheless, if ABC Trading would rather not increase its exposure to Example Corporation stock, it could evade its obligation by offering shares at a bid-ask spread that is far away from the best accessible market price, for example, $4.00 to $405 per share.

## Genuine Example of Stub Quotes

The new regulations require market makers to issue quotes that are inside a certain percentage of the best accessible market price, which is known as the [national best bid and offer](/nbbo) (NBBO). Contingent upon the conditions, these quotes may be permitted to go amiss by as much as 30% or just 8%. These rules have been in effect since December 2010.
