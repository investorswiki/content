# Pull-Through Production
## What Is Pull-Through Production?

Pull-through production is a [just-in-time](/jit) (JIT) [manufacturing](/manufacturing) strategy that sends a thing into the production cycle right when a company gets an order for it. Pull-through production uses a pull system, a method for controlling the flow of resources through a system. Resources are pulled into the production pipeline just as they are really required or mentioned.

## How Pull-Through Production Works

Pull-through production is a [inventory management](/inventory-management) method in which products are manufactured in view of real demand, as in custom or [made-to-order](/specially make) (MTO) [inventory](/inventory). A pull-through strategy answers customer demand in real-time. That means that the impulse for a product being made, or purchased, begins completely with the customer's order.

The goal of pull-through production is to supplant just what has been utilized and at the optimal time. A pull strategy functions admirably for products that can be manufactured or recharged rapidly; for products whose demand is uncertain; and for products that don't benefit from [economies of scale](/economiesofscale) â€” at the end of the day, making a ton of it doesn't reduce the cost of selling it.

## Advantages and Disadvantages of Pull-Through Production

One advantage of a pull strategy is the ability to sell without the associated expenses of carrying an inventory. In the event that a company can deliver as guaranteed without absorbing these extra costs, pull-through production ought to bring about a lower [cost of goods sold](/cogs) (COGS) and more extensive [profit margins](/profitmargin).

Basing purchase orders and production plans on genuine, as opposed to anticipated, orders can lead to lower outlays on storage, factory overhead, [insurance](/insurance), [raw materials](/rawmaterials), and finished goods. Pull-through production could likewise empower a company to cost-effectively tailor a thing to a customer's details, possibly driving customer loyalty.

Notwithstanding, there are a few remarkable disadvantages to this manufacturing strategy. With pull-through production, a company must conduct various, smaller production runs instead of just a couple of runs. This cycle can be costly in the event that not managed as expected.

Another drawback is that job parcels might be basically as small as a single unit, which could require more [overhead](/overhead) in terms of setting up equipment within the production cycle, or needing to order smaller amounts of raw materials.

## Pull-Through Production versus Make To Stock (MTS)

A push, or [made-to-stock](/make-to-stock) (MTS) strategy, alludes to the more traditional model of trying to match production with consumer craving through estimates, occasional demand planning, and historic trends.

Frequently, the differences in these contrary strategies complete one another. Managing the dynamics of both a push strategy and a pull strategy is critical to effective [supply chain management](/scm) (SCM).

For instance, in order for some [e-commerce](/internet business) companies to strike a cost-effective balance in manufacturing, they could involve a push strategy for high-volume things that they know have sold very much in view of forecasting. On the other hand, they could involve a pull strategy for special things that they can't bear to stock, however which they accept will appeal to customers.

Albeit these methods seem, by all accounts, to be in resistance to one another, they are not mutually exclusive. As a matter of fact, they are many times the best when applied decisively together to address individual business situations.

## Special Considerations

Information technology (IT) makes it extremely simple for a vendor to shift from a push-type model to a pull-type business model. Thus, pull-through production has tremendous ramifications for online shippers and the web based business industry.

Supply chain management involves managing the product chain from development through production, and to distribution. Supply chain production has received new consideration in the 21st century due to the advanced IT technology that is currently accessible and that can link and control different parts of a [supply chain](/supplychain).

Implementing a pull-through strategy into the online business part of a business could be alluring for smaller companies that need to have an online presence and give more options to customers yet that have low inventory spending plans.

- Adopting a pull-through method of production can reduce the different cost associated with carrying inventory, albeit the cycle can be counterproductive and costly in the event that not managed as expected.
