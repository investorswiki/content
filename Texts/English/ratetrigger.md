# Rate Trigger
## What Is Rate Trigger?

Rate trigger is a drop in interest rates that is sufficiently critical to propel a bond [issuer](/issuer) to call their [bonds](/bond), prior to maturity, to reissue at the lower rate and reduce their interest expense.

## Understanding Rate Trigger

Truly, a rate trigger is a type of trade trigger which, when reached, will make an action occur. On account of a bond, the rate trigger might be dropping interest rates. A decrease in winning [interest rates](/interestrate) drives an issuer of a [callable bond](/callablebond) to call that bond. Vacillations in interest rates have suggestions across the economy however can be particularly effective in the bond market.

[Calling away](/calledaway) must be finished in the event that the bond issue remembers a call provision for the offering. "Call" alludes to the early redemption of a bond by the bond's issuer. The call provision frequently comprises of a date by which calls must be complete. A bond with a callable period isn't eligible for calls before that date. Callable bonds typically offer a higher coupon rate and a call price better than expected value to make them appealing to likely investors.

Numerous investments are subject to [interest rate risk](/interestraterisk), otherwise called market risk. Interest rate risk is the hazard that an investment will lose value due to the relative engaging quality of declining winning rates. A bond with a fixed [coupon rate](/coupon-rate) is one illustration of an investment subject to interest rate risk. Assuming that interest rates fall, the borrower (issuer) may call the current bond for giving another at the lower interest rate. The rate trigger is set when the bond is issued and is the level where the lender realizes that the bond is probably going to be called. Rate triggers, over the long haul, set aside the borrower cash.

Notwithstanding, the bondholder is forced to go to the marketplace to replace the called away investment. A threat to bondholders is [reinvestment risk](/reinvestmentrisk), or the chance that investment options accessible to the investor after a bond's calling are not quite so alluring as the original bond. In a market with falling interest rates, it is impossible the investor will get another comparative instrument that generates the equivalent payouts that they were getting from the called issue.

## Rate Trigger Example

On January 1 of 2018, Company ABC offers 10-year [callable bond](/callablebond) with a 8% coupon rate, callable at 120% of par value. The callable date is January 1, 2022. Interest rates rise and fall between the issue date and the callable date however stay close to 8%. On the main day of 2023, interest rates dip to 5%. This drop is a rate trigger.

Company ABC closes a deal to offer new debt at 5% and will utilize the proceeds from this offering to repay its 8% bondholders as they call away the bond. Company ABC practices the option on the 8% bonds. The investor gets $1,200 per $1,000 bond. Nonetheless, the bondholder loses the $400 of interest payments they would have received over the leftover life of the bond.

This model demonstrates the risk and rewards of callable security in the event of a rate trigger. Prior to the company calling its bonds, the investor could anticipate earning an above-market interest rate. The 2023 rate trigger understands the market risk of a callable bond, bringing about lost interest income.
