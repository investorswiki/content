# Collateral Trust Bond
## What Is a Collateral Trust Bond?

A collateral trust bond, otherwise called collateral trust certificate or collateral trust note, is a bond that is secured by at least one financial assets — like shares of stock or different bonds — that is kept and held by a trustee for the holders of the bond. The bond is perceived as a more secure investment than an unsecured bond since the assets could be sold to pay the bondholder, if fundamental.

## Understanding Collateral Trust Bonds

A [corporate bond](/corporatebond) is a bond issued by a company to raise capital for its short-term debt obligations or long-term capital ventures. In return for the loan given by investors, the company pays periodic interest to bondholders, endless supply of the bonds, repays the principal investment.

Since companies like to issue debt with as low an interest rate as could really be expected, they will search out ways of diminishing their [cost of borrowing](/costofdebt). One method for doing this is by getting the bond issued with [collateral](/collateral) through a security called a collateral trust bond.

> On the off chance that a corporation fails or defaults on its debt, bondholders get compensated back first, and holders of secured bonds get compensated back before holders of unsecured bonds.

A collateral trust bond has a claim against a security or basket of securities. These bonds are commonly issued by holding companies since they generally have practically no real assets to use as collateral. All things being equal, holding companies have control over different companies, known as [subsidiaries](/subsidiary), by possessing stock in every one of the auxiliaries. A holding company will consequently issue a collateral trust bond against securities of its subsidiary firms.

The collateralized securities pledged to secure the bond are moved to a [trustee](/trustee) to oversee for the benefit of the bondholders. Even however the trustee has custody of the pledged assets, the [voting rights](/votingright) in truth by these securities will stay with the corporate issuer.

For the securities to be eligible for collateral, their market values must be higher than the amount of the outstanding bonds by a certain percentage. The value of pledged securities will be routinely reconsidered and [marked to market](/marktomarket) to mirror their current market value. On the off chance that during the life of the bond, the market value of the collateral falls below the stipulated least featured on the [trust indenture](/trust_indenture), the issuer must pledge extra securities or cash as collateral.

> Buying a secured bond, for example, a collateral trust bond is more secure than buying an unsecured bond, however the extra safety has a cost — a lower interest rate than what you would receive in the event that you had bought a comparable unsecured bond.

## Illustration of Collateral Trust Bond

In the event that the responsible company were to default on the debt obligation, the debt holders would receive the securities held in trust, just like collateral for a loan. For instance, say Company An issues a collateral trust bond, and as collateral for the bond, it incorporates the right to Company A shares held by a [trust company](/trustcompany). If Company A were to default on the bond payments, the bondholders would be qualified for the shares held in trust.

Moreover, on the off chance that the issuer defaults on its payments, the voting rights of the shares held by the trustee will be moved to the trustee which has the option of selling the securities to pay the bondholders.

Collateral trust bonds have lower yields than unsecured bonds since they are perceived to be safer due to the collateral held by the trustee. Investors will actually want to acknowledge a lower yield on these bonds in return for a guaranteed stream of income and safeguarded principal investment.

## Features
- This sort of bond is viewed as more secure than an unsecured bond; notwithstanding, the tradeoff with greater safety is a lower yield and consequently lower payout.
- In the event that after some time, the value of the collateral falls below the settled upon least, the issuer needs to put up extra securities or cash as collateral.
- The collateral must have a market value at the time the bond is issued that is basically equivalent to the value of the bonds.
- A collateral trust bond is a type of secured bond, where a corporation deposits stocks, bonds, or different securities with a trustee to back its bonds.
- The value of the collateral is periodically reconsidered to ensure it actually matches the value initially pledged.
