# Capital Investment Analysis
## What Is Capital Investment Analysis?

Capital investment analysis is a budgeting methodology that companies and government agencies use to evaluate the possible profitability of a long-term investment. [Capital investment](/capital-investment) analysis evaluates long-term investments, which could incorporate [fixed assets](/fixedasset) like equipment, machinery, or real estate. The goal of this cycle is to distinguish the option that can yield the highest return on invested capital. Organizations might utilize different strategies to perform capital investment analysis, which include working out the expected value of future cash flows from the project, the cost of financing, and the risk-return of the project.

## Grasping Capital Investment Analysis

Capital investments are risky in light of the fact that they include critical, up-front expenditures on assets expected for a long time of service, and that will consume a large chunk of the day to pay for themselves. One of the essential requirements of a firm assessing a [capital project](/capital-project) is an investment return greater than the [hurdle rate](/hurdlerate), or required rate of return, for shareholders of the firm.

### Net Present Value

One of the most common metrics for capital investment analysis is the [net present value](/npv) (NPV) model, which determines how much the expected revenue from a project-called future cash flows-are worth in the present dollars. Net present value shows whether the future cash flows or revenue are sufficient to cover the initial investment of the project and some other cash outflows.

The NPV calculation discounts-or lessens the expected future cash flows by a specific rate to show up at their value in this day and age. In the wake of deducting the initial investment cost from the current value of the expected cash flows, a project manager can determine whether the project is worth going after. On the off chance that the NPV is a positive number, it means it's worth chasing after while a negative NPV means the future cash flows aren't generating sufficient return to be worth it and cover the initial investment.

Basically, net present value (NPV) measures the difference between the current value of the project's cash inflows and the current value of any costs or cash outflows. For instance, a company could compare the returns from a project to the cost of financing that project. The cost of financing would be the hurdle rate used to compute the current value of the cash flows. A project wouldn't be worth chasing after in the event that the expected cash flows aren't sufficient to cover the hurdle rate and the initial investment cost.

### Discounted Cash Flow (DCF)

[Discounted cash flow (DCF)](/dcf) is like net present value yet additionally somewhat unique. NPV ascertains the current value of cash flows and deducts the initial investment. DCF analysis is basically a part of the NPV calculation since it's the most common way of utilizing a [discount rate](/discountrate) or an alternative [rate of return](/requiredrateofreturn) to measure regardless of whether the future cash flows make the investment worth it.

DCF is famous with investments that are expected to generate a set rate of return every year from here on out. It doesn't consider any beginning up costs however simply measures whether the rate of return on the expected future cash flows is worth investing in view of the discount rate utilized in the formula.

With DCF analysis, the discount rate is regularly the rate of return that is viewed as risk-free and addresses the alternative investment of the project. For instance, a U.S. [Treasury bond](/treasurybond) is normally viewed as risk-free since Treasuries are backed by the U.S. government. On the off chance that a Treasury paid 2% interest, the project would have to earn over 2%-or the discount rate-to be worth the risk.

The current value is the value of the expected cash flows in the present dollars by discounting or taking away the discount rate. Assuming the outcome or present value of the cash flows is greater than the rate of return from the discount rate, the investment is worth chasing after.

## Special Considerations

Capital investment choices are not made softly. Insightful models are not difficult to set up. The information sources, be that as it may, drive model outcomes; thusly, reasonable suspicions are critical for determining whether a pondered investment proceeds. Cash flows past, say, three or five years can be hard to project. The discount rate, when applied to years far into what's in store, significantly affects the current value calculation.

[Sensitivity analysis](/sensitivityanalysis), by which shifting data sources are connected to the model to check changes in value, ought to be performed. Be that as it may, even then, unexpected events can upset the best-planned model with the most reasonable presumptions, in which case the modeler might choose to integrate contingency factors into the analysis.
