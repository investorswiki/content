# 2-Way ANOVA
## What Is a 2-Way ANOVA?

[ANOVA](/anova) represents analysis of variance and tests for differences in the effects of independent variables on a dependent variable. A two-way ANOVA test is a statistical test used to decide the effect of two nominal predictor variables on a continuous outcome variable.

A two-way ANOVA tests the effect of two independent variables on a dependent variable. A two-way ANOVA test breaks down the effect of the independent variables on the expected outcome alongside their relationship to the actual outcome. Random factors would be considered to have no statistical influence on a data set, while systematic factors would be considered to have [statistical significance](/statistical-significance).

By utilizing ANOVA, a specialist can decide if the variability of the outcomes is due to chance or to the factors in the analysis. ANOVA has numerous applications in finance, [economics](/economics), science, medication, and [social science](/social-science).

## Figuring out 2-Way ANOVA

An ANOVA test is the most vital phase in recognizing factors that influence a given outcome. When an ANOVA test is performed, an analyzer might have the option to perform further analysis on the systematic factors that are statistically adding to the data set's [variability](/variability).

A two-way ANOVA test uncovers the consequences of two independent variables on a dependent variable. ANOVA test results can then be utilized in a F-test, a statistical test used to decide if two populaces with normal distributions share variances or a standard deviation, on the significance of the regression formula overall.

Analysis of variances is useful for testing the effects of variables on one another. It is like various two-example [t-tests](/t-test). Be that as it may, it results in less [type 1 errors](/type_1_error) and is suitable for a scope of issues. An ANOVA test groups differences by contrasting the means of each group and incorporates spreading out the [variance](/variance) across assorted sources. It is employed with subjects, test groups, among groups and inside groups.

## ANOVA versus 2-Way ANOVA

There are two fundamental types of analysis of variance: one-way (or unidirectional) and two-way (bidirectional). One-way or two-way alludes to the number of independent variables in your analysis of variance test. A one-way ANOVA assesses the impact of a sole factor on a sole response variable. It decides if the noticed differences between the means of independent (unrelated) groups are explainable by chance alone, or whether there are any statistically huge differences between groups.

A two-way ANOVA is an extension of the one-way ANOVA. With a one-way, you have one independent variable influencing a dependent variable. With a two-way ANOVA, there are two independents. For instance, a two-way ANOVA permits a company to compare worker productivity in light of two independent variables, like department and orientation. Noticing the collaboration between the two factors is used. It tests the effect of two factors simultaneously.

A [three-way ANOVA](/three-way-anova), otherwise called three-factor ANOVA, is a statistical means of deciding the effect of three factors on an outcome.

## Features
- A two-way ANOVA is an extension of the one-way ANOVA (analysis of variances) that uncovers the consequences of two independent variables on a dependent variable.
- A two-way ANOVA test is a statistical technique that examines the effect of the independent variables on the expected outcome alongside their relationship to the actual outcome.
- ANOVA has numerous applications in finance, economics, science, medication, and social science.
