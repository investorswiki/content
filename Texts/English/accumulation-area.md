# Accumulation Area
## What Is the Accumulation Area?

The accumulation area on a price and volume chart is characterized by generally [sideways](/sidewaysmarket) stock price movement, which is seen by investors or technical analysts as indicative of large institutional investors buying, or accumulating, a large number of shares over the long haul.

This can be contrasted with the [distribution zone](/accumulationdistribution), where institutional investors start selling their shares. Having the option to perceive whether a stock is in the accumulation zone or the distribution zone is useful to investing achievement. The goal is to buy in the accumulation area and sell in the distribution area.

## Understanding the Accumulation Area

The accumulation area is important for investors to perceive while deciding to buy or sell. Experienced investors search for patterns indicating a stock is at a high point, low point, or some in the middle between. The goal is to determine in the event that a stock price has [momentum](/momentum), and in which direction. A stock in the accumulation area may be about to [break out](/breakout). At the point when a stock price doesn't fall below a certain price level, and moves in a sideways range for an extended period, this can be an indication to investors that the stock is being accumulated by investors and subsequently, will be moving up soon.

The accumulation area is just one form of charting. Charting is also used to identify what is known as the distribution zone, which may indicate that a stock is nearing a selloff. Investors search for divergences between stock price fluctuations and trading volumes as key to their charting analysis.

The widespread availability of online charting devices through online trading firms is allowing more investors access to procedures once confined to professionals. These apparatuses permit investors to think back over years to see when stocks moved and to understand what was happening at the time.

Traders hope to identify ranges of price and volume movement; a prolonged sideways chart range with no large ups or downs indicates the stock is in the accumulation area and may be about to climb.

## The Accumulation/Distribution Indicator (A/D)

Accumulation/distribution ([A/D](/accumulationdistribution)) is a cumulative indicator that utilizes [volume](/volume) and price to assess whether a stock is being accumulated or distributed. The accumulation/distribution measure tries to identify [divergences](/divergence) between the stock price and volume flow. This provides understanding into how strong a trend is. Assuming that the price is rising however the indicator is falling this recommends that buying or accumulation volume may not be sufficient to support the price gain and a decline may come.

The A/D indicator is cumulative, meaning one period's value is added or subtracted from the last. A rising A/D line affirms a rising price trend, while a falling A/D line affirms a price downtrend. In the event that the price is rising however A/D is falling, it signals underlying weakness and a potential decline in price, as well as the other way around.

In that one day, more than $14 billion of value was wiped under the table.
