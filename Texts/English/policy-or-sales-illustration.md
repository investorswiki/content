# Policy Or Sales Illustration

A policy or sales illustration is an instructive device that shows a prospective or new insurance policyholder how a life or disability insurance policy works. A policy or sales illustration factors in a policy's all's key subtleties, including the candidate or protected's age, orientation, and underwriting class (the risk level used to determine premiums).

## Breaking Down Policy Or Sales Illustration

A policy or sales illustration likewise shows the insurance item's name, term, benefit amount, [premium](/premium), cash values (in the event that the policy has a cash value part), and projected [dividends](/profit) (assuming that the policy is being issued by a mutual insurance company). The illustration will likewise portray any policy riders or options. A policy illustration shows how the policy's value is expected to change over the long run and what suppositions those values depend on. A disability policy illustration will likewise show the waiting period before benefits become payable and depict the conditions that must be met for the policy to payout.

A policy or sales illustration is definitely not a binding contract and doesn't guarantee how much a policy will be worth at whatever year, with the exception of where values are unequivocally stated as "guaranteed." The illustration is to a great extent a ballpark estimation determined by a computer program in view of the accessible data at the time the illustration is generated. The real legal guarantees associated with the policy are contained in the policy's contract.

Insurance agents give a policy illustration to candidates who are thinking about purchasing a life or disability insurance policy. The illustration examines the policy's elements and benefits. After the policy is issued, the agent will issue another illustration in view of the real policy issued, since it might contain unexpected suspicions in comparison to the illustration utilized in the application phase. For example, the candidate's medical exam could have set the customer in a higher-risk category than the initial sales illustration assumed, or the candidate could have changed their brain about the amount of coverage they need to purchase.

The [National Association of Insurance Commissioners](/nainsurancec) (NAIC) developed a model policy illustration that numerous insurers use as the basis for their policy or sales illustrations, since it is straightforward and contains all the data consumers need to be aware. It shows the item's current guaranteed and non-guaranteed values in light of what the policy's underlying sub-accounts mean for the policy's cash value and death benefit, expecting a rate of return that is reasonable, given the client's risk tolerance and market conditions. The policy illustration ought to likewise show any fees associated with the policy. Sales or contract illustrations are utilized with products like whole life insurance, universal life insurance, variable universal life insurance, and long-term disability insurance.
