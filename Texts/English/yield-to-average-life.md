## What Is Yield-to-Average Life?

Yield-to-average life is the calculation of a bond's yield in light of the average maturity as opposed to the stated maturity date of the issue. This yield replaces the stated last maturity with the average life maturity. Average life is additionally called the [weighted average maturity](/weightedaveragematurity) (WAM) or [weighted average life](/weightedaveragelife) (WAL).

## Understanding Yield-to-Average Life

Yield-to-average life allows the investor to estimate the genuine return from a bond investment, no matter what the bond's definite maturity date. The yield-to-average life calculation assumes that the bond develops on the day given by its [average life](/averagelife) and at the average redemption price rather than the par price. It tends to be calculated with a similar formula as [yield to maturity](/yieldtomaturity) (YTM) by subbing the average life for the bond's maturity.

Yield-to-average life determines the amount of time it will take to recuperate one-half of a bond's [face value](/facevalue). Bonds that have a quicker repayment of principal will bring down the risk of default and permits a bondholder to reinvest their money sooner. Speedier reinvestment can be fortunate or unfortunate, contingent upon which course interest rates have moved since the investor bought the bond.

While certain bonds repay the principal in a lump sum at maturity, others repay the principal in portions over the term of the bond. This portion method of repayment is called a [sinking fund](/sinkingfund) feature. In these bonds, the [indenture](/indenture) requires the issuer to set money to the side into a separate account routinely.

This account is for the exclusive purpose of recovering the bonds. With the amortization of a bond's principal along these lines, the average life calculation will permit investors to determine how soon repayment of the principal will be.

Trustees of a sinking fund bond will utilize the yield-to-average life calculation to assist them with determining on the off chance that they should re-get a portion of the bonds on the open market. This is normal when the bonds are trading below par. The average life, in this case, might be fundamentally not exactly the genuine number of years until maturity.

A sinking fund is a means of repaying funds borrowed through a bond issue through periodic payments to a trustee who resigns part of the issue by purchasing the bonds in the open market. A sinking fund works on a corporation's creditworthiness, allowing the business to pay investors a lower interest rate.

## Yield-to-Average Life for Mortgage-Backed Securities

Yield-to-average life permits investors to determine the expected return of [mortgage-backed securities](/mbs) (MBS), as a result of the prepayment of the underlying mortgage debt. This measurement is helpful in the pricing of MBSs, for example, [collateralized mortgage obligations](/cmo) (CMOs) issued by the [Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation](/freddiemac) (Freddie Mac) and private issuers.

A MBS generally repays principal over the lifetime of the investment. Contingent upon whether the MBS was purchased at a discount or a premium, the advanced paying of the principal can influence an investor's expected return.

An environment with declining interest rates frequently drives property holders to refinance. In the refinancing system, the old loan is paid off as another loan with lower interest payments has its spot.
