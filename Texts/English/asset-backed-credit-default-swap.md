# Asset-Backed Credit Default Swap (ABCDS)
## What is an Asset-Backed Credit Default Swap?

An asset-backed credit default swap (ABCDS) is a credit default swap (CDS) wherein the reference asset is the asset-backed security instead of a corporate credit instrument.

## Understanding Asset-Backed Credit Default Swaps (ABCDS)

Asset-backed credit default swap (ABCDS) agreements are like traditional credit default swap agreements. ABCDS are like insurance, where a buyer pays normal premiums to safeguard against the possibility that a borrower won't completely repay a financial loan. Be that as it may, on account of an ABCDS, the buyer gets protection for [defaults](/default2) on asset-backed securities or [tranches](/tranches) of securities, instead of protecting against the default of a specific issuer. Asset-backed securities are securities backed by a pool of loans or receivables, for example, car loans, home equity loans or credit cards loans.

## Asset-Backed Credit Default Swap (ABCDS) Compared to Credit Default Swap (CDS)

Since ABCDS can be hedged, they are structured uniquely in contrast to different CDS agreements. For instance, since numerous asset-backed securities [amortize](/amortization) and pay month to month, the asset-backed swap will all the more closely match those elements.

Likewise, an ABCDS operates with a more extensive definition of a [credit event](/credit-event) than a traditional credit default swap (CDS). On a customary CDS, a credit event commonly possibly happens on the off chance that the borrowing organization goes bankrupt. Since a credit event on a corporate credit instrument is normally a one-time occurrence, under a CDS this event will trigger a large, one-time settlement.

However, with an ABCDS, since the protection really covers cash flows from various loans, there can be numerous credit events over the term of the agreement. These different events can trigger settlements of changing spans and sizes. Further, the credit event can happen not just in that frame of mind of non-payment of an underlying loan, yet additionally on account of a [write-down](/writedown), i.e., the reduction of an underlying asset's book value due to it surpassing its [market value](/marketvalue).

ABCDS agreements frequently deliver settlements on a pay-as-you-go basis, meaning the seller remunerates the buyer for any write-downs or non-repayments as they happen. For example, if the value of one of the underlying loans in the asset-backed security declines by $10,000, the asset-backed credit default swap (ABCDS) seller will remunerate the buyer by $10,000. From the ABCDS buyer's point of view, their asset-backed security generally operates as in the event that each loan in the pool of loans is being reimbursed by its original terms and expected rate of interest. Yet, in exchange for that security, the buyer must pay a customary premium to the ABCDS seller.
