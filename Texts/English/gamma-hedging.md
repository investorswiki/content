# Gamma Hedging
## What Is Gamma Hedging?

Gamma hedging is a trading strategy that attempts to keep a consistent delta in a [options](/option) position, frequently one that is delta-neutral, as the underlying asset changes price. It is utilized to reduce the risk made when the underlying security takes strong up or down actions, especially during the last days before expiration.

An option position's [gamma](/gamma) is the rate of change in its [delta](/delta) for each 1-point move in the underlying asset's price. Gamma is an important measure of the convexity of a [derivative's](/subordinate) value, comparable to the underlying asset. A [delta hedge](/deltahedging) strategy, in comparison, just reduces the effect of generally small underlying price changes on the options price.

## How Gamma Hedging Works

A [gamma neutral](/gammaneutral) options position is one that has been vaccinated to large moves in a [underlying security](/underlying-security). Achieving a gamma neutral position is a method of overseeing risk in options trading by laying out an asset portfolio whose delta's rate of change is close to zero, even as the underlying rises or falls. This is known as gamma hedging. A gamma-neutral portfolio is in this manner hedged against second-order time [price sensitivity](/price-sensitivity).

Gamma hedging comprises of adding extra option contracts to a portfolio, for the most part as opposed to the current position. For instance, in the event that a large number of calls were being held in a position, a trader could add a small put-option position to offset an unexpected drop in price during the next 24 to 48 hours, or sell a carefully picked number of call options at an alternate strike price. Gamma hedging is a sophisticated activity that requires careful calculation to be done accurately.

## Gamma versus Delta

Gamma is the Greek-letter set motivated name of a standard variable from the [Black-Scholes Model](/blackscholes), the principal formula recognized as a standard for pricing options. Inside this formula are two specific variables that assist traders with understanding the manner in which option prices change comparable to the price moves of the underlying security: delta and gamma.

[Delta](/delta) lets a trader know how much a [option's](/optionscontract) price is expected to change in light of a small change in the underlying stock or asset — specifically a one-dollar change in price.

Gamma alludes to the rate of change of an option's delta with respect to the change in the price of an underlying stock or other asset's price. Basically, gamma is the rate of change of the price of an option. In any case, a few traders likewise think of gamma as the expected change coming about because of the second continuous one-dollar change in the price of the underlying. So that by adding gamma and delta to the original delta, you'd get the expected move from a two-dollar move in the underlying security.

## Delta-Gamma Hedging

Delta-gamma hedging is an options strategy that consolidates both delta and gamma hedges to moderate the risk of changes in the underlying asset — and furthermore in the delta itself — as the underlying asset moves. With delta hedging alone, a position has protection from small changes in the underlying asset. Nonetheless, large changes will change the hedge (change the delta), leaving the position defenseless. By adding a gamma hedge, the delta hedge stays in salvageable shape.

Utilizing a gamma hedge related to a delta hedge requires an investor to make new hedges when the underlying asset's delta changes. The number of underlying shares that are bought or sold under a delta-gamma hedge relies upon whether the underlying asset price is expanding or decreasing, and by how much.

A trader who is attempting to be delta-hedged or [delta-neutral](/deltaneutral) is typically making a trade that has next to no change in light of the short-term price vacillation of a smaller size. Such a trade is in many cases a bet that [volatility](/volatility), or at the end of the day, demand for the options of that security, will trend towards a huge rise or fall from now on. However, even delta hedging won't safeguard an options trader very well on the day preceding expiration. On this day, on the grounds that so brief period stays before expiration, the impact of even a normal price variance in the underlying security can cause extremely huge price changes in the option. Delta hedging is hence insufficient under these conditions.

Gamma hedging is added to a delta-hedged strategy as an approach to protecting the trader from larger than expected changes to a security, or even a whole portfolio, however most frequently to safeguard from the effects of quick price change in the option when time value has totally disintegrated.

## Gamma Hedging versus Delta Hedging

As we have seen above, delta-and gamma-hedging are frequently utilized together. A simple delta hedge can be made by purchasing call options and shorting a certain number of shares of the [underlying](/underlying-asset) stock simultaneously. In the event that the stock's price continues as before, however volatility rises, the trader might profit except if time value erosion obliterates those profits. A trader could add a short call with an alternate [strike price](/strikeprice) to the strategy to offset time value decay and safeguard against a large move in the delta; adding that second call to the position is a gamma hedge.

As the underlying stock rises and falls in value, an investor might buy or sell shares in the stock on the off chance that they wish to keep the position neutral. This can increase the trade's volatility and costs. Delta and gamma hedging don't need to be totally neutral, and traders might change how much positive or negative gamma they are presented to after some time.
