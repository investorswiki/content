# Texas Ratio
## What Is a Texas Ratio?

The Texas ratio was developed to caution of credit problems at particular banks or banks in particular areas. The Texas ratio takes the amount of a bank's [non-performing assets](/non-performing-assets) and partitions this number by the sum of the bank's [tangible common equity](/substantial common-equity) and its loan [loss reserves](/loss-save). A ratio of more than 100 (or 1:1) shows that non-performing assets are greater than the resources the bank might have to cover likely losses on those assets.

## How the Texas Ratio Works

The Texas ratio was developed as an early warning system to distinguish potential problem banks. It was initially applied to banks in Texas during the 1980s and proved helpful for New England banks in the mid 1990s. The Texas ratio was developed by Gerard Cassidy and different analysts at RBC Capital Markets. Cassidy found that banks with a Texas ratio of greater than 100 will generally fail.

During the 1980s Texas saw an energy boom. Banks financed the flood, however soon the oil flood subsided and banks began to battle. Thus, Texas saw the best number of bank failures from 1986 to 1992 in the nation.

As part of the Texas ratio, non-performing assets incorporate loans that are in default or real estate the bank has needed to abandon. These could become expenses for the bank. On the opposite side, unmistakable equity does exclude intangibles that can't be utilized to cover losses, like goodwill.

## Special Considerations
