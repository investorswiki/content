# Tax Attribute
## What Is a Tax Attribute?

Tax attribute alludes to certain losses, tax credits, and the adjusted basis of property that must be reduced as a result of the exclusion of debt cancellation from a taxpayer's gross income. Tax attributes are adjusted when a taxpayer is indebted or declares bankruptcy.

## How Tax Attributes Work

As per the [cancelation of debt](/cancellation-of-debt) (COD) income rules, canceled debt won't be taxable if:

- The debt was discharged in [bankruptcy](/bankruptcy).
- The debtor is [insolvent](/insolvency), with debts greater than assets, yet just to the degree of the insolvency.
- The canceled debt was a gift or an inheritance from a companion or relative.

Individual and business taxpayers who are excused their debts due to insolvency or bankruptcy don't need to incorporate the pardoned debt as part of their [taxable gross income](/taxableincome). In any case, the discharged debt means financial gain. Under ordinary taxation principles, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) taxes most financial gains earned by people and businesses. In this case, Section 108 of the [Internal Revenue Code](/internal-revenue-code) (IRC) excludes gains from pardoned debt from being considered into taxable income, giving a measure of relief to certain taxpayers who wind up facing serious financial troubles.

Notwithstanding, the amount excluded from gross income is utilized to reduce certain tax attributes. Excluding income under Section 108 expects that a taxpayer delay their [tax liability](/taxliability) by decreasing dollar-for-dollar (or at times, 1/3 of every dollar) certain tax attributes that would somehow be accessible to offset future income. In this way, in effect, when a debt is canceled, the taxpayer relinquishes some tax attribute benefits in exchange for getting positive treatment connecting with the bankruptcy.

The Internal Revenue Code (IRC) specifies that taxpayers must reduce seven tax attributes in the accompanying order:

- [Net operating loss](/netoperatingloss) from any business
- [General business credit](/general-business-tax-credit) vestige
- [Alternative least tax](/alternativeminimumtax) credit
- Capital loss
- The [cost basis](/costbasis) of property
- [Passive activity loss](/passive-activity-loss-rules)
- [Foreign tax credit](/foreign-tax-credit) remainder

Taxpayers might utilize IRS Form 982: **Reduction of Tax Attributes Due to Discharge of Indebtedness** to reduce the basis of depreciable assets before diminishing the other tax attributes.

## Illustration of a Tax Attribute

For instance, on the off chance that $5,000 in debt was pardoned, the taxpayer could choose to have the basis (cost price) of their rental property reduced by $5,000 and concede the tax until the property is sold. Lessening the cost basis of an asset means that a taxpayer will perceive a higher taxable gain (or more modest loss) from the sale of the asset. On the off chance that the property is sold for a gain, $5,000 of that gain will be taxed as ordinary income.

## Features
- Tax attributes are specific economic benefits, for example, tax credits, that must be reduced by the amount of canceled debt excluded from income.
- There are seven types of tax attributes, including net operating losses, capital losses, and passive activity loss.
- In exchange for good tax treatment, the ruined or bankrupt taxpayer must swear off certain tax attribute benefits.
- Gains from discharged debt isn't calculated into taxable income.
- The IRS doesn't need excused debt to be incorporated as taxable gross income.
