# SEC Form 12b-25
## What Is SEC Form 12b-25?

SEC Form 12b-25, otherwise called the Notification of Late Filing, is the document a public company must file with the [Securities and Exchange Commission](/sec) (SEC) when its anticipates missing the deadline for other key filings, like quarterly financial outcomes.

By filing Form 12b-25, a company might avoid penalties associated with failing to file different required forms. Included on the form is a description of why the late filing is taking place and whether the company expects any major shocks compared to its prior year's filing of the required form.

## How SEC Form 12b-25 Works

The SEC requires companies to periodically disclose [financial statements](/financial-statements) so investors can make informed decisions. Investors will normally scrutinize a company's quarterly [10-Q](/10q) and annual [10-K](/10-k) reports before buying [equity](/equity) shares or [corporate bonds](/corporatebond). The SEC assists with facilitating appropriate disclosure of financial information. Companies must report financial outcomes in a specific format and by specific deadlines consistently.

If a company cannot fulfill a time constraint, it would file Form 12B-25. When filing the Notification of Late Filing, the registered firm must provide details including whether "any remaining periodic reports required under Section 13 or 15(d) of the [Securities Exchange Act of 1934](/seact1934) or Section 30 of the [Investment Company Act of 1940](/investmentcompanyact) during the preceding 12 months" or for a more limited period have been filed as required. The filing of SEC Form 12b-25 provides an extension of five or 15 calendar days, depending on the related form.

The filer is likewise required to report if it is "anticipated that any significant change in consequences of operations from the corresponding period for the last fiscal year will be reflected by the earnings statements to be included in the subject report." If thus, the filer is required to join "an explanation of the anticipated change, both narratively and quantitatively, and, if suitable, state the reasons why a reasonable estimate of the outcomes cannot be made."

The SEC Form 12b-25 must be signed by an executive officer of the registrant or by any other duly authorized representative and is commonly filed electronically using the SEC's [EDGAR](/edgar) system.
