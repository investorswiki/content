# Additional Paid-In Capital (APIC)
## What Is Additional Paid-In Capital?
Additional paid-in capital is a journal entry on the [balance sheet](/balancesheet) that addresses the amount investors pay for a company's [stock](/equity) above [par value](/parvalue). It is otherwise called the share premium, or capital surplus. At the point when investors buy into a company's [capital stock](/capitalstock), that capital stock is ordinarily sold over its par value and turns into its paid-in capital.
For publicly traded companies, additional paid-in capital is the difference between the shares' par value and the amount investors pay for shares at a company's [initial public offering](/ipo). This difference is otherwise called paid-in capital in excess of par value. It is included in the [shareholders' equity](/shareholdersequity) section of the balance sheet and might be included as part of the line thing for the issuance of [common](/commonstock) and [preferred stock](/preferredstock). In different cases, it might show up as a separate line thing.
An entry for additional paid-in capital might be made on the balance sheet for a period at whatever point a company sells new shares or [repurchases stock](/buyback). At the point when a company issues new shares again after its IPO, this is known as a follow-on offering (or secondary offering).
Below is an illustration of an entry on additional paid-in capital for Company A. The par value records all shares being issued, which in this case addresses only common stock of 1 billion shares at $0.01 par value per share. Since the IPO was priced at $15 a share, that means $15 billion in shares were sold to investors, putting its total paid-in capital at $15 billion. With the paid-in capital at $10 million, additional paid-in capital can be calculated at $14.99 billion.
