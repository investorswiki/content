# Reaction
## What Is a Reaction?

A reaction, with regards to financial markets, is a sudden yet normally brief upwards or downwards movement in a stock's price. Technical analysts frequently portray a descending movement in the price of a stock after a period of up movement as a reaction.

Reactions are regularly responses to news or data applicable to the company that issued the stock or the industry it works in. The change in price will in general be slight.

A reaction is like a [correction](/correction) or a [reversal](/reversal) yet comes up short on same intensity or longevity.

## Figuring out a Reaction

Reactions are generally viewed as a positive and normal occurrence in a sound market. Ceaseless price increments can bring about an even bigger price drop on the off chance that a company doesn't live up to assumptions or hits some other obstacle.

In fact, a periodic reaction is probably going to prevent an event, for example, a run on a stock or a high volume sell-off sometime in the not too distant future.

A [overreaction](/overreaction) is an extreme response to new data. In finance and investing, it is an emotional response to a security, for example, a stock or other investment, which is driven either by greed or fear. Investors overreacting to news make the security become either overbought or oversold until it returns to its [intrinsic value](/intrinsicvalue).

## Uplifting news and Bad News

A descending reaction is many times a response to negative news. That news could be a terrible [earnings](/earnings) report, a critical story about the company, economic and political vulnerability, and any unforeseen and sad occurrence. Any or these can cause selling pressure and a lessening in stock price.

Positive news will normally make prices rise, but momentarily. An announcement of another product, an acquisition, or the release of a playful economic indicator all can cause a positive reaction in a stock's price.

These events can be genuinely fleeting. A hurricane moving toward landfall can cause a drop in utility stocks and insurance stocks. Hours after the fact, an announcement that the tempest has floated offshore can turn prices around.

## Reactions versus Reversals

Reactions can be disregarded, particularly by investors who are in it for the long take. Reversals are more serious and can long-last. Traders should have the option to recognize the two.

Most reversals include a change in a security's basic essentials that powers the market to reconsider its value. On the off chance that a company reports a shocking quarter, investors will recalculate the stock's net present value and act as needs be. Or on the other hand, a contender's release of a game-changing new product can cause long-term harm to a stock's value.

Events that will end up being huge will initially appear to be a reaction. However, on the off chance that they play out north of several meetings, a true reversal might be in progress.

For this reason traders utilize moving midpoints, trendlines, and trading bands to flag the place where reaction risks entering reversal domain.

## Highlights
- A reaction might last for a couple of meetings before returning to the predominant trend.
- A true reversal or price correction is more profound and more prolonged than a brief and muffled reaction.
- A reaction is a concise movement in price, frequently in response to news or to the release of new data.
