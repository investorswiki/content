# Asian Currency Unit (ACU)
## What Was the Asian Currency Unit (ACU)?

The Asian Currency Unit (ACU), otherwise called the Asian Monetary Unit (AMU), was a proposed [basket](/currencybasket) of Asian currencies, like the [European Currency Unit](/european-currency-unit), which was the forerunner of the [euro](/euro) common currency. Today, the ACU stays a scholarly project with no real foothold among Asian state run administrations, nor much famous support among its residents.

## Grasping the Asian Currency Unit (ACU)

The goal of the ACU was to advance greater free trade and financial flows among Asian countries and release the region's reliance on the U.S. dollar. The [Asian Development Bank](/asian-development-bank) (ADB) is responsible for investigating the feasibility and construction of the currency basket alongside Japan's Research Institute on Economy, Trade, and Industry (RIETI).

The ACU is a proposed currency basket for the currencies of Asian countries that would incorporate China, Japan, South Korea, Indonesia, Malaysia, and Singapore. Specifically, it would act as a common currency basket made out of 13 East Asian currencies, for example, [ASEAN 10](/asean) plus Japan, China, and South Korea.

The ASEAN (Association of Southeast Asian Nations) is a regional organization of 10 Southeast Asian and Pacific Rim countries whose states collaborate to advance socio-social, economic, and political headway in the region. Different proposals have called for the ACU to likewise incorporate Hong Kong and New Zealand.

The reasoning for ACU was that it very well may be utilized for of upgrading internal exchange rate stability assuming the regional central banks start to settle their separate currencies to the ACU unit, hence diminishing the possibility of regional [competitive devaluations](/competitive-devaluation), where one country strategically depreciates its currency in response to another country's own devaluation.

The thought of stabilization by means of an internal basket like Europe's [Exchange Rate Mechanism](/exchange-rate-mechanism) (ERM) is distinct from stabilization utilizing an outside unit, which would expect that the ACU, thus, be pegged here and there to outer currencies like the US dollar or euro, or to some outer basket.

There have been a number of financial instruments that utilization baskets of Asian currencies, however these are separately developed and are not sponsored or utilized for the purpose of exchange in the countries addressed. Yet, there were snags forestalling the creation of an official Asian Currency Unit, including extreme misalignments between the different regional currencies that would have been involved.
