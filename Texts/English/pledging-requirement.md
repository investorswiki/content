# Pledging Requirement
## What is Pledging Requirement?

Pledging Requirement alludes to a legal, or regulatory, expectation that marketable and actively traded securities be pledged as collateral for public fund, or other specific, deposits.

## Understanding Pledging Requirement

Pledging banks generally keep pledged securities in a separate account of some kind. These securities can be held by various institutions, like an independent trustee or [Federal Reserve Bank](/federalreservebank). They can then act as collateral for deposits made by nearby and state governments as well as the federal government. [Treasury securities](/treasurybond) are normally pledged at full face value, while [banker's acceptances](/bankersacceptance) and commercial paper are taken at 90% of their face value.

Banks must pledge securities when they borrow from the Federal Reserve's [discount window.](/discountwindow) The discount window is a central bank lending facility intended to assist commercial banks with overseeing short-term liquidity needs. The Federal Reserve and other central banks keep up with discount windows, alluding to the loans they make at an administered [discount rate](/discountrate) to commercial banks and other store taking firms. Discount window borrowing will in general be short-term - typically overnight - and [collateralized](/collateral). These loans are unique in relation to the uncollateralized lending that banks with deposits at central banks do among themselves. In the U.S., these loans are made at the [federal funds rate](/federalfundsrate), which is lower than the discount rate.

As indicated by frbdiscountwindow.org, the accompanying types of instruments can used to fulfill pledging requirements:

- Obligations of U.S. government agencies and [government-sponsored enterprises](/gse)
- Obligations of the [United States Treasury](/ustreasury)
- Obligations of states or political developments of the U.S.
- [Collateralized mortgage obligations](/cmo) (CMO)
- [Asset-backed securities](/asset-backedsecurity) (ABS)
- [Corporate bonds](/corporatebond)
- [Money market](/moneymarket) instruments
- Residential real estate loan
- Commercial, industrial, or agricultural loans
- Commercial real estate loans
- Consumer loans.

The full value of the loan shouldn't even need to be pledged. The Federal Reserve discount window has a '**Payment System Risk Collateral Margins Table**' that

> "incorporates collateral margins for the most normally pledged asset types. Assets accepted as collateral are assigned a collateral value (market value or estimate increased by the margin) considered proper by the Federal Reserve Bank. The financial condition of an institution might be thought about while allotting values."

The pledging of collateral is one motivation behind why banks generally really like to borrow from different banks since the rate is less expensive, and the loans don't need collateral. Be that as it may, the discount window is an important lender of last resort when the financial system is under stress. Each financial institution realizes it can bring cash promptly up in the case of a liquidity crunch or crisis.
