# Fully Diluted Shares
## What are Fully Diluted Shares?

Fully diluted shares are the total number of common shares of a company that will be outstanding and accessible to trade on the open market after all potential wellsprings of conversion, for example, [convertible bonds](/convertiblebond) and [employee stock options](/eso), are worked out. Fully diluted shares incorporate those which are currently issued as well as those that could be guaranteed through conversion. This number of shares is required for a company's [earnings for every share](/essential earnings-per-share) (EPS) calculations on the grounds that applying fully diluted shares increases the share basis in the calculation while decreasing the dollars earned per share of common stock.

## Seeing Fully Diluted Shares

Fully diluted shares influence the EPS of a company, which is a common measurement for surveying relative value and profitability. EPS addresses net income minus preferred dividends, separated by the weighted average of common shares outstanding, in which the weighted average of common shares outstanding = (beginning period balance + ending period balance)/2.

In the event that a company can increase earnings per common share, it is viewed as more important and the publicly traded share price might increase. Nonetheless, the number of outstanding shares influences this measurement and, when the number increases, it decreases the EPS.

## Figuring in Fully Diluted Shares

Expect that ABC Corporation (ABC) creates $10 million in [net income](/netincome) and pays preferred shareholders a total of $2 million in dividends. The net income accessible to common shareholders is $8 million. Assuming the association's weighted average of common shares outstanding totals 1 million, the EPS will be $8.00 per share or ($8 million/1 million shares). This $8.00 EPS is alluded to as "essential" EPS on the grounds that the total isn't adjusted for dilution.

Full dilution means that each security that can be changed over into common shares has been changed over, showing there will be less earnings accessible per share of common stock. Since EPS is a key measure of a company's value and profitability, it is important for a [investor](/investor) to survey essential EPS as well as fully diluted EPS.

## Illustration of Fully Diluted Shares

A few types of securities can be changed over into common stock, including convertible bonds, convertible preferred stock, employee stock options, rights, and [warrants](/warrant).

Accept that ABC issues 100,000 shares in stock options to employees to reward them for strong company performance. The firm has convertible bonds outstanding that permit bondholders to change over their securities into a total of 200,000 shares of common stock. ABC additionally has convertible preferred stock outstanding and those shares can be changed over into 200,000 shares of common stock too.

Full dilution expects that every one of the 500,000 extra common stock shares are issued, which increases the common shares outstanding to 1.5 million. Applying the $8 million in earnings to common shareholders, fully diluted EPS will be ($8 million/1.5 million shares) or $5.33 per share, which is lower than the fundamental EPS of $8.00 per share.

## Features
- Earnings paid to [preferred shareholders](/preferredstock) as money dividends are deducted from net income on the grounds that EPS applies just to common shareholders.
- While full dilution may not happen at the same time, it demonstrates the number of shares that may be outstanding later on, in view of current company policy in regards to conversions.
- Company policy with respect to conversions might change over the long run, possibly affecting expectations about the future number of fully diluted shares.
