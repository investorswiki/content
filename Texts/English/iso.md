# Incentive Stock Options (ISOs)
## What are incentive stock options?
Incentive stock options, additionally alluded to as qualified stock options, are stock options that must be granted to employees and receive positive tax treatment when exercised. Gains from incentive stock options are taxed at a long-term [capital gains rate](/capitalgain). Dissimilar to [non-qualified stock options](/nso), giving companies can't deduct the cost of incentive stock options as an operating expense.
## More profound definition
Stock options are granted by certain companies as a form of [deferred compensation](/deferred-compensation). They grant employees and certain different gatherings the right to purchase a given number of the company's shares at a fixed price — called the grant price or the [strike price](/strikeprice) — after a brief time span has gone by. Holders by and large exercise stock options when the market price has risen over the grant price, giving them a discount on the shares. They either hold the shares got in the exercise of the option, or sell them quickly for a profit.
Incentive stock options are administered by vesting schedules. Options vest over the long haul, or when key company objectives are met. Different graduated vesting schedules are utilized, with a portion of the options vesting consistently an employee stays with a company. A three-year vesting schedule is extremely common. On the off chance that an employee vests one-fifth of the options granted to her yearly, she turns out to be completely vested following six years. When vested, the employee can exercise options at the grant price whenever over the option term up to the expiration date.
Incentive stock options receive more ideal tax treatment than other stock options. In the event that shares of stock acquired from incentive stock options are sold two years after the grant date or one year after the exercise date, the profits are a qualifying demeanor taxed at the short-or long-term capital gains rate. On the off chance that the shares of stock are sold before these thresholds, the profits are taxed as [ordinary earned income](/ordinaryincome).
Incentive stock options may possibly be exercised assuming the market price is equivalent to the grant price. On the off chance that the price is lower than the grant price, it would involve paying a premium for the shares. Non-qualified stock options might be sold at any market price, either higher or lower than the grant price.
While non-qualified stock options carry less good tax treatment for the holder than incentive stock options, they offer different benefits. Non-qualified stock options can be issued to anybody — employees, board individuals, advisors, sellers — while incentive stock options may just be issued to employees. There are severe limitations on the total market value of incentive stock options that can be exercised in one calendar year.

As the market value of Mobiledyne's stock keeps on rising, Zeke will in any case just pay $10 per share to exercise his options. The difference between the $10 grant price and the exercise price is the spread. In the event that Mobiledyne's stock goes to $25 following seven years, and Zeke exercises every one of his options, the spread will be $15 per share, paying $100,000 for stock carrying a market value of $250,000.
