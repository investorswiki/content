# Negotiated Market
## What Is a Negotiated Market?

A negotiated market is a type of [secondary market](/secondarymarket) exchange in which the prices of every security are dealt out among buyers and sellers. In a negotiated market, there are no market-makers or order matching. All things being equal, buyers and sellers actively haggle on the price at which a transaction is concluded either straightforwardly or using brokers. These markets are viewed as exceptionally inefficient as the time, exertion, and lack of [transparency](/transparency) in pricing are large issues that can't be settled for this type of trading.

## Grasping a Negotiated Market

A negotiated market alludes to the decentralized buying and selling of securities without one central market maker. Negotiated markets exist and function by means of the fundamental principle of supply and demand. Buyers produce demand for a given security or asset by entering bid orders to buy the security at a predetermined amount and price; sellers make the supply for the security by entering ask orders, again at set amounts and costs. The [over-the-counter](/otc) securities market is one major illustration of a negotiated market.

For instance, consider a buyer who needs to buy 1,000 shares of the Small Time Insurance Company. This company is traded only in the over-the-counter market. The buyer calls his broker and asks at a cost quote. The broker checks the market by alluding to the pink sheets issued by the National Quotation Bureau. The pink sheets indicated that a brokerage in Chicago is currently making a market in Small Time Insurance Company, citing it at $20 bid and $20.75 asked. The broker lets the buyer know that Small Time Insurance Company can likely be purchased for $20.75. Assuming the buyer loves the price, he might provide the broker an order to buy Small Time Insurance.

As of now, the buyer's broker would call or wire the broker in Chicago. Such a discussion could go this way:

- Buyer broker: What is your market for Small Time Insurance?
- Chicago broker: 20 bid and 20.75 asked
- Buyer broker: What is the size of your market?
- Chicago broker: 300 shared either way (buy or sell)
- Buyer broker: I will pay 20.25 for 100
- Chicago broker: I will sell 100 at 20.50
- Buyer broker: I will take 100 at 20.5
- Chicago broker: I have sold you 100 shares of Small Time Insurance common stock at 20.50

In practice, the buyer broker most likely checked the quotations of several dealers before making an offer, since different brokers might sell a security at different prices. A broker that needs to buy a security for a customer will check the market by calling several brokers he believes are making a market in the security.

## Negotiated Market versus Auction Market

A negotiated market can be differentiated to an auction market. In an auction market, buyers and sellers enter competitive bids all the while. The price at which a stock trades addresses the highest price that a buyer will pay and the most reduced price that a seller will acknowledge. Matching bids and offers are paired together, and the orders are executed.

For instance, assume that four buyers wish to purchase shares of the company FUN. They make the accompanying bids: $20.00, $20.02, $20.03, and $20.06. Simultaneously, four sellers need to sell shares of FUN, and these sellers submitted offers of $20.00, $20.02, $20.03, $20.06, individually. In this scenario, the people that made bids/offers for FUN at $20.06 will have their orders executed. All excess orders won't promptly be executed, and the current price of company FUN will be $20.06.

The [New York Stock Exchange (NYSE)](/nyse) is one illustration of an auction market while the Nasdaq is an illustration of a negotiated market.
