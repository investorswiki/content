# Loan Commitment
## What is a loan commitment?
A loan commitment is a lender's guarantee to offer a loan or [credit](/credit) of a predefined amount to a borrower. Likewise called a commitment letter, it incorporates the entirety of the terms and conditions of the loan.
## More profound definition
A loan commitment is a formal letter from a lender expressing that the candidate has met every one of the capabilities for getting a loan, and that the lender guarantees a specific amount of money to the borrower.
Many loan commitments are unconditional, meaning the loan isn't just a one-time, lump sum payment that the borrower must pay back. All things being equal, the borrower can keep on involving this amount as long as the individual continues to pay it back. This makes it like a [revolving line of credit](/revolvingcredit, for example, a credit card. On the off chance that the borrower utilizes a portion of the loan amount and pays it back, the lender applies the payment to the borrower's [principal](/principal) balance.
An unassuming loan commitment is contingent upon the borrower's credit status and requires meeting certain capabilities. A loan commitment can be either secured or [unsecured](/unsecuredloan). An unsecured loan requires no collateral, however a secured loan does.
## Loan commitment model
Marcus applies for a mortgage and he gets several notification during the cycle telling him the situation with the loan application and making sense of how everything functions. In the first place, he gets a prequalification letter that affirms that he meets the capabilities for the loan, yet that the lender must survey his documentation before going with a last choice. When the lender gets and surveys the entirety of this documentation, and chooses to offer Marcus a mortgage, it sends a loan commitment letter affirming the decision. The letter will incorporate the amount of the loan as well as every one of the terms and conditions, for example, the interest rate and term.
