## What Are Accumulating Shares?

Accumulating shares is a classification of common stock that is given to shareholders of a company in lieu of, or notwithstanding, a dividend.

## Understanding Accumulating Shares

By taking accumulating shares rather than cash dividends, shareholders don't need to pay income tax on the distributions in the current year. Be that as it may, it is as yet mandatory to pay [capital gains tax](/capital_gains_tax), if any, in the year when the shares are sold. Some of the time companies pay out these types of shares notwithstanding cash dividends as [stock dividends](/stockdividend).

A company's [board of directors (B of D)](/boardofdirectors) chooses whether to pay dividends, how much, and in what form. In practically all cases, dividends are paid in cash, primarily in light of the fact that investors anticipate it. This is especially true for stocks that are depended upon by investors for customary income. At times — for instance, when a company needs to safeguard cash on its balance sheet — accumulating shares are given to existing shareholders.

One more justification behind distributing these shares is to increase the number of [outstanding shares](/outstandingshares), in this way supporting the [liquidity](/liquidity) in the public market. It is important to note that existing shareholders won't endure [dilution](/dilution) of their holdings on the grounds that the shares are going to them rather than to different investors. They hold proportional stakes in the company.

Accumulating shares are likewise a feature of [mutual funds](/mutualfund). A mutual fund investor is generally given the decision between getting income distributions in cash from the fund or reinvesting the income back into the fund. Assuming that the investor selects reinvestment, the income is utilized to purchase extra shares in the fund.

Generally talking, since equity prices will more often than not rise after some time, the common money wisdom is to acknowledge accumulating shares rather than cash dividends in the event that you make some long memories horizon and you don't rely upon dividend income for daily everyday costs.

## Stock Dividends

Otherwise called a "scrip dividend," a stock dividend is a distribution of shares to existing shareholders in lieu of a [cash dividend](/cashdividend) and is consequently a form of accumulating shares. This type of dividend arises when a company needs to reward its investors yet either doesn't have the capital to disperse or it needs to hold onto its existing liquidity for different investments.

Stock dividends likewise have a tax advantage in that they aren't taxed until the shares are sold by an investor. This makes them advantageous for shareholders who don't require immediate capital.

The board of a public company, for instance, can support a 5% stock dividend, which provides existing investors with an extra share of company stock for each 20 shares they currently own. In any case, this means that the pool of accessible equities increases by 5%, weakening the value of existing shares.

Subsequently, in this model, even however an investor who possesses 100 shares in a company might receive 5 extra shares, the total [market value](/marketvalue) of those shares continues as before. Along these lines, a stock dividend is basically the same as a [stock split](/stocksplit).
