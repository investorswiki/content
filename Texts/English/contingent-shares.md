# Contingent Shares
## What Are Contingent Shares?

The term **contingent shares** alludes to company [stock](/stock) that is issued to certain shareholders under special conditions. They act just like customary common stock, then again, actually companies issue them when they meet certain conditions, for example, making a [profit](/profit), meeting earnings expectations, or during [mergers and acquisitions](/mergersandacquisitions) (M&A). At the point when a company issues contingent shares, the ownership of existing shareholders becomes diluted.

## How Contingent Shares Work

Corporate [shares](/shares) address an ownership stake in the company by the holder. Private companies issue shares to founders, owners, and their management teams. Public companies offer shares to the overall population on the primary and secondary markets, where a single share shows a certain equity stake in the company. So in the event that a company has 100 shares and one person possesses 10 of them, they have a 10% ownership stake.

Shares come in many shapes and sizes. The most common are [common shares](/commonstock), which permit shareholders to vote on corporate issues and to choose the board of directors, and [preferred shares](/preferredstock), which give shareholders priority for dividend payments over others. Then there are contingent shares.

Contingent shares are just similar to [common shares](/commonstock) — with one difference. They are simply moved to the beneficiary once certain conditions are met. These conditions differ contingent upon the specific situation. Common models incorporate the accomplishment of determined [revenue](/revenue) targets or operational milestones, like the release of another product a work in progress.

They are commonly utilized in M&A activity. At the point when one company gains another, the two gatherings might differ on the price to be paid. At the point when this occurs, one party can offer contingent shares to the next party to help close [negotiations](/exchange). When the deal is complete, the shares can be moved to the planned beneficiaries. On the off chance that the condition isn't met — paying little heed to what it is — the shares become worthless and aren't issued by any means.
