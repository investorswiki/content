## What Is an Incumbency Certificate?

An incumbency certificate (or certificate of incumbency) is an official document issued by a corporation or limited liability company (LLC) that rundowns the names of its current directors, officers, and, infrequently, [key shareholders](/head shareholder). It determines who holds which positions inside the organization, and is most often used to affirm the identity of people who are authorized to go into legally binding transactions for the company's sake.

Outside of the U.S., an incumbency certificate may likewise be known as a register of directors, certificate of officers, or secretary certificate.

## Understanding Incumbency Certificates

Incumbency certificates like a certificate of incumbency, certificate of officers, officer's certificate, register of directors, or secretary's certificate, all basically give a similar data. Incumbency certificates are issued by the corporate secretary and frequently bear the corporate seal and might be legally approved by a [public notary](/notary). Since the secretary is the officer in charge of keeping company records, the incumbency certificate is an official act of the company, and outsiders can sensibly depend on its exactness.

An incumbency certificate contains all important specifics with respect to the company's directors and officers, for example, the occupant's name, position, whether chose or designated, and the term of office. It likewise ordinarily incorporates a signature sample for comparison purposes.

An ordinary incumbency certificate might be phrased as follows:

>
> The undersigned, X, Secretary of ABC Inc. (the "Company"), thusly affirms that the persons named below do hold the position set forward inverse their names with the Company, that the signature showing up inverse each such person's name is the true signature of such person, and that they are appropriately authorized to ..."
>

This notice would then be trailed by a rundown of the directors and officers, the date, and the secretary's signature. This document can be requested by a financial institution when the company applies to open a bank account or starts a major transaction. Likewise, the certificate could be requested by an attorney or any other individual who needs to affirm the lawfulness and stated position of a director or officer inside the corporation.

Anybody who is engaged with a transaction with a company and needs to affirm the stated position of an officer inside the company might request an incumbency certificate from the secretary of the company. In practice, an incumbency certificate is much of the time required by a bank or another financial institution while opening an account to guarantee that the person who claims to be the authorized signatory of a company genuinely is.

Essentially, when attorneys are drafting contracts for transactions including companies, they ordinarily require an official incumbency certificate to determine who can legally tie the company in the contracts.
