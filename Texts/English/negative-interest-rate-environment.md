## What Is a Negative Interest Rate Environment?

A negative interest rate environment exists when the nominal [overnight interest rate](/overnightrate) falls below zero percent for a specific economic zone. This means that banks and other financial institutions would need to pay to keep their [excess reserves](/excess_reserves) stored at the central bank as opposed to receive positive interest income.

A [negative interest rate policy](/negative-interest-rate-policy-nirp) (NIRP) is an unconventional [monetary policy](/monetarypolicy) tool by which nominal [target interest rates](/target-rate) are set with a negative value, below the hypothetical lower bound of zero percent.

## Understanding a Negative Interest Rate Environment

The catalyst for a negative interest rate is to invigorate economic growth by empowering banks to loan or invest excess reserves instead of experience a guaranteed loss. That's what the theory goes, with interest rates below zero, banks, organizations, and households will invigorate the economy by spending money as opposed to saving it. A negative interest rate environment is accepted to urge banks to make more loans, households to buy more products, and organizations to invest extra cash as opposed to depositing it in the bank.

Since it is strategically troublesome and expensive to transfer and store large amounts of physical cash, a few banks are still good with paying negative interest on their deposits. Notwithstanding, assuming the interest rate is set adequately negative, it will start to surpass storage costs.

Negative interest rate environments are planned to punish banks for holding onto cash as opposed to broadening loans. They ought to, from a certain point of view, make it less expensive for organizations and households to take out loans, empowering really borrowing and pumping more cash into the economy.

## Risks of a Negative Interest Rate Environment

All things being equal, they might accumulate cash at home. Founding a negative interest rate environment might move a cash run, triggering households to pull their cash out of the bank to abstain from paying negative interest rates for saving.

Banks that wish to stay away from cash runs can cease from applying the negative interest rate to the similarly small deposits of household savers. All things being equal, they apply negative interest rates to the large balances held by [pension funds](/pensionplan), investment firms, and other corporate clients. This urges corporate savers to invest in bonds and different vehicles that offer better returns while protecting the bank and the economy from the negative effects of a cash run.

Notwithstanding, the negative interest rates are up to this point small.

Central banks have wondered whether or not to bring down negative interest rates too far below zero in light of the fact that the practice of establishing negative interest rate environments didn't start up to this point, with the ECB being the main major financial institution to establish such an environment.
