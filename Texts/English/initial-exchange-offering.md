# Initial Exchange Offering (IEO)
An Initial Exchange Offering, commonly alluded to as an IEO, is a raising money event that is administered by an exchange. In contrast to an Initial Coin Offering (ICO) where the project team themselves conduct the gathering pledges, an Initial Exchange Offering means that the raising support will be conducted on a notable exchange's raising money platform, like Binance Launchpad, where users can purchase tokens with funds straightforwardly from their own exchange wallet.
The ICO fever in 2017 proved to be an exceptionally high-risk environment for people needing to take part in new blockchain project token releases, from coincidentally sending funds to the wrong wallet, or some project teams absconding with funds.

### What are the Benefits of an IEO?
For a client, an IEO is not difficult to partake in as they don't have to oversee on-chain transactions with various wallets on various blockchains. All things considered, a client only necessities an account on the exchange and a few funds in their account and can partake totally through the trusted site's interface. Additionally, the exchange is staking its reputation behind the projects on its platform, offering a higher degree of trust behind the project.
For a project hoping to raise funds, an IEO offers the commitment of an immediate userbase that can see their product, and contingent upon the size of the exchange's crowd, could mean that the project can reduce their outside marketing pipes for gathering pledges, permitting them to zero in only on the development of their product.
Assuming you plan on participating on an IEO on Binance Launchpad, it is suggested that you read through the whole Binance Research report for the specific token you wish to purchase.
