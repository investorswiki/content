# Hammering
## What Is Hammering?

Hammering is quick and concentrated selling of stock [shares](/shares) in the wake of a surprising event that is perceived as very harming to the company's short-term performance. The effect of hammering is a precarious drop in the price of the stock.

## How Hammering Works
### Grasping an Asteroid Event

Hammering is generally a response to startling awful news, otherwise called a [asteroid event](/asteroid-event, for example, a psychological militant attack. It might zero in on a single stock, a sector of the market, or the whole stock market.

Now and again, investors might team up with an end goal to push the share price lower for their own motivations. Hammering can be achieved with a couple of large sale orders or many small sell orders.

A single company might experience an asteroid event that triggers hammering. On the off chance that the progress of a company depends on the reputation of a specific chief or the outcome of a single product, an adverse event may in a flash change the company's outlook.

A few companies and industries are especially inclined to asteroid events. For a small drug or biotechnology company, a misfortune in a clinical trial or FDA endorsement can change expectations of its short-term profit expectations overnight.

More normal asteroid events incorporate corporate [restructurings](/rebuilding), [mergers](/consolidation) and acquisitions deals, [bankruptcy](/bankruptcy), side projects, or [takeovers](/takeover). Assuming such an event gets the market by surprise, the stock could well get hammered.

Investors might try to benefit from an asteroid event on the off chance that they see it as a brief stock mispricing. They basically buy the stock after it falls in the expectation that it will rapidly recuperate.

That strategy might fizzle. After an asteroid event, stock analysts audit the stock and may issue reconsidered suggestions and lower price targets. Different investors will answer those proposals, keeping the stock's price lower for the long take.

A few asteroid events really are great at a stock's cost. When a [hostile takeover](/hostiletakeover) happens, the stock price of the target company is probably going to rise. Assuming the takeover comes up short, the stock price could rise or fall relying upon market sentiment.

### Achieving a Hammer Candlestick Chart Pattern

Technical analysts, who watch the high points and low points of stock prices to recognize patterns that can be taken advantage of, have distinguished a [hammer](/hammer) [candlestick](/candlestick) pattern that shows a recovery in a stock's price.

This indicator might show up after a prolonged downtrend in the stock's price. The stock perseveres through strong selling. It arrives at a low point and afterward starts to recuperate. Eventually, it closes close to its previous mark or higher.

In this case, the market might be viewed as "hammering out a base."

## Instance of Hammering a Stock

Shares of Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. (CMG) got hammered after 22 individuals reported turning out to be ill in the wake of eating at its restaurants in October 2015. A type of E. coli contamination was accused.

Chipotle acted rapidly after the early reports. It briefly closed 43 areas in Washington state and Oregon even before testing confirmed its food was to be faulted.

The terrible news continued to come. By late January 2016, a total of 55 individuals in 11 states had been nauseated by one of two kinds of E. coli microscopic organisms perhaps linked to Chipotle products.

From October 2015 to February 2018, shares went from above $750 per share right down to $250. In each company's nightmare scenario, Chipotle Mexican Grill turned into the victim of late-night satire kids about food harming.

Yet, that wasn't its finish. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) acknowledged the company for a number of aggressive measures to deal with the crisis, including the immediate shutdown of 43 West Coast restaurants. Furthermore, Chipotle:

- Directed 2,500 microbial tests on its food, restaurant surfaces, and equipment. None showed E. coli defilement;
- Expanded its testing of products before restocking its restaurants;
- All directed a deep cleaning of its restaurants, and,
- Worked closely with government specialists to reconsider its food safety standards.

Chipotle stock didn't return to its previous levels until well into 2019. By mid-2020, its price had nearly reached $1,200 a share. Most would agree that Chipotle accomplished that hammer candlestick pattern, albeit maybe not as fast as a portion of its investors would have trusted.
