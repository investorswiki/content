# Residual Equity Theory
## What Is Residual Equity Theory?

Residual equity theory expects [common shareholders](/common_shareholder) to be the real owners of a business. It follows that accountants and corporate managers must likewise embrace the viewpoint of shareholders.

Under this theory, [preferred stock](/preferredstock) is a liability for common shareholders as opposed to part of the firm's equity. Subsequent to deducting preferred shares, just common shares stay as the residual equity. This is the basis of residual equity theory, and common shareholders can be considered residual investors.

## How Residual Common Equity Works

In residual equity theory, the equity value of a firm is calculated by deducting the claims of debtholders and preferred shareholders from a company's assets. Preferred stockholders have a higher claim on distributions (e.g., dividends) than common stockholders and act fairly like a hybrid between common equity and a corporate bond in that it delivers a consistent dividend. Preferred stockholders typically have no or limited, voting rights in corporate governance.

Residual equity is hence indistinguishable in value to the firm's common stock.

Common shareholders are the last in line to be compensated in the event that a company seeks financial protection, so the theory states that equity ought to be calculated according to their point of view. The theory contends that they ought to receive adequate data about corporate finances and performance to settle on sound investment choices. This prompts the [earnings-per-share (EPS)](/eps) calculation that applies just to common stockholders.

## The Development of Residual Equity Theory

George Staubus, a financial accounting scientist, developed residual equity theory at the University of California, Berkeley. Staubus was an advocate for the proceeded with improvement of the standards and practices of financial reporting. He contended that the primary objective of financial reporting ought to be to give data that is valuable in settling on investment choices.

Staubus settled on substantial contributions to choice handiness theory, which was quick to interface cash flows to the measurement of assets and liabilities. This approach stresses data that is important for going with investment choices. Choice value theory was in the end incorporated into [generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP)](/gaap) and the applied structure of the [Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB)](/fasb).

## Special Considerations: Alternative Theories

The proprietary theory of accounting is the most well known alternative to residual equity theory. Initial accounting classes generally stress proprietary theory, and it works out equity as assets minus liabilities. Proprietary theory turns out best for [sole proprietorships](/soleproprietorship) and [partnerships](/partnership), and it is more clear. Notwithstanding, residual equity theory can introduce a more accurate picture while investing in publicly traded companies.

Other equity speculations incorporate the [entity theory](/entity-theory), in which a firm is treated as a separate entity from owners and creditors. In the entity theory, a firm's income is its property until distributed to shareholders. Enterprise theory goes further and considers the interests of partners like employees, customers, government agencies, and society.
