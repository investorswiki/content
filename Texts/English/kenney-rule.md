## What Is the Kenney Rule?

Kenney rule alludes to a ratio that sets a target of [unearned premiums](/unearned-premium) to an insurer's [policyholders' surplus](/policyholder-surplus) of 2-to-1. Developed by Roger Kenney, it decides and reduce the risk of an insurance company's insolvency. The rule is commonly utilized by companies that compose property and casualty insurance. Regulators can utilize the Kenney rule to an insurer's ability to pay out claims and stay dissolvable.

## Understanding the Kenney Rule

The Kenney rule is named after Roger Kenney, an expert in insurance finances who distributed the book **Fundamentals of Fire and Casualty Insurance Strength** in 1949. While Kenney's attention was on [underwriting](/underwriting) property insurance policies, the rule has been adjusted to insurers who guarantee different types of policies, including [liability insurance](/liability_insurance).

This rule, likewise called the Kenney ratio, is a core value utilized by insurance companies. The ratio shifts as per the insurance lines and is still commonly utilized in the property and casualty segment of the industry. The common ratio is customarily viewed as 2-to-1 of [net premiums](/net-premium) to surplus. Specific segments, like liability insurance, utilize a somewhat unique ratio — 3-to-1.

However, what does this all mean? The Kenney rule states that the ratio of policyholders' surplus to its unearned premium reserve is an indicator of the strength of one insurance company relative to another. The policyholders' surplus addresses the insurer's net assets, included capital, reserves, and surplus.

The unearned premium addresses the liability that is still unaccounted for by the insurer. Having a higher policyholders' surplus relative to unearned premium means that the insurer is more robust monetarily. A lower policyholders' surplus to unearned premiums suggests the inverse — that the company is monetarily temperamental.

> Having a ratio that is too high might demonstrate that an insurance company isn't generating sufficient business.

## Special Considerations

There is nobody size-fits-all standard for a Kenney rule ratio that is viewed as great or acceptable. The type of policy figures out what is viewed as a sound Kenney rule ratio. Policies that don't give extended coverage or those that don't have an adjusted coverage date are more straightforward to account for on the grounds that incidents happening before or after the policies' effective period are not generally covered.

Insurance companies need to ensure they have a sufficient cushion to cover any liabilities associated with the policies they endorse. However, that doesn't mean a high Kenney ratio is dependably smart. That is on the grounds that an exceptionally high surplus to liability ratio addresses a [opportunity cost](/opportunitycost) — the benefits that the company might pass up by having too much cash close by in its reserves. Here's the reason.

In the event that the insurer is in a relatively[ okay environment ](/insurance-risk-class)and doesn't endorse numerous policies, it can have a high ratio and be renouncing future increases to its surplus. This is on the grounds that it isn't taking on new business.

Preferably, an insurer ought to endeavor to accomplish a ratio that finds some kind of harmony between the two, generating business and keeping up with operational growth while as yet accumulating an adequate cushion to safeguard them against possible claims. Once more, the specific ratio shifts relying upon the type of policy included.
