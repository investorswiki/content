# Hedonic Regression
## What Is Hedonic Regression?

Hedonic regression is the utilization of a regression model to estimate the influence that different factors have on the price of a decent, or some of the time the demand for a decent. In a hedonic regression model, the dependent variable is the price (or demand) of the great, and the independent variables are the traits of the great accepted to influence utility for the buyer or consumer of the upside. The subsequent estimated coefficients on the independent variables can be deciphered as the loads that buyers place on the different characteristics of the upside.

## Figuring out Hedonic Regression

Hedonic regression is utilized in [hedonic pricing](/hedonicpricing) models and is commonly applied in real estate, retail, and economics. Hedonic pricing is a [revealed-preference](/uncovered inclination) method utilized in economics and consumer science to decide the relative significance of the variables which influence the price of or demand for a decent or service. For instance, in the event that the price of a not entirely settled by various characteristics, similar to the number of rooms, the number of washrooms, vicinity to schools, and so on, regression analysis can be utilized to decide the relative significance of every variable.

The hedonic pricing regression utilizes ordinary least squares, or further developed regression procedures, to estimate the degree to which several factors influence the price of a product or a piece of real estate, similar to a house. The price is defined as the dependent variable and is relapsed on a set of independent variables that are accepted to influence the price, in light of economic theory, the examiner's instinct, or consumer research. On the other hand, an inductive approach, for example, [data mining](/datamining), can be utilized to screen and decide the variables to remember for the model. The chose characteristics (called credits) of the great might be addressed as continuous or dummy variables.

## Applications of Hedonic Regression

The most common illustration of the hedonic pricing method is in the housing market, wherein the price of a building or land not set in stone by the characteristics of the property itself (e.g., size, appearance, highlights like sun powered chargers or cutting edge spigot fixtures, and condition), as well as characteristics of its general environment (e.g., in the event that the area has a high crime rate or potentially is open to schools and a midtown area, the level of water and air pollution, or the value of different homes close by).

Hedonic regression is likewise utilized in [consumer price index (CPI)](/consumerpriceindex) computations to control for the effect of changes in product quality. The price of any great in the CPI basket can be modeled as a function of a set of properties, and when (at least one) of these characteristics changes, the estimated impact on the price can be calculated. The hedonic quality adjustment method eliminates any price differential credited to a change in quality by adding or deducting the estimated value of that change from the price of the thing.

## Beginning of Hedonics

In 1974, Sherwin Rosen previously introduced a theory of hedonic pricing in his paper, "Hedonic Pricing and Implicit Markets: Product Differentiation in Pure Competition," affiliated with the University of Rochester and Harvard University. In the publication, Rosen contends that a thing's total price can be considered a sum of the price of every one of its homogeneous characteristics. A thing's price can likewise be relapsed on these unique characteristics to decide the effect of every characteristic on its price.

## Highlights
- In a hedonic regression model, a price is typically the dependent variable and the qualities that are accepted to give utility to the buyer or consumer are the independent variables.
- Hedonic regression is the application of regression analysis to estimate the impact that different factors have on the price or demand for a decent.
- Hedonic regression is commonly utilized in real estate pricing and quality adjustment for price indexes.
