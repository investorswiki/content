## Types of Count Analysis

As verified above, there are various methods for count analysis, like breakout, reversal, and horizontal counts.

### Breakout Count Analysis

The [breakout](/breakout) count method is utilized to find a bullish price objective must be utilized with an active P&F buy signal. There are four steps to this method.

In the first place, the most active sell signal, known as a [Double Bottom](/doublebottom) Breakdown, must be found on the P&F chart, working from right to left. The subsequent step includes working to the right of this signal to find the next buy signal or the [Double Top](/doubletop) Breakout. The column creating this signal is key since it turns into the measure column. Then, at that point, the level of the measure column must be calculated and duplicated by the crate reversal amount. At long last, the total of this calculation must be added to the low of the column to one side of the measure column.

### Reversal Count Analysis

The [reversal](/reversal) count method might be utilized to find [bullish](/bull) and [bearish](/bear) price objectives. There are three steps used to track down bullish prices. The reversal count must be utilized with an active P&F buy signal. To start with, working from left to right, the latest P&F sell signal must be found. The X column next to the sell signal turns into the measure column. Next, the level of the column must be calculated and increased by the crate [reversal amount](/reversalamount). Then, the total must be added to the low of the column to one side of the measure column.

### Horizontal Count Analysis

For the horizontal count method, a [congestion](/congestion) pattern or reversal must form on a P&F chart. The congestion pattern should be at least five columns wide and must have a column that breaks the congestion. The columns in this pattern are to be counted. This is the width. After the breakout column happens on the P&F chart, analysts can increase the width by the [box size](/boxsize) and the reversal amount to estimate price extension. The extension is added to the low of the pattern at a cost objective.
