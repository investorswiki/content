# Closed Loop MRP
## What Is Closed Loop MRP?

Closed Loop MRP (Manufacturing Resource Planning) is a software system companies use for production planning and inventory control.

## Understanding Closed Loop MRP

Closed Loop MRP contains an information feedback feature that empowers plans to be continuously checked and adjusted. They synchronize the purchasing or materials [procurement](/procurement) plans with the master production schedule.

Inputs to the system include a bio of materials, inventory status documents, and master production schedules. The system takes care of back information about completed assembling and materials close by into the MRP system so these production plans can be adjusted according to capacity and different requirements. The system is called a closed loop MRP in light of its feedback feature, which is likewise alluded to as "closing the loop."

Closed Loop MRP was developed during the 1970s as a replacement to prior open-loop materials requirements planning systems, which could receive information however had no mechanism to receive feedback. As a result of that improvement, systems can oversee master production schedules (MPS), guide capacity planning and shop floor activities, and create scheduling changes.

Closed Loop MRP systems are valuable in the assembling of an extensive variety of production types including profoundly modified products as well as high-volume batch products. Closed Loop MRP's benefits include reductions in inventory (and associated costs), rush orders, and lead times, greater responsiveness to customer demand, more limited delivery times, and better capacity utilization.

Since they have a feedback feature, closed loop systems likewise assist the manufacturer with incorporating the return cycle into their manufacturing loop. In this specific situation, "returns" alludes to products that are sent back by individual customers and retail channels as well as returns produced using the quality cycle back to the manufacturing floor.

Manufacturers who use MRP systems either design their own, or purchase software they can redo to their production cycle. While designing or transitioning to one, system complexity can be a stumbling block and implementation times, including training faculty and testing systems, can stretch from months to years depending on the organization's size.

## Continued Evolution of MRP Systems

Closed loop MRP systems are viewed as second-age systems, and have since been displaced by [manufacturing resource planning](/manufacturing-resource-planning) (MRP II) and [enterprise resource planning](/erp) (ERP) systems. While MRP systems were principally worried about materials utilized in the manufacturing system, MRP II and ERP systems integrated extra angles including finance and accounting, sale and marketing, and [human resources](/humanresources).

Building on the usefulness contained in closed-loop MRP systems, these more up to date systems profited from advances in computing technology to send supply and demand forecasting reenactments and consider the possibility that situations and pair them with [just-in-time](/jit) (JIT) inventory management systems.

The major providers of ERP software systems include Oracle (ORCL), Systemanalyse Programmentwicklung (SAP), Microsoft (MSFT), Sage, and Netsuite with the last two specializing in systems designed to address the issues of medium-sized companies.

## Features
- Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) systems and MRP II have displaced closed loop MRP systems.
- It was developed during the 1970s as a replacement to prior open-loop materials requirements planning systems.
- Closed loop MRP is a software system utilized for production planning and inventory control with a feedback feature that empowers dynamic adjustments during the processes.
