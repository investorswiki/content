# Discount to Net Asset Value
## What Is Discount to Net Asset Value?

A discount to net asset value is a pricing situation that happens when an exchange-traded fund (ETF) or mutual fund's [market trading price](/market-price) is lower than its daily [net asset value](/nav) (NAV). Several factors might trigger a discount, including occurrences where the market has a negative future outlook on the underlying holdings of a fund.

Discount to NAV can be appeared differently in relation to [premium to NAV](/premium_to_nav).

## Understanding Discount to Net Asset Value

A discount to net asset value can happen with [closed-end](/closed-endinvestment) mutual funds and [ETFs](/etf) as both of these investments trade on the open market and work out a daily NAV. A discount to NAV surfaces when the market trading price is lower than the latest NAV. A discount frequently shows the market is generally bearish on the investments in the fund and the fund organization's capability to produce returns.

The NAV of a fund is calculated after the close of each trading day. It is viewed as a forward price NAV since it accounts for all transactions that have happened since the previous day's price calculation. The NAV is the value of the fund's total [assets](/asset) at market close, minus the fund's liabilities, separated by the total number of [shares outstanding](/outstandingshares).

Closed-end funds and ETFs trade on exchanges with transactions happening at a [market value](/marketvalue) â€” an erratic price not entirely set in stone by market participants. At the point when the fund trades over its last quoted NAV it is trading at a premium. At the point when it trades below its last traded NAV it is trading [at a discount](/at-a-discount).

## Profiting from a Discount to Net Asset Value

A discount flags that investors, perhaps wrongly or properly, find the [securities](/security) in the fund to be valued below their extensive NAV value. This can happen over the course of the day from [bid-ask spread](/bid-askspread) variance and the price of underlying securities falling due to negative market news, in addition to other things.

> Much of the time, a premium or discount might be due to slight varieties in the market pricing of the securities inside the fund. The NAV is calculated once each day while the securities trade almost 24 hours daily around the world.

Closed-end funds tend to trade with higher [volatility](/volatility) from their NAV than ETFs. That is on the grounds that ETFs have [authorized participants](/authorizedparticipant) that actively follow the shares and make a move to accommodate the price in the open market when it veers off from the NAV.

Closed-end funds don't have such components and offer greater opportunities for [arbitrage](/arbitrage). On the off chance that a discount happens, investors can profit from the discounted price and furthermore gain [yield](/yield) benefits from a lower price on income paying securities.

## Special Considerations

The [Guggenheim Enhanced Equity Income Fund](/gpm) gives one model. On December 13, 2017, the fund's market price was $8.97, versus the NAV price of $9.15, coming about in a - 1.97% discount. On that equivalent date, the fund likewise reported a 52-week average discount of - 4.04%.

## Features
