## What Is Ringfencing?

Ringfencing is the point at which a regulated public utility business financially separates itself from a [parent company](/parentcompany) that participates in non-regulated business.

As the rule just applies to U.K. banks, and not U.S. or on the other hand European banks operating in the U.K., pundits contend that this could put U.K. banks in a tough spot.
