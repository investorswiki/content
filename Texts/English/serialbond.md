# Serial Bond
## What Is a Serial Bond?

A serial bond is a bond issue that is structured so a portion of the outstanding [bonds](/bond) mature at ordinary stretches until every one of the bonds have matured. Since the bonds mature bit by bit over a period of years, these bonds are utilized to finance projects that turn out a predictable revenue stream for bond [repayment](/repayment). The whole bond issue is sold to the public on a similar date, and the maturity dates are stated in the offering records.

## Figuring out Serial Bonds

Assuming an issuer reduces the dollar amount of bonds outstanding, it reduces the risk that the issuer misses a principal repayment or interest payment and [defaults](/default2) on the bond issue. While a serial bond issue requires the issuer to repay specific bondholders on a stated date, other bond issues are structured with a [sinking fund](/sinkingfund).

A serial bond structure is a common strategy for municipal [revenue bonds](/revenuebond) in light of the fact that these bonds are issued for expense generating projects worked by states and urban communities. Expect, for instance, that a city constructs a games arena that is funded with parking fees, arena [concession](/concession) income, and lease income. In the event that the bond issuer accepts that the facility can create income reliably every year, it can structure the bond for serial maturity dates. As the total amount of bonds outstanding reductions, the future risk on the bond issue defaulting likewise declines.

## The Differences Between Sinking Funds and Serial Bond Issues

In a sinking fund, the issuer makes periodic payment to the bond issue's trustee, and the trustee purchases bonds in the [open market](/open-market) and retires the bonds. The trustee addresses the interests of the bondholders and must utilize the sinking fund payments to buy bonds and retire them. Rather than resigning bonds as per a specific schedule, the trustee purchases bond from any [bondholder](/bondholder) who will sell his [holdings](/holdings). Both sinking funds and serial bond issues reduce the total dollar amount of bonds outstanding after some time.

## Instances of Bond Rating Companies

Standard and Poor's and Moody's Investor Services both give bond ratings that survey the ability of a bond issuer to repay principal and interest payments on time. A bond issue with a sinking fund or a serial maturity has more [creditworthiness](/credit-value) than a bond issue that matures completely on one [maturity date](/maturitydate). On the off chance that, for instance, a serial bond for a $10 million arena bond misses bond interest payments 15 years after the issue date, a certain dollar amount of bonds are as of now paid off before year 15. Since less bonds are outstanding, the issuer might have the option to recuperate monetarily and pay the interest payments that were missed.
