# Flat Tax
## What is a flat tax?
A flat-tax system is one in which everybody pays a similar rate, paying little heed to [income](/incometax). Despite the fact that advocates propose that flat taxes would work on the tax system and make both payment and enforcement simpler, flat taxes generally reduce the proportional tax burden of high-income earners while expanding it on low-income earners. While the U.S. federal tax system is [progressive](/progressivetax), implying that a laborer's income is taxed by her level of income, a few states have flat taxes on income too.
## More profound definition
Under a progressive tax system, an individual's share of income taxes increases with the amount she earns. That takes the burden off lower-income individuals and decreases income inequality.
In a flat-tax system, everybody pays a similar percentage of their income, and most proposition have no or limited [deductions](/derivation). Basically all recommendations feature a low tax rate, typically far lower than the upper marginal tax rates; since taxes will fall across the board, this appears to add a degree fairness to the tax system. That's what defenders propose, with a flat tax, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) tax code could be reduced from great many pages to just a couple, opening up IRS workers and accountants to concentrate their energies somewhere else and making the distressing experience of filing a tax return a simple reconsideration.
Notwithstanding, the overall net effect of a flat-tax system is just to deny the federal government of tax revenue. That is on the grounds that the benefits to a great extent accrue to higher-income earners, who will pay undeniably less, while disadvantaging lower-income earners, who might notice just token declines in their tax burden or may even see an increase. While flat-tax defenders accept that lower taxes across the board could lead to thriving and job growth, periods of marginal tax rates as high as 92 percent have likewise been associated with a more grounded economy, and the decision stays disrupted.
A few states as of now tax personal income at flat rates, albeit none of these rates is higher than 6 percent. [FICA](/fica) taxes, which pay for [Social Security](/socialsecurity) and [Medicare](/medicare), are additionally flat taxes, assessed by the federal government at 6.2 percent and 1.45 percent per employee, separately.
Some flat-tax recommendations have exemptions for investment income, so the interest you earn in a money market account will not get taxed.
## Flat tax model
One of the most conspicuous allies of the flat tax is the distributing executive Steve Forbes, the manager in-head of **Forbes** magazine. Forbes has run for office on several events, and he regularly makes the flat tax one of his policy proposition while advocating it in his magazine. Forbes' plan calls for a 17 percent flat tax assessed just once on individual and business incomes, with exemptions for individuals and families earning below a certain amount. Forbes, who is worth almost half a billion dollars, would see his tax burden more than cut in half, saving him a great many dollars a year. In the mean time, those on the lower end of the income range would see a more unobtrusive drop in taxes, on the off chance that they see any difference whatsoever.
