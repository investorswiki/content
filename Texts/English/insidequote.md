## What Is Inside Quote?

Inside quotes are the best bid and ask prices offered to buy and sell a security among the contending market makers.

Not all quotes are apparently shown on the [order book](/order-book). Thusly, there might be an inside quote "inside" of the quotes that retail investors see.

## Grasping Inside Quote

Inside quotes are imparted between market makers who try to interface buyers and sellers through a bid-ask trading process. Generally, inside quotes are just seen by market makers and sophisticated traders. In any case, these quotes are reflected in the price at which trades happen.

[Regulation National Market System](/regulation-nms) (NMS) states that investors must receive the best price available as it connects with publicly showed orders. As such, a financial backer's order can't be filled at a more terrible price than what is noticeably appearing on the order book.

In the modern electronic age of trading where retail investors can have direct market access and low trading fees, the market makers job has been lessened. Commonly the prints on the time and sales will match the bid and offer. The exception is the point at which a [dark pool](/dark-pool), or a [electronic communication network](/ecn) (ECN) is matching orders with [price improvement](/priceimprovement). This could be viewed as an inside quote, despite the fact that it doesn't be guaranteed to should be impelled by a market maker. A few retail traders with advanced order and ECN capacities can likewise start these orders.

Say that the order book shows a bid of $125.65 and an offer of $125.75. You go to buy shares at $125.75 however the order really fills at $125.70. Somebody posted a hidden order to sell at $125.70, which you had the option to buy from. Since the order is hidden from the order book, it isn't subject to Regulation NMS in the ordinary sense. It isn't publicly shown, so at times, it might possibly be hit if a certain ECN or order type is utilized. These order types may just be accessed by market markers, automated trading platforms, or sophisticated investors. This is basically an inside quote.

## Special Considerations

The inside quote is a price that isn't publicly shown, however that is inside the order book quotes. For instance, an inside bid is higher than the order book bid and the inside offer is lower than the order book offer.

More often than not, and in that frame of mind, there is no inside quote. The order book quotes are the best prices available. In the event that there are inside orders or dark orders, as talked about over, the price these orders are executing voluntarily be shown on the [time and sales](/time-and-sales).

## Bid-Ask Trading Process

The inside quote is part of the bid and ask trading process, by which there are consistently two prices: the bid and ask.

The best bid is the highest price shown by somebody able to buy. There will be extra bids at lower prices. The best ask is the lowest price shown by somebody ready to sell. There will be extra ask/sell orders over the best ask price.

Traders can see the current bids and asks and afterward conclude how they need to continue. They can either buy from the ask, or sell to the bid. This is called paying the [spread](/spread).

They can likewise join the bid by posting a buy order costing that much, or they can join the ask by posting a sell (or [short sale](/shortsale)) order costing that much. They can likewise post a bid to buy below the best bid, or a sell order over the best ask.

> Traders continually reshuffling their bids and asks, and different traders interfacing with orders, makes prices move. In an actively traded stock, the bid and ask prices — and the amounts of shares available at those prices — will change constantly.

Due to Regulation NMS, an order can't trade through the best bid or best offer. Meaning, assuming somebody buys, it must be filled at the best ask price that is apparently available. Assuming there is an offer for 100 shares at $36.50, a buy order for 100 shares or less must be filled at that price first (assuming that that price is as yet available when the order comes to the [exchange](/exchange)) and not at $36.55 for instance.

## Inside Quote Example

Actively traded stocks will frequently have a $0.01 spread between the bid and ask. For instance, the bid is 2,000 shares to buy at $27.25 and the ask is 3,000 shares at a price of $27.26.

A dark pool might be offering to sell at $27.255. This is a form of inside quote; not every person might approach buy off of that order. Additionally, many retail traders may not even realize the order is there since it isn't posted on the order book: the order is "[dark](/dark_pool_liquidity)."

The main way individuals will realize the order is/was there is on the grounds that a transaction at $27.255 will show up on the time and sales. On the other hand, in the event that a common order type is steered through the dark pool or hidden order, then, at that point, retail traders will notice price improvement on their buy order. They were hoping to buy at $27.26, however rather were filled at $25.255 by a hidden order or inside offer.
