## What Is an Endowment?

An endowment is a donation of money or property to a [nonprofit organization](/non-profitorganization), which involves the subsequent investment income for a specific purpose. An endowment can likewise allude to the total of a nonprofit institution's investable assets, otherwise called its "[principal](/principal)" or "corpus," which is intended to be utilized for operations or programs that are reliable with the desires of the donor(s). Most endowments are intended to keep the principal amount intact while involving the investment income for charitable efforts.

## Grasping Endowments

Endowments are commonly organized as a [trust](/trust), [private foundation](/privatefoundation), or public charity. Numerous endowments are administered by educational institutions, like colleges and universities. Others are managed by social institutions, like art historical centers, libraries, strict organizations, private secondary schools, and administration arranged organizations, for example, retirement homes or medical clinics.

At times, a certain percent of an endowment's assets are allowed to be utilized every year so the amount removed from the endowment could be a combination of interest income and principal. The ratio of principal to income would change year to year founded on winning market rates.

## Policies of Endowments

Most endowment funds have the following three parts, which oversee investments, withdrawals, and utilization of the funds.

### Investment Policy

The investment policy spreads out which types of investments a manager is permitted to make and directs how aggressive the manager can be while seeking to meet return targets. Numerous endowment funds have specific investment policies incorporated into their legal structure so the pool of money must be managed as long as possible.

Endowment funds of larger universities can have hundreds, in the event that not thousands, of more modest funds that invest the pools of money in different securities or [asset classes](/assetclasses). The funds regularly have long-term investment goals, like a specific rate of return or yield. Because of the investment goals, the [asset allocation](/assetallocation) (or types of investments inside the fund) is intended to meet the long-term returns set forward in the fund's objectives.

### Withdrawal Policy

The withdrawal policy lays out the amount the organization or institution is permitted to take out from the fund at every period or installment. The withdrawal policy can be founded on the requirements of the organization and the amount of money in the fund. In any case, most endowments have an annual withdrawal limit. For instance, an endowment could limit the withdrawals to 5% of the total amount in the fund. The explanation the percentage of withdrawal is ordinarily so low is that most university endowments are laid out to last everlastingly and, in this manner, have annual spending limits.

### Utilization Policy

The utilization policy makes sense of the purposes for which the fund can be utilized and furthermore guarantees that all funding is sticking to these purposes and being utilized fittingly and actually. Endowments, whether set up by an institution or given as a gift by benefactors, can have numerous purposes. These incorporate guaranteeing the financial soundness of specific departments, granting scholarships or fellowships on the basis of legitimacy to students, or giving assistance to students from a foundation of economic hardship.

Chair positions or invested residencies can be paid with the revenue from an endowment and free up capital that institutions can use to hire more staff, lessening teacher to-student ratios. These chair positions are viewed as prestigious and are held for senior staff.

Endowments can likewise be laid out for specific disciplines, departments, or programs inside universities. Smith College, for instance, has an endowment for its greenhouses, and Harvard University has in excess of 14,000 separate endowment funds.

## Endowment Types

There are four unique types of endowments:

- **Unrestricted Endowment** - This comprises of assets that can be spent, saved, invested, and distributed at the tact of the institution getting the gift.
- **Term Endowment** - This setup as a rule specifies that, solely after a period of time or a certain event, might the principal at any point be exhausted.
- **Semi Endowment** - This is a donation made by an individual or institution and given with the intent of having that fund fill a specific need. The principal is commonly retained, while the earnings are used or distributed per specifications of the giver. These endowments are generally started by the institutions that benefit from them by means of internal transfers or by utilizing unrestricted endowments previously given to the institution.
- **Restricted Endowment** - This has its principal held in perpetuity, while the earnings from the invested assets are exhausted per the contributor's specifications.

But in a couple of conditions, the terms of endowments can't be disregarded. On the off chance that an institution is close to bankruptcy or has declared it yet has assets in endowments, a court can issue a [cy pres doctrine](/cy-pres-doctrine), allowing the institution to utilize those assets toward better financial wellbeing while as yet regarding the desires of the giver as closely as could be expected.

## Requirements for Endowments

Managers of endowments need to deal with the push and pull of interests to utilize assets to forward their causes or reasonably develop their particular foundation, institution, or university. The goal of any group given the task of dealing with a university's endowments, for instance, is to economically develop the funds by [reinvestment](/reinvestment) of the endowment's earnings while likewise adding to the operating cost of the institution and its goals.

Management of an endowment is a discipline regardless of anyone else's opinion. A blueprint of considerations incorporated by a leading management team incorporates setting objectives, fostering a payout policy, building an asset allocation policy, choosing managers, overseeing risks systematically, cutting costs, and characterizing liabilities.

Philanthropies, or, all the more specifically, private nonoperating foundations, a category that incorporates the majority of award making foundations, are required by federal law to pay out 5% of their investment assets on their endowments consistently for charitable purposes to keep their tax-exempt status. Private operating foundations must pay substantially all — 85% or more — of their investment income. Community foundations have no requirement.

Under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, substantially large university endowments must pay a tax of 1.4% on net investment income. This tax is exacted on endowments held by private colleges and universities with somewhere around 500 students and net assets of $500,000 per student.

## Endowments and Higher Education

Endowments are such a vital part of Western scholarly institutions that the size of a school's endowment can be a fair measure of its prosperity. They furnish colleges and universities with the ability to fund their operating costs with sources other than educational cost and guarantee a level of stability by involving them as a potential blustery day fund. More established educational institutions, for example, the Ivy League schools in the United States, have been particularly fruitful in building very robust endowment funds, enjoying the benefits of proceeded with donations from rich alumni and great fund management.

## Analysis of Endowments

Harvard and other elite higher educational institutions have gone under analysis for the size of their endowments. Pundits have questioned the utility of large, multibillion-dollar endowments, comparing it to hoarding. Large endowments had been considered blustery day funds for educational institutions, however during the [Great Recession](/great-recession), numerous endowments cut their payouts. A 2014 study distributed in the American Economic Review took a gander at the incentives behind this behavior and found a trend toward an overemphasis on the strength of an endowment as opposed to the institution as a whole.
It's not unusual for student activists to look with a critical eye at where their colleges and universities invest their endowments. In 1977, Hampshire College stripped from South African investments in protest of apartheid, a move that a large number of educational institutions in the United States followed. Pushing for divestment from industries and countries that students find ethically compromised is as yet common among student activists, however the practice is advancing to further develop efficacy, as indicated by reporting by The New Yorker.

All the more as of late, three unmistakable universities with multibillion-dollar endowments — Harvard, Princeton, and Stanford — declined to acknowledge millions they were set to receive as part of a $14 billion federal aid package for higher education remembered for the CARES Act, as indicated by reporting by The New York Times. For sure, Harvard University has now declined emergency COVID-19 relief money from the federal government three times, most as of late $25.5 million from President Biden's American Rescue Plan.

## Real World Examples of Endowments

### Harvard University Endowment

Harvard authorities had expected the endowment to shrink in 2020 due to the impact of the pandemic on the economy and financial markets. They were off-base, however, as it returned 7.3% on its investments and actually increased a bit. Comparative feelings of trepidation around 2021 proved even more unfounded. Controlled by a rising stock market, the endowment returned an incredible 33.6% on its investments and developed by $11.3 billion to $53.2 billion.

Distributions gave 35% of total revenue to 2021, and another 10% of revenue came from current gifts of philanthropy. Cash gifts to the endowment totaled $541 million. Roughly 70% of the annual distribution is restricted to specific departments, programs, or different purposes. At the end of the day, the funds should be spent by the terms laid out by the givers. Just 30% of the fund can be utilized by Harvard for flexible spending.

In 2021, Harvard paid almost $161 million from the endowment to students for scholarships. Around 55% of the students receive need-based scholarships and pay, on average, $12,700 each year to go to Harvard. Of the students who receive scholarships, 20% don't pay anything to go to Harvard College.
