# Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS)
## What Is a Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS)?

Statements of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS), distributed by the [Financial Accounting Standards Board](/fasb) (FASB), gave guidance on a specific accounting point, until 2009. SFAS laid the rules for accounting standards in the U.S. These SFAS were distributed with an end goal to refresh the accounting industry on the most proficient method to handle certain transactions or occasions.

## Grasping SFAS

Statements of Financial Accounting Standards were distributed to address specific accounting issues, with the end goal of upgrading the precision and transparency of financial reporting. There was an extended public counsel about the possible outcomes of a rule change before a SFAS was distributed.

A SFAS turned out to be part of the FASB accounting standards whenever it was distributed. The FASB sets accounting standards in the United States, which are distributed as the [generally accepted accounting principles](/gaap) (GAAP). GAAP administers the financial readiness and reporting by corporations and addresses the rules that publicly-exchanged companies must comply with while reporting their financial data. GAAP incorporates standards for how U.S. companies ought to report their income statement, balance sheet, and statement of cash flows. These financial statements are assembled and utilized by regulators and investors. Publicly-exchanged companies are regulated by the [Securities and Exchange Commission](/sec) (SEC), which is the top guard dog for the legitimate working of U.S. exchanges.

SFAS have been supplanted by the FASB Accounting Standards Codification, which became effective after Sept. 15, 2009. This codification is currently refreshed through Accounting Standards Updates (ASUs). The total number of SFAS is 168, with no. 168 taking note of that all prior standards are supplanted by the ASC.

## Special Considerations

The FASB presently utilizes the Accounting Standards Codification (ASC). The ASC is currently the sole source of GAAP. The FASB changed to the ASC, the authority of accounting writing, to make a single database for accounting standards. The ASC is organized into 90 accounting points, and quite, its presentation didn't change GAAP however rather presented another structure for sorting out all the data. The thought was that ASC would make looking for subjects more straightforward, upgrading the research cycle and making it simpler.

## Illustration of SFAS

A SFAS becomes an integral factor when the concept turns out to be part of GAAP. Before that, it's just a concept and goes through different moves toward conclude whether it ought to be adopted into GAAP. The FASB will pinpoint an issue that should be addressed, whether through their own investigation or by means of a point the accounting industry or companies are discussing. The board then, at that point, puts together a structure for dealing with the problem and will hold public meetings to examine the issue.

A proposed solution is put together and shipped off stakeholders for feedback. Changes are made in light of feedback, and the FASB will hold one more public meeting to talk about. The board then thinks about that feedback and assuming they are in agreement with the industry's recommendations and the legitimate accounting treatment, they will issue a SFAS and add it to GAAP.
