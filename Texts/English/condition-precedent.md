## What is a Condition Precedent?

A condition precedent is a legal term depicting a condition or event that must happen before a specific contract is viewed as in effect or any obligations are expected of one or the other party.

## Understanding Condition Precedent

For instance, in real estate, a [mortgage](/mortgage) contract will have a condition precedent that an inspection to evaluate the condition and value of the property must happen. That assessment must be agreed upon by both the buyer and the lender before the mortgage contract produces results.

Condition precedents are likewise very common in [wills](/will) and trusts, where the transfer of money or property just happens after certain expectations are met, for example, a heir being married or arriving at a certain age.

In certain cases, conditions precedent might be deferred, on the off chance that they are not the connected with the subject matter of the contract. Consider the case of a subject matter expert who contracts a ghostwriter to writer a book for him. The expert expects that the picked writer not perform household duties during the period of composing for full payment. The conditions precedent, in this case, are the completion of the book and non-performance of household duties during the book composing period. The last option condition can be deferred assuming the writer successfully creates the last deliverable to the expert's satisfaction. In 1908, a comparable case was introduced to the New York court, and the judge decided for the writer.

Something contrary to condition precedent is condition subsequent, which characterizes conditions that must be met for one or the other party to exit from the contract.
