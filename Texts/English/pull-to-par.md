# Pull to Par
## What Is Pull from Par's point of view?

Pull to par is the movement of a bond's price toward its face value as it approaches its maturity date. Premium bonds, which trade at a higher price than their face (par) value, will diminish in price as they approach maturity. Discount bonds, which trade at a lower price than their par value, will increase in price as they approach maturity.

## Understanding Pull to Par

Investors purchase bonds from issuers or from the secondary markets at par, at a discount, or at a premium. No matter what the price paid to buy a bond, the [face value](/facevalue) of the bond at maturity will be repaid to bondholders at maturity. The face value, or par value, of a bond, is the nominal or dollar value imprinted on a bond's certificate, addressing the amount that an investor will receive assuming that they hold the bond until it matures. [Corporate bonds](/corporatebond) normally have a par value of $1,000, [municipal bonds](/municipalbond) $5,000, and most [government bonds](/government-bond) $10,000.

At the point when an investor buys a bond [at par](/at-par), it means the investor purchases the bond at its face value. Assuming that the bondholder holds the bond until its maturity date, they will be repaid the full par value of their investment â€” that's it, nothing less. An investor that purchases a bond with a $5,000 par value for $5,000 will receive a full principal investment of $5,000 at maturity. In effect, the value of a par bond will hold consistent at its par value.

Pull to par mirrors the way that investors require a specific return on their bond investment, given the bond's qualities and overall market conditions.

### Discount Bonds and Premium Bonds

A bond purchased [at a discount](/at-a-discount) is one that is issued or sold for [less than its par](/below-par) value. As the opportunity to maturity lingers nearer, the value of the bond is pulled higher until it is at par on the maturity date, at which point, the investor receives the par value of the debt security.

For instance, a one-year bond with a par value of $1,000 is issued for $920. Over a period of 12 months, the bond increases steadily from $920 to $1,000. This movement is alluded to as a pull to par and it depicts the [accretion of a discount bond](/accretion-of-discount).

A pull to par on a premium bond works the other way of a discount bond. A bond purchased [at a premium](/at-a-premium) has a value over the par value of the security. As the bond approaches maturity, its value diminishes consistently until it unites toward the par value on the maturity date.

In this case, the investor will receive an amount not as much as what they purchased the bond at. This pull-down in the value of a premium bond is alluded to as the [amortization of a premium bond](/amortizable-bond-premium). Assume an investor purchases a bond for $1,150 and holds it until it matures. The par value of the bond is $1,000 and is set to mature in two years. Over a period of 24 months, the premium bond's value will be pulled down from $1,150 to par at the hour of maturity. The bond issuer will pay the bondholder $1,000 par value on the redemption date.

## Features
- Discount bonds that trade below par will see their value rise as maturity approaches.
- Premium bonds, then again, will see their value fall towards par value.
- Pull to par alludes to the inclination at a bond's cost to approach its par value as it approaches its maturity date.
