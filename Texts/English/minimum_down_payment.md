# Least Down Payment
## What Is a Minimum Down Payment?

The base [down payment](/down_payment) is the cash contribution that a borrower must give when they purchase a home. Many mortgage loans will require such a base, and the genuine amount required varies by the loan program, however the standard least down payment required for a [conventional loan](/conventionalmortgage) is 20% and 3.5% for a FHA loan. Some VA loans may not need a base down payment.

## Figuring out a Minimum Down Payment

Least down payment amounts are required to offset the likely risk to a lender. The theory is that a borrower will be less inclined to [default](/default2) on a loan when they have made a large cash contribution to the actual mortgage.

For conventional loans that are backed by various lending institutions, this amount is commonly 20%, which is due at the signing of the closing archives. Government-backed loans, otherwise called [FHA mortgages](/fhaloan), offset this risk by gathering a month to month mortgage premium known as [mortgage insurance](/mortgage-insurance) or MI.

## Illustration of a Minimum Down Payment

Consider, for instance, that Mary Smith is hoping to purchase a home. She has received preapproval for a $360,000 mortgage and has found a home that she might want to buy. The purchase price is $350,000. With a [conventional mortgage](/conventionalmortgage), Mary will actually want to borrow up to 80% of that purchase price, or $280,000. That means she should concoct 20%, or $70,000 of her own funds (or through a down payment assistance program) to close on the loan.

Assuming we see Mary's mortgage once more (this time utilizing FHA rules), we see that as opposed to borrowing 80% of $350,000, Mary can borrow up to 96.5%, or $337,750. That means Mary now just has to view as 3.5% of $350,000, or $12,250.

In any case, presently Mary will be required to make a month to month [mortgage insurance](/mortgage-insurance) payment as well as paying principal, interest, taxes, and insurance. The month to month mortgage insurance premium rate varies somewhere in the range of 0.3% and 1.5% of the original loan amount and depends on several factors, for example, the borrower's [credit score](/credit_score) and [loan-to-value ratio](/loantovalue). This premium is [escrowed](/escrow) into the regularly scheduled payment.
