## What Is a Pure Discount Instrument?

A pure discount instrument is a type of security that pays no income until [maturity](/maturity). Upon expiration, the holder receives the [face value](/facevalue) of the instrument. The instrument is initially sold for not exactly its face value — at a discount — and recovered at par.

## How a Pure Discount Instrument Works

Some debt instruments require the issuer to repay the lender the amount borrowed plus interest. This involves making periodic interest payments to the lender until the security develops, at which point the lender is reimbursed the face value of the security. In different cases, the securities don't make scheduled interest payments. All things being equal, investors can purchase the securities at a value not exactly [par](/parvalue) and receive the face value at maturity. These securities are alluded to as pure discount instruments.

Pure discount instruments can appear as [zero-coupon bonds](/zero-couponbond) or [Treasury bills](/treasurybill). The discount on these securities, or at least, the difference between the purchase price and the redemption value at maturity, addresses the interest that gathers on these debt instruments. In the event that a pure discount instrument is held to maturity, the bondholder will earn a dollar return equivalent to the discount.

## Illustration of a Pure Discount Instrument

For instance, expect a Treasury bill with a face value of has opportunity and willpower to maturity of 270 days and is as of now selling for $950. Assuming the investor holds the T-bill until it develops, they will earn a positive yield of:

r = (Discount/Face value) x (360/t)

Where,

-  r = annualized yield
- Discount = Face value - Purchase price
- 360 = bank convention on the number of days of the year
- t = time to maturity

Following our model over, the yield can be calculated as follows:

r = ($50/$1,000) x (360/270)

= 0.05 x 1.33

= 0.0665, or 6.65%.

The formula utilized above is alluded to as the [bank discount yield](/bankdiscountbasis). The yield on pure discount instruments is the annualized return that results when the bonds are switched over completely to face value. This yield is likewise alluded to as the [spot interest rate](/spot_rate). An interest-bearing bond with unsurprising cash flows or interest payments should be visible as a portfolio of pure discount bonds.

Coupon-bearing bonds are priced utilizing spot rates by relegating the yield of a pure discount instrument developing in six months to the [coupon payment](/coupon) six months from now, the yield of a one-year pure discount instrument to the coupon payments one year from now, etc, until yields have been assigned to all the bond's cash flows.

The formula for this calculation is as per the following:

Price = C1/(1+r1) + C2/(1+r2)2 + C3/(1+r3)3 + … + Cn/(1+rn)n + F/(1+rn)n

Where,

- C = the cash flow for period n
- r = spot rate of interest for period n
- F = face value at maturity

However long pure discount instruments are accessible at all maturity terms, the spot rates will accurately mirror the [term structure of interest rates](/termstructure).

## Features
- Pure discount instruments pay no coupon, all things considered, paying face value at maturity.
- These instruments are priced at a discount to par. The yield on pure discount instruments, otherwise called the spot interest rate, is the annualized return that results when the bonds are switched over completely to face value.
- Famous pure discount instruments are zero-coupon bonds and Treasury bills.
