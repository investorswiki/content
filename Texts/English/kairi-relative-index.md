# Kairi Relative Index (KRI)
## What is the Kairi Relative Index (KRI)?

The Kairi Relative Index is a metric that traders use to show when the time has come to buy or sell an asset. It measures the deviation of the price from the [simple moving average](/sma) (SMA) of that asset's price throughout some stretch of time, commonly 10 to 20 days.

In the event that an asset's price is a lot higher than the SMA of the asset throughout a picked time span, the Kairi Relative Index favors selling. On the off chance that an asset's price is a lot of lower than the simple moving average, the index favors buying the asset.

## The Formula For the Kairi Relative Index (KRI)
<!--DCC51E18334CDD2884D969EA25A9AEE7-->
## The most effective method to Calculate the Kairi Relative Index (KRI)
1. Work out a simple moving average involving the latest closing prices for a predetermined number of periods, like 10 (n).
1. Deduct the n-period SMA from the latest close price.
1. Partition the outcome by the SMA.
1. Increase by 100.
1. Repeat the interaction as every period closes.

## What Does the Kairi Relative Index Tell You

The Kairi Relative Index was imagined by an investor in Japan. It came into broad use in the twentieth century, however by the 1970s it had been supplanted by additional sophisticated metrics like the [Relative Strength Index (RSI)](/rsi).

The KRI is measuring the distance away the price is from its moving average. Assets that move a great deal will quite often have bigger values than assets that don't move a ton. For instance, an extremely low perusing on the SPDR S&P 500 ETF (SPY) is between - 7 and - 15 and a high perusing is four to 10 on the upside.

An unpredictable stock might have extreme readings of - 40 or +50. In this way, when the indicator is applied to a stock or other asset, note the extreme levels the indicator has arrived at in the past on that asset. Those are the areas to look for on the indicator later on.

At the point when the indicator falls to an extremely low perusing for that asset, the indicator is saying the price is [oversold](/oversold) and could bounce. Consider waiting for confirmation, for example, the price really starting to rise before buying.

At the point when the indicator rises to an extremely high perusing for that specific asset, the indicator is saying the price is [overbought](/overbought) and could decline. Consider waiting for confirmation before selling, for example, the price starting to fall.

## Illustration of How to Use the Kairi Relative Index (KRI)

On the chart below, the KRI is added to an Apple Inc. (AAPL) week by week chart.

Over seven years, extreme readings on the upside have normally been 15 or above. Extremely low readings have been below - 10.

A portion of these extremes are set apart by vertical lines on the chart, with green lines addressing KRI buy signals and red lines addressing KRI sell signals.

While a portion of these trades would have worked out, principally on the grounds that Apple was in an overall uptrend during the period, many signals would have brought about poor entry and exit points assuming that the KRI was utilized all alone. Several buy signals occurred when the price of Apple was all the while declining. Several sell points occurred too right on time as the price will in any case moving higher.

Waiting for confirmation of a price reversal once the KRI had arrived at an extreme would have forestalled a portion of these early sections and exits.

## Difference Between the Kairi Relative Index (KRI) and the MACD

The KRI measures the distance of closing prices to the SMA. The [Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD)](/macd) measures the distance between two exponential moving averages. A signal line is then normally applied to the MACD to produce trade signals.

## Limitations of Using the Kairi Relative Index

The KRI is tracking the way in which far an asset is from its moving average. Extreme readings are considered sell or buy signals, however users must likewise note that the more extreme the perusing the more grounded the trend is. Prices need to run fast and hard to get away from the moving average. Subsequently, attempting to short a quickly rising market or buy a quickly falling market can resemble stepping in front of a freight train.

It is prudent to sit tight for another form of verification that the price is really turning when the Kairi indicator arrives at an extreme level. Trades might utilize other technical indicators or [price action](/price-action) to signal the price is turning.

The KRI might turn lower or higher without the asset's price turning lower or higher. This can happen on the grounds that the distance between the price and the SMA limits, yet the price can in any case go on in its current heading.

A simple moving average is the principal part of the KRI indicator. Averages are historical in nature, and may not give understanding into what will occur from here on out.

## Highlights
- The KRI is definitely not an accurate timing signal, and in this manner, ought to be combined with different forms of analysis to create trade signals.
- Extreme perusing in the KRI are considered buy and sell signals.
- The Kairi Relative Index measures the distance between closing prices and a Simple Moving Average (SMA).
- Extreme readings will differ by asset, with additional unstable assets arriving at a lot higher and lower extremes that more steady assets.
