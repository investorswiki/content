# Gap
## What Is a Gap?

A gap is an area irregularity in a security's chart where its price either rises or tumbles from the previous day's close with no trading in the middle between. Gaps are common when news makes market fundamentals change during hours when markets are typically closed, for example an earnings call after-hours.

## What Does A Gap Tell You?

Gaps typically happen when a piece of information or an event causes a flood of buyers or sellers into the security. It brings about the price opening altogether higher or lower than the previous day's closing price. Contingent upon the sort of gap, it could show either the beginning of a recent fad or a reversal of a previous trend.

[Gapping](/gapping) happens when the price of a security or asset opens well above or below the previous day's [close](/closingprice) with no trading in the middle between. Partial gapping happens when the [opening price](/openingprice) is higher or lower than the previous day's close yet inside the previous day's price range. Full gapping happens when the open is outside of the previous day's reach. Gapping, particularly a full gap, shows a strong shift in sentiment happened overnight.

A few traders make it a strategy to profit from playing the gap when such a situation happens.

## The Difference Between Different Types of Gaps

There are a few fundamental differences between the various types of gaps: - [Common Gaps](/commongap), [Breakaway Gaps](/breakawaygap), [Runaway Gaps](/runawaygap), and [Exhaustion Gaps](/exhaustiongap).

- As a rule, there is no major event that goes before this type of gap. Common gaps generally get filled somewhat rapidly (as a rule inside several days) when compared to different types of gaps. Common gaps are otherwise called "area gaps" or "trading gaps" and will more often than not be joined by normal average trading volume.
- A breakaway gap happens when the price gaps over a help or obstruction area, similar to those laid out during a [trading range](/tradingrange). At the point when the price breaks out of a deep rooted trading range through a gap, that is a breakaway gap. A breakaway gap could likewise happen out of one more type of chart pattern, like a triangle, [wedge](/wedge), cup and handle, [rounded bottom](/roundingbottom) or top, or head and shoulders pattern.
- A runaway gap, typically seen on charts, happens while trading activity skirts sequential price points, normally driven by serious [investor](/investor) interest. As such, there was no trading, defined as an exchange of ownership in a security, between the price point where the runaway gap started and where it ended.
- An exhaustion gap is a technical signal set apart by a break lower in prices (typically on a daily chart) that happens after a fast rise in a stock's price more than a long time prior. This signal mirrors a critical shift from buying to selling activity that generally concurs with falling demand for a stock. The ramifications of the signal is that a vertical trend might be going to end soon.

Each type of gap has certain ramifications for traders. For instance, reversal or breakaway gaps are typically joined by a sharp rise in trading volume, while common and runaway gaps are not. Moreover, most gaps happen due to news, or an event like earnings or an investigator's overhaul/downsize.

Common gaps happen all the more routinely and don't necessarily require motivation to happen. Likewise, common gaps will generally get filled, while the other two gaps might signal a reversal or continuation of a trend.

## Illustration of a Gap

In the historical model below, Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN) stock gaps higher on October 27, 2017, rising strongly from the previous days close after months of sideways consolidation. The stock's gain is joined by a huge increase in volume, affirming a breakaway gap. It is the beginning of a recent fad higher in Amazon's stock, which proceeds to rally from $985 to $2,050 by September 2018.

In the next model, Alphabet Inc's. (GOOGL) chart shows a runaway gap. Alphabet's stock was at that point expanding in April 2017 when it gapped strongly higher, continuing its previous uptrend.

## Limitations of Gaps

Limitations regardless of gaps are by and large simple to spot. The glaring flaw is one's own ability to distinguish the various types of gap that happen. On the off chance that a gap is confounded, it very well may be a grievous slip-up making one botch an opportunity to one or the other buy or sell a security, which could weigh vigorously on one's profits and losses.

## Features
- There four unique types of gaps - Common Gaps, Breakaway Gaps, Runaway Gaps, and Exhaustion Gaps - each with its own signal to traders.
- Gaps are not difficult to spot, yet deciding the type of gap is a lot harder to figure out.
- A gap is a broken space in the price chart of an asset or security, frequently happening between trading hours.
