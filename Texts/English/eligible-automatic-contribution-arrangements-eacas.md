# Eligible Automatic Contribution Arrangements (EACAs)
## What Are Eligible Automatic Contribution Arrangements?

Eligible automatic contribution arrangements (EACAs) lay out a default percentage of an employee's pay to be automatically contributed to a retirement account. EACAs apply when employees don't give explicit directions in regards to pretax contributions to a qualified retirement account given by an employer.

## Figuring out Eligible Automatic Contribution Arrangements

Eligible automatic contribution arrangements were made as part of the [Pension Protection Act of 2006](/pensionprotectionact2006) (PPA) to energize more worker participation in self-funded [defined-contribution retirement plans](/definedcontributionplan). Before the creation of automatic contribution arrangements (ACAs), employees normally expected to go with an affirmative decision to contribute a certain percentage of their pretax earnings to an employer-gave retirement plan.

ACAs give increased legal protection to employers to make another default state in which employees who make no move concerning their employer-gave plans make payments at a rate laid out by the plan. In theory, this raises participation rates in retirement plans by compelling employees who don't wish to participate to settle on an affirmative decision to opt-out of the plan.

Assume an employee joins a firm and overlooks the heap of [human resources](/humanresources) desk work about retirement plans. On the off chance that the firm purposes an EACA, the employee will ultimately receive a paycheck with pretax earnings contributed to their retirement fund as outlined by the program. On the off chance that the employee chooses not to participate or chooses to increase or diminish the percentage of contributions, they would need to explicitly decline to participate or finish up desk work to increase or diminish the percentage of pay going into the plan.

In view of the plan's rules, the employee could possibly recover any automatic contributions made in the span of 90 days of the withdrawal.

## EACAs versus QACAs

The PPA characterizes two unique decisions for employers who need to add an automatic contribution arrangement. EACAs have more straightforward requirements than the other alternative, [qualified automatic contribution arrangements](/qualified-automatic-contribution-arrangements-qacas) (QACAs).

Under an EACA, participants automatically contribute a specific, uniform percentage of their gross pay to a qualified investment plan given by the employer. Employers utilizing an EACA must treat all employees who give no explicit enrollment guidelines the equivalent, selecting them in a similar plan at a similar contribution rate.

Employers likewise must give their employees adequate notice and data about the plan, as well as their contribution and withdrawal rights. A few plans furnish employees with a [grace period](/grace_period) during which they can pull out their automatic contributions without penalty in the event that they choose not to participate.

QACAs give employers safe harbor provisions excluding them from [actual deferral percentage and actual contribution percentage](/actual-deferral-percentage-actual-contribution-percentage) (ADP/ACP) testing that different plans must go through to guarantee that they don't oppress lower-paid employees. In return, employers must make matching contributions as required by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and must [vest](/vesting) matching and non-elective contributions in two years or less.

The default deferred contribution for a QACA must likewise increase yearly from no less than 3% the first year to no less than 6%, with a maximum of 10% at whatever year.
