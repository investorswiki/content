# Gross Margin Return on Investment (GMROI)
## What Is the Gross Margin Return on Investment (GMROI)?

The [gross margin](/grossmargin) return on investment (GMROI) is a [inventory](/inventory) profitability evaluation ratio that breaks down a firm's ability to transform inventory into cash over the cost of the inventory. It is calculated by separating the gross margin by the [average inventory cost](/averagecostmethod) and is utilized frequently in the retail industry. GMROI is otherwise called the gross margin return on inventory investment (GMROII).

## Understanding the Gross Margin Return on Investment (GMROI)

The GMROI is a valuable measure as it assists the investor or manager with seeing the average amount that the inventory returns over its cost. A ratio higher than one means the firm is selling the merchandise for more than whatever it costs the firm to get it and shows that the business has a decent balance between its sales, margin, and cost of inventory.

The inverse is true for a ratio below 1. A few sources suggest the rule of thumb for GMROI in a retail store to be 3.2 or higher so all occupancy and employee costs and profits are covered.

The formula for the GMROI is as per the following:

To work out the gross margin return on inventory, two metrics must be known: the gross margin and the [average inventory](/average-inventory). The gross profit is calculated by deducting a company's [cost of goods sold](/cogs) (COGS) from its revenue. The difference is then partitioned by its revenue. The average inventory is calculated by summing the ending inventory over a predefined period and afterward partitioning the sum by the number of periods while considering the obsolete inventory portion situations too.

### Step by step instructions to Use the Gross Margin Return on Investment (GMROI)

For instance, assume luxury retail company ABC has a total revenue of $100 million and COGS of $35 million toward the finish of the current fiscal year. Subsequently, the company has a gross margin of 65%, and that means it holds 65 pennies for every dollar of revenue it has produced.

The gross margin may likewise be stated in dollar terms as opposed to in percentage terms. Toward the finish of the fiscal year, the company has an average inventory cost of $20 million. This firm's GMROI is 3.25, or $65 million/$20 million, and that means it acquires revenues of 325% of costs. Company ABC is hence selling the merchandise for more than a $3.25 markup for every dollar spent on inventory.

Assume luxury retail company XYZ is a contender to company ABC and has total revenue of $80 million and COGS of $65 million. Thusly, the company has a gross margin of $15 million, or 18.75 pennies for every dollar of revenue it has created.

The company has an average inventory cost of $20 million. Company XYZ has a GMROI of 0.75, or $15 million/$20 million. It subsequently acquires revenues of 75% of its costs and is getting $0.75 in gross margin for each dollar invested in inventory.

This means that company XYZ is making just $0.75 pennies for each $1 spent on inventory, which isn't sufficient to cover business expenses other than inventory like selling, general, and administrative expense (SG&A), marketing, and sales. For that XYZ margins are unsatisfactory. In comparison to company XYZ, Company ABC might be a more ideal investment in view of the GMROI.

## Features
- A higher GMROI is generally better, as it means every unit of inventory is generating a higher profit.
- The GMROI can show substantial variance depending on market segmentation, the period, type of thing, and different factors.
- The GMROI shows how much profit inventory sales produce in the wake of covering inventory costs.
