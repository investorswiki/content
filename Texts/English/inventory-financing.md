# Inventory Financing
## What Is Inventory Financing?

The term inventory financing alludes to a short-term loan or a revolving [line of credit](/lineofcredit) that is acquired by a company so it can purchase products to sell sometime in the future. These products act as the collateral for the loan.

[Inventory](/inventory) financing is helpful for companies that must pay their providers for stock that will be warehoused before being sold to customers. It is particularly critical as a method for streamlining the financial effects of seasonal variances in [cash flows](/cashflow) and can assist a company with accomplishing higher sales volumes by permitting it to obtain extra inventory for use on demand.

## How Inventory Financing Works

Inventory financing is a form of asset-based financing. Businesses go to [lenders](/lender) so they can purchase the materials they need to fabricate products they mean to sell sometime in the future.

This sort of financing is common for small to medium sized retailers and wholesalers, especially those with a large amount of available stock. That is on the grounds that they normally lack the financial history and available [assets](/asset) to secure the institutional-sized financing options larger corporations are able to access, like Walmart (WMT) and Target (TGT).

Since they are generally [private companies](/privatecompany), they can't fund-raise by giving bonds or new adjusts of stock. Companies might utilize all or part of their existing stock or the material they purchase as [collateral](/collateral) for a loan that is utilized for general [business expenses](/businessexpenses).

As indicated above, inventory financing permits businesses to purchase inventory to run their businesses. The motivations behind why they depend on this sort of financing include:

- Keeping cash flow consistent through occupied and slow seasons

## Special Considerations

Banks and their [credit](/credit) groups consider inventory financing on a case-by-case basis, seeing factors like resale value, perishability, theft, and loss provisions as well as business, economic, and industry inventory cycles, calculated and transporting imperatives. This might make sense of why such countless businesses couldn't get inventory financing after the [credit crisis](/credit-crisis) of 2008. At the point when an economy is buried in [recession](/recession) and unemployment rises, consumer goods that aren't staples stay unsold.

[Depreciation](/depreciation) is another factor lenders consider. Furthermore, not all forms of collateral are equivalent. Inventory of any sort will in general devalue in value after some time. The business owner who looks for inventory financing will most likely be unable to acquire the full upfront cost of the inventory. Thusly, any potential hiccup is factored into setting a [interest rate](/interestrate) on an asset-backed loan.

Inventory financing isn't generally the solution. Banks might see inventory financing as a type of [unsecured loan](/unsecuredloan). That is since, in such a case that the business can't sell its inventory, the bank will be unable to by the same token. In the event that a retailer or a wholesaler makes a terrible bet on a trend, the bank could stall out with the goods.
