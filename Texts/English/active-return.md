# Active Return
## What Is Active Return?

Active return is the percentage gain or loss of an investment relative to the investment's benchmark. A benchmark may be market far reaching, like the [Standard and Poor's 500 Index](/sp500) (S&P 500), or sector-specific, like the Dow Jones U.S. Financials Index.

An active return is a difference between the [benchmark](/benchmark) and the genuine return. It tends to be positive or negative and is commonly used to survey performance. Companies that look for active returns are known as "active fund managers" and are typically asset management firms or hedge funds.

On the off chance that a similar portfolio returned just 4%, it would have a negative active return of - 1% (4% - 5% = - 1%).

In the event that the benchmark is a specific segment of the market, a similar portfolio could speculatively [underperform](/underperform) the more extensive market nevertheless have a positive active return relative to the picked benchmark. To this end it is essential for investors to know the benchmark a fund uses and why.
