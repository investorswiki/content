# Load
## What is a load?
A load is a commission or fee paid to a sales intermediary or broker by an investor. Separate from operating costs of a mutual fund, this sales charge can be paid upfront at the purchase of assets (front-end load), upon an investor selling assets (back-end load), or yearly (12b-1 fee). At the point when the fee is paid over time, it is called a level-load fund. On the off chance that there is no fee, it is called a no-load fund.
## More profound definition
A load is basically a percentage of the invested amount that brokers charge toward the beginning, during or toward the end of an investment schedule. It is ordinarily inside the 1 percent to 5 percent range and may shift as per the type of asset purchased.
Brokers frequently assign a type of load to a category of shares. Class A funds ordinarily feature a front-end load, Class B funds a back-end load, and Class C funds a level load. This is what to know:
- **Front-end load:** Requires an investor to pay a decided percentage of the invested amount upfront to enter a fund.
- **Back-end load:** Also known as a contingent deferred sales charge, this is a percentage deducted from the amount the investor receives subsequent to selling assets. All in all, the investor pays to exit the mutual fund.
- **Level load:** This fee is a continuous charge charged to the investor and is likewise communicated as a percentage.
- **No load:** Although no-load funds denote no sales fee, charges can be deducted in alternate ways, like a 12b-1. A 12b-1 fee was once classified as an operations expense, this amount is now charged every year by sales mediators, generally after the sale of an investor's assets.

## Load models
In the event that you purchase a $10,000 fund with a front-load fee of 5 percent, you will be required to pay $500 as a fee. Hence, the total amount would be $10,500 to enter the fund.
In the event that you purchase the equivalent $10,000 fund with a bank-end load of 5 percent, the broker will deduct $500 from the total value of your assets upon sale. Hence, you will receive $9,500 after the transaction (expecting there are no gains).
In the event that a broker charges a 1 percent level load yearly for the equivalent $10,000 fund, you will be required to pay $100 each year over a predefined period except if adjusted.
Compute the amount you will pay in fees for your mutual fund.
