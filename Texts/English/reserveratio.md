# Reserve Ratio
## What Is the Reserve Ratio?

The reserve ratio is the portion of reservable liabilities that commercial banks must hold onto, instead of loan out or invest. This is not set in stone by the country's [central bank](/centralbank), which in the United States is the Federal Reserve. It is otherwise called the cash reserve ratio.

The base amount of reserves that a bank must hold on to is alluded to as the [reserve requirement](/requiredreserves), and is some of the time utilized interchangeably with the reserve ratio. The reserve ratio is indicated by the Federal Reserve Board's Regulation D. [Regulation D](/regulationd) made a set of uniform reserve requirements for all depository institutions with transaction accounts, and expects banks to give standard reports to the Federal Reserve.

As an oversimplified model, expect the Federal Reserve decided the reserve ratio to be 11%. This means in the event that a bank has deposits of $1 billion, it is required to have $110 million on reserve ($1 billion x .11 = $110 million).

> During the pandemic of 2020, the Federal Reserve reduced the reserve requirements to 0%.

## What Does the Reserve Ratio Tell You?

The Federal Reserve involves the reserve ratio as one of its key monetary policy apparatuses. The Fed might decide to bring down the reserve ratio to increase the money supply in the economy. A lower reserve ratio requirement gives banks more money to loan, at lower interest rates, which makes borrowing more appealing to customers.

Alternately, the Fed increases the reserve ratio requirement to reduce the amount of funds banks need to loan. The Fed utilizes this mechanism to reduce the supply of money in the economy and control inflation by dialing the economy back.

The Fed likewise sets reserve ratios to guarantee that banks have money available to prevent them from running out of cash in the event of overreacted contributors needing to make mass withdrawals. On the off chance that a bank doesn't have the funds to meet its reserve, it can borrow funds from the Fed to fulfill the requirement.

Banks must hold reserves either as cash in their vaults or as deposits with a Federal Reserve Bank. On Oct. 1, 2008, the Federal Reserve started paying interest to banks on these reserves. This rate was alluded to as the interest rate on required reserves (IORR). There was likewise an interest rate on [excess reserves](/excess_reserves) (IOER), which is paid on any funds a bank deposits with the Federal Reserve in excess of their reserve requirement. On July 19, 2021, the IORR and IOER were supplanted with another simplified measure, the interest on reserve balances (IORB). Starting around 2022, the IORB rate is 0.10%.

> U.S. commercial banks are required to hold reserves against their total reservable liabilities (deposits) which can't be loaned out by the bank. Reservable liabilities incorporate net transaction accounts, [nonpersonal time deposits](/nonpersonal-time-store) and [Eurocurrency ](/eurocurrency)liabilities.

## Reserve Ratio Guidelines

The [Board of Governors](/board-of-governors) of the Federal Reserve has the sole authority over changes in reserve requirements inside limits determined by law. As of March 26, 2020, the reserve requirement was set at 0%. That is the point at which the board killed the reserve requirement due to the global financial crisis. This means that banks aren't required to keep deposits at their Reserve Bank. All things being equal, they can utilize the funds to loan to their customers.

The last time the Fed refreshed its reserve requirements for various depository institutions before the pandemic was in January 2019. Banks with more than $124.2 million in net transaction accounts were required to keep a reserve of 10% of net transaction accounts. Banks with an excess to reserve 3% of net transaction accounts. Banks with net transaction accounts of up to $16.3 million or less were not required to have a reserve requirement. The majority of banks in the United States fell into the principal category. The Fed set a 0% requirement for nonpersonal time deposits and Eurocurrency liabilities.

## Reserve Ratio and the Money Multiplier

In [fractional reserve banking](/fractionalreservebanking), the reserve ratio is key to understanding how much credit money banks can put aside by lending out installments. For instance, on the off chance that a bank has $500 million in deposits, it must hold $50 million, or 10%, in reserve. It might then loan out the leftover 90%, or $450 million, which will advance back to the banking system as new deposits. Banks may then loan out 90% of that amount, or $405 million while holding $45 million in reserves. That $405 million will be saved in the future, etc. Eventually, that $500 million in deposits can transform into $5 billion in loans, where the 10% reserve requirement characterizes the supposed [money multiplier](/deposit_multiplier) as:

## Features
- The Fed brings the reserve ratio down to give banks more money to loan and lift the economy and increases the reserve ratio when it needs to reduce the money supply and control inflation
- The reserve ratio, set by the central bank, is the percentage of a commercial bank's deposits that it must keep in cash as a reserve in case of mass customer withdrawals
- In the U.S., the Fed involves the reserve ratio as an important monetary policy device to supply increase or lessening the economy's money
