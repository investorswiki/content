## What Is Strap?

A strap is an options strategy including one [put](/putoption) and two [calls](/calloption) with a similar strike and expiration. Traders use it when they accept a large move in the underlying asset is possible albeit the course is as yet unsure. All options in a strap are [at the money](/atthemoney).

## Grasping Strap

A strap, likewise alluded to as a "triple option", is like a [straddle](/straddle), but since there are two calls for each put, the strategy is bullish. This is as opposed to a strip, which includes two puts and one call, making it a bearish straddle modification.

Similarly as with its easier options strategy cousin, known as a [straddle](/straddle), a strap profits when the underlying asset takes a large action from its current price. The holder profits regardless of what direction the underlying moves, as long as it covers the premiums paid for the options.

With a strap, be that as it may, there is a bullish bias as the holder profits two times as much from an up move. All things considered, the trader can in any case bring in money if the underlying falls substantially. A short strap would include selling one put and two calls however this strategy profits when the underlying doesn't move.

The profits of a strap strategy are unlimited however the risk is controlled. Maximum loss happens on the off chance that the underlying asset doesn't move by any means when the options lapse. In that case, the options become worthless and the loss is limited to the premiums paid for the three options.

The cost of developing the strap is high since it requires three options purchases:

1. Buy 2 ATM (at-the-money) call options
1. Buy 1 ATM (at-the-money) put option

Every one of the three options ought to be bought on a similar underlying security, at the equivalent [strike price](/strikeprice) and expiration date. The underlying can be any optionable security, for example a stock like IBM or a file like [S&P500](/sp500).

A primary drawback with a strap is its upfront cost to execute. Not exclusively must a trader purchase three options, however since they are all at the money their prices will generally be somewhat high.

It is feasible to change a strap fairly to utilize marginally less expensive options that are to some degree [out of the money.](/outofthemoney) This is called a strap strangle strategy. The profit curve would be like a customary [strangle](/strangle) strategy as both require an even larger move in one or the other course to be profitable. Similarly as with the ordinary strap, the profit curve on the upside is more extreme than it is on the downside.

## Strap Usage

Stocks will generally be especially [volatile](/volatility) around news events and earnings releases. A trader who is bullish on a company in the long-term however stresses that the current earnings report will be not exactly expected could involve a strap as protection against a potential [whipsaw](/whipsaw).

The profit curve for a strap is like that of a straddle as both hold at the money puts and calls. Be that as it may, on the grounds that a strap holds two calls, the incline of the profit line over the current asset price is a lot more extreme than the slant of the profit line when the underlying asset declines.

The exchange has unlimited profit potential over the upper breakeven point on the grounds that, theoretically in any event, the price can rally to limitlessness. For each point acquired by the underlying security, the exchange will create two profit points - for example a one-dollar increase in the underlying increases the payoff by two dollars.

This is where the bullish outlook for strap plays offers better profit on upside compared to the downside and how the strap varies from a straddle that offers equivalent profit likely on one or the other side.

The exchange has limited profit potential below the lower breakeven point in light of the fact that the underlying can't dip under $0. For each point lost by the underlying, the exchange will create one profit point.
