# Pick-Up Tax
## What Is the Pick-Up Tax?

The pick-up tax was a [estate tax](/estatetax) exacted by individual states, permitting them to share in the proceeds and revenue from federal estate taxes. In spite of the fact that states had the option to claim a portion of an individual's federal estate transfer tax, the pick-up tax didn't increase the estate's [tax liability](/taxliability).

The pick-up tax was phased out with the section of the [Economic Growth Tax Relief Reconciliation Act](/egtrra) (EGTRRA) of 2001 and totally ended in 2005. A few states supplanted the pick-up tax with their own new estate taxes.

## Figuring out the Pick-Up Tax

Individuals reserve the privilege to transfer their personal property to their [heirs](/main successor) after they bite the dust. This might incorporate cash, real estate, [trusts](/trust), business assets, securities, and different investments. In any case, there is a price that a person's heirs need to pay. The federal government collects a tax on these assets subsequent to deciding the assets' [fair market value](/fairmarketvalue) (FMV). The taxable amount is calculated subsequent to thinking about certain deductions and reductions.

The pick-up tax was otherwise called a wipe tax. That is on the grounds that it was viewed as soaking up the taxes collected by the federal government. It didn't survey an extra [liability](/liability) for an estate to pay. All things being equal, it addressed a sharing arrangement among states and the federal government for the estate taxes collected at the federal level by the [Internal Revenue Service](/irs) (IRS). It was a helpful way for states to share in federal estate taxes without making their own rules and complete legislative pointless tasks.

The costs of collecting estate taxes are disproportionately high given there are not that many individuals with [estates](/estate) meeting the base threshold. There is a fair setup of [auditing](/review) and desk work engaged with settling estates, and the pick-up tax left that burden with the federal government while permitting states to share in the proceeds.

At the point when the pick-up or wipe tax was phased out in 2001, a number of various states enacted new laws permitting them to keep collecting estate taxes. Starting around 2021, 12 states and the District of Columbia collect estate taxes, with exclusion amounts going from $1 million to $5.93 million. A few states collect [inheritance taxes](/inheritancetax), which contrast from estate taxes in that the individuals getting the proceeds of an estate, and not the actual estate, are responsible for paying the state taxes when they file.

## Special Considerations

Federal estate taxes have been around beginning around 1916 and have seen many changes throughout the long term, including when the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) of 2017 was passed. Initially, the estate tax threshold multiplied. For 2021, the threshold remained at $11.7 million for an individual filer, meaning an estate with a value not exactly this amount isn't required to pay any estate tax — basically at the federal level. The new higher thresholds mean there will be less estate tax money collected, and less individuals expecting to file.

On the off chance that no action is taken by President Biden and the Democrat-controlled Congress, the present grandiose exemption amounts will return to $5 million for each person, adjusted for [inflation](/inflation), toward the beginning of 2026. A few pundits accept almost certainly, President Biden, who crusaded a ton on transforming the current tax system, will hope to push through these changes sooner.

That is uplifting news for states actually collecting the tax. Had the federal government ultimately totally phased out the federal estate tax, many states might have considered dispensing with it also, realizing that the administrative costs for auditing and collecting estate taxes on the state level from somewhat couple of individuals may not be worth the potential [revenues](/revenue).
