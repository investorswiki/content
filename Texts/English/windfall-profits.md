## What Are Windfall Profits?

Windfall profits are large, unexpected gains coming about because of fortunate conditions. Such profits are generally well above historical standards and may happen due to factors, for example, a price [spike](/spike) or supply shortage that are either transitory in nature or longer-enduring. Windfall profits are generally procured by a whole industry sector yet can likewise track down their direction to an individual company.

In terms of an individual, a windfall profit could be a spike in [income](/personalincome) because of a specific, one-time event, like scoring that sweepstakes, acquiring money or suddenly having the option to sell that rare piece of music memorabilia you own for a large amount of money after the vocalist dies.

> There was beforehand a tax on corporate windfall profits; in any case, it was disliked and there are as of now no such taxes in the United States, however once again introducing the tax has drawn a lot of discussion on Wall Street and in Washington.

## How Windfall Profits Work

Among the reasons that windfall profits can emerge are a sudden change in market structure, an executive order from the government, a court ruling, or an emotional shift in trade policy. Companies that are beneficiaries of windfall profits had not made arrangements for them, yet they would be naturally satisfied to receive them.

These profits would have different purposes: dividend increases or a [special one-time dividend](/specialdividend), [share buybacks](/sharerepurchase), reinvestments in the business for future growth, or debt reduction. Windfall profits are as of now not taxed in the U.S., however there have been lukewarm efforts to once again introduce the tax.

For an individual, a windfall profit could bring about a sudden lift in their income, past what they might have sensibly expected. Dissimilar to a [corporation](/corporation), an individual isn't expected to give the profits to other people.

## Illustration of Windfall Profits

Every once in a while, flooding prices for [crude oil](/crude-oil) and natural gas have created windfall profits for the overwhelming majority energy companies. In this industry, wherein supply and demand are the fundamental force deciding price levels for the commodities, unexpected supply shortages have prompted sharp and quick price rises.

In 2008, a barrel of WTI crude oil moved above $140 from $60 per barrel just one year sooner. Several factors on both the supply and demand sides schemed to spike the price. Turmoil in the Middle East, waiting effects of Hurricane Katrina, supply disturbances in Venezuela and Nigeria, strong demand from emerging countries, and speculative enthusiasm by traders were undeniably accepted to be reasons for the precarious climb of oil prices. Windfall profits for oil and gas producers followed, however they proved brief in light of the fact that an only a short time after the price crested, a barrel of oil was trading at just $40 per barrel.
