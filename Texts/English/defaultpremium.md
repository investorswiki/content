# Default Premium
## What Is Default Premium?

A default premium is an extra amount that a borrower must pay to repay a lender for expecting [default risk](/defaultrisk). All companies or borrowers by implication pay a default premium, however the rate at which they must repay the obligation differs.

## How Default Premium Works

Normally the main borrower in the United States that wouldn't pay a default premium would be the U.S. government. In any case, in turbulent times, even the U.S. Treasury has brought to the table for higher yields to borrow. Additionally, companies with lower grade (i.e., junk or non-venture grade) bonds and individuals with low credit pay default premiums.

Corporate bonds receive ratings from huge agencies, like Moody's, S&P, and Fitch. These ratings depend on the revenues the issuers can generate to meet principal and interest payments, alongside any assets (equipment or financial assets) they can pledge to secure the bond(s). The higher the credit rating, the lower a company's default premium. For higher-rated issuances, investors won't receive as high of a yield.

Investors frequently measure the default premium as the yield on an issuance far beyond a government bond yield of comparable coupon and maturity. For instance, on the off chance that a company issues a 10-year bond, an investor can compare this to a [U.S. Treasury bond](/treasurybond) of a 10-year maturity.

## Default Premium and Individual Credit Scores

Individuals with poor credit must pay higher interest rates to borrow money from the bank. This is a form of default premium given that lenders accept these individuals have a higher risk of being not able to repay their obligations. There can be a lot of discrimination in the individual lending market, as proven by payday loans.

## Special Considerations

A payday loan is a short-term borrowing solution where a lender will expand an exceptionally high-interest credit, in light of a borrower's income and credit profile. Factors that contain an individual credit score incorporate the history of repaying obligations, including completion and timeliness, the size of the obligations, number of obligations, and conceivably extra information like employment history.

Numerous payday lenders will set up organizations in additional devastated neighborhoods with populaces that are now powerless against financial shocks. Albeit the federal [Truth in Lending Act](/tila) requires payday lenders to unveil their frequently outsized finance charges, numerous borrowers neglect the costs since they need funds rapidly. Most loans are for 30 days or less, with amounts as a rule from $100 to $1,500. Frequently, these loans can be turned over for even further finance charges. Numerous borrowers are many times repeat customers.

## Highlights
- Lenders look for default premiums for guaranteeing default risk.
- Payday loans are many times a predatory loan with very high-interest rates and fees.
- Companies with poor credit pay default premiums thus.
