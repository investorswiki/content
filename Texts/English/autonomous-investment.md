# Autonomous Investment
## What Is an Autonomous Investment?

An autonomous investment is the point at which a government or other body makes a [investment](/investment) in a foreign country regardless of its level of [economic growth](/economicgrowth) or the possibilities for that investment to generate positive returns. These investments are made basically for reasons for international stability, economic aid, further developing infrastructure, national or individual security, or helpful goals.

## Grasping Autonomous Investment

Autonomous investments are made in light of the fact that they are considered as fundamental necessities to individual, organizational, or national prosperity, wellbeing, and safety, and are executed even when levels of [disposable income](/disposableincome) for investment are zero or close to zero.

Autonomous investments incorporate inventory recharging, government investments in [infrastructure](/infrastructure) tasks like streets and thruways, and different investments that keep up with or improve a country's economic potential. They don't increase in response to higher [gross domestic product](/gdp) (GDP) growth, or shrink in response to economic contractions, showing that they are not propelled by profit, yet rather by the goal of working on cultural welfare.

The 2009 [American Recovery and Reinvestment Act ](/american-recovery-and-reinvestment-act)(ARRA) gives numerous instances of autonomous investment.

## Autonomous Investment versus Induced Investment

Autonomous investments stand rather than induced investments, which increase or abatement in response to economic growth levels. Induced investments aim to generate a profit. Since they answer shifts in output, they will generally be more variable than autonomous investments; the last option act as an important stabilizing force, assisting with diminishing [volatility](/volatility) in induced investment.

For example, as disposable income rises, so does the rate of induced consumption. This cycle applies to all [normal goods](/normal-great) and services. At the point when individuals have more disposable income, they are in a better position to set aside or invest cash to be utilized as future income.

Autonomous and induced investments can be considered in terms of the [marginal propensity to invest](/marginal-propensity-invest) (MPI): the change in investment communicated as a proportion of the change in economic growth. At the point when that marginal propensity is zero, the investment is autonomous. At the point when it is positive, the investment is induced.

## Factors Affecting Autonomous Investment

Actually, autonomous investments are not impacted by outer factors. In reality, notwithstanding, several factors can influence them. For instance, [interest rates](/interestrate) fundamentally affect investments made in a [economy.](/economy) High-interest rates can tamp down on consumption while low-interest rates can spike it. Thusly, this influences spending inside an economy.

Trade policies between countries can likewise influence autonomous investments made by their residents. In the event that a producer of cheap goods imposes [duties](/obligation) on exports, it would make completed products for outside topographies more costly.

Governments can impose controls on an individual's autonomous investments through [taxes](/tax assessment), too. In the event that an essential household great is burdened and no substitutes are accessible, the autonomous investment relating to it might diminish.
