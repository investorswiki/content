# Gold Option
## What Is a Gold Option?

A gold option is a [options contract](/optionscontract) that uses either physical gold or gold futures as its [underlying asset](/underlying-asset).

A gold [call option](/calloption) would give the holder the right, however not the obligation, to buy bullion sometime not too far off at a set price, while a [put option](/putoption) would grant the holder the right to sell it at a foreordained price level. The option agreement terms will list subtleties, for example, the delivery date, quantity, and strike price, which are completely foreordained.

## Grasping Gold Options

A gold option is a [derivative](/derivative) that has physical gold, or [futures](/futures) on physical gold, as the underlying asset.

The gold options contract is an agreement between two gatherings to work with an expected transaction on a quantity of gold. The contract records a preset price, known as the [strike price](/strikeprice), and an expiration date.

There are two primary types of options contracts: put options and call options. In any case, there are four types of participants as both the call and put can be either bought or sold.

## Types of Gold Options
- **Call gold options:** Give the holder the right, not the obligation, to buy a specific amount of gold at the strike price until the [expiration date](/expirationdate). A call option turns out to be more significant as the price of gold increments since they locked in a buy at a lower price. At the point when you buy the call, you have the right, however not the obligation, to purchase the gold. In the event that, then again, you sell the call, you don't have a decision and must sell the gold at the foreordained price when the person holding the contrary side of the contract requests delivery up to the expiration date.
- **Put gold options:** Give the owner the right, however not the obligation, to sell a specific amount of gold at the strike price until the expiration date. A put option turns out to be more significant as the price of gold reductions since they locked in a sell at a higher price. Assuming that you buy the put, you have the right, however not the obligation, to sell the gold. In the interim, when you sell a put, you don't have a decision and must purchase the gold at the foreordained price from the person holding the contrary side of the contract.

In the event that neither the holder of the call or put options exercise their rights, the contract will lapse as useless.

## Gold Options versus Gold Future Contracts

A gold option is comparative somehow or another to a gold [futures contract](/futurescontract) in that the price, the expiration date, and the dollar amount are preset for both. Notwithstanding, with a futures contract, there is an obligation to uphold the agreement and either buy or sell the settled upon quantity of gold at the settled upon price.

On the other hand, an investor who holds a gold option has the right, yet not the obligation, to claim the significant position, which will rely upon on the off chance that they hold the call option or the put option.

## Gold Options Contract Specifications

Gold options contracts trade on different derivatives [exchanges](/exchange) around the world. In the U.S., investors can find gold options listed on the [COMEX](/comex) exchange.

COMEX is the primary futures and options market for trading metals like gold, silver, copper, and aluminum. Formerly known as the Commodity Exchange Inc., COMEX merged with the [New York Mercantile Exchange](/nymex) (NYMEX) in 1994 and turned into the division responsible for metals trading. Today, COMEX — and the NYMEX all the more extensively — works as a division of the [Chicago Mercantile Exchange](/cme) (CME).

COMEX gold options really utilize gold futures, instead of physical gold straightforwardly, as are [cash-settled](/cash-settled-options). These gold futures have a contract size of 100 [troy ounces](/troyounce) each and require [physical delivery](/physicaldelivery) on the off chance that not closed out.

The investor could then pivot and quickly sell that gold on the open [market](/market) for a quick profit.

Ought to, then again, gold be trading at or close to the strike price, the investor may [break even](/breakeven-price) or maybe even assume a loss, when their initial cost to purchase the option is figured in.
