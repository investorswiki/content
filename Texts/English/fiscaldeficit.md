## What Is a Fiscal Deficit?

A fiscal deficit is a shortfall in a government's income contrasted and its spending. The government that has a fiscal deficit is spending too far in the red.

### Record Fiscal Deficits

At the level of the Depression, President Franklin D. Roosevelt made a prudence of necessity and issued the primary U.S. Savings Bonds to urge Americans to save more and, not unexpectedly, finance government spending.

As a matter of fact, President Roosevelt holds the record for the quickest developing U.S. fiscal deficits. The New Deal policies intended to pull America out of the Great Depression, combined with the need to finance the country's entry into World War II, drove the federal deficit from 4.5% of GDP in 1932 to 26.8% in 1943.

After the war, the federal deficit was decreased and a surplus of $4 billion was laid out by 1947 under President Harry S. Truman.
