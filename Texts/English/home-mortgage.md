## What Is a Home Mortgage?

A home mortgage is a loan given by a [bank](/bank), [mortgage company](/mortgage-company), or other [financial institution](/financialinstitution) for the purchase of a residence — a primary residence, a secondary residence, or an investment residence — as opposed to a piece of commercial or industrial property. In a home mortgage, the owner of the property (the borrower) transfers the [title](/title) to the [lender](/lender) depending on the prerequisite that the title will be moved back to the owner once the last loan payment has been made and different terms of the mortgage have been met.

A home [mortgage](/mortgage) is one of the most common forms of debt, and it is likewise one of the most suggested. Since they are [secured debt](/secureddebt) — an asset (the residence) acts as backing for the loan — mortgages accompany lower [interest rates](/interestrate) than practically whatever other sort of loan that an individual consumer can find.

## How a Home Mortgage Works

Home mortgages allow a lot broader group of residents the chance to claim [real estate](/realestate), as the whole purchase price of the house doesn't need to be given up front. But since the lender really holds the title however long the mortgage is in effect, it has the privilege to [foreclose](/foreclosure) on the home (hold onto it from the homeowner, and sell it on the open market) in the event that the borrower can't make the payments.

A home mortgage will have either a [fixed](/fixedinterestrate) or [floating](/variableinterestrate) interest rate, which is paid month to month along with a contribution to the [principal](/principal) loan amount. In a [fixed-rate](/fixed-rate_mortgage) mortgage, the interest rate and the periodic payment are generally a similar every period. In a [adjustable-rate](/arm) home mortgage, the interest rate and periodic payment vary. Interest rates on adjustable-rate home mortgages are generally lower than fixed-rate home mortgages in light of the fact that the borrower bears the risk of an increase in interest rates.

One way or the other, the mortgage works the same way: As the homeowner pays down the principal over the long run, the [interest](/interest) is calculated on a more modest base with the goal that future mortgage payments apply more toward [principal reduction](/principal-reduction) than just paying the interest charges.
