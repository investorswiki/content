# Russian Option
## What Is a Russian Option?

A Russian option, otherwise called a "decreased regret option," is a type of [exotic option](/exoticoption) that contains a [lookback provision](/lookbackoption) as well as no [expiration date](/expiration-time). This means that the holder of a Russian option can stand by as long as they need before [exercising](/exercise) it, and might in fact do as such at the most ideal price that it has at any point traded for, no matter what its current price.

In practice, Russian options are rarely utilized as they would probably require exceptionally large [premiums](/option-premium) due to the profoundly ideal terms appreciated by the option holder.

## Grasping Russian Options

The concept of the Russian option was first proposed by Larry Shepp and A. N. Shiryaev, in a 1993 article distributed in the scholarly journal **The Annals of Applied Probability**. They portrayed a type of "new put option" in which the option holder has the privilege to hold the option endlessly, exercise the contract whenever, and, upon executing the contract, receive either the current price or the maximum price (discounted) at which the option at any point traded in the past. "The buyer need take a gander at the variances [between the purchase time and the exercise time] just incidentally and appreciates having practically zero regret that he didn't exercise the option at a prior time (with the exception of the discounting)," the creators composed.

"We call it the Russian option, halfway to recognize it from the American and European options, where the term of the option is endorsed in advance and where no definite formula for the value has been given," Shepp and Shiryaev added. In any case, "as far as anyone is concerned, no such regretless option is currently traded in any existing market regardless of its clear appeal."

To be sure, most investors couldn't want anything more than to possess such an option since it is very great for the option holder. Be that as it may, while the Russian option concept has prompted a lot of scholarly discussion, it has never been put into standard use. In the event that it were carried out in reality, it would probably be traded [over the counter (OTC)](/otc) and would require substantial premiums. These imperatives could largely dispense with the appeal of Russian options for most genuine traders.

Albeit the Russian option isn't traded in that frame of mind at any rate, no major [exchange or market](/stockmarket) offers it â€” it has prompted the development of several amazing formulas for the option value, optimal exercise time, and the expected exercise time, which significantly affect likelihood theory.

> In 1995, Shepp and Shiryaev distributed a follow-up paper, "A New Look at Pricing of the 'Russian Option,'" which offered a simplified method for computing a fair value for the option.

## Illustration of a Russian Option

Brad is an options trader who appreciates investing in exotic options through OTC transactions. He figures out how to find a counterparty able to arrange a Russian option, which is never traded in reality.

Brad and his counterparty settle on the following terms: The contract is written as a [put option](/putoption) in which Brad is the option holder and in which the underlying asset is [silver](/silver). At the time they compose the contract, the [spot price](/spotprice) for silver is generally $15 per ounce. Brad gets the right (yet not the obligation) to sell his counterparty a predetermined quantity of silver at a [strike price](/strikeprice) of $10 per ounce, fundamentally below the current market price. In any case, since it is a Russian option, there is no fixed [maturity date](/maturitydate) for the option contract, and Brad can choose for exercise the put option whenever and sell the silver to his counterparty at any price that happened during the life of the contract.

In exchange for this flexibility, Brad is required to pay his counterparty a critical premium, to such an extent that even with the liberal terms of the option contract, Brad is a long way from certain that he will bring in money on the transaction.
