# Income-Sensitive Repayment (ISR)
## What Is Income-Sensitive Repayment?

Income-sensitive repayment (ISR) is a repayment method for loans serviced by lenders participating in the Federal Family Education Loan Program (FFELP). The ISR is intended to make it simpler for borrowers with lower-paying tasks to manage the cost of their month to month loan payments. The ISR is an alternative to the income-contingent repayment.

The month to month loan payment amount depends on a fixed percentage of the borrower's [gross month to month income](/grossincome), somewhere in the range of 4% and 25%. The regularly scheduled payment must be greater than or equivalent to the interest that the loan accumulates.

FFEL program loans incorporate three types of loans: FFEL Plus and Subsidized and Unsubsidized Federal Stafford Loans, but the program was discontinued in July 2010. On the off chance that you had the loan in 2010 or prior, you can in any case fit the bill for income-sensitive repayment.

## How Income-Sensitive Repayment Works

Income-sensitive repayment permits lower-earning borrowers to reduce their regularly scheduled payment amount, contingent upon the gross month to month income. This method of repayment expands the total amount of interest that will be paid on loan. Borrowers must apply every year to be eligible for ISR and give a copy of their tax returns and W-2s.

## Special Considerations

Not all student loans are eligible for income-sensitive repayment. Just loans under FFELP are available for this remarkable assistance. Assuming you take it, this option is just available for five years, and you are as yet responsible for paying back your loans. Be that as it may, you could possibly address your loan service provider (a lender participating in FFELP) and check whether you can move to one more type of program.

Here is the trick: recall FFELP ended in July 2010, and assuming your loans were issued after that date, you don't fit the bill for this program. Notwithstanding, assuming your loans were issued in 2010 or before that date, you may be eligible. Starting around 2021, numerous years have gone by since this program was active in the student loan world.

There are other payment plans in view of income and given that FFELP is at this point not an option for students who went to school past 2010, they are definitely worth investigating assuming that you really want another payment plan. The four income-drive payment plans are as per the following: income-contingent repayment, income-based repayment, pay as you earn repayment, and changed pay as you earn repayment. In any case, to fit the bill to apply for one of these programs, you must take out a direct consolidaiton loan and consolidate your FFEL loans into it.
