# Triple-Tax-Free
## What is Triple-Tax-Free?

Triple-tax-free, or "triple tax-exempt", is an approach to depicting an investment, generally a [municipal bond](/municipalbond), where the interest payments are exempt from taxes at the municipal, state and federal levels.

## Understanding Triple-Tax-Free

A triple-tax-free municipal bond is a [debt security](/debtsecurity) issued by a state, municipality or district. Regularly, municipal bonds are issued to generate capital for large infrastructure tasks like schools, scaffolds, medical clinics or highways. Through offering tax incentives, territories urge occupants to invest in infrastructure improvements that benefit the community. Triple-tax-free municipal bonds might be [general obligation bonds](/generalobligationbond) or [revenue bonds.](/revenuebond)

Triple-tax-free municipal bonds function similarly as other bond investments. The bond's [principal](/principal) is paid back at the [maturity date](/maturitydate). In the interim, the bondholder gets interest payments. Triple-tax-free municipal bonds are normally viewed as a low-risk investment, as they are backed by the government that issues them.

Triple-tax-free municipal bonds offer tax-exempt interest payments to investors in light of multiple factors, yet the primary explanation is the U.S. Constitution precludes the federal government from taxing interest earned on loans to municipalities and states.

The overwhelming majority of states have made interest income received from securities issued by the state or a state government entity exempt from state income tax. At last, the excess state or municipality offers tax-free status to the issuer at its specific level of government as a politeness. These tax incentives urge occupants to invest in capital improvements in their nearby networks.

## Limitations of Triple-Tax-Free

While there are distinct tax benefits to claiming triple-tax-free investments, tax-free status on earnings includes some major disadvantages. Since they are low-risk investments, tax-free municipal bonds generally offer lower returns than [corporate bonds](/corporatebond) or other taxed investments. The low-interest rates of triple-tax-free municipal bonds might open bondholders to [inflation risk](/inflationrisk). Inflation risk occurs on the off chance that the rate of inflation outperforms the interest earned on the investment vehicle. The bondholder may at last wind up with an investment that procures a negative rate of return.

Contingent upon a singular's tax obligation, this downside risk may not be recuperated. Higher income earners gain more from tax-free investments than lower income earners. Triple-tax-free investments are likewise especially interesting to investors who live in areas with high state or municipal tax rates, like New York.
