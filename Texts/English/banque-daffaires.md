# Banque D'Affaires
## What Is a Banque D'Affaires?

A banque d'affaires is a French financial institution that specializes in organizing financing and giving financial counsel to corporate clients. It is like a business bank or corporate investment firm in the U.S.

Like those institutions, it's anything but a deposit bank or a lender serving the overall population.

## Figuring out a Banque D'Affaires

Banques d'affaires commonly offer two core services: they orchestrate financing for businesses and different organizations and they prompt corporations on financial issues.

### Loaning

Banque d'affaires organize financing for businesses, albeit not generally similarly as other financial institutions. In the wake of giving a loan, the banque d'affaires will frequently sell off the debt to an outsider, empowering it to create a quick gain and free up funds to loan more cash â€” expecting, of course, that investors need a slice of the pie.

As such, the banque d'affaires assumes the job of a [intermediary](/financialintermediary). The bank coordinates a business requiring financing with a qualified lender seeking an investment. The bank brokers a deal between the two gatherings and afterward continues on toward the next business transaction.

Once in a while, a banques d'affaires may decide to embrace [structured-finance](/structuredfinance) activities with its own resources. In such cases, the bank would support a loan determined to hold onto the debt and dealing with the asset until the borrower takes care of the balance in full.

### Prompting

Banques d'affaires ordinarily operate in an advisory capacity too, assisting companies with finding the best method for raising capital, open up to the world through an initial public offering (IPO), make acquisitions, deal with their debt, and seek after other corporate strategies.

In exchange for these services, and mastery on the expected return of ventures, the banques d'affaires are paid a commission.

## History of the Banques D'Affaires

Banques d'affaires in their modern form were made during a wave of government reform of the French banking industry that followed the economic decimation of the Great Depression and World War II.

Under these reforms, a banque d'affaire could never again hold its own short-term capital. All things being equal, they were simply permitted to handle and oversee stakes in new and existing businesses and give long-term loans to organizations and corporate clients.

## Banque D'Affaires versus Banques D'Investissement

A few different types of French banks, like banques d'investissement, may perform comparative activities to banques d'affaires. The greatest differentiator is in many cases the time span of the activities they embrace.

Banques d'investissement, best described as French [investment banks](/investmentbank) (IB), will more often than not work on shorter-term operations, while banques d'affaires for the most part specialize in long-term financing and investment projects. A banque d'affaires may assist with working with a years-long corporate [merger](/merger). Broad analysis and negotiation are commonly required, and the banque d'affaires will earn a substantial commission for its difficulty.

## Special Considerations

Banques d'affaires generally have no conflict of interest with credit or financing institutions. They might even work closely with banques d'investissement or banques commerciales, which are the French [retail banks](/retailbanking), to address the issues of a client.

For instance, a corporate client seeking to finance an acquisition by giving [securities](/security) could work with a banque d'investissement to issue the securities and a banque d'affaires to handle the acquisition.
