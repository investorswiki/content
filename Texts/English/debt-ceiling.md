## What Is the Debt Ceiling?

The debt ceiling is the maximum amount of money that the United States can borrow in total by giving bonds. The debt ceiling was made under the Second [Liberty Bond](/liberty-bond) Act of 1917 and is otherwise called the "debt limit" or "legal debt limit." If U.S. government national debt levels bump facing the ceiling, the Treasury Department must resort to other "uncommon" measures to pay government obligations and expenditures until the ceiling is raised once more.

The debt ceiling has been raised or suspended various times over the course of the years to stay away from the most dire outcome imaginable, which would be a [default](/default2) by the U.S. government on its debt.

## Grasping the Debt Ceiling

Before the debt ceiling was made, Congress had free rule over the nation's finances. In 1917, the debt ceiling was made during World War I to make the federal government fiscally responsible.

The majority of popularity based countries don't have a debt ceiling, making the United States one of a handful of the exemptions.
