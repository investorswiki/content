# Transaction Authentication Number (TAN)
## What is a Transaction Authentication Number (TAN)

A transaction authentication number is a one-time code utilized in the processing of online transactions. A transaction authorization number (TAN) addresses an extra layer of security past a secret key to sign into an account or conduct a transaction safely.

## BREAKING DOWN Transaction Authentication Number (TAN)

Transaction authentication numbers (TANs) give extra security. Dealers and payment card companies have an incentive to further develop transaction security, as better security reduces the possibility that fraud might happen. Organizations, for example, the Payment Card Industry Security Standards Council make standards that payment card [acquirers](/acquirer) and processing companies are expected to follow to encode card information at the mark of-association (POI) and later unscramble and deal with the transaction.

Transaction authorization numbers are one way that financial institutions can reduce the possibility of fraud. They are single-use numbers and give a two-factor authentication of a transaction. The main level of authentication might incorporate a [personal identification number](/personal-identification-number) (PIN) or secret key to access an account, while the second level of authentication might be the TAN.

Financial institutions typically give a rundown of passwords or passphrases that can be utilized to verify a transaction, with each TAN just being legitimate for a single use. The financial institution giving the rundown of TANs keeps a database in which it relates each TAN to a specific client.

TANs are most usually utilized in online transaction confirmations. At the point when an individual or business begins the transaction it could be given the TAN in an email, in a SMS instant message, or through another method. The delivery method has typically been validated ahead of time through a previous connection, for example, a bank sending an instant message affirming that a specific phone number is linked to an account. At the point when a transaction is being conducted, the client will receive a message with the TAN code, and will be required to input that code in a field on an electronic form. On the off chance that the code is accurately matched, the transaction will be handled.

## Transaction Authentication Numbers and Two-factor Authentication

As Americans have moved a greater amount of their activities online, the utilization of transaction authentication numbers has spread from financial institutions to numerous different areas of life. It is encouraged, for instance, that email users sign in to their email accounts utilizing [two-factor authentication](/twofactor-authentication-2fa), by which one must put one's secret word in alongside a transaction authentication number. These are typically kept by the client on a rundown of one-time codes, or the number is recovered through instant message, email, or a telephone call.
