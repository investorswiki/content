No matter what their storage medium, $1,000 on securities, bills, letters of credit, notes other than bank notes, tickets, accounts, deeds, evidence of debt, international IDs, compositions, stamps, and philatelic property. c. $1,500 on jewelry, watches, precious and semiprecious stones, diamonds, and furs. d. $2,500 on silverware, goldware, pewterware, and things plated with gold or silver. e. $2,000 on weapons and things connected with firearms. f. "Business" property, up to the sums displayed below: 1) $2,500 while on the "insured premises"; 2) $250 while away from the "insured premises". g. $1,000 on watercraft including their trailers, decorations, equipment and motors. h. $1,000 on trailers not in any case accommodated.
