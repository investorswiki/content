# Beginning Market Value (BMV)
## DEFINITION of Beginning Market Value (BMV)

Beginning market value (BMV) is the valuation at which a property or investment ought to exchange at the date of origination, and afterward at the beginning of each subsequent period. The beginning market value at the start of each and every period is thus equivalent to the ending market value of the previous period. Here, the market value depends on what both the buyer and seller (effectively, the market), consider to be the true value of the property in question. [Market value](/marketvalue) is like market price given that the market remains [efficient](/marketefficiency) and the players are [rational](/rational-conduct).

This might be contrasted with the Ending Market Value ([EMV](/ending-market-value)), which is the value of an investment at the finish of the investment period. In private equity, the ending market value, likewise called the residual value, is the leftover equity that a limited partner has in a fund. It might likewise be contrasted with average market value (AMV), which is the average value of an investment over a certain period.

## BREAKING DOWN Beginning Market Value (BMV)

The beginning market value (BMV) is the total value of securities held in an investment account at the beginning of a reporting period, for instance each quarter. In an account with a number of investments including stocks, bonds, options, and mutual funds will have a BMV will typically be calculated for every asset type separately. It can likewise be alluded to as the value of an investment at the time its position is first entered.

The BMV is essentially the ending market value of the previous period. The ending market value of the previous period is calculated as the beginning market value at time t-1 multiplied by 1 plus the rate of returned over that period. By taking a gander at the ending market value and contrasting it with the beginning market value, we can perceive how much return we have made for the current period. These periodic returns can be linked together in a [time-weighted rate of return](/time-weightedror) to calculate a multi-period rate of return.

For instance, expect that in time t=0 the beginning market value of a share of XYZ stock is $10.00. Returns are assessed consistently. After a month passes (time t=1), the market value of XYZ stock is $12.00. So the BMV for time t=0 is $10 and its EMV is $12.00, generating a 20% return on investment ([ROI](/returnoninvestment)). $12.00 is therefore the beginning market value at time t=1, etc.
