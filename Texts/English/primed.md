# Primed
## What's the significance here?

In finance, being "primed" is a conversational term that alludes to the situation where the [seniority](/seniorsecurity) position of a lender with respect to a [secured loan](/secureddebt) is supplanted by another lender.

In the event of [default](/default2), creditors with the highest priority will be quick to be reimbursed utilizing the borrower's collateral. Assuming the collateral is inadequate to repay the entirety of the borrower's loans, then those creditors with relatively low priority might receive limited or even no repayment.

Due to this unique circumstance, lenders are careful to guarantee that their level of priority with respect to the borrower's collateral won't be adversely impacted by any new loans that may be gotten by the borrower later on.

At times, nonetheless, a borrower might be forced to look for new loans to manage the cost of their existing loans. The lenders accessible to give these loans, in any case, may demand getting a higher priority status than the existing creditors, as a condition for expanding this new and possibly risky loan. In those situations, the more seasoned lenders might feel that it is much improved to be primed than to risk the borrower defaulting on their obligations by and large.

This type of financing ordinarily influences the laid out priority of the existing lenders, making old lenders lose ground relative to the DIP lender.

Under these troublesome conditions, the existing lenders could consent to being primed assuming they accept that the new DIP financing will allow the bankrupt company to recuperate. On the off chance that then again they won't be primed, the company might be forced to [liquidate](/liquidation) in a less orderly way and possibly repay even less of their initial loans.
