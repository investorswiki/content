# Revaluation Rates
## What Are Revaluation Rates?

The term "revaluation rates" alludes to rates that are usually used to determine the performance of [currencies](/currency). Traders utilize these market rates to evaluate whether a currency understands a profit or loss anytime.

## Understanding Revaluation Rates

The revaluation rate is basically viewed as the [closing rate](/closingprice) for the previous [trading session](/tradingsession). Usually used to reference currency rates in the currency market, revaluation rates are utilized in different markets.

Revaluation rates show the change in a currency, investment, or [portfolio's](/portfolio) value at some random point in time. To survey a trader's profit or loss, they utilize the closing rate from the other day, the present revaluation rate, as a [baseline](/baseline) to compare the present closing rate. In the event that the rate expands, the trader creates a gain. On the off chance that it drops, there is a loss.

Numerous equity and [bond](/bond) portfolio managers utilize the daily [WM/Reuters rates](/wmreuters-benchmark-rates) to revalue their portfolios. These rates are calculated utilizing an average rate more than a one-minute trading period, which is 30 seconds before and 30 seconds after 4:00 pm London time. This provides investors with an exact value of the portfolio at the given time interval.

Equity [portfolio managers](/portfoliomanager) can show fund gains or losses by looking at the values of their fund at the predetermined time, for example, the closing value of the fund yesterday compared to its closing value today.

The revaluation rate is important for retail investors. In the event that a position is revalued at a huge loss, the investor might be [margin-called](/margincall) and they might be required to additional fund their account in the event that they wish to keep holding the position. Brokers routinely revalue positions at the close of the day and issue [margin](/margin) calls to the people who abuse their margin requirements.

## Illustration of Revaluation Rates

To show how revaluation rates work in the [foreign exchange market](/foreign-exchange-markets), expect a trader has a position in EUR/USD worth $100,000 and the last closing price for this currency pair was 1.1450. The close of the next day is 1.1425. The prior day's close (1.1450) turns into the revaluation rate used to survey the position's profit or loss and that's what the rate uncovers assuming the trader sells that day, they make $250 (1.1450 - 1.1425 x $100,000), or 25 [pips](/pip).
