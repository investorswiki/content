Georgia gathered a stock portfolio with a cost basis of $5,000, plus $400 in commissions, and sold them once the value of the shares came to $7,500. Georgia's net profit was $2,500. To decide her return on investment, Georgia takes away the commissions of $400 from the net profit of $2,500, and separates the subsequent figure by the $5,000 cost of the investment, then, at that point, duplicates this figure by 100, which brings about a ROI of 42 percent. This compares well to the 10 percent ROI that Georgia's companion, Franz, offered on a potential real estate deal, so Georgia lets her stock investment be and turns down Franz's offer.
