# Sovereign Bond Yield
## What Is Sovereign Bond Yield?

Sovereign bond yield is the [interest rate](/interestrate) paid to the buyer of the [bond](/bond) by the government, or sovereign entity, giving that debt instrument.

## Understanding Sovereign Bond Yield

Sovereign bond yield is the rate of interest at which a national government can borrow. [Sovereign bonds](/sovereign-debt) are sold by governments to investors to fund-raise for government spending, like financing war efforts.

Sovereign bonds, as different bonds, yield the full face value at [maturity](/maturity). The fact that governments fulfill budgeting needs makes sovereign bonds the number one way. Since numerous sovereign bonds are viewed as risk-free, like [U.S. Treasury bonds (T-bonds)](/treasurybond), they don't have [credit risk](/creditrisk) incorporated into their valuation, and consequently they yield a lower interest rate than riskier bonds.

The spread between sovereign bond yields and exceptionally rated [corporate bond](/corporatebond) yields is in many cases utilized as a measure of the risk premium put on corporations. It is important to think about these factors together while thinking about an investment in sovereign or corporate bonds.

Technically, sovereign bonds are viewed as risk-free in light of the fact that they depend on the currency of the responsible government, and that government can constantly issue more currency to pay the bond on maturity. Factors that influence the yield of a specific sovereign bond incorporate the creditworthiness of the responsible government, the value of the responsible currency on the currency exchange market, and the stability of the responsible government.

## Special Considerations

The creditworthiness of sovereign bonds is ordinarily founded on the perceived financial stability of the responsible government and its ability to repay debts. International credit rating agencies frequently rate the creditworthiness of sovereign bonds â€” strikingly [Moody's](/moodys), [Standard and Poor's (S&P)](/sp), and [Fitch](/fitch-ratings). These ratings depend on factors that include:

- [Gross domestic product (GDP)](/gdp) development
- The government's history of defaulting
- Per capita income in the country
- The rate of [inflation](/inflation)
- The government's outer debts
- Economic development inside the country

At the point when a government is encountering political instability, or experiencing outer factors that add to instability, there is a risk that the government could [default](/default2) on its debts. During the sovereign debt emergencies that have happened in the past, markets responded by pricing in a credit premium and this increased the cost of new borrowing for these governments. Recent models incorporate the [European debt crisis](/european-sovereign-debt-crisis) and emergencies in Russia and Argentina.

Even without credit risk, sovereign bond yields are affected by [currency exchange rate risk](/currencyrisk), and nearby interest rates. This is especially true in the event that governments borrow in a foreign currency, for example, a country in South America borrowing in dollars since devaluation of their domestic currency could make it harder to repay the debt. Borrowing in one more currency is regularly something done by countries with currencies that are not exceptionally strong all alone.
