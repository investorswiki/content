## What Is a Bond in Simple Terms?
A bond is a debt issued by a borrower, like a corporation or the federal government, to fund-raise. A bond is known as a [fixed-income security](/fixed-income-investments) since it pays its holder a fixed sum on a customary schedule for a fixed term. Toward the finish of the term, the borrower has paid back the principal of the debt, which is known as its face value, along with periodic interest payments.
[Stocks](/commonstock) might be the more impressive financial assets, however in all honesty, the bond market is really bigger. As per the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association (SIFMA), global equity markets were valued at $120 trillion out of 2021, while global bond markets were valued at $123.5 trillion.
Since bonds are more stable and less [volatile](/volatility) than stocks, possessing bonds can be part of an investor's balanced portfolio strategy. One more plus: Bonds turn out revenue as interest, otherwise called coupon payments.
Something key to realize about bonds is that their prices move conversely to [interest rates](/interestrate). So when interest rates increase, bond prices fall. At the point when interest rates decline, bond prices go up.
Most bonds mature in 30 years or less. Longer-term bonds regularly have higher coupons to remunerate the investor for the risk that interest rates could rise before the bond matures. This is known as interest-rate risk.
## 10 Bond Investing Terms You Need to Know
To comprehend how bonds work, we've put together a helpful glossary of terms:
1. **Bond:** A small loan, made by an individual, to a corporate or government entity.
1. **Bondholder:** The individual who is loaning money to a corporate or government entity.
1. **Bond Duration:** This measures the sensitivity of a bond's value to a change in interest rates. High [duration](/duration) equals high sensitivity and high risk. Low duration equals low sensitivity and low risk.
1. **Bond Issuer:** The corporate or government entity to whom the bondholder is loaning money.
1. **Bond Yield:** The profit, or return, the bondholder receives annually on their bond. Yield on any bond will mirror the interest rates at the time the bond is issued.
1. **Coupon Rate:** The annual income the bondholder will receive on their bond. The annual coupon rate is calculated by interest rates. The coupon rate is set in the bond agreement, however it can fluctuate contingent upon current interest rates.
1. **Credit quality:** This alludes to the issuer's ability and readiness to pay interest and repay principal on schedule. Most bonds carry ratings (AAA is the highest) showing their credit quality.
1. **Face Value/Par Value:** This is the set value of the bond, and the amount the bondholder will be repaid at maturity. Oftentimes, with bonds, the face value is set to a memorable simple $100 or $1,000 value. The face value won't ever change. Try considering it a bond's wholesale price.
1. **Market Value:** This is the price a bondholder really pays for a bond when they purchase it. For what reason is this unique in relation to the face value of your bond? It's different in light of the fact that the market value of the bond changes. It will rise and fall in correlation to interest rates and different factors.
1. **Maturity Date:** This is the date a bond matures and the bondholder gets compensated back the principal bond amount (or original investment).

## 4 Common Types of Bonds
There are several classes of bonds: Treasury securities are issued by the federal government; municipal bonds are issued by states and nearby governments; and [corporate bonds](/corporatebond) are issued by companies. Different types of bonds incorporate high-yield bonds, agency securities, and asset-backed securities. With the exception of municipal bonds, the wide range of various types are aggregately alluded to as spread product.
### Agency bonds
Agency bonds are issued by government-sponsored enterprises (GSEs) or organizations affiliated with the federal government, for example, the Federal Home Loan Mortgage (Freddie Mac), Federal National Mortgage Association (Fannie Mae), or Federal Home Loan Bank.
### Corporate bonds
Corporate bonds are issued by companies seeking a lower interest rate and more good terms than are offered by traditional bank loans.
### Government bonds
Government bonds are issued by government specialists and by and large known as "treasuries," or "sovereign debt" whenever issued by the federal government.
### Municipal bonds
Municipal bonds are issued by states and municipalities seeking the same.
**Secured and Unsecured Bonds**
A secured bond is normally a corporate or municipal bond that is backed by collateral, similar to property, equipment, or another asset. Probably the most notable secured bonds are **mortgage-backed securities**, which are an assortment of home loans that banks issue and investors can buy.
The main thing supporting an unsecured bond is a commitment that they will be repaid on "full faith and credit." There isn't anything backing an unsecured bond, which adds to their risk level. Unsecured bonds, which are otherwise called debentures, normally pay higher coupon payments than secured bonds.
## Fixed versus Variable Rates
Fixed-rate bonds pay a set, or fixed, coupon for the term of the bond. True to their name, variable-rate bonds pay a coupon that changes, so that when interest rates change, their coupon changes likewise. A couple of models will illustrate.
### Bond Example 1: Fixed Interest Rate
Jessica bought a $1,000 bond with a maturity of 2 years, at a fixed coupon rate of 5%.
In 1 year, Jessica will receive a $50 coupon/bond yield.
In 2 years, when her bond matures, she will receive $1,050 back, which incorporates:
- Her par value of $1,000
- Her coupon/bond yield of $50 (calculated with the coupon rate of 5% interest)

Thus, eventually, her bond had a total coupon/bond yield of $100.
Jessica's profit is directly proportional to the coupon rate she had on her bond. Since she picked the most secure sort of bond, a fixed interest rate bond, she knew precisely exact thing she was getting into and what she would receive toward the finish of the 2 years. She received her coupon/yield of $100 — no more, no less.
### Bond Example 2: Variable Interest Rate
Sam bought a $1,000 bond with a maturity of 2 years, at a variable interest rate of 5% (the current interest rate at the hour of purchase).
In the event that interest rates don't change during that 1 year period, Sam will receive the same yield as Jessica: $50.
In any case, assuming interest rates drop to 3%, Sam's yield will presently change to $30. It's lamentable, yet that is the risk Sam took when he picked a variable interest rate bond.
Notwithstanding, rather than dropping, interest rates could rise to 7% during that year! Assuming that is the case, Sam's yield has now changed to $70.
## How do Bonds Pay Interest?
Bonds make periodic interest payments, which is known as their coupon rate. Most coupon bonds make payments semiannually, or two times per year. In any case, there are a few bonds, similar to Zero-coupon bonds, that pay no interest by any means.
### Zero-coupon bonds
Zero-coupon bonds are maybe the simplest of bonds. A zero-coupon bond doesn't pay a coupon rate; all things considered, income is generated by giving the bond at a discounted price compared to its face value. This thusly gives a profit to the bondholder at maturity, when the full face value is repaid. An illustration of a zero-coupon bond is a dollar bill issued by the U.S. Treasury.
### Convertible bonds
Convertible bonds can be changed over into stock contingent upon the conditions of the contract. This is alluring to some bond issuers, as it allows them to sell at a lower coupon rate/higher maturity with the bait to the bondholder being that they might possibly change over that bond into stock when the stock price rises.
### Callable bonds
Callable bonds are viewed as a riskier option for bondholders. This type of bond allows the bond issuer to "call" the bond before the maturity date, which frequently happens when that bond is rising in value.
### Puttable bonds
Puttable bonds are the reverse of callable bonds: this type of bond allows a bondholder to "put" or sell the bond back to the bond issuer before it has matured.
## How Are Bonds Rated?
**Credit Quality:** To assist investors with grasping the creditworthiness of a bond, private rating agencies, like Standard and Poor's, Moody's and Fitch Ratings, conduct an assessment of the bond issuer at the time they issue a bond. Their discoveries are distributed in a straightforward ratings system, with AAA being the highest. An AAA rating means the issuer is incredibly fit for meeting its financial commitments.
**Investment-grade** bonds are anything above BB status, while D-rated bonds show that the company is in default. This chart gives a helpful illustration of the various ratings.

Investment-grade bonds normally have lower coupon yields than non-investment-grade bonds, which offer investors higher yields as a method for offsetting their increased risk. Junk bonds are bonds with high coupons yet in addition have ratings lower than BB. Companies as a rule issue junk bonds when they need to raise cash rapidly.

## How Are Bonds Priced?
Recall our definition of par value, (otherwise called face value)? Par value is the bond's set price. It is additionally the amount the investor will receive at maturity. Bonds can trade at par, at a discount, which is below their face value, or at a premium, which is higher than their face value.
Bond performance is estimated by benchmarks. These benchmarks are the highest-rated government Treasuries, which are viewed as free of default risk. The 10-year Treasury, for instance, is utilized as a benchmark for 10-year bonds.
Bond prices are affected by their creditworthiness as well as how old they are, which is their maturity. The nearer a bond is to its maturity, the more probable it will trade at par value, since it is just nearer to returning the full investment to a bondholder.
## Instructions to Calculate Yield to Maturity
The formula used to compute yield to maturity is below:

The Yield to Maturity formula is the sum of the coupon plus the calculation of face value minus bond price separated by the number of years to maturity. All of this gets partitioned by another calculation, which is the face value deducted by the bond price and separated in half.
Keep in mind, bonds that have longer terms to maturity are generally priced lower and offer higher yields.
