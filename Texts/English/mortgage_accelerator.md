## What Is a Mortgage Accelerator?

A mortgage accelerator is a type of [mortgage](/mortgage) loan program that looks like the combination of a [home equity loan](/homeequityloan) and a checking account. Borrowers' paychecks are saved straightforwardly into the mortgage account, and that amount decreases the mortgage balance. Then, as checks are written against the account during the month, the mortgage balance rises. Any amount saved in the account that isn't withdrawn through the check-composing process is applied to the mortgage balance toward the month's end as repayment of the loan's principal. Mortgage accelerator loans were first promoted in the United States during the mid-2000s.

## How a Mortgage Accelerator Works

In a mortgage accelerator program, homebuyers receive a variable-rate home equity credit extension (HELOC) rather than a fixed-rate loan for their most memorable mortgage. Numerous lenders offer the accelerator for new home purchases as well with respect to refinancing an existing mortgage.

Furthermore, the amount of the paycheck that remaining parts in the account toward the month's end may be bigger than whatever would be paid toward the mortgage's principal balance under a traditional amortizing mortgage. At the point when this is the case, the principal is retired early, diminishing the mortgage's whole term and bringing about interest savings.
