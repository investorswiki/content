## Understanding Equity Style Boxes

An equity style box is made out of nine squares, or categories, with the investment elements of stocks/stock mutual funds introduced along its vertical and horizontal tomahawks. Institutional investment managers will involve equity style box categories as a central consideration for their portfolio management objectives. Investors, all things considered, can utilize equity style box categories to screen stocks and mutual funds for individual investing qualities.

For stocks and stock funds, the vertical hub is separated into three company-size categories in light of market capitalization: large, medium, and small. The horizontal hub addresses the investment style and shifts marginally for stocks and stock funds. The two stocks and stock funds incorporate value and growth categories. For stock investments, Morningstar orders the middle category, which can generally be considered as a mix of value and growth, as a core for stocks and blend for funds. Investors will frequently see these categories utilized in stock reports and mutual fund marketing materials.

## Special Considerations
