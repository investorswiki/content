# Excess Limits Premium
## What Are Excess Limits Premiums?

The excess limits premium of an insurance policy agreement is the amount paid for [coverage](/insurance-coverage) past the fundamental [liability](/liability) limits outlined in the policy agreement. The term is most usually found in casualty reinsurance contracts.

## Grasping Excess Limits Premiums

In an insurance contract, the insured party purchases a predefined amount of coverage against a specific type of [risk](/risk) from the insurer. When the policyholder arrives at the coverage limit, the insurer is as of now not responsible for covering losses.

Coverage limitations can make a scenario in which the loss from a risk surpasses the amount of coverage. The outcome is the insured possibly needs to cover a critical portion of the leftover losses out-of-pocket.

A party purchasing a casualty policy — a broad category of coverage against loss of property, damage, or different liabilities — should balance the amount of coverage wanted with the premium amount they will pay. The higher the coverage limits are in the policy, the higher the premiums will be. Premiums are the predetermined amount of payment required intermittently by an insurer to provide coverage under a given insurance plan.

On the off chance that the policyholder ought to never file a case near the coverage limit, then, at that point, they are logical over-insured. The policyholder could, accordingly, think about diminishing the amount of coverage to pay less premium and understand a few cost savings. In situations where there is as yet the possibility that losses might surpass the amount of fundamental coverage, the insured might utilize an excess coverage [rider](/rider), which just triggers during incidents of high damage.

## Computing Excess Limits Premiums

The calculation of premiums for excess limits coverage is a factor of the premium paid for the essential coverage. Excess coverage limits are given in [tranches](/tranches), or portions, with a pre-determined factor assigned to each level. Ordinarily, the factor increments as the excess limit tranche increments.

For instance, an engineering company holds a casualty insurance policy with a fundamental coverage limit of $1 million. The company purchases excess coverage for up to $5 million in damages.

The tranches of excess coverage are at $1 million additions. The engineering firm will pay 20% of the premium of their essential coverage for the first $1 million excess. Each section tranche increments with the $5 million excess-limit levels assessed at half of the base premium.

## Special Considerations
### Reinsurance Market

Excess limits premiums are most regularly found in reinsurance contracts. Reinsurance is a method for insurance providers to sell high-risk policies they hold to a secondary provider, in this way spreading the risk of loss from a [catastrophic](/calamity insurance) event.

Excess limit premiums are more specific to [excess of loss reinsurance](/excess-loss-reinsurance), as opposed to [pro rata](/pro-rata) reinsurance. The former is a type of reinsurance where the reinsurer repays the [ceding company](/ceding-company) for losses that surpass a predefined limit. The last option, then again, is an agreement by which the losses and premiums are shared between the reinsurer and the ceding company as per a fixed percentage.

Excess limits are utilized to repay the ceding insurer for a loss in excess of a pre-determined holding level. This arrangement protects the original ceding company from risks that can possibly be serious and conceivably place it into [financial distress](/financial_distress), like in the event of a hurricane or flood.

The reinsurer will assess the conceivable risk to determine the cost of the excess limits coverage. If the reinsurer gauges a low-loss probability, the more prudent an excess limits premiums approach might be for the ceding company.
