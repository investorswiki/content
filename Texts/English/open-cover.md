# Open Cover
## What Is Open Cover?

Open cover is a type of marine [insurance](/insurance) policy in which the insurer consents to give coverage to all cargo shipped during the policy period. Open cover insurance is generally normally purchased by companies that make incessant shipments, as the blanket coverage holds them back from buying another policy each time a shipment is made.

## Grasping Open Cover

Open cover policies are generally utilized in international trade, specifically by companies associated with high volume trade over extensive stretches of time. There are many risks associated with marine shipping that would lead to a company needing to purchase marine insurance. A portion of these risks incorporate damage to cargo from loading or unloading, invasion, sinking, piracy, weather conditions issues, and other comparative hardships. Marine insurance is commonly split between insurance for the ship, known as frame and machinery, and the cargo. Each would be required to have their own insurance policy.

On the off chance that a company accepts it won't be participating in marine activity that frequently, it can opt to buy a renewable policy, where it can restore the policy after it terminates if necessary. This means that for each voyage it would reestablish the open cover policy. Most marine companies opt for a permanent policy for a specific time frame period on the off chance that they hope to make various voyages in that time span.

The permanent policy covers all voyages under that time span without arranging a contract for every shipment. A form of blanket coverage just requires certain subtleties to be informed before setting out on the voyage.

Since the insured is consenting to purchase a more extended term contract, it could have the option to acknowledge lower [premiums](/premium) on the grounds that the insurer doesn't need to spend time on administrative exercises and the insurer benefits from having a guaranteed premium over a more drawn out period of time. Premiums are commonly endless supply of a voyage, for instance, week after week or month to month.

Individual countries oversee insurance regulations for international shipping, as opposed to an international organization. Scandinavian countries and the U.K. are notable marine insurance policy suppliers, and China is likewise becoming as a [underwriter](/underwriter) country.

## Facultative versus Open Cover

Marine insurance is commonly partitioned into two types: facultative and open cover. Facultative insurance gives the insurance company the option of covering cargo. Nonetheless, the insured and the insurer must arrange the terms for every shipment, including the type of coverage, cargo, and ship.

Open cover insurance contrasts in that the insurer is committed to give coverage, given that the cargo falls inside the limits illustrated in the insurance policy document, and the shipment occurs inside the policy time span. This makes open cover insurance a form of treaty [reinsurance](/reinsurance).

## Requirements for Open Cover

In certain regards, an open cover insurance policy is viewed as a contract of "[utmost great faith](/uberrimae-fidei-contract)," implying that the insured must willfully uncover to the insurer all information relevant to the accepted risks. Inability to do so could void an open cover policy. To aid in this disclosure requirement, the insurance company gives certificates to be filled out each time cargo is sent.

The value of the cargo, the proposed travel period, and the location are kept in the certificate. The terms of an open cover policy will set a maximum value for the cargo to be covered inside a defined time span. When the maximum value is reached, another agreement ought to be endorsed between the two players. Since countries oversee their waters, marine insurance regulations are heavily influenced by the state run administrations where any losses might happen, not the insured company's regulations or their legislatures.
