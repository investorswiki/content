# Effective Gross Income (EGI)
## What Is Effective Gross Income?

Effective gross income (EGI) is the Potential Gross Rental Income plus other income minus vacancy and credit costs of a rental property.

EGI can be calculated by taking the expected gross income from a [investment property,](/investment-property) add different forms of income created by that property, and deduct vacancy and assortment losses.

## Figuring out Effective Gross Income (EGI)

EGI is a key variable in deciding the value of a rental property and the true positive cash flow that property could create. Rental cash flow is certainly not a simple calculation yet incorporates all forms of income produced by the property minus the realistic costs engaged with rental income. Assuming that we take a gander at the variables of the EGI formula, we can perceive how rental income works out in reality.

## EGI Formula Explained
### Gross Potential Rental Income

Gross potential rental income is the speculative amount an investor would receive with no of the rental headwinds that are commonplace in reality. It expects that your rental property will be rented all year long and that renters will pay the agreed to rent reported in the lease. For instance, if the agreed to rent is $2,000 every month, the gross potential rental income is $24,000.

### Other Income Generated by the Rental Property

What comprises "other" income produced from rental properties? Here are probably the most common wellsprings of cash flow not derived straightforwardly from rental payments:

- On-premise coin-worked clothing machines
- On-premise candy machines
- Month to month parking permits
- Storage Units
- Pet Fees
- Late Fees

### Vacancy Costs

In real life, a unit won't necessarily in all cases be rented all year long. Vacancy costs are the periods between tenants where the owner isn't getting rent since there is a "vacancy." [Vacancy ](/vacancy-rate)costs are gauges of how long the owner accepts his unit will be without a tenant. Assuming the owner has managed investment properties for quite a while, this cost might be estimated in light of his/her managerial experience or industry data.

### Credit Costs

Credit costs will happen when a rental unit is occupied, and the owner doesn't receive the agreed-upon rental payment. The renter has not paid the rent, or has not paid it completely. Likewise with vacancy costs, this amount will be an estimate that might be founded on historical data.

## Why EGI Is Important

EGI is essential to the real estate investor on the grounds that, by the day's end, they need to realize that the property they are thinking about purchasing produces sufficient positive cash flow to cover month to month operating expenses as well as any liens or encumbrances they might have taken on to purchase the property.
