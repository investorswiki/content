# Least Deposit
## What Is a Minimum Deposit?

A base deposit or initial deposit is the base amount of money required to open an account with a financial institution, for example, a bank or brokerage firm.

Higher least deposits are generally associated with accounts offering premium services, though products situated toward a mainstream crowd generally offer lower least deposits to draw in new customers.

## How Minimum Deposits Work

In the United States, least deposits can shift widely. While certain services offer no base deposit requirement, others set their base at $10,000 or more.

According to the point of view of the service provider, least deposits assist with guaranteeing that the [revenues](/revenue) produced from the customer will be adequate to cover the administrative costs and different overheads associated with servicing that account.

Generally, higher least deposit requirements are associated with premium products, while mass-market offerings will generally reduce or even forgo their base deposit requirements. For instance, a full-service brokerage could require a base deposit of something like $10,000 in exchange for added highlights, for example, reduced trade commissions, access to analyst reports, or more complete and convenient data from the exchanges. A discount brokerage, on the other hand, could postpone their base deposit requirements yet offer a more pared-down service with less advanced highlights.

Today, developing competition among financial services firms has prompted reduced fees and least deposit requirements in certain sectors. This is especially apparent in the discount brokerage and investment management industries, where firms, for example, Wealthsimple and Betterment offer low-cost platforms that, at times, have no base deposit requirements. This low-cost approach has even extended into other fee areas, for example, by killing per-trade commissions.

Notwithstanding least deposit requirements, different areas where financial firms can contend to draw in customers incorporate annual account fees, asset management endlessly fees associated with pulling out or transferring funds.

## Genuine Example of a Minimum Deposit

To delineate, consider the pricing options offered by the two financial firms referenced previously. For customers needing the cheapest option, Wealthsimple and Betterment both offer account options with no base deposit requirements. Be that as it may, customers wishing to access further developed highlights can do as such by giving higher least deposits.

For example, Wealthsimple offers an account for least deposits of $100,000 or more, which gives reduced annual fees, as well as extra services, like oversight from a financial adviser. Another plan, for deposits of $500,000 or more, offers extra benefits, for example, a discounted [health plan](/wellbeing plan-classifications).

Betterment offers a somewhat unique model, in that its premium plan (for deposits of $100,000 or more) conveys a higher management fee. In exchange, notwithstanding, the premium plan offers access to a team of financial planning experts who can educate the customer on a reach with respect to subjects, for example, retirement and estate planning.
