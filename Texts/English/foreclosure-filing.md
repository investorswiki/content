## What Is a Foreclosure Filing?

A foreclosure filing alludes to the legal act by a mortgage lender in filing a lawsuit in court to win the right to sell the home of a delinquent [mortgagor](/mortgagor) at auction. It is subsequently the commencement of the proper foreclosure process.

At the point when a homeowner defaults on mortgage payments, or in any case neglects to satisfy the terms of the mortgage agreement, the lender can implement its rights through the foreclosure cycle. The [foreclosure](/foreclosure) process is regulated by state laws, and the rights and obligations of both the borrower and the lender can shift widely from one state to another.

## Types of Foreclosure Filings

There are two fundamental types of foreclosure filing:

- [Judicial foreclosure](/judicial_foreclosure), in which the lender must file a foreclosure suit in court to be permitted to resell the home.
- Nonjudicial foreclosure, wherein a lender doesn't have to look for court endorsement.

Whether your mortgage lender should file a judicial foreclosure relies upon the laws of your state.

### Judicial Foreclosure Filing

In states with judicial foreclosure, there are run of the mill steps that a mortgage lender must take before it can file a foreclosure suit in court. In New York state, for example, the bank must initially send a delinquent borrower an acceleration letter, which states its goal to speed up the mortgage, in the event that the borrower doesn't get current on their loan by a certain date.

To speed up a mortgage means to expect that a borrower pay the whole amount due immediately. An acceleration letter is normally sent after a borrower has failed to make their mortgage payment for a long time. Subsequent to sending the acceleration letter, a mortgage lender in New York state must likewise send delinquent borrowers a 90-day [pre‐foreclosure](/pre-foreclosure) filing notice, which must illuminate borrowers regarding no less than five nonprofit legal counseling services in the borrower's area.

Solely after this 90-day period might a mortgagor at any point file for foreclosure. In many states like New York, the [delinquent](/delinquent) borrower then has a period of time, normally 20 to 30 days, to file a response to the mortgage lender's objection. This response is the borrower's opportunity to state assuming the mortgagor accepts the foreclosure protest has been filed in mistake, or on the other hand on the off chance that the borrower has some other grumblings about the conduct of the mortgage servicer.

### Nonjudicial Foreclosure Filing

The greater part of the U.S. states — 28, including Arizona, California, Georgia, and Texas — principally use nonjudicial foreclosure, additionally called [power of sale](/power-of-sale). This type of foreclosure doesn't need the lender to file a conventional lawsuit — in fact, it doesn't go through the court system at all except if the homeowner sues the lender to try to stop the procedure.

In a nonjudicial foreclosure, a specific section of the mortgage contract, called the power of sale clause, gives the lender the right to seize and sell the property on the off chance that the borrower defaults. By signing the mortgage contract, the borrower actually consents to this condition.

While each state that permits it has somewhat various rules with regards to nonjudicial foreclosure, the interaction generally incorporates these angles:

- The borrower has defaulted by neglecting to make payments;
- The lender must give limited notice of the foreclosure;
- After a specific period of time, a third-party trustee can sell the home at a foreclosure sale.

While they don't need court action, nonjudicial foreclosures actually order a series of state-endorsed steps that lenders need to follow. Generally, borrowers need to receive a written advance warning, similar to a breach letter or a pre-foreclosure notice, of the lender's goal. Different steps include:

- A notice of default. giving you a certain amount of opportunity to get current on the loan by making up the back payments in general;
- A combined notice of sale and right to fix. letting you know that your home will be sold on a certain date except if you make up the missed payments by a certain cutoff time;
- A notice of sale.

## Filing Foreclosure in Nonjudicial States

In many states where there are laws supporting nonjudicial foreclosure, the actual filing of a foreclosure suit is some of the time excessive. In these states, banks can renounce a judicial survey of the foreclosure in the event that they remembered a power of sale clause for the mortgage agreement.

In these states, lenders are not required to get a decree of foreclosure through the court system. All things being equal, they might alert the borrower and the public of the foreclosure through different means. These may incorporate a [notice of default](/notice-of-default) followed by a notice of sale, a [decree of sale](/decree-of-foreclosure-and-sale) determining an auction date, or essentially the publication of a notice of sale in a paper. In states with nonjudicial foreclosures, the foreclosure cycle generally works more rapidly than in states requiring a court-gave decree of foreclosure.
