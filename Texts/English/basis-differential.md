# Basis Differential
## What Is Basis Differential?

Basis differential is the difference between the spot price of a commodity to be hedged and the futures price of the contract utilized. For instance, the difference between the [Henry Hub](/henry_hub) natural gas spot price and the relating futures price for a natural gas contract in a predefined location is the basis differential.

The Henry Hub pipeline, situated in Erath, Louisiana, fills in as the official delivery location for [New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX)](/nymex) futures contracts.

## Figuring out Basis Differential

Basis differential is a factor that traders need to consider while hedging their commodity price exposure. In practice, hedging is frequently confounded due to factors, for example, the asset whose price is being hedged may not be the very same as the underlying asset of the futures contract. Or on the other hand the hedger might be dubious with regards to the specific date when the commodity will be bought or sold. This means the hedge might require the futures contract to be closed out before expiration, and a loss or gain will be solidified on the basis differential.

If the commodity to be hedged and the asset underlying the futures contract is something very similar, the basis ought to be zero at the futures' contract expiration. Prior to expiration, the basis differential might be positive or negative. When in doubt, when the spot price increments by more than the futures price, the basis differential ascents. This is called reinforcing of the basis.

Alternately, when the futures price increments by more than the spot price, the basis differential psychologists. This is called a debilitating of the basis. This mismatch in basis differential price behavior can out of the blue debilitate or reinforce the hedger's position.

Different factors influencing the basis differential are the decision of the underlying asset of the futures contract and the [delivery month](/deliverymonth). It is generally important to carry out a careful analysis to figure out which accessible futures contract has a price that most closely corresponds with the price of the commodity being hedged.

Utilizing an alternate underlying asset or changing the delivery month can in some cases reduce the basis differential for the commodity being hedged. This reduces price vulnerability for the party utilizing the hedge. When in doubt, in any case, the basis differential increments as the time difference between the current spot price and hedge expiration increments.
