# Data Loss
## What Is Data Loss?

Data loss happens when valuable or sensitive information on a computer is compromised due to theft, human mistake, viruses, malware, or power failure. It might likewise happen due to actual damage or mechanical failure or equipment of a structure.

The most compelling motivations for data loss incorporate PC theft, accidental erasure or overwriting of files, power blackouts and floods, spilled liquids, and the breaking down or sudden failure of hard drives. Consistently backing up files makes data recovery conceivable in the event of data loss. For data that hasn't been backed up, professional recovery services could possibly reestablish lost data.

Servers can likewise experience the ill effects of data loss, just like individual computers and gadgets can.

## Grasping Data Loss

Social engineering and phishing attacks are common wellsprings of computer viruses and malware contaminations that penetrate computers and lead to data loss. The attackers can likewise [encrypt data](/encryption) and hold it prisoner until the client [pays a ransom](/ransomware) to get the decryption key. Keeping antivirus software state-of-the-art safeguards against software weaknesses, yet [phishing](/phishing) and [social engineering](/social-engineering) attacks may not be preventable by hostile to virus software.

In this way, a decent defense is to teach individuals about the idea of these attacks so they are less inclined to become casualties. For instance, practicing alert in tapping on email connects and downloading connections can assist with preventing data loss.

## Data Loss: Common Causes

Power floods and blackouts hurt computers by making operating systems shut down suddenly without following the legitimate procedures. The file corruption that can result can make it difficult to reboot the computer. Liquid spills onto PC keyboards can saturate the packaging and damage the internal parts, particularly on account of acidic or sweet beverages, so it's smart to keep liquids from PCs or utilize a spill-confirmation travel mug.

Hard drives have moving parts that can experience a mechanical failure due to wearing out, overheating, electrostatic discharge, or being dropped. They can likewise fail due to file corruption, ill-advised drive formatting, or software corruption. Hard drives might fail and experience data loss suddenly, or they might give indications of gradually failing, for example, crashing more than once, turning out to be progressively sluggish, or making unusual clamors.

Making normal data reinforcements of hard drive data safeguards against this form of data loss. For instance, an individual could back up their personal files from a PC to both an outer hard drive and [the cloud](/cloud-storage). Having the data stored in three places that face various risks limits the risk of total data loss.

Preventing data loss is important for companies to safeguard their privacy and intellectual property as well as conform to government regulations. Organizations can utilize data loss prevention (DLP) highlights in software from suppliers like Google and Microsoft to safeguard against data loss. There are additionally data loss prevention suites from suppliers like Clearswift, Symantec, Digital Guardian, Forcepoint, and McAfee, among others.

## Features
- Data loss can be brought about by outer factors, like a power blackout, theft, or a broad-based phishing attack.
- Companies can safeguard themselves by involving data loss prevention procedures in software and by having conventions in place for employees that enable them to securely work with and share business archives.
