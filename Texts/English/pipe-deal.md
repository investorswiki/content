## What Is a PIPE Deal?

Private investment in public equity deal (PIPE Deal) alludes to the practice of private investors buying a publicly-traded stock at a price below the current price accessible to the public. Mutual funds and other large institutional investors can strike deals to buy large pieces of stock at a preferred price.

PIPE deals are frequently offered by companies hoping to rapidly raise a large amount of capital.

## Understanding PIPE Deals

In a traditional PIPE deal, a company will privately sell equity in publicly traded common or preferred shares at a discounted rate relative to the market price to an[ accredited investor](/accreditedinvestor). In a structured PIPE deal, the responsible company issues convertible debt, which can typically be changed over completely to the responsible company's stock at the purchaser's will.

Generally, the offering company is attempting to raise capital, either on the grounds that they need it rapidly or in light of the fact that they couldn't obtain it through different means. The purchasing company (generally a mutual fund or[ hedge fund](/hedgefund)) enjoys the benefit of buying at a discounted price; in light of the fact that these straightforwardly sold shares are relatively illiquid, the purchaser is possibly interested on the off chance that it can get the shares at a discount.

PIPE deals are famous as a result of their proficiency — especially compared to different sorts of secondary offerings — and in light of the fact that they are subject to less regulations from the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Any publicly-traded company can start a PIPE deal with an accredited investor. This is especially helpful for smaller or less popular companies that could experience difficulty raising capital in any case.

## History of PIPE Deals

Interest in PIPE deals has changed over the long haul. In 2017, a total of $45.3 billion was raised more than 1,461 deals. In 2016, 1,199 deals raised $51.6 billion. Nonetheless, that is not exactly the $88.3 billion closed north of 980 transactions in the initial 9 months of 2008. PIPE deals will generally happen in markets or industries for which it is hard to raise capital; in this manner, PIPE deals were well known at the level of the[ 2008 banking crisis](/extraordinary downturn).

PIPE deals are fairly less famous with shareholders, as the issuance of new stock for these sales weakens the value of existing shares. In certain cases, investors or companies with inside information on the trade have shorted the responsible firm stock in anticipation. A few regulators have called for additional intensive regulations to prevent such insider trading opportunities, contending moreover that the generally small offering firms have not much of a choice yet to take terrible deals with hedge funds to raise horribly required capital.

## Special Considerations
### PIPE Deals and Government Bailouts

PIPE deals can be much the same as the sort of deals that happen with government bailouts of distressed companies or industries. In these deals the government purchases a piece of equity as stock, warrants, or convertible debt in return for the liquid capital a company needs to stay in operation, rebuild, or keep away from bankruptcy. A PIPE deals similarly frequently include distressed companies that have run out of different options on the market to raise required capital rapidly, trading a piece of equity to an institutional investor at a discount which can leave the buyer in a strong position to influence the company or even a controlling interest.

An illustration of a comparative government bailout deal would be the vehicle industry bailout of 2009, where the Treasury took over GM and Chrysler. These types of bailouts are generally more extreme than the regular PIPE deal, since the companies that look for them are more desperate and may have proactively fallen flat to arrange a PIPE deal with a private institution. Private PIPE deals are likewise bound to be sought after as a last resort by smaller companies who are not considered systemically sufficiently important to warrant government action.
