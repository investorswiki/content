## What Is Temasek Holdings?

Temasek Holdings is a [sovereign wealth fund (SWF)](/sovereign_wealth_fund) — a state-owned company — that deals with an investment fund for the benefit of the Government of Singapore. Utilizing federal reserves, it centers around investments situated in Singapore, China, and North America, as well as Europe and a few emerging economies. Temasek Holdings has a portfolio of roughly SGD $306 billion (US $226.6 billion) as of March 2020.

The investment fund presently has 11 offices worldwide and deals with many investments and financial services including telecommunications, media and technology, transportation and industrials, consumer and real estate, life sciences and agribusiness, energy, and resources.

## Grasping Temasek Holdings

Temasek Holdings was established in 1974 under the Singapore Companies Act, which incorporated the organization. Incorporation permitted the company to possess and oversee investments and assets that the Singapore government had recently been responsible for. By alleviating the government from the financial angle task of overseeing investments, the government's Ministry of Finance had the option to have additional time and capacities to zero in on policymaking and regulation, as it was intended to do.

The company was initially based on a [portfolio](/portfolio) of SGD$354 million dollars from shares in companies, startups, and adventures that were held by the Singapore government, including a bird park, an inn, a shoemaker, a steel mill and an airline.

In spite of the fact that Temasek Holdings has the standard corporate structure, with two unique elements that mirror its status as a Fifth Schedule corporation in Singapore:

- The endorsement of the President of Singapore is required to make certain moves, like arrangement and removal of directors and key managers, including the CEO; the Board and CEO are accountable to the President. The majority of Temasek Holdings' directors and key officers are independent directors delegated from the [private sector](/private-sector). Temasek has one sole shareholder in the Singapore Minister for Finance.
- The company's financial statements are examined by the Government of Singapore's Auditor-General.

Regardless of the fact that the Singapore Minister of Finance is the company's sole shareholder, Singapore's government isn't straightforwardly associated with any of the investment or operational choices on any level of the company. The government is a shareholder as illustrated by the Board of Directors, which permits Temasek to operate as a Fifth Scheduled Company.
