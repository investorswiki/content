# Buying Power
## What is Buying Power?

Buying power, likewise alluded to as excess equity, is the money an investor has accessible to buy securities in a trading setting. Buying power equals the total cash held in the [brokerage account](/brokerageaccount) plus all suitable margin.

## How Buying Power Works

While buying power can take on an alternate significance relying upon the specific situation or industry, in finance, buying power alludes to the amount of money accessible for investors to purchase securities in a leveraged account. This is alluded to as a [margin account](/marginaccount), as traders apply for a new line of credit in light of the amount of cash held in their brokerage account. Regulation T, laid out by the [Federal Reserve Board](/frb) (FRB), orders that an investor's initial margin requirement in this account type must be no less than half, meaning the trader has two times buying power.

## Buying Power of Margin Accounts

The amount of margin a brokerage firm can offer a specific customer relies upon the firm's risk boundaries and the customer. Typically, equity margin accounts offer investors two times however much the cash held in the account, albeit some [forex](/forex) broker margin accounts offer buying power of up to 50:1.

The more leverage a brokerage house gives an investor, the harder it is to recover from a margin call. All in all, leverage offers the investor a chance to make increased gains with the utilization of seriously buying power, yet it additionally expands the risk of covering the loan. For a non-margin account or cash account, the buying power is equivalent to the amount of cash in the account. For instance, assuming a non-margin account has $10,000, that is the investor's buying power.

## Buying Power of Day Trading Accounts

Pattern day trading accounts work distinctively to ordinary margin accounts in that they require a base equity requirement of $25,000, rather than $2,000. While a trader needs to finance half of their stock situations in a standard margin account - which gives two times equity in buying power, they just need to fund 25% of the cost of securities purchased in a pattern day trading account - giving the trader four times equity buying power.

For instance, assume Sam has $50,000 in a day trading account; they could purchase up to $200,000 worth of [open trades](/vacant position) inside the trading day (50,000 x 4 = $200,000 buying power).

## Instance of Buying Power

We should expect Alex has $100,000 in a brokerage margin account and needs to purchase shares in Apple Inc. (AAPL). Alex's [initial margin](/initialmargin) requirement is half to enter a trade - a few brokers might have an initial margin requirement greater than half.

To compute Alex's total buying power, partition the amount of cash in the brokerage account by the initial margin percentage. Here, partition the cash balance of $100,000 by half. Accordingly, Alex can purchase up to $200,000 worth of Apple shares. ($100,000/half = $200,000). All things considered, the value of the margin account changes with the value of the securities held. The nearer it gets to the margin limits, the greater chance Alex has of getting a [margin call](/margincall).
