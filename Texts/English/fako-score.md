# FAKO Score
## What Is a FAKO Score?

The term "FAKO Score" alludes to any credit score that isn't the "FICO Score" developed and sold by the [publicly traded](/publiccompany) credit scoring company, Fair Isaac Corporation (FICO).

Throughout the long term, different websites have made and promoted credit scores that are expected to look like the FICO score, however which can contrast from it in critical regards. Pundits at times utilize the term "FAKO score" to allude to these non-FICO scores in a derogatory fashion.

## How FAKO Scores Work

Today, there are numerous websites offering [credit scores](/credit_score) to the public. In spite of the fact that there isn't anything preventing new companies from making their own type of credit score, the difficulty emerges from the way that most consumers unknowingly determine whether a given score is "great" or "terrible" by contrasting it with the reach promoted by the FICO score. This reach, which ranges from a low of 300 to a high of 850, has become so imbued in public cognizance that FAKO scores could delude consumers into accepting that their [creditworthiness](/creditrating) is better or more regrettable than it really is. This has driven a few consumers to excuse non-FICO credit scores as "FAKO scores," short for "counterfeit FICO scores."

At last, credit scores depend on the credit reports put forward by the three major [credit reporting agencies](/creditbureau): Experian, Equifax (EFX), and TransUnion (TRU). Be that as it may, score providers can vary substantially as to how they join the data from these credit reports into one complete score. For instance, the FICO scores consider five factors while determining creditworthiness: the borrower's current level of indebtedness, their history of payments, the types of credit utilized, the length of the borrower's [credit history](/credit-history), and the number of new credit accounts for which the borrower has applied. Despite the fact that credit scores are eventually founded on similar types of data, they gauge these factors in various extents and can thusly come to tangibly unique end results.

Credit scores are a subject of impressive interest due to the central job they play in determining whether a given credit application is declined or approved. Generally speaking, FICO scores of 650 or greater demonstrate an extremely strong credit history and carry a high likelihood of new loan acceptance. Scores below 620, then again, may make it challenging for borrowers to get financing at positive rates. Tragically, the different calculation methods utilized by credit score providers can make it challenging for consumers to precisely anticipate whether they will meet all requirements for loans. Even FAKO scores that utilization the equivalent 300-to-850 scale as FICO may not execute similar categories for determining a borrower's credit score or apply similar loads to those categories as FICO.

## Genuine Example of a FAKO Score

Currently, the two most well known FAKO scores are those of Credit Sesame and Credit Karma, the two of which are private [financial technology](/fintech) companies situated in San Francisco, California. Both of these companies allow customers to estimate their current credit score utilizing their own proprietary models. Since these models vary from those utilized by the Fair Isaac Corporation, the outcomes from these apparatuses will constantly contrast marginally from those of the FICO score.

Prior to 2018, a third well known FAKO provider was Quizzle, a personal finance website based out of Detroit, Michigan. In any case, Quizzle's services have since been closed down and incorporated into the offerings of its New York-based parent company, Bankrate.
