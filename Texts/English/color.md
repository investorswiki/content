# Variety
## What Is Color?

Variety is an option's "greek" that measures the rate at which [gamma](/gamma) will change over the long haul. Variety is otherwise called gamma decay or the derivative of gamma with respect to time.

## Figuring out Color

All the more explicitly, variety is the third-order derivative of an option's value, once to time and two times to the option's price. Gamma measures the change in [delta](/delta) in response to a one-unit price move in the [underlying asset](/underlying-asset), and delta measures how a derivative maneuvers in response to a price change in the underlying.

Options [greeks](/greeks) measure numerous qualities of options pricing, from how fast the options price changes with respect to the price changes in the underlying asset, called delta, to the rate of decay of the option's time value, called [theta](/theta).

To comprehend variety, it is important to initially figure out gamma, since variety is measuring the way in which gamma will change after some time.

Gamma measures the rate of change in an option's delta for every one-point move in the underlying asset's price. Delta is a first derivative, gamma a second, and variety a third. Variety is an important characteristic to monitor while keeping a [gamma-hedged](/gamma-supporting) portfolio since it assists the trader with measuring the viability of the hedge over the progression of time.

Gamma is additionally utilized while attempting to check the price movement of an option, relative to the amount it is in or out of the money. At the point when the option being measured is deep in or [out of the money](/outofthemoney), gamma is small. At the point when the option is close or at the money, gamma is at its biggest. Gamma is likewise bigger nearer to expiration, and smaller the further away it is from expiration.

All options that are a [long position](/long) have positive gamma, while all [short options](/composing an-option) have negative gamma.

Traders who utilize a gamma-supporting options trading strategy use tone to capture data on the gamma of an option each year. The daily figure can be found by separating the outcome by the number of days in the year.

Variety gives a more solid figure when the option is a long way from expiration. Be that as it may, as expiration moves close, variety turns out to be more unstable, can change intraday, and is less dependable.

Other third order greeks incorporate speed which is the rate of change of gamma concerning the underlying price, ultima, and [zomma](/zomma).

Borrowing from material science, on the off chance that delta is the velocity of options price movement with respect to the underlying, then gamma is the acceleration. Since the third derivative is a bit hard for non-researchers to get a handle on, we can drop these greeks down one level. Presently believe gamma to be the velocity of delta and consequently variety is the acceleration of gamma.

Gamma extends as expiration moves close and variety measures it. Gamma likewise extends as the option draws nearer to [at-the-money](/atthemoney), and variety additionally measures this. Assuming gamma is small on the grounds that the option is a long way from expiration, or in light of the fact that the underlying asset is a long way from the strike price, then variety will mirror this.

## Illustration of Color in Option Trading

Expect that an option has a delta of 0.65. That means that for each $1 move in the stock price, the option's price is expected to move $0.65, all else staying equivalent.

Presently expect that this option has a $10 strike price and the underlying is as of now trading at $11. The stock price is going up and before long reaches $12, placing the stock even more in the money. The delta of the stock is presently 0.90.

An in-the-money option will likewise see its delta increase as the opportunity to expiration moves nearer. Regardless, for every dollar move in the stock, the option is currently moving $0.90. The difference between the old delta and the new is the thing gamma is measuring. Gamma increased by 0.25 [$0.90 - $0.65]. Note however, gamma will begin to diminish the nearer delta gets to one in light of the fact that once delta is at 0.90 it can increase by 0.10, which is not as much as the thing it was expanding before.

Variety is an extension of gamma, measuring the amount it moves over the long run. Variety shows how much gamma is expected to change. The daily amount shows how much the gamma is expected to change every day. A shade of 0.03 means gamma will vacillate roughly 0.03 each day. A perusing of 0.1 means gamma will vacillate 0.1 each day.

As the price approaches expiration, variety is more inclined to quick change and is consequently not as solid.

## Features
- Variety measures the rate at which gamma will change after some time, say one year.
- Variety is important for gamma-supporting as it shows how gamma will change.
- Variety measures gamma, which measures changes in delta, which measures the sensitivity of the price of an option to changes in the underlying asset's price.
- Variety can be changed over completely to a daily amount by partitioning by the number of days in a year.
