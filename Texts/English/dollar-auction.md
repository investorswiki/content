## What Is a Dollar Auction?

Planned by economist Martin Shubik, a dollar auction is a game that represents a paradox of [rational decision theory](/rational-decision theory) which expects that a person will constantly pursue the most consistent choice. In this apparent paradox, individuals will frequently enter an auction for a dollar bill and wind up bidding more than its face value.

## Understanding Dollar Auctions

A dollar action is a simple game, where two participants bid on a dollar bill. The highest bidder gets the bill. Notwithstanding, the loser must pay the amount that they offered also. While bidding in the game starts to approach or go past $1, the players' game objectives change. Rather than augmenting their possible gain, players presently try to limit their likely loss.

A dollar auction begins with an auctioneer accepting the initial bids of two participants. From that point onward, it doesn't appear to be legit for them to stop bidding up the price. For instance, in the event that an auction leads to Participant A bidding 90 pennies, trailed by a $1 bid from Participant B, Participant A can either offer $1.01 and lose 1 penny or drop out of the auction and lose 90 pennies.

Bidding in excess of a dollar for a dollar isn't consistent. Simultaneously, losing 90 pennies isn't so smart as losing 1 penny. In this game, the rational move is place the bid which leaves Participant B experiencing the same thing. All in all, either bid $1.02 and lose 2 pennies or drop out and lose the dollar. In theory, the bidding system could go on in perpetuity provided that the two players stay committed to winning the dollar.

## The Dollar Auction and Game Theory

The dollar auction demonstrates the way that rational behavior can lead to a bothersome outcome. In that sense, it is like the more widely known [prisoner's dilemma](/detainees dilemma), which specifies that rational people probably won't help out one another, even when apparently it would be to their greatest advantage to do as such.

American economist Martin Shubik concocted the dollar auction to uncover the outcomes of what he called the "acceleration of commitment." Shubik, a trailblazer in [game theory](/gametheory), placed that the dollar auction demonstrates the way that individuals can become fixated on losing, even however they realize that they can in any case lose by winning.

In his 1971 article, "The Dollar Auction Game: A Paradox in Noncooperative Behavior and Escalation," Shubik indicated that he especially delighted in seeing the game's dynamics play out in party settings and in front of a large crowd. "When two bids have been acquired from the crowd, the paradox of heightening is real. This simple game is a paradigm for heightening. When joining the challenge, the chances are that the end will be a disaster to both."
