## What Is Cash Flow?
The name says everything: Cash flow refers to the movement of cash into and out of a company. **Inflows** refer to the money that is going into a business, while **outflows** describe the money leaving a business. When inflows exceed outflows, a business is considered healthy.
Cash flow, along with other quantitative metrics like debt-to-equity and [P/E ratios](/price-earningsratio), make up an important part of fundamental analysis, which is a process investors use to value companies. Positive cash flow means that a company's [liquidity](/liquidity) — which measures how easily a company's assets can be converted to cash — is developing. Liquidity is an integral component of a company's cash flow because it is the sum of the tangible assets that a company needs to run its operations, pay its wages and debts, etc.
## Cash Flow Example
Let's say you own a shoe store. Your assets would include items like your shoes and the building your store is located in. Your total revenues (i.e., your cash inflows) would be your shoe sales. Your outflows would be what you pay your employees, your operating expenses (like inventories, rent, and utilities), and what you owe your creditors.
## What Are the Three Types of Cash Flows?
There are three types of cash flow for a business:
1. **Operational Cash Flow (OCF)** measures the short-term financial health of a business. It's the total amount of cash that a business produces from daily operations. You can calculate this by utilizing net income, which is cash inflows from accounts receivable subtracted from expenses from accounts payable.
1. **Cash Flow From Financing Activities (CFF)** measures the cash flow between a company and its owners or creditors — people who provide long-term funds to a business. These items include the repayment of debt or loans, the sale of stocks or stock repurchases, bond issuance, and dividend payments.
1. **Cash Flow From Investing Activities (CFI)** is the total of a company's long-term investment gains or losses plus the purchase or sale of fixed assets. These can include a company vehicle, equipment, a building, etc. Cash flow from investing activities is calculated by simply adding up money received from the sales of securities and long-term assets subtracted from the cost of purchasing the assets.

## Will Cash Flow Be Negative?
Yes. Assuming that a company has a negative cash flow, that means it can't cover its liabilities, thus it must borrow against the value of its assets to meet its expenses. Startups are one type of company where negative cash flow is considered acceptable. Mature companies may likewise experience negative cash flow when they make [dividend](/dividend) payments or stock repurchases.
Yet, left unchecked, negative cash flow can tear apart the very fabric of a business. For example, when negative cash flow results in a company's failure to make payments on a loan, that makes the company less attractive for future capital investment. What's more, its stock is considered to have higher interest rate risk.
When a business is running low on cash, it could experience a **cash crunch**, which affects daily operations. To overcome this, the business would need to secure emergency financing or raise cash, perhaps by inquiring as to whether they can pay up front instead of on credit. Assuming that insolvency persists, the business might need to lay off workers. Assuming the worst, the company could even need to declare **bankruptcy**, and that means it must cease operations, leave business, and sell off its assets to pay its debts.
It's dependably advisable for a business to pay close attention to its cash flow as well as hold a percentage of its assets in reserves — in case the unthinkable ever happens.
## Are Cash Flow and Profit the Same?
Cash flow and profit are not the same concepts. Profit's left over after expenses, while cash flow is the net flow of cash into and out of a business. Some say that cash flow is even more important than profit because positive cash flow gives a business more opportunities to develop. Here, the maxim "cash is top dog" is apt — the more cash a business has, the more liquid it is, and the easier it will be to secure financing, draw in investors, etc.
