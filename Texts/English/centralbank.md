Central banks exist in many countries around the world. They utilize different methods to deal with their nations' monetary systems alongside commercial banks.

A few common methods incorporate setting reserve requirements, adjusting banking interest rates, and coordinating open market operations.
## Financial reserves
Reserves are essential as part of the fractional reserve banking system that most financial institutions use internationally. The central bank is responsible for setting the base reserve requirement for commercial banks, implying that these banks must hold a small percentage of the money stored by their customers in their accounts, while as yet having the option to make loans with the remainder of the money.

## Interest rates
Central banks set the rates of interest charged to member banks when they advance credit through short-term loans. The member banks are responsible for offering loans to businesses and consumers for mortgages, vehicles, business expansion, equipment, and other large purchases. They additionally sell bonds at set interest rates. The central bank's interest rate is intended to direct commercial banks in their lending activities. At the point when the interest rate is low, banks are bound to loan more money. Be that as it may, when the central bank raises the rates, member banks fix their lending rehearses.
## Open Market Operations
Member banks sell and buy securities from the central bank (e.g., government bonds and mortgage-backed securities). At the point when a central bank buys securities from its member banks, it gives the commercial banks more cash to loan to their consumers. In recent economic emergencies, central banks have involved this method in endeavors to help in economic recovery through quantitative easing (QE). In short, QE strategies "made" new money by adding currency to a bank's financial reserves through credit.
