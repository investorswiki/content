## What Is a Distribution Channel?

A distribution channel is a chain of organizations or intermediaries through which a decent or service passes until it arrives at the last buyer or the end consumer. Distribution channels can incorporate [wholesalers](/wholesaling), retailers, merchants, and even the internet.

Distribution channels are part of the downstream cycle, responding to the inquiry "How would we get our product to the consumer?" This is as opposed to the upstream interaction, otherwise called the supply chain, which addresses the inquiry "Who are our providers?"

## Understanding Distribution Channels

A distribution channel is a path by which all goods and services must head out to show up at the expected consumer. Alternately, it additionally portrays the pathway payments make from the end consumer to the original vendor. Distribution channels can be short or long, and rely upon the number of intermediaries required to deliver a product or service.

Goods and services sometimes advance toward consumers through different channels — a combination of short and long. Expanding the number of ways a consumer can find a decent can increase sales. In any case, it can likewise make a complex system that sometimes makes [distribution management](/distribution-management) troublesome. Longer distribution channels can likewise mean less profit every intermediary charges a manufacturer for its service.

## Direct and Indirect Channels

Channels are broken into two unique structures — direct and indirect. A direct channel permits the consumer to make purchases from the manufacturer while an indirect channel permits the consumer to buy the goods from a wholesaler or retailer. Indirect channels are regular for goods that are sold in traditional brick-and-mortar stores.

Generally, in the event that there are more intermediaries engaged with the distribution channel, the price for a decent may increase. On the other hand, a direct or short channel might mean lower costs for consumers since they are buying directly from the manufacturer.

## Types of Distribution Channels

While a distribution channel might appear to be unending on occasion, there are three primary types of channels, all of which incorporate the combination of a producer, wholesaler, retailer, and end consumer.

The main channel is the longest in light of the fact that it incorporates each of the four: producer, wholesaler, retailer, and consumer. The wine and grown-up drink industry is a perfect illustration of this long distribution channel. In this industry — because of laws conceived out of disallowance — a winery can't sell directly to a retailer. It works in the three-level system, meaning the law requires the winery to initially sell its product to a [wholesaler](/wholesale-exchange) who then sells to a retailer. The retailer then sells the product to the end consumer.

The subsequent channel cuts out the wholesaler — where the producer sells directly to a the retailer product to the end consumer. This means the subsequent channel contains just a single intermediary. Dell, for instance, is adequately large to sell its products directly to reputable retailers like Best Buy.

The third and last channel is a direct-to-consumer model where the producer sells its product directly to the end consumer. Amazon, which uses its own platform to sell Kindles to its customers, is an illustration of a direct model. This is the shortest distribution channel conceivable, cutting out both the wholesaler and the retailer.

## Picking the Right Distribution Channel

Not all distribution channels work for all products, so companies must pick the right one. The channel ought to line up with the company's overall mission and strategic vision including its sales objectives.

The method of distribution ought to increase the value of the consumer. Would consumers like to address a salesperson? Will they need to handle the product before they make a purchase? Or on the other hand would they like to purchase it online without any problems? Responding to these inquiries can assist companies with determining which channel they pick.

Also, the company ought to consider how rapidly it needs its product(s) to arrive at the buyer. Certain products are best served by a direct distribution channel like meat or produce, while others might benefit from an indirect channel.

In the event that a company picks different distribution channels, for example, selling products online and through a retailer, the channels shouldn't conflict with each other. Companies ought to plan so one channel doesn't overwhelm the other.
