# Intermodal Freight
## What Is Intermodal Freight?

Intermodal freight comprises of products and raw materials that are shipped in a compartment by different vehicles, for example, holder ships, semi-18 wheelers, and trains. Compartments intended for intermodal freight frequently comply with [International Organization for Standardization](/international-organization-for-standardization-iso) (ISO) aspect rules, which permit the freight to stay in a similar holder when moved between modes of transportation as opposed to being moved into another compartment of an alternate size.

## Figuring out Intermodal Freight

The development of normalized transporting holders has permitted products and [raw materials](/rawmaterials) to travel quicker and at a decreased cost. The United States military is frequently credited with the containerization of transportation during the 1950s when the Department of Defense's standards were adopted by the ISO.

Intermodal transportation ought not be mistaken for multimodal transportation. Multimodal transportation is directed under a single contract, while intermodal transportation is led by numerous contracts with various carriers. Furthermore, multimodal utilizes various modes of transport, yet under one [bill of lading](/billoflading), and a similar carrier is responsible for moving shipments in the modes as a whole.

## Benefits and Disadvantages of Intermodal Freight
### Benefits

Organizations use intermodal freight transporting both domestically and internationally on the grounds that it decreases the amount of dealing with performed with the cargo during the trip and can diminish costs. Intermodal freight transportation is likewise a safe and secure method since it wipes out the treatment of the freight itself during transportation, which diminishes damage and loss, drivers can handle more loads in a more limited period, and extra security is given at terminals, rail tracks, and slopes, which forestalls theft.

Intermodal transportation is eco-accommodating. Rail transportation is more efficient. As per Inbound Logistics, rail can move one ton of freight just about 450 miles on one gallon of fuel. This fuel effectiveness makes less ozone harming substance and carbon pollution as goods are sent from one coast to another.

### Drawbacks

Intermodal freight transportation requires a substantial outlay in [infrastructure](/infrastructure) costs. Substantial cranes are important to lift holders at various ports while changing the mode of transport. For instance, when a holder shows up at a seaport, it must be moved to a flatbed, rail, or truck. Furthermore, investments in rail and road access are required. Seaports need rail and road access so rail lines and trucks can move goods to and from the port.

## The Intermodal Shipping Process

A normal [import](/import) transporting process involves that in the wake of showing up from overseas, containerized cargo is moved from a holder port to a rail yard for domestic shipment. The [cargo](/cfr) is moved onto the rail and is shipped to the next area, which could be many miles inland. When the cargo shows up at its objective, it is put on a truck to be driven to its last objective directed by the original order.

## Growth in Intermodal Freight

As indicated by Freightquote.com, there are roughly 25 million compartments moved every year by intermodal transporting. A market research report by Technavio predicts that intermodal freight transportation will develop at a [compound annual growth rate](/cagr) (CAGR) of roughly 7% from 2020 to 2024, developing by $49.8 billion in that time period. The report refers to cost benefits for transporters as the justification for its expected growth. Furthermore, the cost of the road as a single mode of transportation is expanding. In any case, multimodal transportation, where convenience is a huge element in light of the fact that a single company is responsible for the movement of cargo across all modes, is expected to obstruct the growth of the intermodal freight transportation market from now on.

## Features
- One drawback to intermodal freight is that it requires a huge outlay of infrastructure costs to operate.
- Intermodal freight is unique in relation to multimodal transportation, which is directed under a single contract, while intermodal transportation is led by various contracts with various carriers.
- Intermodal freight diminishes the amount of dealing with on cargo during a trip and lessens costs and is likewise more eco-accommodating.
- The International Organization for Standardization (ISO) sets out the standards required for the holders utilized in intermodal freight.
- Intermodal freight comprises of products and raw materials that are shipped by compartment by different vehicles.
- The utilization of intermodal freight is expected to fill in the next couple of years due to the cost benefits for transporters.
