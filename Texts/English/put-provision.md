# Put Provision
## What is Put Provision?

A put provision allows a bondholder to exchange a [bond](/bond) back to the issuer at [par](/parvalue), or face value, after a predefined period however prior to the bond's [maturity date](/maturitydate).

## Figuring out Put Provision

Basically, a put provision is to the bondholder what a [call provision](/callprovision) is to the bond issuer. At the point when a bond is purchased, the [issuer](/issuer) will determine dates at which the bondholder might decide to exercise the put provision and recover their bond rashly to receive the [principal](/principal) amount. A put provision will generally determine various dates when the bond might be reclaimed before the maturity date. Various dates give the bondholder the ability to reevaluate their investment like clockwork, in the event, they wish to recover for reinvestment.

Practicing the put provision will mean that the bondholder doesn't receive the full anticipated return, or [yield-to-maturity](/yieldtomaturity) (YTM) of the investment. Nonetheless, it offers protection to the [bondholder](/bondholder) from experiencing unwanted losses on their investment. For instance, If the bond's value declines due to rising [interest rates](/interestrate), or the disintegration of the issuer's credit rating, a put provision will safeguard the bondholder from the potential losses radiating from these events. This protection is due to the foundation of a floor price for the bond, which is its principal value.

In any case, assuming the bondholder purchased the bond when interest rates were high, and interest rates have since dropped, it's improbable that the bondholder would need to exercise the put provision since their [fixed-income investment](/fixed-incomesecurity) is as yet earning a similar higher rate of return. If they somehow happened to recover the bond and reinvest into one more fixed-income security, they would, in all likelihood, have a lower [yield](/yield), due to the lower accessible interest rates. Likewise, the investor might like to keep getting the bond's payment [coupons](/couponbond) for just gathering the one-time principal payment by reclaiming.

## Practicing a Put Provision

An investor will probably exercise the put provision in a bond assuming they have motivation to accept that the bond's issuer will default on payment when the bond comes to maturity. An investor can look to [rating agencies](/bond-rating-agencies) such as[ Moody's](/moodys) and [Standard and Poor's](/sp) (S&P) to get an assessment of the bond issuer's default probability. Nonetheless, it's worth noticing that many bonds with put provisions are guaranteed by outsiders, like banks. Subsequently, in the event that an issuer can't make its payments on reclaimed bonds, the bondholder can in any case be guaranteed payment by the outsider.

Put provisions safeguard the bondholder from [reinvestment risk](/reinvestmentrisk). Say interest rates rise and the bondholder associates that an alternate type with investment could eventually be more lucrative than the one they currently own. They could exercise the put provision and reclaim this bond to reinvest in the other instrument. For instance, a bondholder might purchase a bond when interest rates are at 3.25%. In any case, on the off chance that interest rates rise to 4.75%, they might begin to consider their bond's rate of 3.25% unfortunately low and need to recover it, in order to reinvest it at the current higher interest rate.
