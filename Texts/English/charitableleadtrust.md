# Charitable Lead Trust
## What is a Charitable Lead Trust

A charitable lead trust is a type of [irrevocable](/irrevocabletrust) trust intended to reduce a beneficiary's potential tax liability, upon inheritance.

## Breaking Down Charitable Lead Trust

A charitable lead trust resolves by giving payments of the trust to charity, temporarily. After that period lapses, the balance of the trust is then paid out to the [beneficiary](/beneficiary). While this reduces the taxes owed by the beneficiary, when they acquire the leftover balance, it likewise gives them other potential tax benefits, such an income tax deduction for charitable donations, and savings on estate and gift taxes. Furthermore, it sets up a continuous way for the beneficiary and benefactor to make charitable contributions, without having to issue regularly scheduled payments physically.

These forms of trusts are generally set up during the course of estate planning, or during the composition of a will, when benefactors wish to reduce the possibles troubles beneficiaries would regularly cause by accepting their inheritance. These trusts, which cost around $1,000 to set up, can be prepared by any attorney acquainted with [estate planning](/estateplanning).

## What is a Charitable Remainder Trust

A [charitable remainder trust](/charitableremaindertrust) is believed to be something contrary to a charitable lead trust. Rather than just making regularly scheduled payments to a charity, the trust can make regularly scheduled payments to the beneficiary, and in certain occasions, to the benefactor, too. This amount must be set at least 5% and something like half of the balance of the trust.

Dissimilar to certain trusts, a beneficiary or benefactor can keep making payments into the trust as time walks on. The benefactor might be eligible to take a deduction for the foundation of the trust. It tends to be funded with different assets like cash, publicly-exchanged securities, qualifying stocks, and real estate.

Like the charitable lead trust, the charitable remainder trust allows beneficiaries to exploit the donations that they are making. The maximum term permitted on this type of trust is 20 years, which successfully means that after the 20-year period has ended, the trust must pay out the balance to the charitable beneficiary, which may either be a public charity or a private foundation.

With a charitable remainder trust, these causes and foundations can be changed after some time, not at all like a charitable lead trust, which must stick to the gatherings that were initially written into the language of the trust at its initial signing.

**[Important: Charitable lead trusts might be structured to be "reversionary," where remaining assets return to the individual who made the trust, or they might be "non-reversionary," where remaining assets funnel to a beneficiary other than the originator.]**
