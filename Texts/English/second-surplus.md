## What Is a Second Surplus?

A second surplus portrays a [reinsurance](/reinsurance) treaty that gives coverage over that of a first surplus reinsurance treaty. Insurers go into surplus reinsurance arrangements to transfer their very own portion risk or liability to another party.

## How a Second Surplus Works

Second surplus reinsurance, otherwise called follow-on reinsurance, applies to any risks that the ceding insurer doesn't keep for its own account and that surpass the capacity of the main surplus treaty. The ceding insurer frequently requires a second surplus treaty on the off chance that it can't secure a reinsurance treaty that covers sufficient risk to guarantee its own solvency.

At the point when an insurer goes into a reinsurance treaty, it holds liabilities up to a specific amount, which is called a line. Any excess liability goes to the reinsurer, which participates only in risks any above what the insurer holds. The total amount of risk that the reinsurance treaty covers, called the capacity, is regularly communicated in terms of a different of the insurer's lines.

The [reinsurer](/reinsurer) doesn't participate in all risks assumed by the ceding company. All things being equal, it only accepts the risks above what the insurer holds, making this type of reinsurance not quite the same as [quota share reinsurance](/quota-share-treaty).

By ceding its very own portion risk to a reinsurer, the insurance company guarantees its own [solvency](/solvency) since it conveys less risk of making large payouts to policyholders. These surplus settlements normally have sufficient capacity to cover numerous lines, however now and again, they can't cover the whole amount required by the ceding company. In this event, the ceding insurer either needs to cover the leftover amount itself or go into a second reinsurance treaty. This second reinsurance treaty is alluded to as the second surplus treaty.

## Illustration of a Second Surplus

Suppose a life insurance company is hoping to reduce its liability through a reinsurance treaty. It has $20 million in obligations from the numerous policies that it has [underwritten](/insurance-guarantor) yet only needs to hold $2 million of that risk. The surplus is the difference between the total liability and the retained risk, or $18 million.

Each line of retention is set at $1 million. The life insurance company goes into a first surplus reinsurance treaty with a reinsurer. The reinsurer faces the risk challenges eight lines, covering $8 million. Be that as it may, with this $8 million in reinsurance and the $2 million retained, the ceding company actually must find a reinsurer for its excess $10 million of risk.

The ceding company then searches out another reinsurer briefly surplus reinsurance treaty to cover the excess $10 million of risk. On the other hand, it could find a reinsurer to cover only part of that $10 million, and one more third treaty to cover the leftover amount to be covered.
