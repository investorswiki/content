## Reactions of Bond Indexes

A few potential problems are inherent in bond indexes. Most bond indexes are market-weighted, meaning their basis is on the market value of the bonds. So companies with more debt have a higher allocation in a corporate bond index.

It may not be beneficial to hold even more an organization's debt as it gets more. Additionally, many bonds don't often trade so they have wide [spreads](/spread). Wide spreads make it hard to price these bonds since they might not have traded in weeks. Some method to compute the price would create an estimate, which may not be close to the real price of the next trade. To wipe out this problem, a bond index might be structured to incorporate just more liquid, or generally liquid bond, issues with tight spreads that have continuous trades.

Nonetheless, assuming the index comprises of too couple of bonds, it can make another problem. Traders might have the option to front-run a more modest index by guessing which bonds a bond fund would buy and sell. This front-running could enable the traders to create okay profit to the detriment of the fund buyers and sellers. The solution is to incorporate a more critical number of bonds (this is true for some indexes). Likewise, most bond indexes do exclude more modest bond issues to limit the problems associated with a lack of liquidity.

Another issue is the point at which a bond comes to [maturity](/maturity), it stops existing. Along these lines, there is a natural turnover incorporated into each bond index. Nonetheless, the attributes of the bonds added may contrast from the qualities of those eliminated from the index. Subsequently, essential highlights of a bond index, like the average maturity of bonds in the index, can change consistently.
