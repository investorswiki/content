Forex is short for foreign exchange. Transactions in the forex market are consistently between a pair of two unique currencies.

A forex broker may likewise referred to be as a retail forex broker or a currency trading broker.

Any individual forex broker firm will handle just a small portion of the volume of the overall foreign exchange market.

## The Role of a Forex Broker

Most foreign exchange transactions are between pairs of the currencies of the 10 nations that make up the G10. The nations and their currencies incorporate the U.S. dollar (USD), the Euro (EUR), the pound sterling (GBP), the Japanese yen (JPY), the Australian dollar (AUD), the New Zealand dollar (NZD), the Canadian dollar (CAD), and the Swiss franc (CHF).

Most brokers permit customers to trade in different currencies, including those of emerging markets.

Utilizing a forex broker, a trader opens a trade by buying a currency pair and closes the trade by selling a similar pair. For instance, a trader who needs to exchange euros for U.S. dollars purchases the EUR/USD pair. This amounts to buying euros utilizing U.S. dollars.

To close the trade, the trader sells the pair, which is equivalent to buying U.S. dollars with euros.

On the off chance that the exchange rate is higher when the trader closes the trade, the trader creates a gain. On the off chance that not, the trader assumes a loss.

At the point when a retail client opens a position at the ask price and later closes it at the bid price, the forex broker will collect that spread amount.

Also, a few brokers charge extra fees. Some charge a fee for each transaction or a month to month fee for access to a specific software interface or fees for access to special trading products like exotic options.
