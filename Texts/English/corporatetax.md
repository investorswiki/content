# Corporate Tax
## What Is Corporate Tax?

A corporate tax is a tax on the profits of a corporation. The taxes are paid on a company's taxable income, which incorporates revenue minus [cost of goods sold](/cogs) (COGS), [general and administrative (G&A) expenses](/general-and-administrative-expenses), selling and marketing, research and development, depreciation, and other working costs.

Corporate tax rates fluctuate widely by country, for certain countries viewed as [tax havens](/taxhaven) due to their low rates. Corporate taxes can be lowered by different [deductions](/deduction), government [subsidies](/endowment), and tax [loopholes](/proviso), thus the [effective corporate tax rate](/effectivetaxrate), the rate a corporation actually pays, is typically lower than the statutory rate; the stated rate before any deductions.

## Figuring out Corporate Tax

The federal corporate tax rate in the United States is currently a flat 21%, because of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA), which President Donald Trump endorsed into law in 2017 and which came full circle in 2018. Beforehand, the maximum U.S. corporate income tax rate was 35%.

U.S. corporate tax returns are generally due by the fifteenth day of the fourth month following the finish of the corporation's tax year. Corporations might request a six-month extension to file their corporate [tax returns](/taxreturn) in September. Installment payment due dates for estimated tax returns happen in April, June, September, and December. Corporate taxes are reported on Form 1120 for U.S. corporations. In the event that a corporation has more than $10 million in assets, it must file online.

## Corporate Tax Deductions

[Corporations](/corporation) are permitted to reduce taxable income by certain vital and ordinary [business expenditures](/businessexpenses). All current expenses required for the operation of the business are completely [tax-deductible](/tax-deduction). Investments and real estate purchased with the intent of creating income for the business are likewise deductible.

A corporation can deduct employee salaries, medical advantages, tuition reimbursement, and bonuses. Moreover, a corporation can reduce its taxable income by deducting [insurance premiums](/insurance-premium), travel expenses, terrible obligations, interest payments, sales taxes, fuel taxes, and excise taxes. Tax readiness fees, legal services, bookkeeping, and advertising costs can likewise be utilized to reduce business income.

## Special Considerations

A central issue connecting with corporate taxation is the concept of [double taxation](/double_taxation). Certain corporations are taxed on the taxable income of the company. Assuming this net income is distributed to [shareholders](/shareholder), these individuals are forced to pay individual income taxes on the dividends received. All things considered, a business might register as a [S corporation](/subchapters) and have all income pass-through to the business owners. A S corporation doesn't pay corporate tax as all taxes are paid through individual tax returns.

## Benefits of a Corporate Tax

Paying corporate taxes can be more beneficial for business owners than paying extra individual income tax. Corporate tax returns deduct medical insurance for families as well as fringe benefits, including [retirement plans](/retirement-planning) and [tax-deferred](/taxdeferred) trusts. It is more straightforward for a corporation to deduct losses, too.

A corporation might deduct the whole amount of losses while a [sole proprietor](/soleproprietorship) must give evidence in regards to the intent to earn a profit before the losses can be deducted. At long last, profit earned by a corporation might be left inside the corporation, allowing for tax planning and potential future tax benefits.
