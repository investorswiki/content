# Poisson Distribution
## What Is a Poisson Distribution?

In [statistics](/statistics), a Poisson distribution is a [probability distribution](/probabilitydistribution) that is utilized to show how frequently an event is probably going to happen over a predefined period. All in all, it is a count distribution. Poisson distributions are frequently used to comprehend independent events that happen at a consistent rate inside a given interval of time. It was named after French mathematician Sim\u00e9on Denis Poisson.

The Poisson distribution is a discrete function, meaning that the variable can take specific values in a (possibly limitless) list. Put in an unexpected way, the variable can't take all values in any continuous reach. For the Poisson distribution, the variable can take whole number values (0, 1, 2, 3, and so on), without any parts or decimals.

## Grasping Poisson Distributions

A Poisson distribution can be utilized to estimate how likely it is that something will work out "X" number of times. For instance, if the average number of individuals who buy cheeseburgers from a cheap food chain on a Friday night at a single restaurant location is 200, a Poisson distribution can respond to questions, for example, "What is the likelihood that in excess of 300 individuals will buy burgers?" The application of the Poisson distribution in this way empowers managers to present optimal planning systems that wouldn't work with, say, a [normal distribution](/normaldistribution).

One of the most well known historical, down to earth utilizations of the Poisson distribution was assessing the annual number of Prussian rangers soldiers killed due to horse-kicks. Modern models incorporate assessing the number of vehicle crashes in a city of a given size; in physiology, this distribution is frequently used to compute the probabilistic frequencies of various types of synapse emissions. Or on the other hand, assuming a video store averaged 400 customers every Friday night, what might have been the likelihood that 600 customers could come in on some random Friday night?

## The Formula for the Poisson Distribution Is

Where:

- **e** is Euler's number (**e** = 2.71828...)
- **x** is the number of events
- **x**! is the factorial of **x**
- \u03bb is equivalent to the [expected value](/expected-value) (EV) of **x** when that is likewise equivalent to its [variance](/variance)

Given data that follows a Poisson distribution, it shows up graphically as:

In the model portrayed in the graph above, expect that some operational cycle has a blunder rate of 3%. On the off chance that we further expect 100 random trials, the Poisson distribution depicts the probability of getting a certain number of errors over some period of time, like a single day.

## The Poisson Distribution in Finance

The Poisson distribution is likewise ordinarily used to model financial count data where the count is small and is many times zero. As one model in finance, it tends to be utilized to model the number of trades that a commonplace investor will make in a given day, which can be 0 (frequently), or 1, or 2, and so forth.

As another model, this model can be utilized to foresee the number of "shocks" to the market that will happen in a given time span, say, north of a decade.

## Features
- A Poisson distribution, named after French mathematician Sim\u00e9on Denis Poisson, can be utilized to estimate how frequently an event is probably going to happen inside "X" periods of time.
- Poisson distributions are utilized when the variable of interest is a discrete count variable.
- Numerous economic and financial data show up as count variables, for example, how often a person becomes jobless in a given year, hence lending themselves to analysis with a Poisson distribution.
## FAQ
### When Should the Poisson Distribution Be Used?
The Poisson distribution is best applied to statistical analysis when the variable being referred to is a count variable. For example, how frequently X happens in view of at least one logical variables. For example, to estimate the number of defective products that will fall off an assembly line given various inputs.
### What Assumptions Does the Poisson Distribution Make?
For the Poisson distribution to be accurate, all events are independent of one another, the rate of events through time is steady, and events can't happen all the while. Also, the mean and the variance will be equivalent to each other.
### Is the Poisson Distribution Discrete or Continuous?
Since it measures discrete counts, the Poisson distribution is likewise a [discrete distribution](/discrete-distribution). This can be stood out from the normal distribution, which is continuous.
