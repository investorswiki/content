# the Beneish Model
## What Is the Beneish Model?

The Beneish model is a mathematical model that utilizes financial ratios and eight factors to distinguish whether a company has controlled its earnings. It is utilized as a device to uncover [financial fraud](/fraud).

The factors are built from the data in the company's [financial statements](/financial-statements), and once calculated, make a M-Score to portray the degree to which the [earnings](/earnings) have been controlled.

## Who Created the Model?

Teacher M. Daniel Beneish of the Kelley School of Business at Indiana University made the model. While he had been working on the model for a really long time, Beneish's paper, "The Detection of Earnings Manipulation" was distributed in 1999.

Teacher Beneish has written a number of follow-up studies and extensions since first distributing the model. Beneish's website page at the business school has a M-Score calculator.

## Understanding the Beneish Model

The fundamental theory that Beneish puts together the ratio with respect to is that companies might be bound to control their profits assuming they show crumbling gross margins, operating expenses, and leverage both rising, alongside critical sales growth. These factors might cause profit manipulation through different means.

The Beneish model's eight factors are:

1. DSRI: Days' sales in a receivable index

2. GMI: [Gross margin](/grossmargin) index

3. AQI: Asset quality index

4. SGI: Sales growth index

5. DEPI: [Depreciation](/depreciation) index

6. SGAI: Sales and [general and administrative expenses](/general-and-administrative-expenses) index

7. LVGI: [Leverage](/leverage) index

8. Goodbye: Total [accruals](/accruals) to total assets

When these eight factors are calculated, they are then combined to accomplish a M-Score for the company. A M-Score of not exactly - 1.78 recommends that the company won't be a controller. A M-Score of greater than - 1.78 signs that the company is probably going to be a controller.

## Real World Examples of the Beneish Model's Application

In 1998, a group of Cornell University business understudies utilized the Beneish model to foresee that Enron Corporation was controlling their earnings.

At that point, Enron stock was trading at just about half ($48 per share) of the price to which it in the long run climbed ($90) before its sensational fall into ruin and bankruptcy a couple of years after the fact in 2001. At the time the Cornell understudies sounded the alert, nobody on Wall Street noticed their recommendation.

Numerous professional investment firms and investors utilize the model as part of the assessment cycle for the companies they track, and factor in a company's Beneish M-Score while concluding which companies in which they will invest.
