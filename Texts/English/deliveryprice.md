## What Is the Delivery Price?

The delivery price is the price at which one party consents to deliver the underlying [commodity](/commodity) and at which the counter-party consents to acknowledge delivery. The delivery price is defined in a futures contract traded on a registered exchange or in an over-the-counter forward agreement. The delivery price is set in advance in the contract. It is agreed on the day the futures or forward contract is placed, not on the day in the future when the commodity is really delivered. Delivery price can likewise allude to a stock's selling price in [options contracts](/optionscontract).

## Delivery Price Explained

In forward contracts, the [forward price](/forwardprice) and the delivery price are indistinguishable when the contract starts, yet over the long haul, the forward price will change and the delivery price will stay consistent. Additionally, underlying assets commonly are not really delivered, yet rather closed out with offsetting contracts. Another possibility is that a delivery instrument addressing the underlying asset, for example, a warehouse receipt, will be moved rather than the genuine commodity. On the off chance that the commodity is truly delivered, the cost of delivery will influence the contract's delivery price.

The concept of the delivery price is an important one since it is set on the day the contract is placed and doesn't vary however long the contract would last. Other prices, for example, the [cash price](/cashprice) (or spot price) of the commodity or the price to enter or exit another futures or forward contract do change. Futures contracts are normalized instruments whose gains or losses are set apart to-advertise daily. Prices are adjusted toward the finish of each trading day in view of the settlement price. The delivery price, be that as it may, stays unchanged in light of the fact that it is written into the contract when the contract starts.
