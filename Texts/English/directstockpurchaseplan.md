# Direct Stock Purchase Plan (DSPP)
## What Is a Direct Stock Purchase Plan (DSPP)?

A direct stock purchase plan (DSPP) is a program that enables individual investors to purchase a company's stock directly from that company without the mediation of a [broker](/broker). A few companies that offer DSPPs make the arrangements directly available to retail investors, while others use [transfer agents](/transferagent) or other third-party administrators to handle these transactions. Such plans offer low fees and sometimes the ability to purchase shares at a discount.

Not all companies offer DSPPs, and such plans might accompany certain limitations about when an individual might purchase shares. DSPPs have lost a portion of their appeal throughout recent a very long time as investing through online brokers has become more affordable and more helpful, however DSPPs actually offer an advantage for the long-term investor who doesn't have a lot of money to get everything rolling.

## How a Direct Stock Purchase Plan (DSPP) Works

A DSPP allows individual investors to lay out an account in which to put aside installments to purchase shares directly from a given company. The investor sets aside a regularly scheduled payment (for the most part by ACH) and the company applies that amount toward purchasing shares. Each month, the plan purchases new shares of company stock (or fractions of shares) in light of the money available from deposits or [dividend](/dividend) payouts, if any.

This mechanism makes it simple and automatic to gather shares from a given company slowly. Since these plans frequently have extremely low fees (and sometimes no fees), it makes DSPPs a cheap way for first-time investors to enter the financial markets. The base deposits for participating can go from just $100 to $500.

Maybe the most common means of direct investment is dividend [reinvestment](/reinvestment), which is the act of involving one's dividends to buy more shares in a similar company. For companies that pay dividends, you can set up a DSPP to purchase the shares automatically and afterward reinvest any income payments through an optional [dividend reinvestment plan](/dividendreinvestmentplan) (DRIP). DRIPs allow investors to reinvest their cash dividends into extra shares or fractional shares of the underlying stock on the dividend payment date.

Nonetheless, as online investing has become less expensive after some time, a portion of the original positive factors of DSPPs have blurred.

For instance, a frequently refered to advantage of DSPPs is that shareholders don't have to keep up with physical certificates as proof of purchase — a specialist registers DSPP transactions directly onto the company's books.
