# Exempt Commodity
## What Is an Exempt Commodity?

An exempt commodity is any exchange traded [commodity](/commodity) that isn't a [excluded commodity](/excluded_commodity) or an agricultural commodity, like energy and metal commodities. Transactions in an exempt commodity may just happen between [eligible contract participants](/eligible_contract_participant) or commercial elements.

"Exempt commodity" fills in as a residual term for any of the commodities not determined in the [Commodity Exchange Act](/cea) (CEA). These commodities are exempt from the rules illustrated in the CEA; nonetheless, these transactions are as yet subject to the forbiddances against [fraud](/fraud) and price manipulation.

## Grasping an Exempt Commodity

The Commodities Exchange Act (CEA) controls the trading of commodity [futures](/futurescontract) in the United States. The CEA, for example, lays out the statutory structure under which the [Commodity Futures Trading Commission](/cftc) (CFTC) operates. The CEA likewise lays out classifications for various types of futures contracts.

Futures contracts are legal agreements to one or the other buy or sell a specific commodity or financial security at a set price at a specific time from here on out. They are basically utilized as a means to hedge [price risk](/pricerisk). Futures contracts are [derivatives](/derivative) with the underlying asset being a commodity, like wheat, corn, oil, or a financial part, for example, an interest rate.

Exempt commodities are those that are neither agricultural commodities, like animals, wheat, or other grain, or excluded commodities, for example, financial futures contracts, as [interest rate futures](/interestratefuture). Instances of exempt commodities incorporate energy commodities, for example, [crude oil](/crude-oil), natural gas, synthetic substances, and metals, like gold and silver. Carbon emissions allowances and [weather derivatives](/weatherderivative) are likewise viewed as exempt.

Exempt commodities are viewed as exempt since they don't naturally fall under specific rules and rules that direct agricultural commodities like rules of standardization, quality control, physical storage, and transport. Simultaneously, they don't fit the shape of excluded commodities, for example, financial instrument futures, which lack cash markets for the [underlying](/underlying-asset) assets.

## Excluded Commodities versus Exempt Commodities

The exempt commodity classification was made to stand separated from an excluded commodity. An excluded commodity doesn't fall under the regulation of the CEA and is one that doesn't have its own [intrinsic value](/intrinsicvalue) outside of the underlying asset that it is tied to, and can't be traded on an exchange. These are commodities that are not defenseless to measures of influence or manipulation since they are not finite like physical commodities, like oil and grain.

Excluded commodities incorporate most financial products and any applicable event associated with the commodity that is outside the control of any interested party. Excluded commodities are made for assets that have no [cash market](/cashmarket). At the point when an investor trades interest or exchange rate futures, currency contracts, or security indexes, that person is trading excluded commodities.

## Trading Exempt Commodities

Exempt commodities might be traded on electronic exchange platforms. Exempt commercial markets are electronic trading facilities that trade exempt commodities on a head to-head basis exclusively between persons that are [eligible commercial entities](/eligible_commercial_entity) or eligible contract participants.

An eligible commercial entity is a market participant approved by the CFTC that has a verifiable ability to make or take delivery of an underlying commodity of a contract; causes risks connected with the commodity; or is a dealer that consistently gives risk management, hedging services, or [market-making](/marketmaker) activities to elements trading commodities or derivative agreements, contracts, or transactions in commodities.

However many companies and people buy or sell futures contracts with taking or giving delivery and profiting from the price hedge, numerous investors or traders hypothetically trade futures contracts for of seeking profit.

These traders are not interested in the asset yet rather the price developments of the asset to capture profits. These trades should be left from before the contracts terminate to try not to make or getting delivery.
