# Recapture Provision

A recapture provision is a provision in a reinsurance treaty that allows the ceding party to reclaim some or all of the risk initially ceded to the reinsurer. Recapture provisions frame the conditions in which a recapture can happen.

## Breaking Down Recapture Provision

At the point when an insurance company [underwrites](/underwriting) another policy, it consents to [indemnify](/indemnity_insurance) the policyholder in exchange for a premium. This indemnification is a liability, and the insurer is responsible for covering losses of claims documented. There are regulatory and financial limits on the amount of risk to which an insurer can uncover itself. With each new policy written, the insurer decreases its ability to expect new risks. To diminish or spread the inherent risk, an insurer might go into a reinsurance treaty. The reinsurance treaty will contain rules tending to how ceding companies might recapture risk in the recapture provision.

## Making sense of Reinsurance Treaties

In a reinsurance treaty, the insurer [cedes](/reinsurance-ceded) a portion of its liabilities to the reinsurer. Giving up piece of the insurer's total commitment opens up underwriting capacity. The reinsurer will receive a portion of the premiums or a fee in return for taking on the liability. Much of the time, the reinsurance treaty will stay in effect until the underlying policy terminates. The insurer will frequently surrender higher risk policies seen as over its [retention level](/underlying-retention).

A fundamental principle of reinsurance is that the interests of the ceding company take priority over the interests of the reinsurer. The ceding insurer will hold the policies it sees as profitable and low risk while going into a reinsurance treaty to cover those policies that surpass the company's retention profile.

## Reinsurance Recapture Provisions

Now and again, an insurer might need to increase its retention. Wishes to increase retention could be due to company financial growth or changes in the geographical region the company covers. Right now, the insurer might wish to conjure the recapture provision of the treaty.

Recapture of risk will end the payment of premiums and fees from the ceding company to the reinsurer. The reinsurer must guarantee coverage of all administrative and holding costs for the policies it expects as well as understand a profit for holding the high-risk policies. Most reinsurers don't fight the expansion of a recapture provision to a reinsurance treaty. In any case, a reinsurer will add conditions limiting how the ceding company might recapture its risk.

Reinsurers frequently require the ceding company to cease from recovering risk for a base period. The recapture provision additionally requires the ceding company to give adequate advanced notice that it means on reclaiming a portion of its liabilities.
