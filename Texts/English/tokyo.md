## Understanding the Tokyo Stock Exchange (TSE)

At the pinnacle of the Japanese asset price bubble in Dec. 1989, the [Nikkei 225 index](/nikkei) arrived at a record high of 38,916.

## Other Major International Exchanges

Notwithstanding the Tokyo Stock Exchange, other major trading exchanges worldwide incorporate the [New York Stock Exchange](/nyse) (NYSE), the Nasdaq, and the London Stock Exchange (LSE). Each exchange has specific [listing requirements](/listingrequirements) that owners must meet prior to offering their securities for trading.

As a general rule, these requirements incorporate normal financial reports, for example, evaluated earning reports, and least [capital requirements](/capitalrequirement). For instance, the NYSE has a key listing requirement that specifies a company must have no less than 1.1 million publicly traded shares of stock with a stock price of something like $4 per share. The company must have an aggregate pre-charge income of $10 million for the previous three fiscal years, with no less than $2 million in every one of the latest two fiscal years. Nasdaq expects listers to meet aggregate pre-charge income in the prior three fiscal long periods of no less than $11 million and a base [bid price](/bidprice) of $4.

## Analysis of the Tokyo Stock Exchange (TSE)

Some market participants have complained that throughout the long term the TSE has become too large and complicated compared to other global exchanges. The TSE consists of five sections. The principal section records Japan's greatest companies and the second section records medium-sized companies. Combined, these two sections are called the "primary markets."

Then, at that point, there are two sections dedicated to [startups](/startup). These sections are called the "Moms" (Market of the High-Growth and Emerging Stocks) and the [Jasdaq](/jasdaq) (which is isolated further into standard and growth sub-sections). The last section is the Tokyo Pro Market, which is for professional investors as it were.

To complicate matters, every one of these TSE sections has its own listing requirements. As of Sept. 14, 2021, the primary section alone included around 2,190 companies, practically double the level from 1990. A plan to reform the TSE incorporates improving on the criteria isolating the sections and lessening the number of sections to three — Prime, Standard, and Growth. Another conceivable change incorporates expanding the market cap requirement to reduce the number of companies listed in the top tier.
