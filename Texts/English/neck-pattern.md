## Understanding the On Neck Pattern

The small bullish candle could take quite a few forms, for example, a doji, rickshaw man, or any bull candle with a smaller real body than the prior candle, however the closing prices of the two candles ought to be equivalent or almost equivalent.

The pattern shows bulls endeavoring a rally that winds up flaming out on the subsequent candle, unable to push the close over the prior candle's close. Hypothetically, it is expected that the price will proceed with lower following the pattern. As indicated by the **Encyclopedia of Candlestick Charts** by Thomas Bulkowski, the price just proceeds to the downside 56% of the time. The remainder of the time it will be going about as a reversal pattern to the upside.

Bulkowski's study found that while the price would in general proceed with lower on a more regular basis, when the price switched to the upside the resulting move was bigger. Consequently, traders might like to look for a move higher following the pattern to really signal an upside reversal. These types of up moves will generally be marginally bigger than declines that follow the pattern.

Traders ought to utilize the on neck pattern related to different forms of technical analysis, for example, chart patterns or technical indicators. This is on the grounds that the pattern could bring about a move in one or the other course, so affirming data might assist with signaling which heading that is probably going to be.

The bears see the bulls missing the mark on power to push the price over the prior close. The theory is that the bears will assume command of the next several candles, pushing the price lower. As examined, in reality, this just happens about half the time. Subsequently the pattern puts the two bears and bulls on edge, bringing about basically a coin flip concerning whether prices will go higher or lower following the pattern.
