# Average Daily Rate (ADR)
## What Is the Average Daily Rate (ADR)?

The average daily rate (ADR) is a measurement widely utilized in the neighborliness industry to indicate the average revenue earned for an occupied room on a given day. The average daily rate is one of the [key performance indicators](/kpi) (KPI) of the industry.

Another KPI metric is the [occupancy rate](/occupancy-rate), which when combined with the ADR, includes [revenue per accessible room](/revpar) (RevPAR), which are all used to measure the operating performance of a lodging unit like an inn or inn.

## Understanding the Average Daily Rate (ADR)

The average daily rate (ADR) shows how much revenue is made per room on average. The higher the ADR, the better. A rising ADR proposes that a lodging is increasing the money it's making from renting out rooms. To increase the ADR, inns ought to investigate ways of boosting price per room.

Inn operators try to increase ADR by focusing on pricing strategies. This includes upselling, [cross-sale](/strategically pitch) advancements, and free offers, for example, free transport service to the nearby airport. The overall economy is a big factor in setting prices, with lodgings and inns seeking to change room rates to match current demand.

To determine the operating performance of a lodging, the ADR can be measured against an inn's historical ADR to search for trends, for example, seasonal impact or how certain advancements performed. It can likewise be utilized as a measure of relative performance since the measurement can measure up to different inns that have comparative qualities, like size, clientele, and location. This serves to price room rentals accurately.

## Calculating the Average Daily Rate (ADR)

The average daily rate is calculated by taking the average revenue earned from rooms and dividing it by the number of rooms sold. It rejects free endlessly rooms occupied by staff.

## Illustration of the Average Daily Rate (ADR)

On the off chance that an inn has $50,000 in room revenue and 500 rooms sold, the ADR would be $100 ($50,000/500). Rooms utilized for in-house use, like those set to the side for lodging employees and free ones, are excluded from the calculation.

## Real World Example

Think about Marriott International (MAR), a major publicly traded hotelier that reports ADR alongside occupancy rate and RevPAR. For 2019, Marriott's ADR increased by 2.1% from 2018 to $202.75 in North America. The occupancy rate was genuinely static at 75.8%. Taking the ADR and multiplying it by the occupancy rate yields the RevPAR. In Marriott's case, $202.75 times 75.8% compares to a RevPAR of $153.68, which was up 2.19% from 2018.

## The Difference Between the Average Daily Rate (ADR) and Revenue Per Available Room (RevPAR)

The average daily rate (ADR) is expected to compute the revenue per accessible room (RevPAR). The average daily rate tells a lodging company the amount they make per room on average in a given day. In the mean time, RevPAR measures a lodging's ability to occupy its accessible rooms at the average rate. In the event that the occupancy rate isn't at 100% and the RevPAR is below the ADR, a lodging operator realizes that it can presumably reduce the average price per room to assist with increasing occupancy.

## Limitations of Using the Average Daily Rate (ADR)

The ADR doesn't recount an inn's revenue. For instance, it doesn't include the charges a lodging company might charge in the event that a visitor doesn't appear. The figure likewise doesn't deduct things, for example, commissions and rebates offered to customers on the off chance that there is a problem. A property's ADR might increase because of price increases, be that as it may, this gives limited information in detachment. Occupancy might have fallen, leaving overall revenue lower.
