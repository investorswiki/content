# Riskless Principal
## What Is Riskless Principal?

Riskless principal is a party, endless supply of a [order](/order) to buy or sell a security, buys or sells that security themselves as they take care of the request. It is where a broker, who has received a customer order, promptly executes an indistinguishable order in the marketplace for their account, assuming the job of principal, to fill that customer order.

## Figuring out Riskless Principal

An order from a customer would in this manner require the [member firm](/memberfirm) to execute an indistinguishable order in the market as principal before executing the customer's order, So, a customer's buy order would require that the member firm executes an indistinguishable buy order in the market, while a sell order would require the member firm to execute an indistinguishable sell order in the market. To meet all requirements for riskless principal trades, the [Financial Industry Regulatory Authority](/finra) (FINRA) specifies that the trades ought to be executed at a similar price, exclusive of a markup/markdown, commission, or different fees.

For instance, a [broker-dealer](/broker-dealer) who is a FINRA member and gets a customer order to buy 10,000 shares of Widget Co. at the common market price of $10 would quickly buy the 10,000 shares from one more member at $10. Since the two trades were executed at a similar price (excluding commissions), this would qualify as a riskless principal transaction.

On March 24, 1999, the SEC approved amendments to FINRA, then, at that point, the [National Association of Security Dealers](/nasd) (NASD), rules in regards to the reporting of riskless principal transactions by [market makers](/marketmaker) in [NASDAQ](/nasdaq) and [OTC](/otc) securities. The rule change, which was effective Sep. 30, 1999, permitted market producers to just report one leg of a riskless principal transaction, as opposed to the two legs, similar to the requirement beforehand.

While market creators are constantly considered to be "in danger" while trading from their principal accounts, the amendment was an affirmation of the fact that trades attempted to offset customer orders are riskless. One of the huge benefits of this rule change was a reduction in [transaction fees](/transactioncosts) collected by the SEC.

## NASD Notice on Riskless Principal

The NASD's Special Notice on "Compensation and Mixed Capacity Trading" offers FAQ guidance, and defined a riskless principal trade thusly:

"In NASDAQ, a riskless principal trade is one in which a broker/dealer, in the wake of having received an order to buy (sell) a security, purchases (sells) the security as principal, at a similar price, to fulfill that order. The broker/dealer generally charges its customer a markup, markdown, or commission equivalent for its services, which is uncovered on the confirmation required by Securities Exchange Act (Exchange Act) Rule 10b-10. For additional guidance on riskless principal trade reporting obligations for NASDAQ securities, see Notice to Members 99-65, Notice to Members 99-66 and Notice to Members 00-79."
