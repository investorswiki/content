# Subordination Agreement
## What Is a Subordination Agreement?

A subordination agreement is a legal document that lays out [one debt as positioning behind one more in priority](/subordinateddebt) for collecting repayment from a debtor. The priority of debts can turn out to be critical when a debtor defaults on payments or declares bankruptcy.

A subordination agreement recognizes that one party's claim or interest is better than that of one more party if the borrower's assets must be liquidated to repay the debts.

The subordinated party will possibly collect on a debt owed when and on the off chance that the obligation to the primary lender has been fully fulfilled in the event of foreclosure and liquidation.

## How a Subordination Agreement Works

Individuals and businesses go to lending institutions when they need to borrow funds. The lender is compensated when it receives interest payments on the loaned amount, except if and until the borrower defaults on her payments. The lender could require a subordination agreement to safeguard its interests should the borrower place extra liens against the property, for example, if she somehow happened to require out a subsequent mortgage.

The "lesser" or second debt is alluded to as a [subordinated debt](/subordinateddebt). The debt which has a higher claim to the asset is the senior debt.

Lenders of senior debts have a legal right to be repaid in full before lenders of subordinated debts receive any repayments. It frequently happens that a debtor needs more funds to pay all debts, or [foreclosure and sale](/foreclosure) doesn't create sufficient in that frame of mind of liquid proceeds, so lower priority debts could receive practically zero repayment by any means.

## Illustration of a Subordination Agreement

Consider a business that has $670,000 in senior debt, $460,000 in subordinated debt, and total asset value of $900,000. The business petitions for financial protection and its assets are liquidated at market value â€” $900,000.

The senior debtholders will be paid in full, and the leftover $230,000 will be distributed among the subordinated debtholders, ordinarily for 50 pennies on the dollar. Shareholders in the subordinated company would not receive anything in the liquidation cycle since shareholders are subordinate to all creditors.

Subordinated debts are riskier than higher priority loans, so lenders commonly require higher interest rates as compensation for facing this risk.

## Types of Subordination Agreements

Subordination agreements can be utilized in various conditions, including complex corporate debt structures.

[Unsecured bonds](/unsecureddebt) without collateral are considered to be subordinate to [secured bonds](/securedbond). Should the company default on its interest payments due to bankruptcy, secured bondholders would be repaid their loan amounts before unsecured bondholders. The interest rate on unsecured bonds is normally higher than that of secured bonds, earning higher returns for the investor should the issuer follow through with its payments.

## Special Considerations

Subordination agreements are most common in the mortgage field. At the point when an individual requires out a subsequent mortgage, that subsequent mortgage has a lower priority than the principal mortgage, yet these needs can be agitated about refinancing the original loan.

The mortgagor is basically paying it off and getting another loan when a first mortgage is renegotiated, so the new, latest loan is currently second in line. The existing second loan climbs to turn into the main loan. The lender of the primary mortgage refinancing will currently expect that a subordination agreement be endorsed constantly mortgage lender to reposition it in main concern for debt repayment. The priority interests of every creditor are changed by agreement from what they would somehow have become.

The consented to arrangement must be recognized by a notary and kept in the official records of the region to be enforceable.
