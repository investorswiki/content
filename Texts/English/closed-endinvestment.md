# Closed-End Fund
Closed-end funds are crates of stocks that are gathered by an investment objective and regulated by a manager. However, not at all like open-end funds, which keep on expanding their asset base by selling to new shareholders, closed-end funds get assets by selling a fixed number of shares through an initial offering. After the initial sale, the closed-end fund's shares trade like stocks on exchanges like the NYSE or the AMEX. Low demand for a fund can cause closed-end shares to trade at discounts to net asset value. High demand can make premiums to NAV.

## Highlights
- Closed-end funds are normally actively managed, in contrast to index mutual funds and ETFs, and regularly focus on a single industry, sector, or region.
- The initial capital for a closed-end fund is raised through a one-time offering of a limited number of shares in the fund.
- The shares may then be bought and sold on a public stock exchange however no new shares can be made.
