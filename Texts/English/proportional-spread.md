# Proportional Spread
## What Is a Proportional Spread?

A proportional spread is a measure of a security's [liquidity](/liquidity) that is calculated by looking at its bid and ask prices as a ratio, and is much of the time communicated as a percentage of the security's current price. For example, a stock trading with a bid/ask spread of $10.00-$10.05 would have a proportional spread of 0.125%.

Higher proportional spreads are associated with less liquid securities, permitting [market makers](/marketmaker) to be compensated for the additional risk of dealing in illiquid securities. Then again, more liquid securities will have lower proportional spreads.

## How Proportional Spreads Work

The proportional spread is calculated as the difference between the closing ask and bid prices, partitioned by their average, frequently over a month to month interval:

>
> Month to month Proportional Spread = (Ask - Bid)/(Ask + Bid) \u00f7 2
>

where:

- Ask = The highest close in the month
- Bid = The most minimal close in the month

The proportional spread can be deciphered as the average compensation paid to dealers for making a market in that security.

According to the point of view of the investor, the average cost of executing in that security is equivalent to one-half of the proportional spread.

> By and large, proportional spreads range among 0.50% and around 3%.
>

Proportional spreads are important to investors since they influence the net [cost basis](/costbasis) of purchasing shares. This thus can eat into the proceeds received while selling shares. For famous and liquid securities, nonetheless, proportional spreads are frequently so insignificant as to affect investors.

> A few investors purposely search out illiquid markets in which proportional spreads are higher than normal. In these markets, it is once in a while conceivable to find instances of extreme security mispricing â€” that is, securities that are mispriced relative to their intrinsic value. This approach to investing is frequently employed by value investors.

## Genuine Example of Proportional Spreads

In the mid 2000s, the average proportional spread associated with trading on the [New York Stock Exchange](/nyse) (NYSE) was 0.6%. Be that as it may, with the growth in fame of [electronic trading platforms](/ecn), the market-production process has become progressively efficient in recent years. This has contributed to a decline in the average proportional spread to under 0.2% today.

It is important to note anyway that this is just an average figure. For profoundly liquid securities, in which millions or even huge number of shares change hands each trading session, the proportional spread can be just a couple of basis points. Then again, securities that have next to no volume can have a lot higher proportional spreads.

Notwithstanding these factors, proportional spreads can likewise be impacted by the [lot size](/part) of the order being referred to. For example, a [block trade](/blocktrade) would be subject to a lower proportional spread, while a [odd parcel trade](/oddlot) would be subject to a higher one.

## Features
- Average proportional spreads have diminished altogether in recent years.
- A proportional spread is the ratio of a security's bid and ask price distance relative to the security's price.
- It is more extensive in less liquid securities and more tight in additional liquid ones, which repays market producers for the risk of dealing in illiquid securities.
