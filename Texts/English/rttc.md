Investors should factor in the cumulative costs to determine whether an investment was profitable or caused a loss.

Shares of Main Street Public House Corp. have a [bid price](/bidprice) of $20 and a [ask price](/ask) of $20.10. There is a $10 [brokerage commission](/brokerage-fee). In the event that you bought 100 shares, immediately sell all of them at the bid and ask prices above, what might the round-trip transaction costs be?

Purchase: ($20.10 per share x 100 shares) + $10 brokerage commission = $2,020

Deal: ($20 per share x 100 shares) - $10 brokerage commission = $1,990

The round-trip transaction cost is: $2,020 - $1,990 = $30
