# Real Option
## What Is a Real Option?

A real option is an economically important right to pursue or, more than likely abandon some decision that is accessible to the managers of a company, frequently concerning business projects or investment opportunities. It is alluded to as "real" since it typically references projects including a [tangible asset](/tangibleasset) (like machinery, land, and buildings, as well as inventory), rather than a financial instrument.

Real options contrast subsequently from financial [options contracts](/optionscontract) since they include real (for example physical) "[underlying](/underlying-asset)" assets and are not exchangeable as securities.

## Seeing Real Options

Real options are decisions a company's management gives itself the option to make to grow, change, or reduce projects in light of evolving economic, mechanical, or market conditions. Calculating in real options influences the valuation of expected investments, albeit usually utilized valuations fail to account for potential benefits given by real options.

Utilizing real options value analysis (ROV), managers can estimate the [opportunity cost](/opportunitycost) of continuing or abandoning a project and settle on better choices as needs be.

It is important to note that real options don't allude to a derivative financial instrument, for example, call and put options contracts, which give the holder the right to buy or sell an underlying asset, individually. All things being equal, real options are opportunities that a business could conceivably make the most of or realize.

For instance, investing in another manufacturing facility might furnish a company with real options for introducing new products, uniting operations, or making different changes in response to changing market conditions. While choosing whether to invest in the new facility, the company ought to consider the real option value the facility gives. Different instances of real options incorporate opportunities for mergers and acquisitions ([M&A](/mergersandacquisitions)) or joint endeavors.

## Real Options Valuation

The exact value of real options can be challenging to lay out or estimate. For example, real option value might be realized from a company undertaking socially responsible projects, for example, building a community center. Thusly, the company might realize a benefit that makes it simpler to get important permits or endorsement for different projects. Nonetheless, nailing a careful financial value to such benefits is troublesome.

In dealing with such real options, a company's management team factors the potential for real option value into the decision-production process, even however the value is fundamentally to some degree obscure and uncertain. Of course, the key difference between real options and derivatives contracts is that the last option frequently trades on an exchange and has a mathematical value in terms of its price or [premium](/option-premium). Real options, then again, are undeniably more subjective. Yet, by utilizing a combination of experience, and financial valuations, management ought to get some feeling of the value of the project being thought of and whether it's worth the risk.

In any case, valuation procedures for real options truly do frequently seem like the pricing of financial options contracts, where the spot price or the current market price alludes to the current net present value ([NPV](/npv)) of a project. The net present value is the cash flow that is expected because of the new project, however those flows are discounted by a rate that could somehow be earned for sitting idle. The alternative rate or [discount rate](/discountrate) may be the rate of a U.S. Treasury bond, for instance. In the event that Treasuries pay 3%, the project or the cash flows must yield a return of over 3%; any other way, it wouldn't worth seek after.

Some valuation models use phrasing from [derivatives](/derivative) markets wherein the [strike price](/strikeprice) compares to non-recoverable costs associated with the project. In the derivatives world, the strike would be the price at which the options contract changes over into the underlying security that depends on. Additionally, the [expiration date](/expirationdate) of an options contract could be subbed with the time period inside which the business decision ought to be made. Options contracts likewise have a volatility part, which measures the level of risk in an investment. The higher the risk, the more costly the option. Real options must likewise consider the risk implied, and it too could be assigned a value like volatility.

Different methods of esteeming real options incorporate [Monte Carlo simulations](/montecarlosimulation), which utilize mathematical estimations to assign probabilities to different results given certain factors and risks.

## Special Considerations
### Heuristic Reasoning

Real options analysis is still frequently viewed as a [heuristic](/heuristics) — a rule of thumb, considering flexibility and quick decision-production in a complex, steadily changing environment — in light of sound financial criteria. The real options heuristic is just the recognition of the value typified in the flexibility of picking among alternatives notwithstanding the way that their objective values can't still up in the air with any degree of certainty.

Even on the off chance that a quantitative model is employed to value a real option, the decision of the model itself depends on judgment and frequently an experimentation approach since the decisions accessible can differ across firms and project managers.

Having options bears the cost of the freedom to settle on optimal decisions in decisions, for example, when and where to make a specific capital expenditure. Different management decisions to create investments can give companies real options to make extra moves from here on out, in light of existing market conditions.

In short, real options are about companies simply deciding and decisions that grant them the best amount of flexibility and potential benefit with respect to conceivable future decisions or decisions.

### Decisions that Fall Under Real Options

The decisions that corporate managers face that typically fall under real options analysis are under three categories of [project management](/project-management).

1. The main group are options connecting with the size of a project. Contingent upon the ROV analysis, options might exist to extend, contract, or grow and contract the project over the long run, given different possibilities.
1. The subsequent group connects with the lifetime of a project — to start one, defer starting one, abandon an existing one, or plan the sequencing of the project's means.
1. The third group of real options includes the project's operations: the interaction flexibility, product mix, and operating scale, among others.

Real options are most fitting when the economic environment and market conditions connecting with a specific project are both profoundly unpredictable yet flexible. Stable or inflexible environments won't benefit much from ROV and ought to utilize more traditional corporate finance methods all things considered. Essentially, ROV is applicable just when a company's corporate strategy fits flexibility, has adequate data flow, and has adequate funds to cover potential downside risks associated with real options.

## Real-World Example of Real Options

The McDonald's Corporation (MCD) has caf\u00e9s in excess of 100 countries. Suppose the company's executives are thinking about the decision to open extra caf\u00e9s in Russia. The expansion would fall under the category of a **real option to expand.** The investment or capital outlay would should be calculated, including the cost of the physical buildings, land, staff, and equipment.

In any case, McDonald's executives would have to choose if the revenue earned from the new caf\u00e9s will be sufficient to counter any possible country and political risk, which is hard to value.

A similar scenario could likewise create a **real option to wait** or concede opening any eateries until a specific political situation sorts itself out. Maybe there's an impending election, and the outcome could impact the stability of the country or the regulatory environment.
