# IS-LM Model
## What Is the IS-LM Model?

The IS-LM model, which means "investment-savings" (IS) and "liquidity inclination money supply" (LM) is a Keynesian [macroeconomic](/macroeconomics) model that shows how the market for economic goods (IS) cooperates with the loanable funds market (LM) or [money market](/moneymarket). It is addressed as a graph in which the IS and LM curves cross to show the short-run equilibrium between interest rates and output.

## Understanding the IS-LM Model

British economist [John Hicks](/john-r-hicks) first presented the IS-LM model in 1936, just a couple of months after individual British economist [John Maynard Keynes](/john_maynard_keynes) published "The General Theory of Employment, Interest, and Money." Hicks' model filled in as a formalized graphical representation of Keynes' speculations, however it is utilized basically as a [heuristic](/heuristics) gadget today.

The three critical exogenous, for example outer, factors in the IS-LM model are [liquidity](/liquidity), investment, and consumption. As indicated by the theory, not entirely settled by the size and velocity of the [money supply](/moneysupply). The levels of [investment](/effective money management) and not entirely set in stone by the marginal decisions of individual entertainers.

The IS-LM graph analyzes the relationship between output, or [gross domestic product](/gdp) (GDP), and interest rates. The whole economy is reduced to just two markets, output and money; and their individual [supply and demand](/law-of-supply-demand) characteristics push the economy towards a [equilibrium](/equilibrium) point.

## Characteristics of the IS-LM Graph

The IS-LM graph consists of two curves, IS and LM. Gross domestic product (GDP), or (Y), is placed on the horizontal axis, expanding to the right. The interest rate, or (I or R), makes up the vertical axis.

The IS curve portrays the set of all levels of [interest rates](/interestrate) and output (GDP) at which total investment (I) equals total saving (S). At lower interest rates, investment is higher, which converts into more total output (GDP), so the IS curve slants downward and to the right.

The LM curve portrays the set of all levels of income (GDP) and interest rates at which money supply equals money (liquidity) demand. The LM curve slants up on the grounds that higher levels of income (GDP) prompt increased demand to hold money balances for transactions, which requires a higher interest rate to keep money supply and liquidity demand in equilibrium.

The convergence of the IS and LM curves shows the equilibrium point of interest rates and output when money markets and the real economy are in balance. Different situations or points in time might be addressed by adding extra IS and LM curves.

In certain forms of the graph, curves display limited convexity or concavity. Changes in the position and state of the IS and LM curves, addressing changing inclinations for liquidity, investment, and consumption, modify the equilibrium levels of income and interest rates.

## Limitations of the IS-LM Model

Numerous economists, including numerous Keynesians, object to the IS-LM model for its simplistic and unrealistic suspicions about the macroeconomy. As a matter of fact, Hicks later admitted that the model's defects were deadly, and it was presumably best utilized as "a homeroom device, to be supplanted, later on, by something better." Subsequent revisions have occurred for purported "new" or "enhanced" IS-LM systems.

The model is a limited policy instrument, as it can't make sense of how tax or spending policies ought to be planned with any specificity. This altogether limits its functional appeal. It has very little to say regarding inflation, rational expectations, or international markets, albeit later models truly do endeavor to incorporate these thoughts. The model additionally overlooks the formation of capital and [labor productivity](/labor-productivity).

## Features
- IS-LM can be utilized to portray how changes in market inclinations modify the equilibrium levels of gross domestic product (GDP) and market interest rates.
- The model was devised as a proper graphic representation of a principle of Keynesian economic theory.
- On the IS-LM graph, "IS" addresses one curve while "LM" addresses another curve.
- IS-LM means "investment savings-liquidity inclination money supply."
- The IS-LM model misses the mark on precision and realism to be a helpful solution instrument for economic policy.
- The IS-LM model depicts how aggregate markets for real goods and financial markets connect to balance the rate of interest and total output in the macroeconomy.
