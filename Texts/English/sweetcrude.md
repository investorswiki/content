# Sweet Crude
## What Is Sweet Crude?

Sweet crude alludes to [crude oil](/crude-oil) that is extricated that is found to contain exceptionally low amounts of sulfur. It is viewed as a significant and efficient source of crude oil due to the way that sulfur lowers the yield of different refined petroleum products, for example, gas, diesel fuel, and even plastics.

Sweet crude can be stood out from the less alluring [sour crude](/sourcrude), which has a high level of sulfur content.

## How Sweet Crude Works

Crude oil is made essentially out of carbon and hydrogen, which address around 85% and 12% of its science, separately. The excess components comprise of sulfur, oxygen, nitrogen, and helium. Contingent upon the sythesis of the trace components, the cycle for [refining crude oil](/oil-processing plant) can fluctuate substantially in terms of the amount of residual side-effect — or "residuum" — left over subsequent to refining.

Oil is most straightforward to work with assuming its sulfur content is kept exceptionally low. To assist with creating an industry-standard definition of this high-quality oil, the [NYMEX](/nymex) exchange has put forward a definition of crude sweet oil, expressing that it must have something like 0.42% sulfur content.

Albeit today exact strategies are accessible to survey the sulfur content of a sample of oil, past ages of oil miners would conclude a sample's sulfur content by in a real sense tasting it themselves. Assuming the sample tasted enigmatically sweet and had a wonderful smell, that implied it was low in sulfur. A sour taste with the smell of spoiled eggs indicated a high sulfur content. It is through this old testing method that the terms "sweet crude" and "sour crude" became.

## Different Considerations

As well as controlling sulfur content, the quality of crude oil is likewise impacted by its density. As indicated by the density standards set out by the [American Petroleum Institute (API)](/american-petroleum-institute), crude oil can likewise be recognized as "light" or "heavy" contingent upon its density relative to water. For instance, crude oil with a density equivalent to that of water is defined as having an "API Gravity" of 10.

The API's density scale is inverted, implying that oil with an API Gravity greater than 10 will float on water and be called "light crude." Conversely, oil with an API Gravity below 10 will soak in water and be known as "heavy crude." Although not all light crude is sweet, most heavy crude is sour since it regularly contains large amounts of sulfur along with metals like nickel. Low-density (or "light") oil is alluring on the grounds that it is more straightforward to refine, distil, and transport.

## True Example of Sweet Crude

Joining these components together, we can see that the best type of crude oil is light sweet crude. This is on the grounds that it is highly efficient, leaving negligible residue in its refinement cycle while additionally being not difficult to distil and move due to its low density.

Maybe the most renowned illustration of light sweet crude oil is known as [West Texas Intermediate,](/wti) or WTI crude oil, which is both lighter and sweeter than other major types of oil, for example, [Brent crude](/northseabrentcrude) oil and Dubai crude oil. Its ubiquity in North America is due in part to the way that it is created and refined in North America, while additionally being actively traded on commodity futures markets like the NYMEX.

## Highlights
- When combined with low density, sweet crude is a highly pursued type of oil which orders a high price, known as light sweet crude.
- Sweet crude is a type of crude oil classified by its low sulfur content.
- In North America, a famous illustration of sweet crude oil is the West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil, which is actively traded on the New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX).
