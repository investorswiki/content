# Unrecaptured Section 1250 Gain
## What Is an Unrecaptured Section 1250 Gain?

Unrecaptured section 1250 gain is a [Internal Revenue Service (IRS)](/irs) tax provision where recently recognized [depreciation](/depreciation) is recaptured into income when a gain is realized on the sale of depreciable [real estate](/realestate) property. Unrecaptured [section 1250](/section1250) gains are taxed at a maximum 25% tax rate, or less at times, starting around 2019. Unrecaptured section 1250 gains are calculated on a worksheet inside [Schedule D](/scheduled) guidelines, and they are reported on the Schedule D and carried through to the taxpayer's 1040.

## How Unrecaptured Section 1250 Gains Work

Section 1231 [assets](/resource) incorporate all depreciable [capital assets](/capitalasset) held by a taxpayer for longer than one year. Section 1231 is the umbrella for assets belonging to section 1245 and section 1250, and the last option determines the tax rate of [depreciation recapture](/depreciationrecapture). Section 1250 relates just to real property, like structures and land. Personal property, like machinery and equipment, is subject to depreciation recapture as [ordinary income](/ordinaryincome) under [section 1245](/section1245).

Unrecaptured section 1250 gains are possibly realized when there is a net [Section 1231](/section-1231) gain. Basically, capital losses on all depreciable assets offset unrecaptured section 1250 gains on real estate. In this manner, a net capital loss overall diminishes the unrecaptured section 1250 gain to zero.

A section 1250 gain is recaptured upon the sale of depreciated real estate, just likewise with some other resource; the main difference is the rate at which it is taxed. The justification for the gain is to offset the benefit of recently utilized depreciation allowances. While the gains credited to accumulated depreciation are taxed at the section 1250 recapture tax rate, any excess gains are simply subject to the long-term [capital gains rate](/capital_gains_tax) of 15%.

## Illustration of Unrecaptured Section 1250 Gains

On the off chance that a property was initially purchased for $150,000, and the owner claims depreciation of $30,000, the [adjusted cost basis](/adjustedcostbase) for the property is viewed as $120,000. Assuming the property is consequently sold for $185,000, the owner has recognized an overall gain of $65,000 over the adjusted cost basis. Since the property has sold for more than the basis that had been adjusted for depreciation, the unrecaptured section 1250 gains depend on the difference between the adjusted cost basis and the original purchase price.

This makes the first $30,000 of the profit subject to the unrecaptured section 1250 gain, while the leftover $35,000 is taxed at the ordinary long-term capital gains. With that outcome, $30,000 would be subject to the higher capital gains tax rate of up to 25%. The leftover $35,000 would be taxed at the long-term capital gains rate of 15%.

## Special Considerations

Since the unrecaptured section 1250 gains are viewed as a form of [capital gains](/capitalgain), they can be offset by capital losses. To do as such, the capital losses must be reported through Form 8949 and Schedule D, and the value of the loss might shift in the event that in the event that being short-term or long-term in nature is determined. For a capital loss to offset a capital gain, the two of them must be determined to be short-term or long-term. A short-term loss can't offset a long-term gain and vice versa.
