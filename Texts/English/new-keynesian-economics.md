# New Keynesian Economics
## What's going on Keynesian Economics?

New Keynesian economics is a modern [macroeconomic](/macroeconomics) school of believed that developed from classical [Keynesian economics](/keynesianeconomics). This reexamined theory contrasts from classical Keynesian reasoning in terms of how rapidly prices and wages change.

New Keynesian backers keep up with that prices and wages are "[sticky](/price_stickiness)," meaning they change all the more leisurely to short-term economic vacillations. This, thusly, makes sense of such economic factors as involuntary unemployment and the impact of federal [monetary policies](/monetarypolicy).

## Seeing New Keynesian Economics

English financial specialist [John Maynard Keynes](/john_maynard_keynes)' thought in the aftermath of the [Great Depression](/great_depression) that increased government expenditures and lower taxes can animate demand and pull the global economy out of a downturn turned into the prevailing perspective for a large part of the 20^th^ century. That gradually started to change in 1978 when **After Keynesian Economics** was distributed.

In the paper, new classical business analysts [Robert Lucas](/robert-e-lucas-jr) and Thomas Sargent pointed out that the [stagflation](/stagflation) experienced during the 1970s was contrary with traditional Keynesian models.

Lucas, Sargent, and others tried to build on Keynes' original theory by adding [microeconomic](/microeconomics) establishments to it. The two major areas of microeconomics that may altogether impact the macroeconomy, they said, are price and wage unbending nature. These concepts entwine with social theory, discrediting the pure hypothetical models of classical Keynesianism.

The new Keynesian theory endeavored to address, in addition to other things, the sluggish behavior of prices and its objective, and how [market failures](/marketfailure) could be set off by shortcomings and could legitimize government intervention. The benefits of government intervention stay a flashpoint for banter. New Keynesian financial specialists presented a defense for expansionary monetary policy, contending that [deficit spending](/deficit-spending) energizes saving, as opposed to expanding demand or economic growth.

## Analysis of New Keynesian Economics

New Keynesian economics was condemned in a quarters so that failing could see the [Great Recession](/great-recession) coming and for not precisely accounting for the period of [secular](/secular) stagnation that followed it.

The central concern of this economic doctrine is making sense of why changes in aggregate price levels are "sticky." Under new classical macroeconomics**,** competitive [price-taking](/pricetaker) companies go with decisions on how much output to create, and not at what price, while in New Keynesian economics, [monopolistically competitive](/monopolisticmarket) companies set their prices and acknowledge the level of sales as a requirement.

From a New Keynesian economics point of view, two fundamental contentions try to answer why aggregate prices fail to mimic the nominal [gross national product](/gnp) (GNP) development. Mainly, under the two ways to deal with macroeconomics, it is assumed economic agents, families, and companies have [rational expectations](/rationaltheoryofexpectations).

Nonetheless, New Keynesian economics keeps up with that rational expectations become contorted as market failure emerges from [asymmetric information](/asymmetricinformation) and [imperfect competition](/imperfect_competition). As economic agents can't have a full scope of the economic reality, their data will be limited. There will be little motivation to accept that different agents will change their prices, and, accordingly, they will keep their expectations unchanged. In that capacity, expectations are a urgent element of price determination; as they stay unaltered, so will price, which prompts price unbending nature.
