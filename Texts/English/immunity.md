# Immunity
## What Is Immunity?

Immunity is a [exemption](/exemption) from a legal requirement, indictment, or penalty granted by statute or government specialists.

## Figuring out Immunity

There are four principal types of immunity:

1. **Witness immunity** from indictment is granted to somebody in exchange for information or declaration in a criminal trial.
1. **Public officials' protection from liability** safeguards officials like city managers and police bosses from liability for their choices. It likewise safeguards state and federal administrators and executives regarding their conduct of official duties.

## Immunity Risks for Witnesses

There are a number of risks that emerge from granting such immunity. One risk is that an individual may dishonestly denounce others and limit personal culpability. Then again, value-based immunity produces the risk of an "immunity bath," in which a witness specifies a large number of crimes they committed, secure in the information that they have immunity from indictment. Another risk is that vaccinated declaration might be perceived as being untrustworthy, since it has been "purchased," so to speak.

In choosing whether to grant immunity to a witness, the accompanying factors are thought about:

## Special Considerations

The treaty states that discretionary agents appreciate immunity from the criminal jurisdiction of the getting state, and furthermore appreciate immunity from civil procedures except if the case includes property or business interests unrelated to their conciliatory duties.

In any case, immunity doesn't grant a chaotic situation. Also, governments don't necessarily conjure political immunity with respect to non-official acts by their delegates. For instance, in 1997, the Republic of Georgia postponed the immunity of its second-most noteworthy positioning representative after he killed a 16-year old young lady while driving impaired. He was arraigned and sentenced for murder, for which he was detained for quite some time in North Carolina before getting back to Georgia, where he served two additional years in jail.
