# International Reply Coupon (IRC)
## What Is an International Reply Coupon?

An international reply coupon — IRC is a type of voucher accepted in various countries in exchange for neighborhood postage stamps. After handing one over, coupon holders get the base postage required for airmail gauging as much as 20 grams.

Just countries participating in the Universal Postal Union, or UPU, acknowledge IRCs for postage. The UPU is a wing of the [United Nations](/united-nations-un). It organizes the delivery of global mail, as well as postal policies among member nations. The UPU is situated in Bern, Switzerland. The majority of the world's countries, as well as Vatican City participate in the UPU. The UPU added South Sudan, its latest member, in 2011.

## Figuring out the International Reply Coupon (IRC)

In any case, particularly many years prior, lack of data and fluctuating currency [exchange rates](/exchangerate) made it difficult to tell how much postage either ought to apply. The IRCs made this a lot simpler by normalizing both the maximum letter weight and the postage price.

The development of the IRC took a number of years and started off bright and early long before airmail. The UPU started back in 1874, eventually getting every one of the agreements in place to present IRCs in 1906, just a couple of years following the primary plane flight by Orville and Wilbur Wright in 1903. It took until 1929 for a larger set of rules overseeing airmail to come to fruition. Airmail became famous around by the 1930s, as aircraft filled in prevalence, size and cargo capacity. As of now, a large percentage of airline revenue came from airmail, instead of [revenue seat miles.](/availableseatmiles)

Prior to airmail, delivery of letters by ship took a long time to a few global destinations, while possibly not over a month. Airmail diminished this plan to days. Consequently, most countries charged a premium for airmail letters, and IRCs assisted with normalizing this price.

Of note is that the UPU's official language is French. Thus, airmail sent worldwide some of the time bears the words "standard avion, signifying "via plane," even in certain countries that don't basically communicate in French.

## Advantages and disadvantages of International Reply Coupon — IRC's
