## What Is a Dutch Auction?

A Dutch auction is a market structure in which the price of something offered is determined after taking in all bids to show up at the highest price at which the total offering can be sold. In this type of auction, investors place a bid for the amount they will buy in terms of quantity and price.

A Dutch auction likewise alludes to a type of auction where the price of an item is lowered until it gets a bid. The first bid made is the triumphant bid and results in a sale, expecting that the price is over the [reserve price](/reserve-price). This is in contrast to typical auction markets, where the price starts low and afterward rise as bidders compete among each other to be the effective buyer.

## Understanding Dutch Auction for Public Offerings

On the off chance that a company is utilizing a Dutch auction [initial public offering](/ipo) (IPO), potential investors enter their bids for the number of shares they want to purchase as well as the price they will pay. For instance, an investor might place a bid for 100 shares at $100 while another investor offers $95 for 500 shares.

When every one of the bids are submitted, the allotted placement is assigned to the bidders from the highest bids down, until the allotted shares are all assigned. In any case, the price that every bidder pays depends on the lowest price of the relative multitude of allotted bidders, or essentially the last fruitful bid. Therefore, even assuming that you bid $100 for your 1,000 shares, assuming the last effective bid is $80, you will just need to pay $80 for your 1,000 shares.

The [U.S. Treasury](/ustreasury) utilizes a Dutch auction to sell its securities. To assist with supporting the country's debt, the US Treasury holds normal auctions to sell Treasury bills (T-bills), notes (T-notes), and bonds (T-bonds), collectively known as Treasuries. Prospective investors submit bids electronically through [TreasuryDirect](/treasurydirect) or the [Treasury Automated Auction Processing System](/taaps) (TAAPS), which accepts bids as long as 30 days in advance of the auction. Assume the Treasury looks to bring $9 million up in two-year notes with a 5% coupon. Let's expect the submitted bids are as follows:

- $1 million at 4.79%
- $2.5 million at 4.85%
- $2 million at 4.96%
- $1.5 million at 5%
- $3 million at 5.07%
- $1 million at 5.1%
- $5 million at 5.5%

The bids with the lowest [yield](/bond-yield) will be accepted first since the issuer will like to pay lower yields to its bond investors. In this case, since the Treasury is hoping to raise $9 million, it will accept the bids with the lowest yield up to 5.07%. At this mark, just $2 million of the $3 million bid will be approved. All bids over the 5.07% yield will be rejected, and bids below will be accepted. In effect, this auction is cleared at 5.07%, and all fruitful bidders receive the 5.07% yield.

The Dutch auction likewise gives an alternative bidding cycle to IPO pricing. At the point when Google sent off its public offering, it depended on a Dutch auction to earn a fair price.

## Lowest Bidding Dutch Auction

At a Dutch Auction, prices start high and are dropped progressively until a bidder accepts the going price. When a price is accepted, the auction closes. For instance, the auctioneer starts at $2,000 for an object. The bidders watch the price decline until it arrives at a price that one of the bidders accepts. No bidder sees the others' bids until after their own bid is formulated, and the triumphant bidder is the one with the highest bid. Thus, on the off chance that there are no bidders at $2,000, the price is lowered by $100 to $1,900. On the off chance that a bidder accepts the item of interest at, say the $1,500 mark, the auction closes.

## Benefits and Drawbacks of Dutch Auctions

The utilization of Dutch Auctions for [initial public offerings](/ipo) offers benefits as well as drawbacks.

The biggest benefit of such auctions is that they are meant to democratize public offerings. As it happens currently, the cycle for conducting a typical IPO is mostly controlled by investment banks. They act as underwriters to the offering and shepherd it through roadshows, empowering institutional investors to purchase securities of the responsible company at a discount. They are additionally responsible for setting the IPO's price. A Dutch Auction allows small investors to take part in the offering.

A Dutch Auction is likewise expected to limit the difference between offering and actual listing prices. Institutional investors take advantage of this difference to make gains by purchasing shares at a discount and selling them immediately after the stock is listed. Dutch Auction prices are set by a fairer and more transparent method in which a variety of bids from multiple types of customers are invited. This practice is meant to guarantee that the market shows up at a reasonable estimate of the association's value and that the initial "pop" that goes with the listing of a hot company is muted.

Those benefits are joined by drawbacks. Since the auction is available to investors, everything being equal, there is a risk that they might perform less thorough analysis as compared to investment bankers and accompany a price estimate that may not accurately reflect the company's prospects.

Another drawback of Dutch Auctions is known as the "[winner's curse](/winnerscurse)." In this, a stock's price might crash immediately after listing when investors, who had bid a higher price before, understand that they might have miscalculated or overbid. Such investors might try to sell the stock to get out of their holding, leading to a crash in the share's price.

## Illustration of Dutch Auction

The most prominent illustration of a Dutch Auction in recent times was Google's IPO in August 2004. The company opted for this type of offering to prevent a "pop" in its prices on the first day of trading. While the increase in share prices is a standard phenomenon in stock markets, it had escalated to bubble territory for tech stocks during the [Internet bubble](/internet-bubble) of 2000. From 1980 to 2001, the pop in first-day trading was 18.8%. That figure leaped to 77% in 1999 and in the first half of 2000.

Google's initial estimate for its offering was 25.9 million between the $108 to $135 territory. But the company modified its expectations about seven days before the actual offering after analysts questioned the thinking behind those figures and suggested that Google was overpricing its shares. In the modified estimate, Google offered to sell 19.6 million shares to the public at a price range between $85 to $95.

The response to the offering was viewed as a disappointment. Although Google was viewed as a hot company and offering, investors priced its shares at $85, the lower scope of its estimates. Before the day's over, the shares were trading hands at $100.34, a pop of 17.6% during the first day of trading.

Eyewitnesses put the poor performance on negative press reports about the company leading up to its IPO. A SEC inquiry into its executive share allocation further hosed enthusiasm for Google's offering. The company was additionally supposed to be "secretive" about its utilization of raised funds, making it difficult to evaluate its offering particularly for small investors not aware of the emerging market for web crawlers and sorting out information on the web.
