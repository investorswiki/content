# Hardship Exemption
## What Was the Hardship Exemption?

The term hardship exemption alluded to an exemption allowed to individuals who couldn't bear the cost of health care coverage due to personal and additionally financial conditions. These exemptions were part of a provision in the Patient Protection and [Affordable Care Act](/affordable-care-act) (ACA), which was endorsed into law in 2010. Individuals were required to have acceptable medical care or probably pay a [fee](/fee). Individuals who couldn't manage the cost of coverage could apply for an exemption where no penalty was assessed. The fee for uninsured individuals was killed in 2019 with the death of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA).

## How Hardship Exemptions Worked

The Affordable Care Act was endorsed into law by President Barack Obama on March 23, 2010. Usually alluded to as Obamacare, it decreased the cost of medical services for the American public by making medical care exchanges, extending the qualification for [Medicaid](/medicaid), forestalling [insurance](/insurance) companies from denying coverage, and punishing individuals who weren't covered.

Starting in 2014, most individuals were required to have acceptable medical care, which was known as [minimum essential coverage](/least essential-coverage). The people who weren't covered were charged a fee called an individual command or the Shared Responsibility Payment. This was a one-time fee collected by the [Internal Revenue Service](/irs) (IRS) when individuals documented their annual [tax returns](/taxreturn). The individuals who couldn't bear the cost of medical care had the option to apply for hardship exemptions through the Health Insurance Marketplace.

A hardship exemption might be conceded for tax years somewhere in the range of 2015 and 2018 for the accompanying conditions:

- Vagrancy
- You were ousted in the last six months or confronted [foreclosure](/foreclosure).
- You received a shut-off notice from a utility company.
- You were the survivor of domestic viciousness.
- You encountered the death of a close family member inside the previous three-year period.
- You encountered a fire, flood, or another disaster (natural or man-made) that brought about substantial damage to your property.
- You petitioned for [bankruptcy](/bankruptcy) inside the previous six months.
- You had medical expenses you were unable to pay in the last 24 months.
- You had unexpected expansions in vital expenses connected with really focusing on an ill, disabled, or aging family member.
- You expected to claim a child on your tax return who was denied coverage in Medicaid and CHIP, and someone else was under a court order to offer medical help for the child (in this case, you didn't owe the penalty for the child).
- Because of a qualification requests decision, you are eligible for a qualified wellbeing plan (QHP) through the Marketplace, lower costs on your month to month premiums, or cost-sharing reductions for a period when you were not enrolled in the QHP.
- You are ineligible for Medicaid in light of the fact that your state didn't extend its qualification under the ACA.

The Trump administration wiped out the individual command in 2019, and that means those without health care coverage were longer punished. The administration expanded the conditions for endorsement for the hardship exemption, making it simpler to stay away from the penalty up until 2018 if individuals:

- Lived some place with no [marketplace](/medical coverage marketplace) plans.
- Lived some place with just one company selling plans on the marketplace
- Couldn't track down an affordable plan without early termination coverage.
- Had personal conditions keeping them from purchasing a marketplace plan, including not having the option to find a plan with specialty care.

As verified over, the individual command was wiped out in 2019, and that means individuals without medical coverage are not generally punished.
