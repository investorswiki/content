# Maturity
## What is maturity?
In finance, maturity alludes to the date on which the principal balance of a loan becomes due and payable. It likewise alludes to the date when a bond pays off its principal with interest.
## More profound definition
Maturity alludes to the date on which an issuer or borrower of a loan or bond must repay the principal amount and interest to the holder or investor. The maturity date assigns the life expectancy of a security, illuminating the issuer when he must repay the principal amount and interest.
When the maturity date passes and principal and interest have been reimbursed, the issuer's contractual obligations are terminated. No extra payments are required after the maturity date. Likewise alluded to as a redemption date, maturity can go from one to 30 years, contingent upon the issuer's financial necessities.
Debt instruments, for example, a note or bill, draft and acceptance bond frequently are classified in terms of their maturity dates. Bonds with a maturity date of one year or less are known as short-term bonds, while those with a maturity date of over one year are viewed as long-term.
For most bonds, the specific maturity date is indicated on the bond certificate. Despite the fact that maturity generally alludes to a specific date of principal repayment, there's an exemption to that rule. For example, a few companies issue bonds that are "callable." A callable bond permits the issuer to recover it whenever before the predetermined maturity date.

Assuming that the bond is held until Jan. 1, 2020, then the issuer will return the principal amount of the bond and pay any leftover interest.
