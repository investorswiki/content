The GAB was framed in 1962, when the legislatures of eight IMF members — Belgium, Canada, France, Italy, Japan, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, and the United States — and the central banks of Germany and Sweden, agreed to make resources accessible to the IMF. These resources were for drawings by both IMF participants and, under certain conditions, non-participants.

The GAB was reached as a beneficial borrowing agreement to backstop the IMF on the off chance that it didn't have adequate resources to support a member country. The official language in the GAB states that these countries "stand ready to make loans to the Fund up to determined amounts...when beneficial resources are expected to hinder or cope with an impairment of the international monetary system." Switzerland marked the GAB in 1964, however not a member of the IMF at that point (Switzerland joined the IMF in 1992), subsequently fortifying the agreement.

It was at a G10 Forum in 1971 where members attempted to make [The Smithsonian Agreement](/smithsonian-agreement) following the collapse of the [Bretton Woods](/brettonwoodsagreement) System, which supplanted the[ fixed exchange rate](/fixedexchangerate) system with a [floating exchange rate](/floatingexchangerate) one.
