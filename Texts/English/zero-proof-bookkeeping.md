# Zero-Proof Bookkeeping
## What Is Zero-Proof Bookkeeping?

Zero-proof bookkeeping is a manual bookkeeping method utilized in accounting in which posted sections are systematically deducted from an ending balance to check for errors. In zero-proof bookkeeping, a balance of zero when all sections have been deducted is proof that the accounting passages have been placed accurately. Along these lines, this practice is very like keeping a [balance sheet](/balancesheet), which is a common financial statement issued by firms that balances assets with liabilities and shareholder's equity - to such an extent that deducting the left side from the right half of the balance sheet brings about a sum of zero.

Zero-proof bookkeeping is employed as part of a [double-entry](/twofold section) bookkeeping system, where credits (liabilities) and debits (assets) are monitored all the while.

## Figuring out Zero-Proof Bookkeeping

This method, utilized as part of a twofold passage bookkeeping system, might be utilized to accommodate accounting differences in situations where the number of sections or transactions isn't excessively large. A normal situation where zero-proof bookkeeping is utilized is by bank tellers to accommodate differences toward the finish of a day. Zero proof bookkeeping isn't functional where large numbers of transactions are the standard, and a considerable lot of the figures are adjusted. Hence, this practice is most frequently utilized by more modest businesses or for individual purposes.

Since zero-proof bookkeeping is carried out manually, it is a relentless and tedious interaction. It is likewise dreary in that similar kind of manual computations must be carried out consistently, for instance, toward the finish of every business day. Of course, this work can be augmented with crafted by adding machines or spreadsheets like Microsoft Excel.

To begin in the zeroing out process, the clerk will initially take part in "balance" the ledger. The balance here means summing up each of the numbers kept in a single column of the accounting ledger. The subsequent sum, which shows up at the base ("foot') of the column is then used to accommodate against different columns by looking at and deducting debits from credits (cross-balance). An illustration of zero-proof bookkeeping in practice is the utilization of balance sheets by firms where [shareholders' equity](/shareholdersequity) is utilized as a figure (either positive or negative) to balance assets with liabilities so they amount to zero on net.
