# Retention Tax
## What Is a Retention Tax?

A retention tax is a tax withheld at the source, that is to say, by the employer. Payroll tax withholding is one common illustration of a retention tax. Employers redirect a portion of an employee's paycheck to the IRS to cover anticipated taxes. Employers likewise hold taxes owed by overseas employees to guarantee that the IRS receives the taxes before the money leaves U.S. borders.

## Understanding the Retention Tax

A retention tax is any tax that an employer deducts from an employee's paycheck and pays directly to the government. This commonly happens for two reasons. The first form of [withholding](/withholding) is common for all employees hoping to owe taxes throughout a tax year. Taxpayers complete a [W-4 form](/w4form) and give the employer a rundown of [withholding allowances](/withholdingallowance) that will reduce the tax retained by the employer. Withholding allowances include:

- Two-pay families.
- Dependents who fit the bill for the [Child Tax Credit](/childtaxcredit).
- Dependents beyond 17 years old.
- Itemized deductions in previous years.
- Large tax refunds or bills in previous years.

An employee who doesn't present a W-4 form will be treated as an unmarried person with no allowances and subsequently is subject to the highest conceivable withholding rate. W-4 forms can be refreshed whenever a taxpayer goes through a tremendous change in allowances. Taxpayers who have motivation to expect zero tax liability toward the end of the tax year can claim exemption from withholding.

## Retention Tax for Foreign Nationals

The second type of retention tax is what employers hold from the paychecks of foreign nationals working in the United States. Foreign nationals are generally subject to a federal withholding rate of 30%. Exemptions for this rule incorporate foreign nationals of countries that have specific [tax treaties](/taxtreaty) with the U.S., like Canada and Japan.

Whatever the justification for a tax withholding, the amount retained is an estimate of those taxes that the employee will owe toward the end of the [tax year](/taxyear). Allowances are intended to be an honest intentions endeavor at adjusting the withheld amounts to better mirror the year-end obligation. Taxpayers frequently receive a refund or are committed to make a year-end payment to accommodate withholding with their actual year-end tax bill.

In rare cases, firms that pay dividends or interest on investments are required to hold backup withholding on payments to people who have not given a tax identification number or who are of special interest to the IRS.

Employers must make quarterly reports of withheld taxes to the IRS by means of form 941, otherwise called the Employer's Quarterly Federal Tax Return. The IRS in some cases alludes to employers withholding taxes as withholding agents in official archives.

## Special Considerations

The Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act presented a piece of legislation called the Employee Retention Credit. This credit allowed eligible employers to reduce a portion of the employment tax deposits they withheld and are otherwise required to make. It was utilized as an incentive for employers to keep employees on payroll during the pandemic.

The credit was subsequently extended and amended when Congress passed the Taxpayer Certainty and Disaster Tax Relief Act of 2020, which was enacted December 27, 2020. The new variant of the credit allows eligible employers to claim a refundable tax credit against the employer share of Social Security tax equivalent to 70% of the qualified wages they pay to employees after December 31, 2020, through June 30, 2021. Qualified wages are limited to $10,000 per employee per calendar quarter in 2021. Hence, the maximum ERC amount accessible is $7,000 per employee per calendar quarter, for a total of $14,000 in 2021.
