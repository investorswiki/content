# Private Export Funding Corporation (PEFCO)
## What Is the Private Export Funding Corporation (PEFCO)?

The Private Export Funding Corporation (PEFCO) is a private-sector source of funding for financing exports from the United States. It was shaped by a group of commercial banks fully backed up by the United States [Export‐Import Bank](/ex-im-bank) (Ex-Im Bank or EXIM). It gives a broad scope of export finance programs, both as a direct lender and as a buyer in the secondary market of export loans originated by different lenders.

To be eligible for financing by PEFCO, loans must be guaranteed against non-installment by the Ex-Im Bank.

## Understanding the Private Export Funding Corporation (PEFCO)

The Private Export Funding Corporation (PEFCO) was incorporated in April 1970; its foundation was supported by the [U.S. Treasury](/ustreasury) and the Ex-Im Bank. Its shareholders contain commercial banks associated with export financing (these hold the majority of its shares), companies that export U.S. goods and services, and financial services companies.

Its primary business is making loans to foreign importers to finance their purchases of U.S. goods and services, and it means to supplement (not rival) the financing accessible through the Ex-Im Bank, commercial banks, and different institutions. Its lending activities mirror the insurance activities of the Ex-Im Bank.

As such, there is a PEFCO loan type accessible to match pretty much every insurance or guarantee offered by the Ex-Im Bank. Short-, medium-and long-term funding is all suitable, however there will be various attributes appended to every maturity type of funding.

> PEFCO's stock is owned by 26 U.S. commercial banks, one financial services company, and six industrial companies. On account of commercial banks, the shares are owned directly or through an affiliate.

Since all loans extended by PEFCO are guaranteed by the Ex-Im Bank or other U.S. government institutions backed by the full faith and credit of the United States, PEFCO depends upon this and doesn't make its own assessments of credit risks, evaluations of economic conditions in foreign countries or surveys of different factors in making its loans. The Exp-Im Bank is the primary export credit agency in the U.S., with an order to advance international trade by American businesses through financing export and import operations.

## Special Considerations

As of year-end 2020, PEFCO had assets of $4.87 billion. Assets and incomes fell over the first year because of an obvious drop in global commerce and transportation in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic that forced numerous businesses around the world to close and families to shelter in place in response to government lockdowns.

While incomes fell in 2020, PEFCO notes in its annual report that it hopes to proceed to operate and "has not been physically impacted" by the pandemic. Without a doubt, global delivery and international trade got in 2021.

## Features
