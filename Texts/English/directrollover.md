# Direct Rollover
## What Is a Direct Rollover?

A direct rollover is a qualified distribution of eligible assets from a [qualified plan](/qrp), 403(b) plan, or a legislative [457 plan](/457plan) into a traditional IRA, qualified plan, 403(b) plan, or an administrative 457 plan.

A direct rollover can likewise be a distribution from a [IRA](/ira) to a qualified plan, [403(b) plan](/403bplan) or a legislative 457 plan. A direct rollover really permits a retirement saver to transfer funds starting with one retirement account then onto the next without penalty and without making a taxable event.

## How Direct Rollovers Work

A [rollover](/ira-rollover) happens when one pulls out cash or different assets from one eligible retirement plan and contributes all or a portion of this to another eligible plan. The account owner might be subject to a penalty in the event that the transaction isn't completed in 60 days or less. The rollover transaction isn't taxable, except if the rollover is to a [Roth IRA](/rothira), however the IRS expects that account owners report this on their federal tax return.

To engineer a direct rollover, an account holder necessities to ask his plan administrator to draft a check and send it directly to the new 401(k) or IRA. In IRA-to-IRA transfers, the trustee from one plan sends the rollover amount to the trustee from the other plan. In the event that an account holder gets a check from his existing IRA or retirement account, they can cash it and deposit the funds into the new IRA. In any case, they must complete the cycle in the span of 60 days to stay away from income taxes on the withdrawal. Assuming they miss the 60-day cutoff time, the IRS deals with the amount like an early distribution.

### How They're Made Payable

Direct rollover assets are made payable to the qualified plan or IRA custodian or trustee and not to the individual. The distribution might be issued as a check made payable to the new account. For instance, in the event that an individual chooses to switch employers and move her retirement assets developed over the long haul in the first employer's retirement plan, she must facilitate with the plan administrator, frequently a [asset management](/assetmanagement) firm like Fidelity or Vanguard, to close the account and compose a check for the account balance to the new IRA custodian.

A few firms charge fees for this service despite the fact that they are normally not substantial. On the opposite end, firms frequently charge small fees to open new accounts. In the event that an employee is beginning a new position, frequently this new employer will expect the cost of setting up the new retirement account. Sometimes, the employee should stand by several years or a [vesting](/vesting) period before she might be eligible to open another retirement account and have her employer start making contributions.

## Direct Rollover and Qualified Retirement Plans

As indicated above, direct rollovers apply to qualified retirement plans. These are plans that meet certain criteria, for example, non-segregation among employees, to be eligible for certain tax benefits. These incorporate an employer taking a tax deduction for contributions they make to the arrangement, employees taking a tax deduction on their own contributions, and earnings on all contributions being tax-deferred until removed.

### Defined Benefit versus Defined Contribution

The two major types of qualified plans are [defined benefit](/definedbenefitpensionplan) plans and [defined contribution](/definedcontributionplan) plans. A defined benefit plan is a more traditional pension plan in which benefits depend on a specific formula, frequently including the number of long stretches of employee service times a salary factor. Defined contribution plans designate money to plan participants, in light of a percentage of every employee's earnings. The more drawn out the employee partakes in the plan, the higher the account balance develops, additionally founded on investment earnings.
