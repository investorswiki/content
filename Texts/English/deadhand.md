# Dead Hand Provision
## What Is a Dead Hand Provision?

A dead hand provision, otherwise called a dead hand [poison pill](/poisonpill), is a strategy used by a target company to avert the advances of a hostile takeover. When a certain number of shares have been purchased by the undesirable acquirer, new ones are naturally issued to each and every other existing shareholder, leading the hopeful proprietor's stock holdings, or percentage of ownership in the company, to turn out to be hugely [diluted](/weakening).

## Understanding a Dead Hand Provision

[Acquisitions](/acquisition) happen constantly, albeit not every one of them are invited by company management. Now and again the [board of directors](/boardofdirectors) (B of D), those calling the shots, will dismiss an offer to be bought out. When confronted with resistance, the closely involved individual could either surrender and continue on or go straightforwardly to the company's shareholders to scrounge up sufficient support to supplant management and possibly get the acquisition approved.

Should takeover advances turn [hostile](/hostiletakeover), a company's management could opt to utilize disputable strategies, like the poison pill, the [crown-jewel](/crownjewels) defense, or a [golden parachute](/goldenparachute), to defend its position. These measures fluctuate in nature however all share one thing practically speaking: Each of them is intended to put off the buyer by making the acquisition less appealing.

Like other poison pills, the job of a dead hand provision is to make the hostile takeover restrictively costly. When a hostile bidder procures a designated amount of the [target company's](/targetfirm) shares, regularly between 15% to 20%, the dead hand provision kicks in, permitting just eligible individuals from the Board of Directors to buy recently [issued shares](/issuedshares) at scaled down prices.

> A dead hand provision can be utilized to totally impede the advances of a predator or, in different cases, as a bargaining device to drive up the price of the acquisition. In the last option occasion, it turns into a negotiation device.
>

Abruptly, the stock held by the [acquirer](/acquirer) turns out to be less persuasive. Flooding the market with new shares weakens the value of the shares it previously purchased, decreasing its percentage of ownership and making it harder and more expensive to gain control.

## Analysis of a Dead Hand Provision

A hostile bidder can conquer a standard poison pill by sending off a [proxy contest](/proxyfight) and afterward choosing another board of directors to recover it. That is not the situation with dead hand provisions.

Dead hand provisions in shareholder rights plans bar anybody yet the directors who adopted them from revoking them. As such, that means existing directors can forestall the acceptance of an unsolicited offer, no matter what the shareholders' desires or the perspectives on the recently chosen directors.

Putting this power in the hands of the current board of directors has, maybe justifiably, produced a great deal of debates. The dead hand provision can act as a method for dragging out the tenure of ill suited and undesirable directors, as well as forestall the majority of [voting shareholders](/votingshares) from having something to do with regardless of whether they maintain that an acquisition should go for it.

Such perceptions have driven dead hand poison pills to be tested in certain locales, remembering for the famous business-accommodating state of Delaware. In 1998, the Delaware Supreme Court decided that dead-hand redemption provisions in stockholder rights plans are invalid defensive measures since they unreasonably disappoint shareholders.
