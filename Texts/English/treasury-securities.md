Investors find them attractive on the grounds that they make twice yearly interest payments and they have the highest credit rating (AAA) of all debt securities, and that means they are low risk. In addition, they are considered[ liquid](/liquidity), and that means they can be converted effectively into cash.
### What Are the 4 Types of Treasury Securities?
1. **Treasury bills (T-bills):** T-bills mature in 1 year or less and don't pay an interest rate, referred to in the bond world as the coupon rate. Thus, Treasury bills are otherwise called [zero-coupon bonds.](/zero-couponbond) Income is generated by giving the bond at a discounted price compared to its face value, or par value.
1. **Treasury notes (T-notes):** T-notes mature in 2, 3, 5, 7, or 10 years. They make coupon payments twice per year, either at a fixed or floating rate. The 10-year Treasury is the most widely quoted Treasury note and is utilized while calculating the slant of the[ yield curve](/yieldcurve), which is an important economic indicator.
1. **Treasury bonds (T-bonds):** [T-bonds](/treasurybond) mature in 20 or 30 years. These are the longest-term bonds and as such typically offer the highest coupon payments. They are likewise the most [volatile](/volatility), since bond prices move conversely to interest rates, which affect bond[ duration](/duration).
1. **Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS):** The principal of [Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities](/tips), or TIPS, is indexed to the rate of inflation consistently as estimated by the Consumer Price Index (CPI). In environments of high inflation, these bonds are worth more; when there's deflation, they are worth less. They likewise offer a coupon.

## Are Treasuries the Same as Bonds?

Treasury bills, Treasury notes, Treasury bonds, and TIPS are totally issued by the United States government. Not all bonds are viewed as Treasuries — for instance, states issue[ municipal bonds](/municipalbond), and corporations sell[ corporate bonds](/corporatebond) to finance operations or capital expenditures — but all Treasuries, no matter what their maturation, are classified as bonds.
## What Do Treasury Securities Do? How Do They Work?
Treasury securities help the U.S. government raise the funds it requirements to finance its operations — without increasing government rates. The absolute earliest Treasuries were war bonds, known as Liberty Bonds, created during World War I to help pay for the war effort. After World War I ended, Liberty Bonds started to arrive at maturity, but the government couldn't pay down the anywhere close to $22 billion investors had purchased, so it basically refinanced its debt with even more bonds, shifting in maturity length from short to medium to long-term.
At the point when Treasuries arrive at maturity, they arrive at par value, and set price is completely returned. In addition, a few Treasuries offer interest payments. While the short-term Treasury bills don't pay a coupon rate, any remaining Treasury securities offer an interest payment twice per year, either on a fixed or variable basis.
## What Are Treasury Security Rates?
The U.S. Department of the Treasury distributes yield rates for Treasuries on its website consistently after the market close. These rates depend on closing market prices for Treasuries obtained by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.
## Why Are Treasuries Considered "Risk-Free?"
Investors rush to Treasury securities since they receive the highest (AAA) credit rating and are backed by the "full faith and security" of the U.S. government, and that means their risk of default is virtually zero. That means they are virtually guaranteed to return both principal and interest upon maturity, and they can act as a pleasant method for adding diversification to a stock portfolio.
That doesn't mean Treasuries are risk-free, nonetheless. They have inflation risk, which can be estimated through their bond duration. What's more, longer-term Treasuries are particularly volatile to rising interest rates; when rates go up, bond prices fall, and vice versa.
