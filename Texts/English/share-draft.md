## What Is a Share Draft?

A share draft is a type of draft, which credit unions use, as a method for accessing funds in individual accounts. Share draft accounts at credit unions are the equivalent of individual checking accounts at standard banks. Nonetheless, these shares address partial ownership in a credit union, and credit union members (shareholders) compose drafts (checks) as a method for accessing the value of their partial ownership (shares). While it probably won't influence how you utilize the account, share draft accounts are a form of ownership. This means you are a partial owner of the credit union while checking account owners are customers of banks."

## How Share Drafts Work

Credit unions function uniquely in contrast to banks. In a credit union, each member is likewise a partial owner. Since credit unions are agreeably owned, members don't make [deposits](/store), yet rather purchase shares. Shares don't earn interest, however all things being equal, earn [dividends](/dividend). (A dividend is a distribution of a portion of an organization's earnings, chose by the board of directors or other managerial entity, paid to a class of its shareholders.)

Also, share draft accounts generally carry neither month to month fees nor [minimum balance](/least balance) requirements, dissimilar to many bank checking accounts. In traditional commercial banking, [service charges](/service-charge) assist with creating income from accounts that don't acquire sufficient interest revenue to cover the bank's expenses.

Charging fees when customers fail to keep a base balance (i.e., overdraw an account or compose too many checks) guarantees that these accounts keep on seeming to be OK for the institution.

## Special Considerations

Credit unions previously originated in 1844 in Rochdale, England, when a group of weavers laid out the Rochdale Society of Equitable Pioneers. This organization raised the capital to buy goods at discount prices, thusly giving the savings to their members.

Many think about Friederich W. Raiffeisen to be the pioneer behind the modern credit union. He laid out the Heddesdorf credit union in Germany in 1846. In 1901 credit unions were presented in Canada and showed up in the United States in 1908. The St. Mary's Bank Credit Union in Manchester, New Hampshire, was the principal credit union in the U.S.

Initially, membership in a credit union was limited to individuals who shared a "typical bond." For instance, they needed to work in a similar industry or for a similar company. Members could all live in a similar community.

Today, in any case, credit unions have relaxed membership limitations, permitting the overall population to join. On occasion traditional [retail banks](/retailbanking) have felt the pressure of competition from credit unions.
