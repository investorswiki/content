## How a Dry Loan Works

Like different types of mortgages, dry loans are [debt instruments](/debtinstrument) secured by the collateral of a predetermined real estate property, which permit people and organizations to purchase real estate without paying the full value of the property front and center. The borrower reimburses the loan, plus interest, with a predetermined set of payments over a period of years until they ultimately own the property. Assuming the borrower stops paying the mortgage, the bank can [foreclose](/abandonment).

Dry loans can be [fixed-rate mortgages](/fixed-rate_mortgage), where the borrower pays a similar interest rate for the life of the loan, or [adjustable-rate mortgages (ARMs)](/arm), which utilize a fixed interest rate for an initial term, after which the rate will vary in view of a specific market index.

In a dry mortgage, the seller receives no money from the lender until the loan documentation has been all fully screened and handled by the financial institution. In like that, dry funding gives an additional layer of protection to assist with guaranteeing the legality of the transaction. Since dry loans have a more slow [closing](/closing) process and no funds are dispensed at the closing, there is additional opportunity to address any issues that might emerge.
