# Base
## What Is Bottom?

A base is the lowest price traded or published by a financial security, [commodity](/commodity), or index inside a particular referenced time span. The time span can be a year, month, or even a [intraday](/intraday) period, but when referenced in financial media or studies, this term alludes to a critical low point of interest.

## Understanding Bottom

A price base is referenced for different reasons in financial publications. Commonly a relative base could act as anchor to reference returns starting there. Such returns are almost legendary in nature since investors rarely if at any time buy a security at the exact lowest point of trading â€” the lower part of a price trend for that period.

For instance, after the financial crisis of 2008, prices floated lower for about 10 weeks and put in a price base on March 9, 2009. After one year and from that point, many references were made in financial media publications to gains made measured starting there. Gains from the lowest point traded after a descending trending market [correction](/correction) or full blown [bear market](/bearmarket) in view of some sort of crisis or panic can be among the best trading gains in a lifetime, whenever accomplished. Thus, traders and investors are continually on the lookout for ways of distinguishing a market base.

With respect to an individual security, having the option to recognize a price base can help an investor or [technical analyst](/technical-analyst) gauge the trading range for a security during a year or months-significant stretch. This can give guidance to security valuations going ahead and inform investing choices. Having the option to buy close to the base in a given year can substantially further develop returns for that year. Technical analysts usually study the whole history of a security's price developments, short-term trading levels, and a security's trading volume and search for patterns that distinguish when the security will put in a relative base.

In the event that a stock has reached as far down as possible, it means that it arrived at its low point and could be in the beginning phases of an upward [trend](/trend). Frequently a base can be a signal for a reversal. Investors frequently consider a base to be an opportunity to purchase a stock when the security is underpriced or trading at its lowest value. In [technical analysis](/technicalanalysis), a base is recognized as the lowest level of support while charting a security.

## Illustration of Bottoms

Most technical analysts use [channel trading](/tradingchannel) systems which chart resistance and support levels for a security over the long run. Two of the most common price channels include [Bollinger Band\u00ae](/bollingerbands) and [Donchian Channels](/donchianchannels). Trading channels can be helpful in foreseeing and furthermore recognizing a base since bottoms usually occur at or close to the support levels in a channel charting system. Thusly, bottoms are likewise commonly a signal for a reversal.

A single base followed by a reversal will frequently form a U-shaped pattern. These patterns may likewise be called a rising or ascending base. This is a trading pattern with a base that follows with step steps that move upward after some time. In a rising base, the stock gradually starts a bullish trend higher. This pattern is a popular buy signal for some traders.

A [double bottom](/doublebottom) is a price pattern in which a stock drops in price and afterward rebounds two times during a specific period of time. Say, for instance, the price of XYZ [common stock](/commonstock) drops $5 per share to $20 and afterward rebounds to $26. After three weeks, the stock again drops to a price close $20 per share and rebounds once more, which makes a stock price chart that seems to be the letter W. Most traders are aware of a security's base trading level and are cautious of double bottoms. Securities rebounding from base levels might return to the base price level several times.
