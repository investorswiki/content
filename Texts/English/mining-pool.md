# Mining Pool
## What Is a Mining Pool?

A mining pool is a joint group of [cryptocurrency](/cryptocurrency) miners who consolidate their computational resources over a network to reinforce the likelihood of finding a [block](/block-bitcoin-block) or in any case effectively mining for cryptocurrency.

## How a Mining Pool Works

Individually, participants in a mining pool contribute their processing power toward the work of finding a block. On the off chance that the pool is fruitful in these efforts, they receive a reward, normally as the associated cryptocurrency.

Rewards are normally split between the individuals who contributed, as per the extent of every individual's processing power or work relative to the whole group. Now and again, individual miners must show [proof of work](/proof-work) to receive their rewards.

> Rewards are normally split among the miners in light of the agreed terms and on their particular contributions to the mining activity.

Any individual who needs to create a gain through cryptocurrency mining has the decision to either go it alone with their own dedicated gadgets or to join a mining pool where different miners and their gadgets consolidate to improve their [hashing](/hash) output. For instance, joining six mining gadgets that each offers 335 megahashes each second (MH/s) can generate a cumulative 2 gigahashes of mining power, in this manner leading to quicker processing of the hash function.

## Mining Pool Methods

Not all cryptocurrency mining pools function similarly. There are, notwithstanding, a number of common protocols that oversee a considerable lot of the most famous mining pools.

Proportional mining pools are among the most common. In this type of pool, miners adding to the pool's processing power receive shares up until the place where the pool prevails with regards to finding a block. From that point forward, miners receive rewards proportional to the number of shares they hold.

Pay-per-share pools operate to some degree comparably in that every miner receives shares for their contribution. Nonetheless, these pools give instant payouts paying little mind to when the block is found. A miner adding to this type of pool can exchange shares for a proportional payout whenever.

Peer-to-peer mining pools, in the interim, aim to forestall the pool structure from becoming centralized. In that capacity, they integrate a separate blockchain connected with the actual pool and intended to keep the operators of the pool from cheating as well as the actual pool from flopping due to a single central issue.

## Benefits of a Mining Pool

While progress in individual mining awards complete ownership of the reward, the chances of achieving achievement is exceptionally low due to high power and resource requirements. Mining is in many cases not a profitable venture for individuals. Numerous cryptocurrencies have become progressively challenging to mine in recent years as the prominence of these digital currencies has developed and the costs associated with costly hardware important to be a competitive miner as well as power generally offset the possible rewards.

Mining pools require less of every individual participant in terms of hardware and power costs and increase the chances of profitability. Though an individual miner could have little possibility of effectively finding a block and getting a mining reward, collaborating with others emphatically further develops the achievement rate.

## Drawbacks of a Mining Pool

By partaking in a mining pool, individuals surrender a portion of their autonomy in the mining system. They are regularly limited by terms set by the actual pool, which might direct the way that the mining system is drawn closer. They are likewise required to split any expected rewards, implying that the share of profit is lower for an individual participating in a pool.

A small number of mining pools, like AntPool, Poolin, and F2Pool overwhelm the bitcoin mining process, as per blockchain.com. Albeit many pools really do really try to be [decentralized](/decentralizedmarket), these groups consolidate a significant part of the authority to oversee the [bitcoin](/bitcoin) protocol. For some cryptocurrency defenders, the presence of a small number of powerful mining pools conflicts with the decentralized structure inherent in bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.

## Highlights
- On the off chance that the mining pool is fruitful and receives a reward, that reward is split between participants in the pool.
- Cryptocurrency mining pools are groups of miners who share their computational resources.
- Mining pools use these combined resources to reinforce the likelihood of finding a block or in any case effectively mining for cryptocurrency.
