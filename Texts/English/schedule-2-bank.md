## What Is a Schedule II Bank?

A Schedule II bank is a subsidiary of a foreign bank that is permitted to carry on with work in Canada. Commonly, the names of these banks mirror their foreign subsidiary nature, for example, Citibank Canada and the Amex Bank of Canada.

A Schedule I bank is a domestic institution, for example, the Royal Bank of Canada or Toronto-Dominion Bank. There additionally are Schedule III banks, which are parts of foreign institutions that carry on with work in Canada under a similar name.

This system of government order of banks was authoritatively discontinued in 2001. Strangely, be that as it may, the terms remain widely being used.

## Figuring out the Schedule II Bank

Schedule II banks are the most common type of bank in Canada, as large numbers of the more modest credit unions, trusts, and banks fit into this category. Like all financial institutions operating in Canada, they are regulated by the federal Bank Act.

Under Canada's Bill C-8, executed on Oct. 24, 2001, the Schedule I and II bank categories were supplanted with another system in light of the institution's size. Under this legislation, institutions with more than $5 billion in equity are prohibited from permitting one individual to claim over 20% of the voting shares or 30% of the non-voting shares.

Institutions with values of $1 billion to $5 billion don't have this restriction yet are required to have public ownership of something like 35% of voting shares. Institutions with under $1 billion in equity have no ownership restrictions.

Albeit the Schedule I and II bank assignments have accordingly been supplanted, these terms are still widely used to portray the two principal types of banks in Canada.
