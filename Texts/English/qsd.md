# Quality Spread Differential (QSD)
## What Is Quality Spread Differential (QSD)?

Quality spread differential (QSD) is utilized to compute the difference between market [interest rates](/interestrate) that two gatherings possibly going into a [interest rate swap](/interestrateswap) are able to accomplish. A measurement companies can use to check [counterparty risk](/counterpartyrisk) in an interest rate swap.

## Figuring out Quality Spread Differential (QSD)

QSD is a measure involved by companies of various creditworthiness in interest rate [swap](/swap) analysis. They utilize a QSD to measure [default risk](/defaultrisk). At the point when the QSD is positive, the swap is considered to benefit the two players included.

A quality spread gives a [credit quality](/creditquality) measure for the two players engaged with an interest rate swap. The quality differential is calculated by taking away the contracted market rate by the rate available to the counter-party on comparative rate instruments.

The difference between the two quality spreads can be calculated as follows:

- **QSD = Fixed-rate debt premium differential - Floating-rate debt premium differential **

The fixed-rate debt differential is ordinarily bigger than that of the floating-rate debt.

> Bond investors can utilize the quality spread to conclude whether higher yields are worth the extra risk.

## Interest Rate Swaps

Interest rate swaps trade on institutional market exchanges or through direct agreements between [counterparties](/counterparty). They permit one entity to swap their [credit risk](/creditrisk) with one more utilizing various types of credit instruments.

A regular interest rate swap will incorporate a [fixed rate](/fixedinterestrate) and a [floating rate](/floatinginterestrate). A company that tries to [hedge](/hedge) against paying higher rates on its floating-rate bonds in a rising rate environment would swap the floating-rate debt for fixed-rate debt. The counterparty takes the contrary perspective on the market and accepts rates will fall, so it maintains that the floating-rate debt should pay off its obligations and get a profit.

For instance, a bank might swap its floating-rate bond debt as of now at 6% for a fixed-rate bond debt of 6%. Companies can match debt with shifting maturity lengths relying upon the swap contract length. Each company consents to the swap utilizing the instruments it has issued.

## Quality Spread Differential (QSD) Example

This is an illustration of the way QSDs work. Company A, swapping its floating-rate debt, will receive a fixed rate. Company B, swapping its fixed-rate debt, will receive a floating rate. The QSD is normally not calculated in view of the rates of the instruments utilized. The creditworthiness of the two companies is unique.

In the event that Company A (AAA-rated) utilizes a two-year term floating-rate debt at 6% and Company B (BBB-rated) utilizes a five-year fixed-rate debt at 6%, then, at that point, the QSD would should be calculated in light of the rates versus the market rates.

Company A's 6% rate on the two-year floating-rate debt compares to a 7% rate got for Company B on a two-year floating-rate debt, so this quality spread is 1%. For a five-year fixed-rate debt, Company A pays 4% where Company B pays 6%, so the quality spread is 2%. The key is to involve comparative products in the quality spread calculation to compare rates of comparative issues.

In the model over, this would be 2% minus 1%, bringing about a QSD of 1%. Keep in mind, a positive QSD demonstrates a swap is in the interest of the two players since there is a favorable default risk. If the AAA-rated company had a fundamentally higher floating-rate premium to the lower credit quality company, it would bring about a negative QSD. This would probably make the higher-rated company look for a higher-rated partner.
