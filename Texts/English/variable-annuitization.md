## What Is Variable Annuitization?

Variable Annuitization is an annuity option where the amount of the income payments received by the policyholder will differ as per the investment performance of the [annuity](/annuity). Variable annuitization is one option that can be chosen by the policyholder during the [annuitization phase](/annuitizationphase) of a contract, which is the phase where the policyholder exchanges the accumulated value of the annuity for a surge of normal income payments guaranteed forever or guaranteed for a predefined number of years.

## Grasping Variable Annuitization

There are two phases to the life of an annuity. During the [accumulation phase](/accumulationphase), an investor adds into the annuity, with all earnings that accrue during this phase being exempt from current income tax. When a policyholder is ready to begin getting income from the annuity, they can decide to: Make withdrawals (on an impromptu or systematic basis) or annuitize the contract and choose either fixed or variable payments.

During the [annuitization phase](/annuitizationphase), for annuities purchased with after-tax dollars, a fixed amount of every payment is treated as a non-taxable return of the original basis, and the balance is taxed as income. On the other hand, all annuity income received through withdrawals is generally taxed as income until all the earnings have been removed.

After all earnings have been removed, withdrawals are non-taxable returns of the original (already taxed) investment in the annuity. For annuities purchased with pre-tax dollars, all income — whether through annuitization or from withdrawals — is completely taxable as ordinary income.

Purchasing an annuity can give a level of income security, however can likewise lock in funds into a specific product that may not perform as well true to form.
