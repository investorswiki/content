# The Golden Rule of Government Spending
## What Is the Golden Rule of Government Spending?

The golden rule, in accordance with [fiscal policy](/fiscalpolicy), specifies that a government must just borrow to invest, and not to finance existing spending. All in all, the government ought to borrow money just to fund investments that will benefit people in the future, while current spending must be covered and funded by existing or new taxes.

## Understanding the "Golden Rule"

The "golden rule" term starts from old works, and can be found in the New Testament, the Talmud, and the Koran. Each has a story that shows the golden rule: **Do unto others as you would have them do unto you.** In fiscal policy, the golden rule tries to shield people in the future from being overburdened by debt by restricting borrowed money just to investments, and not to burden people in the future for the benefit of current expenditures.

This golden rule in fiscal policy has been effectively executed in numerous countries. Despite the fact that its specific application fluctuates from one country to another, the fundamental reason of spending not as much as what the government takes in is generally at its foundation. In many countries that have adopted the rule, a change in their constitution was required to guarantee its legitimate application. Countries that have applied some form of the golden rule have encountered a reduction in deficits as a share of gross domestic product ([GDP](/gdp)), after numerous long stretches of deep [deficit spending](/deficit-spending).

## Global Applications of the Golden Rule

Switzerland initiated a debt brake that limits government spending to the projected average revenue for the current [business cycle](/businesscycle). Switzerland has managed to keep its spending growth to under 2% each year beginning around 2004. In the interim, expanding economic output at a quicker rate than its spending has been able.

Germany applied a comparable debt brake, which managed to reduce spending growth to below 0.2% somewhere in the range of 2003 and 2007, making a [budget surplus](/budget-surplus). Canada, New Zealand, and Sweden attempted similar analysis at different times, which transformed deficits into surpluses. The [European Union](/europeanunion) has left on its own variation of the golden rule, requiring all countries whose debts are higher than 55% of GDP to reduce their structural deficit to 0.5% of GDP or less.

## No Golden Rule for the United States

The United States presently can't seem to systematize any golden rule that would require a spending cap, in spite of the fact that there have been various endeavors by lawmakers to do as such. The U.S. Constitution doesn't need a [balanced budget](/balanced-budget), nor does it impose any limits on spending or issuance of [sovereign debt](/sovereign-debt).

The budget surpluses under President Clinton during the 1990s were a consequence of impermanent policies that included tax increases and some spending reductions. In 1985, Congress passed the Gramm-Rudmann-Hollings bill, which determined annual deficit targets that, whenever missed, would trigger an automatic [sequestration](/sequestration) process. The Supreme Court ruled the law was unlawful, thus it was abandoned.
