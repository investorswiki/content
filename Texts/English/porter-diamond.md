# Porter Diamond
## What Is the Porter Diamond?

The Porter Diamond, appropriately alluded to as the Porter Diamond Theory of National Advantage, is a model that is intended to help comprehend the [competitive advantage](/competitive_advantage) that nations or gatherings have due to certain factors accessible to them, and to make sense of how governments can act as impetuses to advance a country's position in a globally competitive economic environment. The model was made by Michael Porter, a recognized authority on corporate strategy and economic competition, and pioneer behind the Institute for Strategy and Competitiveness at the [Harvard Business School](/harvard-business). It is a proactive economic theory, instead of one that just measures competitive advantages that a country or region might have. The Porter Diamond is additionally alluded to as "Porter's Diamond" or the "Diamond Model."

## Grasping the Porter Diamond

The Porter Diamond recommends that countries can make new factor advantages for themselves, like a strong technology industry, skilled labor, and government support of a country's economy. Most traditional speculations of global economics vary by referencing components, or factors, that a country or region inherently has, like land, location, natural resources, labor, and population size as the primary determinants in a country's competitive economic advantage. One more application of the Porter Diamond is in corporate strategy, to use as a structure to dissect the relative benefits of investing and operating in different national markets.

## How the Porter Diamond Works

The Porter Diamond is outwardly addressed by a diagram that looks like the four points of a diamond. The four points address four interrelated determinants that Porter guesses as the game changers of national comparative economic advantage. These four factors are firm strategy, structure and rivalry; related supporting industries; demand conditions; and factor conditions. These could here and there at any point likewise be considered comparable to the eponymous powers of [Porter's Five Forces model](/porter) of business strategy.

Firm strategy, structure, and rivalry allude to the fundamental fact that competition prompts businesses finding ways of expanding production and to the development of mechanical innovations. The concentration of market power, degree of competition, and ability of rival firms to enter a country's market are compelling here. This point is connected with the powers of contenders and barriers to new market contestants in the Five Forces model.

Related supporting industries allude to upstream and downstream industries that work with innovation through trading thoughts. These can spike innovation relying upon the degree of transparency and information transfer. Related supporting industries in the Diamond model compare to the providers and customers who can address either dangers or opportunities in the Five Forces model.

Demand conditions allude to the size and nature of the customer base for products, which likewise drives innovation and product improvement. Larger, more dynamic consumer markets will demand and invigorate a need to separate and improve, as well as just greater market scale for businesses.

## The Importance of Factor Conditions

The last determinant, and the main one as per Porter's theory, is that of factor conditions. Factor conditions are those components that Porter accepts a country's [economy](/economy) can make for itself, for example, a large pool of [skilled labor](/skilled-labor), mechanical innovation, [infrastructure](/infrastructure), and capital.

For instance, Japan has developed a competitive global economic presence past the country's inherent resources, in part by creating an extremely high number of engineers that have helped drive mechanical innovation by Japanese industries.

Porter contends that the components of factor conditions are more important in deciding a country's competitive advantage than naturally inherited factors like land and natural resources. He further recommends that a primary job of government in driving a country's economy is to energize and provoke businesses inside the country to zero in on the creation and development of the components of factor conditions. One way for the government to achieve that goal is to invigorate competition between domestic companies by laying out and upholding against trust laws.
