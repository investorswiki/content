## What Is Net Volume?

Net volume is a [technical indicator](/technicalindicator) calculated by deducting a security's [uptick volume](/uptickvolume) by its [downtick volume](/downtickvolume) over a predetermined period of time. Not at all like standard volume, the indicator separates whether the market sentiment is inclining bullish or bearish. Net volume is commonly plotted below the price chart with bars for every period demonstrating the net volume perusing for that period.

## Grasping Net Volume

Net volume is utilized by traders to evaluate [market sentiment](/marketsentiment) past the utilization of standard volume. Positive net volume proposes that a security is encountering a bullish rise, while negative net volume recommends that a security is encountering a bearish [downswing](/downswing).

For instance, assume that a [thinly traded](/thinly-traded) stock experienced five downward trades at 200 shares a piece, moving down a total of five percent, and one vertical trade at 10,000 shares, moving the stock up three percent. The stock might have closed two percent lower, yet the net volume would have been a positive 9,000, proposing that the [momentum](/momentum) has truly been bullish deep down.

Numerous traders utilize net volume related to different forms of [technical analysis](/technicalanalysis), including technical indicators and chart designs, while searching for expected opportunities. For example, traders could confirm that a stock broke out from a key [resistance level](/resistance) and afterward take a gander at net volume to decide how much buying pressure is behind the move and on the off chance that there's sufficient momentum moving forward.

## Contrasting Net Volume

Net volume is like numerous other momentum indicators that glance at volume alongside different factors. Dissimilar to these different indicators, net volume takes a gander at volume throughout a single time span.

For instance, net volume is like the [money flow index](/mfi), in that both technical indicators measure market interest in a given security, however the MFI utilizes both price and volume to measure buying and selling pressure as opposed to just checking volume out. Net volume is likewise like [on balance volume](/onbalancevolume), in that both technical indicators see volume changes, yet OBV includes up volume up days and down days after some time as opposed to checking a single period out. Different indicators, similar to the [relative strength index](/rsi), take a gander at the size of gains or losses to give experiences.

Numerous traders will quite often utilize more complex momentum indicators than net volume while dissecting opportunities, yet it might in any case play a job in certain situations where the trader needs to take a gander at a single period as it were.
