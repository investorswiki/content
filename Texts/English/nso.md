# Non-Qualified Stock Option (NSO)
## What are non-qualified stock options?
Non-qualified stock options are stock options that don't receive ideal tax treatment when exercised yet give extra adaptability to the responsible company. Gains from non-qualified stock options are taxed as normal income. The company that grants non-qualified stock options can deduct the cost as an operating expense, while no such deduction is accessible for [incentive stock options](/iso).
## More profound definition
Stock options are granted by certain companies as a form of [deferred compensation](/deferred-compensation). They grant employees and certain different gatherings the right to purchase a given number of the company's shares at a fixed price — called the grant price or the [strike price](/strikeprice) — after a brief time span has gone by. Holders for the most part exercise stock options when the market price has transcended the grant price, giving them a discount on the shares. They either hold the shares got in the exercise of a stock option, or sell them quickly for a profit.
Motivating force stock options — likewise alluded to as qualified stock options — may possibly be exercised in the event that the market price is equivalent to the grant price. In the event that the price is lower than the grant price, it would involve paying a premium for the shares. Non-qualified stock options might be sold at any market price, either higher or lower than the grant price.
While non-qualified stock options carry less great tax treatment for the holder than qualified stock options, they offer different benefits. Non-qualified stock options can be issue to anybody — employees, board individuals, merchants — while qualified stock options may just be issued to employees. There are no restrictions on the total market value of stock that can be exercised by a given holder, while there are severe limitations on the total market value of motivation stock options that can be exercised in one calendar year.
The greatest advantage for companies is that insofar as withholding obligations are met, they can deduct the cost of granting non-qualified stock options as an operating expense. These costs are equivalent to the gain declared by the holder, which the individual in question reports as [ordinary income](/ordinaryincome).
## Nonqualified stock options model
An employee exercises his option to purchase stock at a strike price of $25 per share for 100 shares. The current market value of the stock is $45 per share. The employee pays $2,500 for stock that is valued at $4,500. This is a gain of $2,000. Since these are nonqualified stock options, the employee is required to pay income taxes on the $2,000 in compensation.
The employee just pays income taxes on the compensation element once. At the point when he chooses to sell the stock, he is required to pay taxes on the gain. The employee might hold on until the stock price comes to $50 per share to sell. He would pay taxes on the difference between the sale price ($5,000) and the cost basis ($4,500), which is the real price paid plus the compensation element.
