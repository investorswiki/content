# Orphan Drug Credit
## What Is the Orphan Drug Credit?

The orphan drug credit is a federal [tax credit](/taxcredit) that gives drug companies incentives to foster prescriptions and treatments for rare diseases that influence small populaces. The credit is intended to assist drug companies with bringing down their developmental costs.

The credit is for 25% of qualified clinical testing expenses. A rare disease is one that influences under 200,000 individuals in the United States, or one that influences in excess of 200,000 individuals however for which there is no reasonable expectation that a treatment can be profitably developed.

## Understanding the Orphan Drug Credit

The orphan drug credit can be guaranteed whether the drug company performs clinical tests itself or contracts out to an outsider. Much of the time, testing must happen in the U.S. Orphan drugs are drugs developed to treat supposed "orphan diseases," which is a term to portray incredibly rare medical conditions like Gaucher's disease, Tourette's syndrome, Huntington's disease, and numerous different problems.

Regardless of being rare, orphan diseases influence a large number of individuals. An estimated 30 million individuals in the U.S. experience the ill effects of 7,000 rare diseases, yet 95% of these diseases have no treatment or fix.

The orphan drug tax credit is intended to energize the development of treatments for these rare diseases. Without these tax credits, drug companies would be forced to charge high prices that impacted patients would never manage.

## History of the Orphan Drug Credit

In 1982, the U.S. [Food and Drug Administration](/fda) (FDA) recognized the lack of incentive for drug companies to foster remedies for rare diseases. From this realization, the Orphan Drug Act of 1983 was conceived.

Before the Orphan Drug Act was passed, drug companies and medical specialists couldn't and reluctant to invest in treatments for very rare diseases. There basically weren't an adequate number of patients for each orphan disease for drug companies to recuperate their expenses, let alone create a gain. Clinical trials cost great many dollars per patient even when specialists can track down an adequate number of patients to run trials.

Somewhere in the range of 1983 and 2018, the orphan drug tax credit gave a half credit to qualified clinical testing costs for drugs tried under section 505(i) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. A 2017 upgrade of the tax code under the Donald Trump administration decreased the credit from half to 25% beginning in 2018. The National Organization for Rare Disorders and numerous other advocacy bunches battled against the move.
