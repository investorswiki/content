It permits you to figure out your sales, when to order more inventory, how to deal with the cost of your inventory, as well as the amount of your inventory is making it into the hands of consumers, rather than being taken or broken.

The retail inventory method ought to possibly be utilized when there is a reasonable relationship between the price at which merchandise is purchased from a [wholesaler](/wholesaling) and the price at which it is sold to customers. For instance, in the event that a dress store increases each thing it sells by 100% of the wholesale price, it could accurately utilize the retail inventory method, however assuming that it increases a few things by 20%, some by 35%, and some by 67%, applying this method with accuracy can be troublesome.

The cost-to-retail ratio, likewise called the cost-to-retail percentage, gives how much a decent's retail price is comprised of costs. In the event that, for instance, an iPhone costs $300 to fabricate and it sells for $500 each, the cost-to-retail ratio is 60% (or $300/$500) * 100 to move the decimal.

- New Purchases: $500,000
- Total goods ready to move: $1,500,000
- Sales: $1,080,000 (Sales of $1,800,000 x 60% cost-to-retail ratio)
