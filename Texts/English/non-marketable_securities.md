# Non-Marketable Security
## What Is a Non-Marketable Security?

A non-marketable security is an asset that is hard to buy or sell due to the way that they are not traded on any major [secondary market exchanges](/secondarymarket). Such [securities](/security), frequently forms of debt or fixed-income securities, are generally just bought and sold through private transactions or in a [over-the-counter (OTC)](/otc) market.

For the holder of a non-marketable security, finding a buyer can be troublesome, and a few non-marketable securities can't be resold at all since government regulations restrict any resale. A non-marketable security might be diverged from a [marketable security](/marketablesecurities), which is listed on an exchange and effectively traded.

## Non-Marketable Securities Explained

Most non-marketable securities are government-issued debt instruments. Common instances of nonmarketable securities incorporate U.S. savings bonds, rural zap certificates, private shares, state and nearby government securities, and federal government series bonds. Non-marketable securities that are denied from being resold, like [U.S. savings bonds](/ussavingsbonds), are required to be held until maturity.

Limited partnership investments are an illustration of a private security that might be nonmarketable due to the difficulty of reselling. Another model is private shares held by an owner of a company that isn't publicly traded. The way that these shares are non-marketable isn't typically an obstruction for the owner except if they wish to give up ownership or control of the company.

The U.S. government issues both marketable and non-marketable debt securities. The most widely held marketable securities incorporate U.S. [Treasury bills](/treasurybill) and Treasury bonds, the two of which are unreservedly traded in the U.S. bond market.

## The Rationale Behind Non-Marketable Securities

The primary explanation that some debt securities are deliberately issued as non-marketable is a perceived need to guarantee stable ownership of the money the security addresses. Non-marketable securities are much of the time sold at a discount to their face value and redeemable for face value at maturity. The gain for an investor is then the difference between the purchase price of the security and its face value amount.

## Difference Between Marketable and Non-Marketable Securities

Marketable securities are those that are openly traded in a secondary market. The principal difference among marketable and nonmarketable securities spins around the concepts of [market value](/marketvalue) and intrinsic, or book, value. Marketable securities have both a marketable value, one which is subject to possibly unstable variance as per the changing levels of demand for the security in the trading marketplace. Consequently, marketable securities generally carry a higher level of risk than nonmarketable securities.

Non-marketable securities, be that as it may, are not subject to the demand changes in a secondary trading market and, therefore, have just their [intrinsic value](/intrinsicvalue), yet no market value. The intrinsic value of a non-marketable security, contingent upon the structure of the security, can be considered as either its face value, the amount payable upon maturity or its purchase price plus interest.
