## Early Life and Education

Merton Miller was brought into the world in Boston, Massachusetts on May 16, 1923. He graduated with a four year certification from Harvard University in 1944 and earned a Ph.D. in 1952 from Johns Hopkins University. During World War II, Miller functioned as an economist for the federal government in the Division of Tax Research of the U.S. Treasury Department and in this way in the Division of Research and Statistics of the Board of Governors of the [Federal Reserve System](/federalreservesystem) (FRS).

Miller started a long career in scholarly community as a visitor speaker at the London School of Economics before getting a post at Carnegie Mellon's Graduate School of Industrial Administration. In 1961, Miller joined the staff at the University of Chicago where he remained until the end of his career.

## Modigliani-Miller Theorem

All through his career, Miller's research centered around [corporate finance](/corporatefinance) and the economic and regulatory issues of the financial services industry.

While a teacher at Carnegie Mellon's graduate school, Miller met economist and MIT graduate, [Franco Modigliani](/franco-modigliani). The team worked together and distributed the first of their joint "M&M" papers on corporate finance in 1958. "The Cost of Capital, Corporate Finance and the Theory of Investment" would be the basis of the Modigliani-Miller theorem. The theorem later appeared in the papers and compositions of the two men and was explained upon by others too. At that point, Carnegie-Mellon was respected for its educational plan in behavioral economics, and Miller and Modigliani embraced the critical thinking approach supported at the University.

The [Modigliani-Miller Theorem](/modigliani-millertheorem), distributed in 1958, makes sense of that the mix of equity and debt used to finance a company is irrelevant to the association's value. Merton Miller broadly equated his theory to a joke told by baseball catcher Yogi Berra. Berra once let his coach know that he was especially eager, and he trained him to cut his pizza into 12 pieces rather than six. The jest delineates the commended theorem about a company's capital structure that Miller conceived with Modigliani. A company's value is independent of the way things are financed, similar as the size of a pizza is independent of how you cut it.

## Striking Accomplishments

All through his career and into retirement, Miller kept on being engaged with the study and verbalization of issues inside corporate finance. He filled in as a public director on the Chicago Board of Trade and the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. In 1995, he was retained as a consultant by the [NASDAQ](/nasdaq) to research issues of cost fixing on the exchange.
