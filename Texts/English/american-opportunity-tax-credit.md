# American Opportunity Tax Credit (AOTC)
## What is the American Opportunity Tax Credit?
The American Opportunity Tax Credit (AOTC) is a tax break that the government offers to eligible students signing up for a higher-education institution. As part of President Barack Obama's 2009 stimulus package, the AOTC covers the first $2,500 of educational expenses for families that fall inside a certain income bracket.
## More profound definition
To be the eligible for the AOTC, the student must be chasing after a recognized education certification or degree, can't have completed her initial four years of higher education toward the beginning of the tax year, and must be enrolled in some measure half time for no less than one scholarly period that tax year. Moreover, the student must not have been sentenced for a lawful offense drug charge. The AOTC can be claimed just once per student each tax year.
Taxpayers who paid the qualified educational expenses of a student are eligible to claim the full AOTC amount in the event that they are [single-filers](/filingstatus) whose modified [adjusted gross income](/agi) is $80,000 or less or are married, filing jointly, and earning $160,000 or less. Qualified educational expenses are those required for enrollment at the student's school like tuition, fees, and course materials, however they do exclude room and board, medical expenses and [insurance](/insurance), or transportation. The AOTC might in fact be claimed when the expenses are paid for with a student loan.
The credit applies to 100 percent of the first $2,000 of qualified educational expenses and 25 percent of the next $2,000. A little less than half of the amount left over in the wake of covering the student's expenses, up to $1,000, will be [refunded](/discount) to the taxpayer in the event that the AOTC decreases the taxes she owes to zero. The AOTC can't be claimed when the student receives a grant or [grant](/pell-grant) that pays for all his educational expenses.
## American Opportunity Tax Credit model
Orson is an undergraduate this spring, yet when he graduates he'll begin graduate school in the fall. He just claimed the AOTC for quite a long time of college, and desires to claim it for the main year of graduate school. Since he's still inside the income threshold, and has qualified educational expenses, he stays qualified for the AOTC. At the point when he begins graduate school, he can claim the AOTC for the whole taxable year. Nonetheless, in light of the fact that that year will be his fourth of claiming the AOTC, Orson will not have the option to claim it in the future.
