# Forfeited Share
## What Is a Forfeited Share?

A forfeited share is a share in a public corporation that the owner loses (or relinquishes) by forgetting to satisfy quite a few purchase requirements. For instance, a forfeiture might happen on the off chance that a shareholder neglects to pay an owed allotment ([call money](/call-money)), or on the other hand in the event that he sells or transfers his shares during a restricted period.

At the point when a share is forfeited, the shareholder no longer owes any leftover balance and gives up any likely capital gain on the shares, which automatically return to the ownership of the responsible company.

## How Forfeited Shares Work

Assume an investor named David consents to buy 5,000 [shares](/shares) of a company, with a 25% initial payment requirement, trailed by three subsequent annual 25% installments, that are due as indicated by a schedule directed by the company. In the event that David is forsaken on a scheduled installment, the company might decide to hold onto his whole 5,000 shares, and David unfortunately would lose any money he recently paid.

> Corporations are not required to hold onto shares from delinquent shareholders, and can rather offer investors grace periods in which to pay the money that is owed.

## Employee Share Forfeiture

In certain cases, companies offer [employee stock purchase plans](/espp), where employees might distribute a portion of their salaries toward purchasing discounted shares of a company's stock. Be that as it may, these programs frequently accompany limitations. By and large, a stock can't be sold or moved inside a defined period of time after the initial purchase.

Moreover, on the off chance that an employee stops the company before a certain mandatory waiting period, he might be committed to relinquish any shares he purchased. Conflictingly, in the event that an employee stays with the company for a stated duration of time, he turns out to be completely vested in those shares and may cash them in voluntarily.

> When an employee relinquishes shares of stock purchased through an employee stock purchase plan, he may not at any point receive those shares again, should the company reissue them.

## Illustration of Forfeited Shares

Companies utilize stock purchase plans to rouse employee loyalty. Along these lines, companies offer employees bonuses as restricted stock units, which they gradually convey after some time. For instance, an employee could receive 80 restricted stock units as part of an annual bonus. Yet, to tempt this valued employee to wait longer, the stock vests the initial 20 units in the second year after the bonus, 20 in year three, 20 in year four, and 20 in year five. Assuming the employee stops after year two, just 20 units of stocks would be vested, and the other 60 would be forfeited.

## Reissue of Forfeited Shares

Forfeited shares become the property of the responsible company, which is qualified for either reissue the shares [at par](/at-par), at a premium, or a discount (at a price below their nominal value). This decision rests in the hands of a company's board of directors, which ordinarily reissues forfeited shares at a discount.

Yet, assuming the shares were initially issued at par, the maximum discount for the reissued stock is equivalent to the amount forfeited on the shares. Besides, on the off chance that a company's articles of association permits, the board might reissue forfeited shares to an outsider, however may not reissue those shares back to the defaulting shareholder.

## Features
- The responsible company can reissue forfeited shares at anything that price they need; typically, the reissue is at a discount to the initial price.
- Forfeited shares return to the responsible company, for example, when an employee stops before stock options have completely vested.
- Shares in public corporations that an owner loses or surrenders by neglecting to respect certain purchase agreements or limitations are viewed as forfeited.
- With forfeited shares, the shareholder no longer owes any excess balance and is surrendering any conceivable gain on the shares.
