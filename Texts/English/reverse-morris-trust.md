# Reverse Morris Trust (RMT)
## What Is a Reverse Morris Trust (RMT)?

A reverse Morris trust (RMT) is a tax-improvement strategy where a company wishing to [spin-off](/spinoff) and in this way sell [assets](/asset) to a closely involved individual can do as such without paying taxes on any gains produced using the disposal.

A RMT is a form of organization that permits an entity to consolidate a [subsidiary](/subsidiary) that was veered off with another company free of taxes, gave that all legal requirements to a spinoff are met. To form a RMT, a [parent company](/parentcompany) must initially veer off a subsidiary or other undesirable asset into a separate company, which is then merged or combined with a firm that is keen on obtaining the asset.

## How a Reverse Morris Trust (RMT) Works

RMTs originated because of a 1966 ruling in a claim against the [Internal Revenue Service](/irs), which made a tax loophole to keep away from taxes while selling undesirable assets.

The RMT begins with a parent company hoping to sell assets to a third-party company. The parent company then makes a subsidiary, and that subsidiary and the third-party company [merge](/consolidation) to make an unrelated company. The unrelated company then issues shares to the original parent company's shareholders. In the event that those shareholders control no less than 50.1% of the voting right and [economic value](/economic-value) in the unrelated company, the RMT is complete. The parent company has really transferred the assets, tax-free, to the third-party company.

The key feature to save the tax-free status of a RMT is that after its formation investors of the original parent company own something like 50.1% of the value and [voting rights](/votingright) of the combined or merged firm. This makes the RMT just alluring for third-party companies that are about a similar size or more modest than the veered off subsidiary.

It's likewise worth referencing that the third-party company in a RMT has greater flexibility in securing control of its [board of directors](/boardofdirectors) and selecting senior management, regardless of holding a non-controlling stake in the trust.

> The difference between a Morris trust and a reverse Morris trust is that in a Morris trust the parent company converges with the target company and no subsidiary is made.

## Instances of a Reverse Morris Trust (RMT)

A telecom company that desires to sell old landlines to more modest companies in rural areas could utilize this technique. The telecom company probably won't wish to spend the time or resources to upgrade those lines to broadband or fiber-optic lines, so it could sell those assets utilizing this tax-efficient transfer.

In 2007, Verizon Communications announced an arranged sale of its landline operations in certain lines in the Northeast region to FairPoint Communications. To meet the tax-free transaction qualification, Verizon transferred undesirable landline operation assets to a separate subsidiary and distributed its shares to its existing shareholders.

Verizon then, at that point, completed a RMT reorganization with FairPoint that gave the original Verizon shareholders a majority stake in the recently merged company and FairPoint's original management the green light to run the recently formed business.

In another model, Lockheed Martin stripped from its Information Systems and Global Solutions (ISGS) business segment in 2016. Like Verizon, it went through a RMT by forming another branch-off company that then, at that point, merged with Leidos Holdings, a defense and information technology company.

Leidos Holdings paid a $1.8 billion cash payment, while Lockheed Martin reduced roughly 3% of its outstanding [common shares](/commonstock). Lockheed Martin investors engaged with the transaction then owned a 50.5% stake in Leidos. Overall, the transaction was valued at an estimated $4.6 billion.
