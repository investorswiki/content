# Non-Covered Security
## What Is a Non-Covered Security?

A non-covered security is a SEC assignment under which the cost basis of securities that are small and of limited scope may not be reported to the IRS. The adjusted cost basis of non-covered securities is simply reported to the taxpayer, and not the IRS.

## What Is a Covered Security?

In 2008, Congress passed legislation which required brokers to report the [adjusted cost basis](/adjustedcostbase) for securities and mutual funds to both the investors and the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), effective tax year 2011. Starting around 2011, the cost basis of certain securities has been reported through [Form 1099-B](/form-1099-b) which demonstrates whether the capital loss or gain from the sale of the security is short or long term. Any transaction that happens on or after this effective year is a [covered security](/coveredsecurity) and is reported on Form 1099-B . A covered security is defined as:

1. Any stock in a corporation, including [American Depositary Receipts (ADRs)](/adr), acquired on or after Jan. 1, 2011
1. Mutual funds acquired on or after January 1, 2012
1. Stocks or ADRs acquired through a [dividend reinvestment plan](/dividendreinvestmentplan) (DRIP) on or after Jan. 1, 2012
1. Less complex bonds, [derivatives](/subordinate), and [options](/choice) purchased on or after Jan. 1, 2014
1. More complex bonds, derivatives, and options purchased on or after Jan. 1, 2016

## Figuring out Non-Covered Security

Non-covered securities allude to any investments purchased before the effective dates listed above. The itemized cost basis following the sale of a non-covered security isn't required to be reported to the IRS by a broker. Be that as it may, the gross proceeds or redemption value from a sale might in any case be reported to the IRS. While a broker will in any case report the cost basis to the investor or taxpayer, it depends on the investor to report this information to the IRS through [Schedule D](/scheduled) on [Form 1040](/1040) for shares sold, whether covered or non-covered. Even on the off chance that the taxpayer doesn't receive a cost basis report, they must in any case report their adjusted cost basis to the IRS.

> The IRS believes securities to be non-covered in the event that they are acquired through a [corporate action](/corporateaction) and assuming that their cost basis is derived from other non-covered securities.

Corporate actions, for example, [stock splits](/stocksplit), [stock dividends](/stockdividend), and redemptions, generally bring about extra shares for the investor. The extra shares will be classified as non-covered on the off chance that they were received through non-covered shares. For instance, an individual who bought 100 shares in a company in 2010 that split three-for-one of every 2013 will receive 200 extra shares. Even however the 200 shares were acquired after 2011, they are considered non-covered because they were split from shares acquired before 2011.

A [dividend reinvestment plan (DRIP)](/dividendreinvestmentplan) permits an investor to reinvest his dividends for extra shares in a similar company. An investment security that was purchased in 2011 but transferred around the same time to a DRIP that utilizes the [average cost method](/averagecostbasismethod) of computing the cost basis for an asset is a non-covered security. But on the off chance that the transfer happened after 2011, it will stay a covered security.

Investment sales are isolated into covered and non-covered securities utilizing Form 8949. Transactions on non-covered securities not reported on Form 1099-B are reported on Form 8949 where Code C is utilized for short-term holdings, and Code F for long-term holdings.
