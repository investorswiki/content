# Mass Production
## What Is Mass Production?

Mass production is the manufacturing of large amounts of normalized products, frequently utilizing assembly lines or automation technology. Mass production works with the efficient production of a large number of comparative products.

Mass production is likewise alluded to as flow production, dull flow production, series production, or serial production.

In mass production, automation is utilized to accomplish high volume, itemized organization of material flow, careful control of quality standards, and division of labor. An early illustration of the demand for normalized products in large amounts came from military organizations and their requirement for outfits and different supplies. Precision machining equipment has prompted large-scale demand for mass-delivered products made inexpensively with small labor forces.

## Advantages of Mass Production

Mass production enjoys many benefits. On the off chance that production is rigidly observed, mass production can bring about a high level of precision since production line machines have preset boundaries. Mass production additionally brings about lower costs in light of the fact that the automated assembly line production process requires less workers.

What's more, mass production can make higher levels of proficiency since mass-delivered things can be gathered at a speedier rate through automation. Quick assembly helps the brief distribution and marketing of an organization's products that, thusly, can make a [competitive advantage](/competitive_advantage) and higher profits for a company. For instance, McDonald's (MCD) enjoys a competitive benefit in the cheap food industry due to the speed at which it can deliver a feast for time-cognizant customers.

## Disadvantages of Mass Production

In any case, not all that about mass production is beneficial. Laying out an automated assembly line is capital-escalated and requires a critical upfront investment of time and resources. In the event that there is a mistake in the production design, a broad investment of time and money might be important to redesign and rebuild mass production processes.

A modification of the mass production processes might be required because of reasons other than errors. For instance, in the event that a drug company has a thorough assembly line in place for the production of a famous medication, it would be tedious and costly for them to answer a [Food and Drug Administration](/fda) (FDA) regulatory change requiring an alternate production process.

While an advantage of mass production is that it can reduce labor costs, employees who remain part of an assembly line might lack motivation on the grounds that their assignments are redundant. The weariness brought about by dreary work can lead to low employee assurance and increased levels of [turnover](/turnover).

## Illustration of Mass Production

Henry Ford, pioneer behind the Ford Motor Company, developed the assembly line technique of mass production. In 1913, he spearheaded the moving assembly line for the production of the Ford Model T automobile. The reduced manufacturing time for parts allowed the company to apply a similar method to case assembly and definitely reduced the time it took to build the Model T automobile.

Passage kept on refining the cycle, even hiring somebody who concentrated on the manner in which individuals moved most efficiently. Somewhere in the range of 1908 and 1927, Ford assembled 15 million Model T cars. Because of Ford's mass production, cars became something that the overall population could bear, as opposed to a luxury thing that main a limited number of individuals approached.

Henry Ford's inventive production method is as yet utilized today by companies seeking quick, normalized product creation.

## Highlights
- Mass production enjoys many benefits, for example, creating a high level of precision, lower costs from automation and less workers, higher levels of productivity, and brief distribution and marketing of an organization's products.
- Henry Ford, pioneer behind the Ford Motor Company, developed the assembly line technique of mass production in 1913.
- Mass production is the manufacturing of large amounts of normalized products, frequently utilizing assembly lines or automation technology.
