# Effective Duration
## What Is Effective Duration?

Effective duration is a [duration](/duration) calculation for bonds that have embedded options. This measure of duration considers the way that expected cash flows will vary as interest rates change and is, consequently, a measure of risk. Effective duration can be estimated utilizing [modified duration](/modifiedduration) on the off chance that a bond with embedded options acts like a without option bond.

## Grasping Effective Duration

A bond that has an embedded feature increases the suspiciousness of cash flows, consequently making it difficult for an investor to decide the [rate of return](/rateofreturn) of a bond. The effective duration computes the [volatility](/volatility) of interest rates according to the yield curve and consequently the expected cash flows from the bond. Effective duration computes the expected price decline of a bond when interest rates rise by 1%. The value of the effective duration will continuously be lower than the maturity of the bond.

A bond with embedded options acts like a sans option bond while practicing the [embedded option](/embeddedoption) would offer the investor no benefit. In that capacity, the security's cash flows can't be expected to change given a change in yield. For instance, on the off chance that existing interest rates were 10% and a [callable bond](/callablebond) was paying a coupon of 6%, the callable bond would act like a sans option bond since it wouldn't be optimal for the company to call the bond and once again issue it at a higher interest rate.

## Effective Duration Calculation

The formula for effective duration contains four factors. They are:

P(0) = the bond's original price per $100 worth of par value.

P(1) = the price of the bond assuming the yield were to diminish by Y percent.

P(2) = the price of the bond in the event that the yield were to increase by Y percent.

Y = the estimated change in yield used to ascertain P(1) and P(2).

The complete formula for effective duration is:

Effective duration = (P(1) - P(2))/(2 x P(0) x Y)

## Illustration of Effective Duration

For instance, expect that an investor purchases a bond for 100% par and that the bond is at present yielding 6%. Utilizing a 10 basis-point change in yield (0.1%), it is calculated that with a yield lessening of that amount, the bond is priced at $101. Additionally found by expanding the yield by 10 [basis points](/basispoint), the bond's price is expected to be $99.25. Given this data, the effective duration would be calculated as:

Effective duration = ($101 - $99.25)/(2 x $100 x 0.001) = $1.75/$0.20 = 8.75

The effective duration of 8.75 means that if there somehow managed to be a change in yield of 100 basis points, or 1%, then, at that point, the bond's price would be expected to change by 8.75%. This is an estimation. The estimate can be made more accurate by considering in the bond's effective [convexity](/convexity).

## Features
- Effective duration is a duration calculation for bonds that have embedded options.
- The impact on cash flows as interest rates change is measured by effective duration.
- Effective duration works out the expected price decline of a bond when interest rates rise by 1%.
- Cash flows are questionable in bonds with embedded options, making it challenging to know the rate of return.
