The unique three river is a candlestick chart pattern that meets the following criteria:

1. The market is in a bearish downtrend.
1. The main candle has a bearish long [real body](/realbody) (close lower than open).
1. The subsequent candle is a [hammer](/hammer) with a lower [shadow](/shadow) that sets a new low.
1. The third candle has a short white body (close above open) that is below the real body of the subsequent candle.
1. The third candle doesn't surpass the high or low of the subsequent candle.

The long real body of the principal candle shows that bears control the predominant trend while the hammer in the subsequent candle recommends that bulls are recapturing strength following a protracted decline. In the third candle, the [open](/openingprice) comes in higher than the prior time frame's low and the small white body gives indications of stability and the potential for a move higher.

These dynamics recommend a possible bullish reversal from the [downtrend](/downtrend), despite the fact that there is some evidence that it all the more frequently leads to a bearish continuation.

The security opens lower on the third trading day, signaling a reduction in bull power; in any case, bears fail to capitalize on that weakness, creating an uncertain session inside the [trading range](/tradingrange) of the subsequent candle.

This behavior might show that bear power is fading, making way at a bullish cost thrust on the fourth trading day.

The price might move one course and afterward the other, stopping the trader out, however at that point triggering a trade in the other heading. Entering a subsequent time might be beneficial since a [false breakout](/failedbreak) the other way could fuel a strong price move in the new course.
