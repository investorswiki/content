# Tezos (XTZ)
## What Is Tezos?

Tezos is a blockchain network facilitating the associated digital token Tez (XTZ), which is otherwise called tezzie. Like other cryptocurrency blockchains, Tezos works with client participation in decentralized finance (DeFi), [decentralized applications](/decentralized-applications-dapps) and non-fungible token (NFT) projects.

Conversely, with other blockchains, Tezos blocks [hard forks](/hard-fork), or blockchain splits, with a blockchain-based governance mechanism that takes on and carries out protocol upgrades picked by voting proportional to clients' economic stake in Tezos.

## History of Tezos

Tezos was brought about by Arthur Breitman, a France native and former engineer at Google X and Waymo who proceeded to fill in as a quantitative analyst at Morgan Stanley (MS). It was developed with the participation of Kathleen Breitman, Arthur's better half and a former employee of the hedge fund Bridgewater Associates and R3, a software company. The couple reportedly met at an Anarcho-Capitalist meetup in New York.

In 2014, while as yet working at Morgan Stanley, Arthur Breitman distributed a white paper under a nom de plume the principles behind Tezos. In July 2017, the Switzerland-based Tezos Foundation, headed by Swiss entrepreneur Johann Gevers, organized with the Breitmans a [initial coin offering](/initial-coin-offering-ico) (ICO) for Tezos that proved to be the best ICO to date; by January 2021 it positioned as the seventh-biggest crypto coin offering.

In 13 days, the ICO drew 66,000 bitcoins and 361,000 ethers. The ICO was valued at $232 million at that point, with bitcoin trading at $1,964. Tezos Foundation reported assets of $1.16 billion as of Jan. 31, 2022.

In the midst of investor admonitions in regards to ICOs by the [U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)](/sec), including notice that some are investment securities subject to registration under U.S. law, the Tezos ICO was named a fundraiser of donations, however it in the end allocated Tez with respect to outside contributions.

The distribution of coins was delayed first by a power battle between the Breitmans and Johann Gevers, who eventually ventured down as Tezos Foundation president in mid 2018.

Almost a year after the ICO, in June 2018, the Tezos Foundation said ICO "contributors" anticipating their Tez allocations would need to initially submit to [know-your-client (KYC)](/knowyourclient) and [anti-tax evasion (AML)](/aml) verification. As of November 2020 Tezos had checked 94% of the ICO funds.

In March 2020 the Tezos Foundation, the Breitmans, and the Breitmans' company Dynamic Ledger Solutions settled for $25 million a class action lawsuit brought for ICO participants hoping to pull out their investment.

Tez began trading just under $3 in July 2018, however tumbled to a low of $0.36 by December of that year. It topped at $8.55 in October 2021 and was at $2.21 as June 9, 2022. Tez was up almost 9% that day after [Tether](/tether-usdt) (USDT) said it would send its leading [stablecoin](/stablecoin) on the Tezos network.

As of a similar date, Tez had a market capitalization of $1.99 billion, positioning 33rd among cryptocurrencies.

## Grasping Tezos

Like Bitcoin and [Ethereum](/ethereum), Tezos is a [decentralized ledger](/conveyed ledgers) that utilizes blockchain technology. Like Ethereum, Tezos is intended to utilize [smart contracts](/smart-contracts). Contingent upon the source, "Tezos" is either the old Greek term for "smart agreement" or (substantially more logical) the name found by an algorithm Arthur Breitman wrote to filter through names unclaimed on the internet and pronounceable in English.

[Staking](/proof-stake-pos) 8,000 Tez, referred to in the Tezos network as a roll, permits the owner to operate a network node earning a proportional share of Tez rewards for approving blockchain transactions. Holders of more modest Tez totals might designate them to a network node referred to in Tezos speech as a bread cook.

At the point when extra Tez currency is made toward the finish of protocol upgrade cycles to repay designers whose protocol upgrades are adopted, dough puncher stakes are increased proportionately as an inflation adjustment.

Choices on taking on protocol upgrades rely upon voting by dough punchers in relation to the size of their stakes, and the changes are naturally executed all through the blockchain. Last votes require the participation of owners holding no less than 81% of the current coin supply.

All network activity and governance is decentralized, and the Tezos Foundation disavows any job in its operations. Rather it upholds the development of Tezos infrastructure and administers awards and other funding to foster adoption of the network.

## How Tezos Is Different

Tezos' governance protocols recognize it from Bitcoin as well as [Ethereum](/ethereum), which lack formal governance systems, and its demand that the blockchain can't be forked likewise stands apart among cryptocurrencies. The provision adjusting active stakes for the creation of new tokens is additionally unusual, and is intended to support participation.

Furthermore, Tezos patrons say its proof of stakes model for blockchain validation consumes less energy than [Bitcoin mining](/bitcoin-mining).

## Fate of Tezos

It is not yet clear whether Tezos' inflation mechanism can truly safeguard stakeholders over an extended time by giving them extra tokens.

The network's governance protocols and protections against blockchain forks truly do give a few benefits.

Tezos technology was utilized in a recent trial by European central banks investigating the feasibility of sending off a digital euro, a [central bank digital currency](/central-bank-digital-currency-cbdc).

Tezos has additionally drawn in One Of, the NFT platform backed by music producer Quincy Jones.

Other use cases, including cryptocurrency yield cultivating dependent on rising crypto valuations and buoyant financial markets, may demonstrate less strong over the long haul.
