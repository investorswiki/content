# Final Return for Decedent
## What Is a Final Return for Decedent?

A final return for decedent is an income tax return that has been filed for an individual in the year of that taxpayer's death. Taxpayers who kick the bucket at whatever year must have one final tax return submitted to the IRS on their behalf to account for any income or transfers received in that year. A copy of the official death certificate must be attached to the return for it to be handled.

## Understanding Final Returns for Decedent

To appropriately file a final return for decedent, the executor of the individual's estate or a personal representative is usually responsible for filing that tax return. This personal representative may be the deceased spouse or another family member, or their accountant assuming they had one at the hour of death. This return pertains exclusively to income taxes and ought not be mistaken for a [estate tax](/estatetax) return. Income that is received after the taxpayer's death would also be reported on this return.

This final return is typically prepared similarly as when the deceased person was alive, according to the IRS. Any income earned that filing year ought to be noted on the [Form 1040](/1040), or on the other hand, if applicable, 1040-An or 1040-EZ, along with any credits or deductions to which they may be entitled.

On the off chance that the decedent's final return shows that tax is due, their executor or representative ought to present a payment via check, debit card, credit card, or electronic funds transfer. As with normal returns, the filer may qualify for certain payment plans or installment agreements, say IRS officials. On the off chance that the decedent is owed a refund for individual income tax, the executor may claim it utilizing IRS Form 1310, referred to formally as the Statement of a Person Claiming Refund Due a Deceased Taxpayer.

## Other Advice for Filing a Final Return for Decedent

As the Tax Adviser website points out, even on the off chance that the filing of a final decedent's final return may be unfamiliar or uncomfortable for some tax preparers, it is "better to take control of the situation and make the final Form 1040 a strong and effective part of the posthumous planning process."

Among the many points of advice offered by Karen S. Cohen, CPA, she noticed that practitioners ought to first make certain to stop making estimated tax payments: "When a taxpayer bites the dust, they are not generally required to make estimated tax payments. Many good natured family members keep on presenting the decedent's quarterly [estimated tax vouchers](/estimated-tax), which isn't necessary and may require taking funds out of an investment portfolio, where they could somehow be developing and earning income for as long as a year," Cohen composed.

As for the subject of who ought to sign the return, she said: "An enduring spouse filing a joint return need do nothing special. They will just sign as the enduring spouse. Assuming that somebody other than an enduring spouse has been appointed by a court to administer the decedent's affairs, that executor or personal representative ought to sign the return and attach a copy of the certificate that shows the official appointment."

Relatedly, a spouse can in any case file a joint return with a decedent for the year of death, said Cohen, yet entirely noticed that, "assuming the decedent incurred significant medical expenses during their last illness and passed away early enough in the year to report substantially less income, consider filing separately assuming it would save tax by allowing medical expenses to surpass the adjusted gross income threshold for deduction and create a better overall outcome for the enduring spouse and family."
