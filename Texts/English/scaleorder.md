# Scale Order
## What Is a Scale Order?

A scale order contains several [limit orders](/limitorder) at steadily expanding or decreasing prices. On the off chance that it is a buy scale order, the limit orders will diminish in price, triggering buys at lower prices as the price begins to fall. With a sell order, the limit orders will increase in price, permitting the trader to exploit expanding prices, in this way securing in higher returns.

## Understanding Scale Orders

Traders frequently use scale orders as a strategy for buying or selling large blocks of securities, which could be likely to extra price volatility on the off chance that the whole block was bought or sold in a single market transaction. Scale orders let traders split up large transactions into more modest, more sensible [volumes](/volume), which besides keeps the market more stable since a large block order can make negative price volatility.

Expect a stock does 1,000,000 shares in daily average volume. A [hedge fund](/hedgefund) necessities to buy 1,000,000 shares. The hedge fund would rather not just go in and buy every one of the shares on the double as that might make the price move essentially, driving the price up as they buy, which increases their average entry price (diminishing future profit potential). All things considered, they split the order up, buying 100,000 shares every day and splitting up that order further into 10,000 share block purchases at 10 unique times or prices over the course of every day.

Generally, scale orders exist as buys or sells. A buy scale order presents a series of buy limit orders that are set off thusly as the price of the security falls. Sell scale orders work in reverse, with sell limits placed at thusly higher levels that get filled as the price rises.

Assuming a trader accepts that a stock will fall throughout the span of the day, a scale order can assist them with exploiting the lower price in the event that the forecast is right. To purchase 1,000 shares of the company, they might scale the limit orders so 100 shares are bought for each $0.50 fall in price.

While scaling, keep [commissions](/commission) as a main priority. The augmentations must be sufficiently large to offset the cost of splitting up the order. For instance, in the event that commission costs are $10 per trade, it is an exercise in futility to split a 300-share order into three unique 100-share increases $0.10 separated. The $10 commission on each order discredits the better price.

Traders may likewise scale into a position in a contrary manner. This is sometimes called [pyramiding](/pyramiding), or scaling in â€” when a trader increases their position size as the price moves toward them. For instance, a trader might buy a portion of their full position each time the price rises $0.25 (or another augmentation). Essentially, a trader might add to a [short position](/short), shorting a portion of their full position each time the price falls $0.25 (or another augmentation).

## Scale Order Example

Consider a trader that might want to sell 100,000 shares of Alphabet Inc. (GOOG). At the hour of the trade, the stock is averaging just north of 1,000,000 shares each day. Attempting to sell 100,000 shares addresses a huge piece of the daily volume. The seller wishes to break up the order so they don't drive down the price (bringing about an overall lower selling price) with one big sell order.

The price of the stock is right now expanding, so the trader needs to exploit this by selling as the price increases. Rather than submitting a single block request, they can rather place a [good-until dropped (GTC)](/gtc) sell scale order:

- Total order size = 100,000 shares
- Scale order size = 10,000 shares
- Price increase = $1
- Starting price = $1,200
- Ending price = $1,210
- [Bid-ask spread](/bid-askspread) = $1,199.35 by $1,199.90

The stock is at present just below $1,200. When the order is placed, the initial 10,000 shares will be placed available to be purchased at $1,200. One more order will be placed at $1,201, $1,202, etc until the whole order is sold when the price moves above $1,210.

The price may not reach $1,210, and it may not even take care of the request at $1,200. In the event that the order isn't [filled](/fill), or is just to some extent filled, the trader should reevaluate their strategy and potentially adjust the prices of their scale order.
