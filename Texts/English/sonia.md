## Recent Changes to SONIA

The [Bank of England](/boe) (BoE) fills in as the administrator for the SONIA benchmark.

In April 2017, the Working Group on Sterling Risk-Free Reference Rates, which is a group of active, powerful dealers in the sterling interest rate swap market, announced SONIA would be it's preferred, close to risk-free interest rate benchmark. This change will impact sterling [derivatives](/subordinate) and related financial contracts, and give an alternative interest rate to the predominant London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR).

With that in mind, the U.K's. Financial Conduct Authority announced it would never again expect banks to submit LIBOR quotes after the year 2021. While LIBOR will keep on existing from that point forward, its practicality as a [reference rate](/referencerate) will probably be reduced.
