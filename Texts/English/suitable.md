# Suitable (Suitability)
## What Is Suitable (Suitability)?

Suitability alludes to an ethical, enforceable standard in regards to investments that financial experts are held to while dealing with clients. Before making a recommendation, brokers, money managers, and other financial advisors have a duty to make strides that guarantee the asset or product is suitable — that is, proper for — that investor's objectives, needs, and risk tolerance. In the U.S., the [Financial Industry Regulatory Authority](/finra) (FINRA) manages and authorizes this standard, framing suitability requirements in its Rule 2111.

## Understanding Suitable (Suitability)

Any financial firm or individual dealing with an investor must response the inquiry, "Is this investment fitting for my client?" The firm, or [associated person](/associatedperson), must have a legally reasonable basis, or high degree of confidence, that the security they are offering to the investor is in accordance with that investor's objectives, (for example, [risk tolerance](/risktolerance)) as stated in their investment profile.

Both [financial advisors](/financial-advisor) and [broker-dealers](/broker-dealer) must satisfy a suitability obligation, and that means making recommendations that are predictable with the best interests of the underlying customer. The Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) directs the two types of financial elements under standards that expect them to make fitting recommendations to their clients. Notwithstanding, a broker, or broker-dealer, likewise chips away at sake of the broker-dealer firm, which is the reason the concept of suitability needed to be defined to defend investors from predatory practices.

## FINRA Rule 2111

FINRA Rule 2111 states the customer's investment profile "includes, yet isn't limited to, the customer's age, different investments, financial situation and necessities, tax status, [investment objectives](/investmentobjective), investment experience, investment [time horizon](/timehorizon), liquidity needs, [and] risk tolerance" among other data. An investment recommendation by a broker, or some other regulated entity, would naturally trigger this rule.

No investment, other than outright scams, is innately suitable or unsuitable for an investor. All things considered, its suitability depends on the investor's situation and cosmetics.

For instance, for a 95-year-old widow who is living on a fixed income, speculative investments, for example, [options](/choice) and [futures](/futures), [penny stocks](/pennystock), and so on, are incredibly unsuitable. The widow has an okay tolerance for investments that might lose the principal. Then again, an executive with critical net worth and investing experience may be open to taking on those speculative investments as part of their portfolio.

## Types of Suitability Obligations
- **Reasonable-basis suitability** requires a broker to have a reasonable basis to accept, based on reasonable diligence, that the recommendation is suitable for certain investors in any event. Reasonable diligence must provide the firm or associated person with an understanding of the possible risks and rewards of the recommended security or strategy.
- **Customer-specific suitability** expects that a broker, based on a particular customer's investment profile, has a reasonable basis to accept that the recommendation is suitable for that customer. The broker must endeavor to get and dissect a broad exhibit of customer-specific factors to support this determination, including the client's age, risk tolerance, liquidity requirements, and investment time horizon.
- **Quantitative suitability** requires a broker with actual or de facto control over a customer's account to have a reasonable basis for trusting that a series of recommended transactions, even assuming suitable when seen in disengagement, isn't extreme and unsuitable for the customer when taken together considering the customer's investment profile. This obligation is intended to cover strangely high [transaction costs](/transactioncosts) and inordinate portfolio turnover, called [churning](/churning), to create commission fees.

## Suitability versus Fiduciary Requirements

Individuals frequently confound the terms suitability and [fiduciary](/fiduciary). Both look to safeguard the investor from foreseeable mischief or inordinate risk. Nonetheless, suitability standards are not equivalent to fiduciary standards; the levels of advisor responsibility and investor care are unique.

An investment fiduciary is any person who has the legal responsibility for overseeing another person's money. [Investment advisors](/investmentadvisor) and money managers, who are typically fee-based, are bound to fiduciary standards. Broker-dealers, usually compensated by commission, generally need to satisfy just a suitability obligation.

> The SEC's Regulation BI is something of a replacement (a weak one, pundits charge) for the Department of Labor's Fiduciary Rule of 2017, which would have required that all financial experts who work with retirement plans or provide retirement planning exhortation — advisors, broker-dealers, and insurance agents — be legally limited by the fiduciary standard. In June 2018, the U.S. Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals authoritatively abandoned the rule, successfully killing it.

Financial advisors who are guardians have the responsibility to prescribe suitable investments while as yet sticking to the fiduciary requirements of placing their client's interests over their or their firm's interests. For instance, the advisor can't buy securities for their account before suggesting or buying them for a client's account. Fiduciary standards additionally prohibit making trades that might bring about the payment of higher [commission](/commission) fees to the advisor or their investment firm.

The advisor must utilize accurate and complete data and analysis while offering a client investment guidance. To avoid any indecency or presence of inappropriateness, the fiduciary will uncover any potential [conflicts of interest](/irreconcilable circumstance) to the client and afterward will place the client's interests before their own. Furthermore, the advisor undertakes transactions under a "best execution" standard, in which they work to execute the trade or purchase at the most minimal cost and with the highest productivity.

## Suitable (Suitability) versus Best Interest

The command to act in the client's best interest, a key part of the fiduciary standard, is recognizably ailing in the suitability standard, however some could contend it's implied. Starting around 2020, the two have become all the more authoritatively interwoven.

In June 2020, FINRA adopted Regulation BI, technically "revising" its Rule 2111 to oblige it, so that "a broker-dealer that fulfills the best interest guideline would essentially satisfy the suitability guideline."

While the details of which rule applies when are a little hazy, the primary concern is by all accounts that a FINRA-enlisted broker is currently required to follow both Regulation Best Interest and Rule 2111 in regards to recommendations to retail investors.
