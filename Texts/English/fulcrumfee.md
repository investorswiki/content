# Fulcrum Fee
## What Is a Fulcrum Fee?

A fulcrum fee is a performance-based fee that changes up or down based on beating or underperforming a benchmark. Fulcrum fees can be charged by a financial adviser or a [asset manager](/asset_management_company) to qualified clients to connect [outperformance](/outflank) (or lack thereof) to compensation.

## Understanding a Fulcrum Fee

A fulcrum fee is the main performance-based fee that financial advisers are permitted to charge clients. The [Investment Advisers Act of 1940](/investadvact) first disallowed performance-based fees, as they give advisers too much incentive to face undue challenges with their client's money. It was only after 1970 that congress permitted performance-based fees, for example, a fulcrum fee, however exclusively by [Registered Investment Advisers](/ria) (RIA) filling in as investment managers to mutual funds.

Then in 1985 the [Securities and Exchange Commission](/sec) (SEC) further permitted advisers to utilize fulcrum fees with retail clients, and simply because the adviser takes part similarly in the downside and upside of an investment.

The motivation behind why a fund management monster would utilize a fulcrum fee on [actively managed](/activemanagement) funds is that they keep on underperforming cheaper index ([passive](/passivemanagement)) funds, which have caught the vast majority of net inflows in the U.S. throughout the past decade. To make active equity funds more well known, Fidelity is basically bringing down their cost yet permitting themselves to take an interest on the upside assuming they beat their [bogey](/bogey).

## Fulcrum Fee Conditions

Several conditions must be met for an adviser to charge a fulcrum fee:

1) The returns must surpass the appropriate benchmark (and on the off chance that they don't, the base fee must be decreased).

2) The main clients that can be charged this way are people or registered investment companies with an account value greater than $1 million or a net worth greater than $2.1 million. Such clients are known as "qualified clients," defined under Rule 205-3 of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940.

## Do Fulcrum Fees Work?

As per research, incentive fees for [mutual funds](/mutualfund) have not shown any association with further developed risk-adjusted performance. Rather, mutual fund managers paid through incentive fees will quite often accomplish higher returns basically by facing more risk. More regrettable yet, when they lag their [benchmarks](/benchmark) they add more risk. In spite of this, such performance-based fees stay famous with investors.

## Real World Example

In late 2017, Fidelity International announced that it would upgrade its equity fee strategy to a fulcrum fee model. In effect, it would offer another share class for 10 active equity funds that would carry a management charge that was 10 [basis points](/basispoint) lower than current prices. Contingent upon the performance of the funds, that fee would either rise or fall by 20 basis points (performance would be estimated on a three-year rolling basis).

Fidelity isn't the only one in specifically utilizing fulcrum fees; Vanguard, Janus, and AllianceBernstein, as well as other fund managers, likewise utilize them.
