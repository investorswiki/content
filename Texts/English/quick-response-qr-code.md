# Quick Response (QR) Code
## What Is a Quick Response (QR) Code?

A quick response (QR) code is a type of [barcode](/barcode) that can be perused effectively by a digital gadget and which stores data as a series of pixels in a square-molded grid. QR codes are regularly used to follow data about products in a [supply chain](/supplychain) and frequently utilized in marketing and advertising efforts.

QR codes are considered a progression from more established, uni-layered barcodes, and were approved as an international standard in 2000 by the [International Organization for Standardization](/international-organization-for-standardization-iso) (ISO).

## Seeing Quick Response (QR) Codes

QR codes were developed during the 1990s as a method for providing more data than a standard barcode. They were developed by Denso Wave, a [subsidiary](/subsidiary) of Toyota, as a method for following vehicles all through the manufacturing system. Not at all like barcodes, which require a light emission to bounce off of the parallel lines, QR codes can be digitally filtered by gadgets like cell phones.

QR codes comprise of black squares organized in a grid (matrix) on a white foundation and are perused by specific software that can separate data from the patterns that are available in the matrix. These codes are capable of containing more data than traditional barcodes, and essentially handle four methods of data: alphanumeric, numeric, binary, and Kanji.

In spite of the increased data capacity, QR codes have not been as famous with consumers true to form. As opposed to being made by consumers to share data, they are generally commonly associated with promoters and [marketing campaigns](/marketing-effort).

## Quick Response (QR) Codes versus Barcodes

The amount of data that can be conveyed about a product or service was traditionally limited by the amount of room on the product's bundling or the promotion promoting its benefits. In the event that a consumer wanted more data about the product — accessibility, price, credits — they would need to track down a sales rep or request extra documentation.

Barcodes are commonly found on the rear of product bundles and convey data utilizing a combination of different widths of parallel lines, which can be perused by machines that have an optical scanner.

The barcode reformed the way that companies managed [inventories](/stock) and pricing and was first put to commonsense use during the 1960s by U.S. rail lines to follow equipment and holders. Traditional, two-layered barcodes came into common use in U.S. retail stores in 1974. Barcodes are currently found on everything from employee ID identifications and hospital arm bands to steel trailers.

## Types of Quick Response (QR) Codes

There are a number of QR code types that might be utilized for various things. They include:

- **Micro QR Code**: A more modest variant of a traditional QR code that is utilized when space is limited. Micro QR codes can change in size however the littlest is 11 x 11 modules, encoding up to 21 alphanumeric characters.
- **Model 1 QR Codes:** Model 1 is the prototype of Model 2 and Micro QR. One to 14 forms are registered to the Automatic Identification Manufacturers International (AIMI) standard. Its maximum data capacity is 468 bytes, which can encode up to 707 alphanumeric characters.
- **Model 2 QR Codes:** Model 2 has an arrangement pattern for better position adjustment and contains greater data density than Model 1. One to 40 forms are registered to the AIMI standard, with adaptation 40 capable of saving to 4,296 alphanumeric characters.
- **IQR Code**: Can be made in squares or rectangles in situations where space or shape is an issue. It tends to be in any of 61 configurations.
- **SQRC**: Features a restricted perusing capability to contain private data.
- **Outline QR**: Customizable edge that can contain bigger data in configurations like graphics, delineations, or photographs.

## Features
- An enhancement on traditional barcodes, QR codes can store unfathomably more data and are utilized in various applications from supply chain management to cryptocurrency wallet addresses.
- Quick response (QR) codes are square-molded grids of dark or light pixels used to encode and quickly recover data utilizing computer gadgets.
- Several adaptations and varieties of QR codes presently exist that are tweaked to various purposes, or which can store greater amounts of data.
