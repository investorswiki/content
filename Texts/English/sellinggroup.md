# Selling Group
## What Is a Selling Group?

A selling group contains all financial institutions engaged with selling or marketing, yet not really underwriting, a new or secondary issue of debt or equity.

## Understanding a Selling Group

A selling group incorporates a number of financial institutions, including brokers and dealers, whose sole center is to sell an allotment of new or second-issue securities to the public. This group frequently incorporates individuals from the original underwriting syndicate. Underwriters, who have purchased securities straightforwardly from the issuer, sell them at a markup to different individuals from the selling group, who buy them for not exactly the expected market price.

Individuals from the selling group bring in money on the transaction in the [spread](/spread) between their buying price and the market price. Selling group individuals who were not underwriters don't receive residual syndicate profits and are not responsible for unsold securities.

On the other hand, the selling group can essentially be the underwriting group alone: those responsible for underwriting a portion of the new issue. In this scenario, underwriters are reluctant to invite participation in the selling system from contenders who bear none of the risk.

## Special Considerations

A selling group can shift in size proportionally to the size of the issue. Thus, a group can here and there be comprised of several hundred brokers and dealers. There will frequently be a lead dealer or broker, joined by participating broker-dealers as well as different merchants. The senior manager of the underwriting syndicate names the selling group. A selling-group agreement, or chose dealer agreement, oversees the group and lays out terms, for example, whether the account will be partitioned or undivided, also called [western](/westernaccount) or [eastern](/undividedaccount) accounts.

The agreement likewise covers selling concession, or the commission on sales, and the termination date, which is as a rule inside a period of 30 days.

## Theoretical Example of a Selling Group

Suppose that Goldman Sachs, Merrill Lynch, and Wells Fargo Advisors are syndicate individuals, or underwriting firms, and JP Morgan Chase, the starting firm, acts as the syndicate's senior manager. As underwriters, these firms are responsible for unsold securities, yet additionally gain the largest part of profits.

JP Morgan Chase, going about as syndicate manager, welcomes a more extensive scope of brokers and dealers that incorporate more modest investment firms across the globe, to make up the selling group. This approach supports the distribution of the shares and expands the possibilities that they will sell rapidly. Thusly, individuals from the selling group each earn a concession. They are not responsible for the risk of unsold securities.

The profit that syndicate individuals make on the selling group's shares or bonds is called the extra takedown, which is added to the concession for the total [takedown](/takedown).
