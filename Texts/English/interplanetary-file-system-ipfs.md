# InterPlanetary File System (IPFS)

InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) is an open-source project that is building a peer-to-peer file system. The IPFS project is an aggressive project that might possibly change the manner in which we utilize the Internet. Its last goal is to associate all gadgets that have a similar file system, yet not similarly the Web does today. To comprehend the nuts and bolts of IPFS, contrasting it and HTTP is useful.
Basically, the current World Wide Web depends on the HTTP and HTTPS protocols. In short, these are application protocols that empower worldwide data communication and accessibility.
HTTP fills in as a request-reaction protocol that interfaces users (clients) to servers, in light of their location. For example, in the event that Alice goes to a website, her web browser will request the substance to the facilitating server (e.g., Amazon Web Services). On the off chance that all works out positively, the AWS server will return the web pages to her.
Be that as it may, the substance isn't permanent since it is kept up with by a centralized server. Furthermore, since the AWS is facilitating a large number of websites, on the off chance that their servers go down under any circumstance, a big percentage of the Internet goes down with it.
Interestingly, IPFS allows for the creation of a permanent and distributed Web, where a wide range of digital data can be stored and shared. While HTTP communications depend on a server (with a specific location) to give the substance, IPFS communications center around the substance itself.
With IPFS, Alice would never again ask the substance straightforwardly to the AWS server. All things being equal, she would ask the distributed network "who can give me this substance?" and the nearest peers would rapidly answer.
Contingent upon the implementation, IPFS might introduce many benefits when compared to HTTP, like control resistance, data integrity, lower operational costs, better performance, and security.
A portion of the limitations are connected with the low incentives to partake in the network, which prompts a small population of peers. The limited adoption makes it harder for files to be permanently accessible. On the off chance that certain data is just facilitated by a small bunch of hubs and all go offline, it will become inaccessible.
