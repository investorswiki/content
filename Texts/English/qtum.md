# Qtum
## What Is Qtum?

Qtum is a cryptocurrency that joins Ethereum's smart contract usefulness with the security of Bitcoin's unspent transaction output model (UTXO) to make a platform that is suitable for adoption by large organizations. Qtum was established in 2016 by Patrick Dai, Jordan Earls, and Neil Mahl, and its [initial coin offering](/initial-coin-offering-ico) (ICO) was held in March 2017.

As of October 2021, the coin was positioned #91 by overall market cap, with the price floating around $13.45 with a market cap of $1.4 billion.

## Figuring out Qtum

The founders of Qtum (articulated "quantum") tried to consolidate probably the best parts of both [Bitcoin](/bitcoin) and [Ethereum](/ethereum), determined to turn into a secure exchange for business-centered decentralized applications (dApps). Qtum desires to upset the online transactions market and become a fundamental part of industries like finance and social networking. Its currency is called a token.

One core element of Qtum borrowed from Bitcoin is the UTXO model, a kind of accounting system utilized by Bitcoin that gives a high level of transactional security. The UXTO system gives a type of receipt to unspent coins after a transaction. Qtum replicated and improved Bitcoin's UTXO code for its own platform.

Qtum borrowed smart contracts from Ethereum. Smart contracts are blocks of self-executing code that, once confirmed on the blockchain, carry out the terms of the deal, making the contract irrevocable.

## Qtum, Bitcoin, and Ethereum

While Qtum borrowed from both Bitcoin and Ethereum, it contrasts from both of its much-greater rivals in key ways. In the first place, Qtum conveyed what it calls the Account Abstraction Layer (AAL), the technology that empowers the utilization of smart contracts related to the UTXO model. AAL empowers the UTXO and smart contract models to associate.

Qtum likewise utilizes a [proof-of-stake](/proof-stake-pos) (PoS) consensus model instead of the [proof-of-work](/proof-work) model utilized by Bitcoin. This makes it simpler to mine new coins. Bitcoin's PoW approach is asset serious, causing the computer networks mining its coins to consume more power every year than numerous whole countries. A PoS approach improves on the cycle and results in substantially less power consumption.

With a PoS system, excavators are decided to check blocks in light of their own stakes in the system, as opposed to who can take care of a complex math problem the quickest. The greater the stake, the greater the client's chance of being chosen to check the transactions.

## Highlights
- Qtum is a cryptocurrency that consolidates the security of Bitcoin's blockchain model and the flexibility of Ethereum's smart contracts.
- It utilizes a proof-of-stake consensus model for making new blocks, which is far simpler and less energy-concentrated than Bitcoin's proof-of-work model.
- Qtum is intended for use by large organizations, fully intent on becoming fundamental to a scope of industries, including finance and social media.
