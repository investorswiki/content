## What Is a Facility?

A facility is a formal financial assistance program offered by a lending institution to help a company that requires operating capital. Types of facilities incorporate overdraft services, deferred payment plans, [lines of credit](/lineofcredit) (LOC), revolving credit, term loans, letters of credit, and [swingline loans](/swinglineloan). A facility is basically one more name for a loan taken out by a company.

## How a Facility Works

A facility is an agreement between a company and a public or private lender that allows the business to borrow a specific amount of money for various purposes for a short period of time. The loan is for a set amount and doesn't need [collateral](/collateral). The borrower makes month to month or quarterly payments, with interest, until the debt is paid in full.

A facility is particularly important for companies that need to keep away from things like laying off workers, slowing growth, or closing down during seasonal sales cycles when revenue is low.

For instance, on the off chance that a jewelry store is low on cash in December when sales are down, the owner can request a $2 million facility from a bank, which will be paid back in full by July as business picks up. The goldsmith utilizes the funds to proceed with operations and takes care of the loan in regularly scheduled payments by the settled upon date.

## Instances of Facilities

There are a number of facilities accessible for short-term borrowers, contingent upon the requirements of the borrowing businesses. These loans can be [committed](/committedfacility) or [uncommitted](/uncommittedfacility).

### Overdraft Services

Overdraft services give a loan to a company when the company's cash account is vacant. The lender charges interest and fees on the borrowed money. Overdraft services cost not as much as loans, are quickly completed, and do exclude punishments for an early payoff.

### Business Lines of Credit (LOC)

An unsecured business credit extension gives corporations access to cash depending on the situation at a competitive rate, with flexible payment decisions. A traditional credit extension gives check-composing privileges, requires an annual survey, and can be called right on time by the lender. A forward thinking credit extension gives businesses quick access to cash and a high credit limit.

[Revolving credit](/revolvingcredit) has a specific limit and no set regularly scheduled payments, yet interest gathers and is capitalized. Companies with low cash balances that need to fund their [net working capital](/workingcapital) requirements will typically go for a revolving credit facility, which gives access to funds any time the business needs capital.

### Term Loans

A term loan is a [commercial loan](/commercial-loan) with a set interest rate and maturity date. A company commonly utilizes the money to finance an enormous venture or acquisition. Intermediate-term loans are under three years and are repaid month to month, perhaps with balloon payments. Long-term loans can be as long as 20 years and are backed by collateral.

### Letters of Credit

Homegrown and international trade companies use letters of credit to work with transactions and payments. A financial institution guarantees payment and completion of obligations between the candidate (buyer) and the beneficiary (seller).
