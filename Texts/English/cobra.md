# Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act (COBRA)
## What is COBRA?
The Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act, known as COBRA, was passed by Congress in 1986. COBRA gives employees and their family individuals the right to purchase continuing health care coverage at the group wellbeing rates when coverage is lost due to certain predetermined events. The group wellbeing rate is the rate the employer was charged for the insurance. These rates are generally more affordable than plans purchased individually.
## More profound definition
COBRA applies to employers who utilize at least 20 employees on in excess of 50 percent of their run of the mill business days. Parttime employees are considered a fraction of an employee. This means two half-time employees address one full-time employee. The law applies to both private businesses and the public sector.
Individuals who benefit from COBRA are alluded to as qualified beneficiaries. A qualified beneficiary is ordinarily the individual who was insured by a group wellbeing plan on the day preceding the qualifying event occurred. The qualifying event must have made the beneficiary lose their medical coverage. Qualified beneficiaries incorporate employees, their life partners, former mates, dependent children, and dependent stepchildren.
To meet all requirements for COBRA, beneficiaries must have lost insurance due to a predefined event. These events include:
- Reduction in an employee's hours.
- Termination of an employee's employment because of reasons other than gross unfortunate behavior.
- The employee presently meets all requirements for Medicare.
- The death of an employee.
- Divorce or legal separation.

To meet all requirements for COBRA, the employer must in any case offer its employees health care coverage. Assuming the employer leaves business, the employees and dependents are not qualified for COBRA.
Assuming the employer changes its employees' group wellbeing coverage, a similar coverage must be offered to qualified beneficiaries.
Employers might require qualified beneficiaries to pay for the COBRA coverage, and may charge a 2 percent administrative fee. The cost for continuing COBRA coverage is many times more costly than the amount the employee recently paid, since employers ordinarily pay a portion of employees' health care coverage. For instance, in the event that the employee's premiums were $200 each month and the employer's premiums were $800 each month, the qualified beneficiary might be required to pay $1,000 each month for the indistinguishable group wellbeing plan. COBRA premiums may increase assuming that the costs of the plan increases.
COBRA beneficiaries must be permitted to make regularly scheduled payments upon request. The principal payment must be made in the span of 45 days of choosing COBRA insurance. Payments must cover any retroactive COBRA coverage. On the off chance that the payment isn't made by the main date of coverage, the plan can cancel the beneficiary's coverage and afterward restore endless supply of payment. Beneficiaries are responsible for all co-pay fees and deductibles that were administered in the employee's wellbeing plan.
## COBRA model
Beneficiaries who lost coverage due to termination of employment or a reduction in work hours are generally eligible for COBRA for as long as 18 months. Now and again, beneficiaries might be eligible for COBRA for as long as 36 months. Beneficiaries might lose their COBRA benefits assuming they become fully eligible for another group wellbeing plan or Medicare.
Individuals who fit the bill for COBRA must be offered the indistinguishable group wellbeing coverage that they received before the qualifying indicated event. This incorporates:
- Doctor's arrangements.
- Long term and short term care.
- Medical procedure and other major medical procedures.
- Physician endorsed drugs.
- Dental and vision care.

- COBRA benefits generally last for a maximum of 18 months, yet employers have the option of expanding that period.
