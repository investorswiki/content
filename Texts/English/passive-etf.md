# Passive ETF
## What Is a Passive ETF?

A passive exchange-traded fund (ETF) is a financial instrument that looks to reproduce the performance of the broader equity market or a specific sector or trend. Passive ETFs mirror the holdings of a designated [index](/index) — an assortment of tradable assets considered to be representative of a specific market or segment. Investors can buy and sell [passive](/passivemanagement) ETFs all through the trading day, just like stocks on a major exchange.

## How a Passive ETF Works

Parts of a passive ETF follow the underlying index or sector and are not at the prudence of a [fund manager](/fundmanager). That makes it something contrary to [active management](/activemanagement) — a strategy by which an individual or team settles on choices on the underlying portfolio allocation trying to beat the market.

Passive ETFs give investors greater flexibility to execute a [buy-and-hold](/buyandhold) strategy compared to active funds. Passive investing advocates accept it's challenging to outperform the market, so they aim to match its whole performance instead of beat it.

Adopting a hands-off strategy means the provider can charge investors less without stressing over the cost of employee salaries, [brokerage fees](/brokerage-expense), and research. The strategy additionally promotes the benefit of lower [turnover](/turnoverratio). At the point when assets move all through the fund at a slower pace, it prompts less transaction costs and realized capital gains. Investors, in this manner, can save when its opportunity to file taxes.

Passive ETFs are additionally more transparent than their actively managed partners. Passive ETF providers distribute fund [weightings](/portfolio-weight) every day, allowing investors to limit strategy drift and distinguish any copy investments.

## Special Considerations

Passive ETFs have soared in ubiquity since first being acquainted with the world about a quarter of a century prior.

## Passive ETF versus Active ETF

Most investors aren't happy with betting on each ETF. They specifically need to pick the victors and stay away from the [laggards](/loafer). Desires of beating the market are common, even however evidence points to most active fund managers routinely neglecting to accomplish this goal.

[Active ETFs](/actively-managed-etf) look to address those issues. These vehicles feature a large number of similar benefits of traditional ETFs, like price transparency, [liquidity](/liquidity), and tax productivity. Where they vary is that they have a manager introduced that can adjust the fund to changing market conditions.

Albeit active ETFs trade an index like their passive companions, active managers have a room to make modifications and stray from the benchmark when they see fit. Options accessible to them incorporate changing sector rotation, market-timing trades, [short selling](/shortselling), and buying on [margin](/margin).

Investors shouldn't automatically accept that this flexibility guarantees active ETFs to beat the market and their passive companions. Few out of every odd call caused will to be the right one, plus the apparatuses and employees they utilize bring about extra costs, coming about in higher [expense ratios](/expenseratio) that reduce the fund's assets and investors' returns.

## Analysis of Passive ETFs

Passive ETFs are subject to total [market risk](/marketrisk) in that when the overall stock market or bond prices fall, so do funds tracking the index. Another drawback is a lack of flexibility. Providers of these vehicles can't make changes to [portfolios](/portfolio) nor embrace defensive measures, for example, decreasing situations on holdings when a sell-off looks inescapable.

Pundits claim a hands-off approach can be hindering, especially during a [bear market](/bearmarket). An active manager can pivot between sectors to shield investors from periods of [volatility](/volatility). A passive fund that rarely adjusts to market conditions, then again, is forced to take the brunt of a drawdown.

At last, another remarkable issue with passive ETFs is that a considerable lot of the indices they track are [capitalization-weighted](/capitalizationweightedindex). Meaning, the larger the stock's market capitalization, the higher its weight in an investment portfolio. A drawback to this approach is that it reduces diversification and leaves passive ETFs weighted toward large stocks in the market.
