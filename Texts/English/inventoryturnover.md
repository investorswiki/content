Her leftover inventory is $54,000 worth of cat toys, so her cost of goods sold ($200,000 + $4,000 - $54,000) is $150,000.
She needs to compute her inventory turnover. In the first place, she computes her average inventory: $200,000 + $54,000/2 = $127,000.
Presently, she partitions that her COGS more than average inventory: $150,000/$127,000 = 1.18, which is her inventory turnover ratio.
