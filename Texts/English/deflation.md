# Deflation
## What is deflation?
Deflation is the point at which the vast price of goods diminishes, causing a reduction the amount of money in circulation. Something contrary to [inflation](/inflation), deflation frequently happens during or just before a financial crisis since individuals will generally hold onto their cash as opposed to reinvesting it into the economy.
## More profound definition
Deflation is represented by the concept of supply and demand. It can happen when there's by the same token
- A **increased** **demand** for or **decreased** **supply** of money
- A **decreased** **demand** for or **increased** **supply** of goods

At the point when the overall price of goods in an economy begins to diminish, individuals in that economy will generally store their cash as they sit tight for an even lower price. What follows is a decline in the circulation of cash. That, thus, expands the purchasing power of currency. At the point when these things occur, businesses either can't sell their goods and services or need to sell them at lower prices, making their business unbeneficial and compelling them to lay off workers. This cycle is called a deflationary spiral, and it was a major factor in the Panic of 1837 and the Great Depression.
The country's [central bank](/centralbank) battles deflation by bringing down interest rates, which permits banks to loan more money and animate the economy by basically causing inflation. A little inflation can be a boon in times of deflation, yet it can unfortunately do a limited amount a lot. On the off chance that that doesn't work, the next step government could take is essentially to infuse more money into the economy, which makes occupations, incomes, and thusly seriously spending.
One more method for thinking of deflation is that the real value of debt increments. That means money that a borrower owes to the bank is worth more to the bank, leaving the borrower in additional debt. Since she has less money, she might default on her loans, denying the bank of funds.
Moreover, governments disdain deflation since it makes it challenging to fund social services. In the event that there's less money in the economy, the government is drawing less tax revenue.
## Deflation model
The desert planet of Tatooine is host to a flourishing dampness farm economy. This year, every unit of dampness costs $100 on average. That is excessively much for something with such little demand, so no one gets it. The cost of a unit of dampness drops to $95 on average.
Simultaneously, all the Tatooine residents who are not buying units of dampness basically see growth in their money: that $100 they didn't spend is currently worth $105. That is a very decent deal, so they hold back to check whether a unit of dampness will drop in the future.
It rehashes fall. Even however the price of one unit is presently affordable, individuals of Tatooine need to check whether it'll go down even further. This time, the farmers creating dampness can't manage the cost of the loss of income. Several major farms close up shop, and workers in the dampness farm industry are laid off. Presently, counting the jobless, even less individuals are buying dampness, compounding the problem.
