# Reinsurance Assisted Placement
## What Is a Reinsurance Assisted Placement?

A reinsurance assisted placement is a new [reinsurance](/reinsurance) contract initiated by a reinsurance company. Reinsurance is insurance for insurers (additionally called stop-loss insurance). A reinsurance company is one that gives financial protection to insurers. Reinsurers handle risks — specifically, a major claims event — that are too large for insurance companies to handle all alone.

While a reinsurance assisted placement is initiated by a reinsurance company, the majority of insurance contracts are initiated either by [insurance companies](/insurance) or by insurance brokers. Reinsurance companies might be propelled to produce reinsurance assisted placements assuming they accept that the insurance company to whom they direct the business will then, at that point, purchase reinsurance from them.

## How Reinsurance Assisted Placements Work

The reinsurance marketplace is a large and important part of the insurance industry. By purchasing reinsurance, insurance companies can [manage their risk](/riskmanagement) by offsetting a portion of their liabilities to other insurance companies. The companies accepting this risk — that is, the people who are selling reinsurance, the reinsurance companies — are compensated by getting a portion of the insurance premiums collected from the policyholders.

While going into these arrangements, the two parties will haggle around what is a reasonable level of [insurance premiums](/insurance-premium) for the insurer to surrender to the reinsurer. This decision will be founded on the perceived riskiness of the underlying liabilities, as well as on the type of reinsurance contract being thought of.

## Types of Reinsurance Assisted Placements

Most reinsurance contracts can be isolated into two distinct categories: treaty and facultative. Treaty contracts are agreements that cover a broad group of policies, like a primary insurer's all's auto business. Facultative covers specific individual policies, for example, a hospital, that wouldn't be accepted under a treaty since they address higher value policies or more hazardous risks.

For instance, [clash reinsurance](/clash-reinsurance) contracts give insurers extra coverage if a single loss event brings about more than one policyholder filing a claim. [Spot reinsurance](/spot-reinsurance), then again, covers a subsection of the insurer's policies when that subsection is considered to be riskier than the insurer's overall [portfolio](/portfolio) of policies.

More often than not, the insurance contracts that are then reinsured are initiated either by the insurance company themselves or by at least one insurance brokers. Notwithstanding, there are cases when the reinsurance company will start, or "place," another insurance contract for an insurance company. In that scenario, the insurance company may either decide to reinsure the contract with the reinsurance company, or, more than likely work with an alternate reinsurance provider.

On account of [treaty reinsurance](/treaty-reinsurance), the insurance company would be committed to reinsure with the company that gave the reinsurance assisted placement. On account of [facultative reinsurance](/facultative-reinsurance), in any case, the insurance company could pick the choice about whether to reinsure with that particular company.

## Illustration of a Reinsurance Assisted Placement

To delineate, consider the case of two speculative insurance companies: Insurance Corp. also, Reinsurance Corp. The two companies have worked with one another for a long time, with Insurance Corp. consistently purchasing reinsurance from Reinsurance Corp. Albeit the majority of Insurance Corp's. new contracts are created from its own sales reps, as well as its network of insurance brokers, every once in a while Reinsurance Corp. will run over its own business opportunities and allude those customers to Insurance Corp.

Since the two companies have a facultative reinsurance arrangement instead of a treaty reinsurance arrangement, Insurance Corp. isn't committed to deal with Reinsurance Corp. while purchasing reinsurance for its reinsurance assisted placements. Be that as it may, since the two companies have a decent working relationship, it quite often decides to do as such. In this sense, Reinsurance Corp. is going about as a true insurance broker for Insurance Corp., as well as going about as a reinsurer.
