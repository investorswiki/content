# Runs Test
## What Is a Runs Test?

A runs test is a statistical technique that looks at whether a [string of data](/data-examination) is happening randomly from a specific [distribution](/normaldistribution). The runs test dissects the occurrence of comparative occasions that are isolated by occasions that are unique.

In investing, a runs test can be important for investors to decide whether the data set they are utilizing is randomly produced or on the other hand in the event that it is impacted by an underlying variable. Traders who center around technical analysis can utilize a runs test to assist with breaking down the [price action](/price-action) of a security.

## Understanding a Runs Test

A run is a series of expanding or decreasing values, often addressed on a chart by plus (+) or minus (- ) images. In statistics, a runs test decides the [randomness of data](/random-factor-analysis) by uncovering any variables that could impact data designs.

For instance, a rundown of really random single-digit numbers ought to just have a couple of examples where a sequence of numbers is ascending mathematically. Nonetheless, generally speaking, it is hard to state the randomness of data in which there are huge number of sequences in a string of data. In this manner, the runs test was made as a [objective method](/objective-likelihood) of deciding randomness.

## Types of Runs Tests

The runs test is an abbreviated variant of the full name: the Wald-Wolfowitz runs test, so named after mathematicians Abraham Wald and Jacob Wolfowitz. The Wald-Wolfowitz test is a [nonparametric statistical test](/nonparametric-statistics), and that means the data being dissected doesn't need to meet certain presumptions or boundaries. The Wald-Wolfowitz test can be utilized to look at the [hypothesis](/hypothesistesting) that the variables in the data string are mutually independent.

A few analysts accept one more type of runs test — the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test — is a better device than the Wald-Wolfowitz test for recognizing differences between distributions. The Kolmogorov-Smirnov test is a type of [goodness-of-fit test](/goodness-of-fit) that determines whether the sample data being tried addresses [normal distribution patterns](/normaldistribution) or on the other hand assuming that the data is some way or another slanted. The test lays out the disparity between the values in the sample data and the normal distribution model.

## Benefits of a Runs Test

The runs test model is important in deciding if an outcome of a trial is really random, particularly in situations where random versus sequential data has suggestions for subsequent speculations and analysis. A runs test can be an important instrument for investors who utilize [technical analysis](/technicalanalysis) to go with their trading choices. These traders examine statistical trends, like price movement and [volume](/volume), to spot possibly profitable trading opportunities. These traders genuinely must comprehend the underlying variables that could be impacting price movement and a runs test can assist with this.

Two strong ways traders can utilize a runs test include:

1. Testing the randomness of distribution, by taking the data in the given order and stamping with a plus (+) the data greater than the [median](/median), and with a minus (- ) the data not exactly the median (numbers equalling the median are discarded.)
1. Testing whether a function fits well to a data set, by denoting the data surpassing the function value with + and different data with −. For this utilization, the runs test, which considers the signs yet not the distances, is complementary to the [chi-square test](/chi-square-measurement), which considers the distances however not the signs.

## Features
- A runs test is a statistical analysis that decides the randomness of data by uncovering any variables that could influence data designs.
- A runs test, otherwise called the Wald-Wolfowitz runs test, was developed by mathematicians Abraham Wald and Jacob Wolfowitz.
- Technical traders can utilize a runs test to break down statistical trends and assist with spotting profitable trading opportunities.
- For instance, an investor keen on dissecting the price movement of a specific stock could conduct a runs test to gain understanding into conceivable future price action of that stock.
