# Guaranteed Renewable Policy
## What is a Guaranteed Renewable Policy?

A guaranteed renewable policy is an insurance policy feature that guarantees that an insurer is committed to continue coverage as long as [premiums](/premium) are paid on the policy. While re-insurability is guaranteed, premiums can rise in light of the filing of a claim, injury, or different factors that could increase the risk of future claims.

## Understanding Guaranteed Renewable Policies

Most insurers offer both guaranteed renewable policies and non-cancellable policies. In the event that premiums are comparative for both a guaranteed and a non-cancellable policy, the non-cancellable policy is a better deal for the consumer since it offers the double guarantee of re-insurability and locked-in premiums.

In total, insurers ordinarily offer three types of policies: non-cancellable plus guaranteed renewable, guaranteed renewable, and conditionally renewable.

### Non-Cancellable and Guaranteed Renewable Policy

A non-cancellable and guaranteed renewable policy guarantees that there will be no changes to your premium schedule, your month to month benefits or your policy benefits up to mature 65 (or one more indicated age) except if you request them. The exception to this is assuming you file a claim, experience an injury, or then again assuming there is some other factor that the insurance company trusts increases the risk of future claims. In this case, the insurance company can raise your premiums.

This type of contract is many times chosen while purchasing disability insurance. The vast majority can't be aware for certain that their income will never go down ever again. On the off chance that you purchase a non-cancellable and guaranteed renewable policy — even assuming your income goes down further down the road and you are totally crippled — the company will pay you the total disability benefit you originally positioned in-force.

Even however there is definitely not an exceptional price difference, non-cancellable and guaranteed renewable policies regularly cost more than guaranteed renewable policies. Non-cancellable and guaranteed renewable policies are generally preferred on the grounds that the policyholder won't be affected on the off chance that an insurance company reports a gigantic rate increase later on.

### Guaranteed Renewable Policy

This insurance policy isn't generally so extensive as a non-cancellable and guaranteed renewable policy. With a non-cancellable and guaranteed renewable policy, the policyholder can decide to make changes to their premium schedule, month to month benefits, or policy benefits.

With a guaranteed renewable policy, that decision belongs to the insurance company and most insurance companies will attempt to diminish their liability on the off chance that they would be able.

### Conditionally Renewable Policy

A conditionally renewable policy offers the least benefits to the policyholder compared to the next two policies — non-cancellable and guaranteed renewable, and guaranteed renewable. A [conditionally renewable](/conditionally-renewable-policy) policy offers no guarantee that your equivalent benefits will be restored consistently; the insurance company can change the conditions of your policy consistently assuming that they decide to.
