# Micro-Investing Platform
## What Is a Micro-Investing Platform?

A micro-investing platform is an application that allows users to set aside small sums of cash consistently. Micro-investing platforms aim to eliminate traditional barriers to investing, for example, brokerage [account minimums](/least equilibrium), and urge individuals to invest even on the off chance that they have limited earnings and assets.

## Figuring out Micro-Investing Platforms

Micro-investing platforms are the computerized age equivalent of saving in a jar all the spare change from your purchases and afterward taking the full jar of change to the bank. For instance, you could pursue an account with a platform and register your debit card. Each time you make a purchase, the platform gathers together your purchase to the nearest dollar and deposits the difference into an investment account. [Robo-advisors](/roboadvisor-roboadviser), like Acorns, helped pioneer this concept.

You are probably not going to notice the extra $0.50 missing from your account when you pay $3.50 for a cappuccino. However, over the long haul, you will notice the developing sum in your [brokerage account](/brokerageaccount). Assuming you buy that equivalent coffee 20 times per month (fundamentally, every typical working day), you will have easily invested $10 before the month's over or $120 before the year's over. Of course, an improved solution would be for you to make your own cappuccinos at home for $0.50 and invest the $3.00 savings per cup and end up with an extra $60 every month and $720 per year to invest, yet for people who would rather not change their behavior, micro-investing offers a superior alternative to investing nothing by any means.

Micro-investing makes investing sums as low as a couple of pennies conceivable by taking out per-transaction [fees](/transaction-fees) and investment essentials. Consumers don't have to set aside $100 for one share of a stock or mutual fund, and they don't have to pay a brokerage fee to purchase that share. All things being equal, they pay the micro-investing platform a nominal fee, perhaps $1 per month, and it invests their money in [fractional shares](/fractionalshare).

Since those fractional shares are in exchange-traded funds (ETF), the consumer's investment is diversified across various stocks as well as bonds, assisting with safeguarding against market swings such that investing in a single stock doesn't.

Even for individuals who save consistently, micro-investing platforms can advance their situation. Saving $50 every month for a considerable length of time in a [savings account](/savingsaccount) with 0% interest rate results in $6,000, which really has less intrinsic value following a long time since savings accounts for the most part pay interest at a lower rate than inflation. Investing $49 every month (after the $1 platform fee) for a considerable length of time with an average annual return of 7%, nonetheless, results in $8,580 before taxes and inflation.

## Special Considerations
### Features of Micro-Investing Platforms

Programmed investment is certainly not a required feature of a micro-investing platform. The ability to invest tiny measures of money is. Keeping that in mind, some micro-investing platforms aim to help users to not just start saving and investing yet additionally to find out about investing. The platform could show them how to pick an ETF in light of their objectives, risk tolerance, interests and convictions, for instance.

An eminent micro-investing platform is Acorns Inc. which naturally invests a client's spare change through a smartphone app. Micro-investing platforms must register with the [Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)](/sec) as a [Registered Investment Advisor (RIA)](/ria) and as a broker-dealer.
