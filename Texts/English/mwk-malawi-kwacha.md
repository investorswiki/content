# MWK (Malawian Kwacha)
## What Is the Malawian Kwacha (MWK)

MWK is the [currency code](/isocurrencycode) for the **kwacha**, the national currency of Malawi. Its sub-unit, the **tambala**, is 100th 100th of a kwacha. Totals are frequently written as "MK" or "K" trailed by the number, for example, MK 10,000 or K 10,000.

As of August 2020, 1 U.S. dollar is equivalent to about 750 MWK.

## Grasping the Malawian Kwacha

The Malawian kwacha was first presented in 1971, with an exchange rate of one kwacha to two Malawian pounds, the currency that it was supplanting. The Malawian government displayed the Malawian kwacha on the [Zambian kwacha](/zmk-zambian-kwacha) (ZMK), presented in Zambia in 1968. Kwacha is the Chichewa word for "first light", which represents the unfolding of another time post-freedom.

In 2005, the Malawian government [pegged](/currency-peg) the kwacha to the United States dollar (USD). An unofficial, [black-market](/blackmarket) exchange rate arose and came to prevail, redirecting USD and other foreign currencies out of official channels. In 2010 1 U.S. dollar could buy 150 MWK. The Reserve Bank of Malawi changed the kwacha in 2012, officially debasing it by a third, to draw in sufficient foreign currency to import more fuel. The kwacha has since lost more ground to the dollar, exchange close to a rate of 725 kwacha to $1 starting around 2018 and 750:1 by 2020.

The political situation is the best expected threat to the current IMF-approved course for the Malawian economy and the value of its currency. The currency was just changed in 2012 in light of the fact that the former head of state kicked the bucket and was supplanted by somebody with an alternate economic philosophy. As power shifts, so could Malawi's commitment to IMF-ordered reforms.

## The Malawian Economy

Malawi stays one of the world's most lacking countries. The to a great extent agricultural Malawian economy depends intensely on support from the [International Monetary Fund](/imf) (IMF), [the World Bank](/worldbank) and different nations as it fights issues with the economy, education and the spread of AIDS. As a result of its dependent position, Malawi frequently adjusts to IMF requests to meet all requirements for loans and other economic programs.

In 2018, the Malawian economy saw an increase in growth and drop to single-digit [inflation](/inflation), however public debt increased to 55 percent of [GDP](/gdp). The IMF approved an Extended Credit Facility (ECF) worth $112.3 million to be dispensed more than three years relying on the prerequisite that Malawi fulfills the IMF's needs for economic reform. In particular, the IMF is expecting Malawi to carry out a monetary policy that curbs inflation however keeps positive real interest rates, increase and streamline spending on infrastructure and social service to fight poverty, reform financial management and procurement and to execute other structural reforms. The Malawian economy developed at an annual rate of 4.4% in 2019 with an inflation rate of 9.4%.

Somewhat, Malawi has proactively started executing these principles. A significant part of the rebound in growth was due to an increase in agricultural production, however the getting control over of inflation was generally the consequence of fruitful fiscal and monetary policies.
