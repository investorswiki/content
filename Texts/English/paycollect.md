# Pay/Collect
## What Is Pay/Collect?

Pay/gather is an abbreviated reference to the payment and assortment of funds — after futures positions have been [marked to market (MTM)](/marktomarket) — between clearing individuals and their particular clearinghouses.

In futures trading, accounts in a futures contract are marked to market consistently. Profit and loss are calculated between the long and short positions.

## Grasping Pay/Collect

Pay/gather emerges with futures positions, which are marked to market each evening after exchanges are closed for trading. As futures trading is a zero-sum game, in marking to market, one side of the futures position will be in a deficit position while the other is in a surplus. This imbalance is offset through the compensation/gather transactions executed by brokers to their clearing organizations.

The "pay" part alludes to a payment required — or a loss. The "gather" side is money received — or a gain. A clearinghouse offsets trades against each other toward the finish of each and every day to guarantee the least amount of money needs to change hands. The ultimate payment or money received is the compensation/gather.

## Mark to Market in Pay/Collect

In securities trading, mark to market includes recording the price or value of a security, portfolio, or account to mirror the current market value as opposed to the [book value](/bookvalue) or a trader's model value. This is done most frequently in [futures](/futures) accounts to guarantee that margin requirements are being met.

On the off chance that the current market value causes the [margin account](/marginaccount) to fall below its required level, the trader will be confronted with a [margin call](/margincall). [Mutual funds](/mutualfund) are likewise marked to market consistently at the market close with the goal that investors have a better thought of the asset's [net asset value (NAV)](/nav).

Mark-to-market losses are paper losses produced through an accounting entry instead of the genuine sale of a security. Mark-to-market losses happen when financial instruments held are valued at the current market value, which is lower than the price paid to secure them. These would compare with a "pay."

An exchange marks traders' accounts to their market values daily by settling the gains and losses that outcome due to changes in the value of the security. There are dependably two counterparties on one or the other side of a futures contract — a [long trader](/long) and a [short trader](/shortselling). The trader who stands firm on the long foothold in the futures contract is typically [bullish](/bull), while the trader shorting the contract is considered [bearish](/bear).

If, by the day's end, the futures contract went into goes down in value, the long margin account will be diminished and the short margin account increased to mirror the change in the value of the derivative. On the other hand, an increase in value brings about an increase to the margin account holding the long position and a diminishing to the short futures account.
