# Exchange-Traded Derivative
## What Is an Exchange-Traded Derivative?

An exchange-traded derivative is a financial contract that is listed and traded on a regulated exchange. Basically, these are [derivatives](/derivative) that are traded in a regulated environment.

Exchange-traded derivatives have become progressively well known due to the benefits they have over [over-the-counter](/otc) (OTC) derivatives. These benefits incorporate standardization, liquidity, and elimination of default risk.

Futures and options are two of the most famous exchange-traded derivatives. Exchange-traded derivatives can be utilized to hedge exposure and to hypothesize on many financial assets, including commodities, equities, currencies, and even interest rates.

## Understanding Exchange-Traded Derivatives

Exchange-traded derivatives incorporate options, futures, and other financial contracts that are listed and traded on regulated exchanges, for example, the [Chicago Mercantile Exchange](/cme) (CME), [International Securities Exchange](/internationalsecurityexchange) (ISE), the [Intercontinental Exchange](/intercontinentalexchange) (ICE), or the [LIFFE](/liffe) exchange in London, to give some examples.

Dissimilar to their over-the-counter cousins, exchange-traded derivatives can be appropriate for some [retail investors](/retailinvestor). In the OTC market, it is not difficult to become mixed up in the complexity of the instrument and the specific idea of what is being traded.

In such manner, exchange-traded derivatives enjoy two big benefits:

### Standardization

The exchange has standardized terms and specifications for every derivative contract. This makes it more straightforward for investors to decide essential data about the thing they're trading, like the value of a contract, the amount of the security or thing addressed by a contract (e.g., parcels), and the number of contracts that can be bought or sold.

Individual contracts can be a size that is less overwhelming for the small investor. For example, an investor with limited capital could think about mini options (10 shares) on expensive stocks versus standard options (100 shares).

### Elimination of Default Risk

The exchange itself acts as the [counterparty](/counterpartyrisk) for each exchange-traded derivative transaction. It actually turns into the seller for each buyer, and the buyer for each seller. This kills the risk of the counterparty to the derivative transaction defaulting on its obligations.

Another principal quality of exchange-traded derivatives is their [mark-to-market](/marktomarket) feature. Mark to market means gains and losses on each derivative contract are determined daily.

In this way, on any trading day, on the off chance that the client causes losses that disintegrate the initial [margin](/margin) amount to a specific level, they should give the required capital sooner rather than later. In the event that they don't, their derivative position might be closed out by the firm.

> Financial futures are derivatives in light of treasuries, indexes, currencies, and that's just the beginning. They're much of the time utilized by financial institutions to hedge long positions held in the underlying security.

## Users of Exchange Traded Derivatives

A wide range of small retail investors and large institutional investors use exchange-traded derivatives to hedge the value of portfolios and to conjecture on price developments.

Banks could hedge the value of their treasuries portfolio by taking a contrary position in treasury futures. An import-trade organization could utilize currency futures to lock in currency rates for approaching transactions.

Retail investors could take a position in stock options to hedge the value of their stock portfolios. Or on the other hand, they essentially could need the premium income acquired by selling an option contract.

Most investors are consoled by the standardization and regulatory oversight offered by centralized exchanges.

In any case, the transparency of exchange-traded derivatives might be an impediment to large institutions that may not need their trading expectations known to the public or their competitors.

As a matter of fact, institutional investors could opt to work straightforwardly with issuers and investment banks to make tailored investments that give them the specific risk and reward profile they look for.
