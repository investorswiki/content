# Spot Date
## What is Spot Date?

The spot date alludes to the day when a spot transaction is commonly settled, meaning when the funds engaged with the transaction are moved. The spot date is calculated from the horizon, which is the date when the transaction is initiated. In forex, the spot date for most currency pairs is normally two [business days](/business-day) after the date the order is put.

## What a Spot Date implies

A spot date is the day the transaction settles instead of the day the trade is executed. The term is most often found in reference to forex trades. Stock or options trades might allude to comparable terms, for example, [trade date](/tradedate) (the day the trade order was executed) and [settlement date](/settlementdate) (a point in time regularly three trading days after the fact), however these terms are not something similar and have unobtrusively various implications.

An exception to the typical two-day spot-date guideline is the USD/CAD pair, which gets comfortable one business day since this currency pair is usually traded and its financial centers are in a similar time region. Moreover, settlement doesn't need to happen on the spot date. In a short date forward, for instance, the transaction is settled in advance of the ordinary spot date.

The spot date is likewise pertinent in both a [forward contract](/forwardcontract) and a [foreign exchange swap](/foreign-currency-swaps) contract. For a forward contract, the length of the forward will be calculated out of the spot date. For instance, a one-month forward contract will settle one month from the spot date, not from the date of transaction. Essentially, the front leg of a foreign exchange swap will typically be the spot date.

The spot date is likewise the date at which there is no change of the rate for interest rate differentials. On the off chance that the settlement date is past the spot date, a calculation for the interest rate discount or premium will be required. Moreover, on the off chance that a contract is expected to settle before the spot date, either today (TOD) or tomorrow (TOM), the rate will be altered relying upon the yield of the two currencies.

Value TOD and TOM have become more pervasive with the improvement in communications and electronic wire transactions.

## Illustration of a Spot Date Versus a Settlement Date
