## What Is Anchoring?

Anchoring is a heuristic revealed by behavioral finance that depicts the psyche utilization of irrelevant data, for example, the purchase price of a security, as a fixed reference point (or anchor) for coming to subsequent conclusions about that security. Hence, individuals are bound to estimate the value of a similar thing higher on the off chance that the suggested retail cost is $100 than if it is $50.

In sales, price, and wage negotiations, anchoring can be an integral asset. Studies have shown that setting an anchor at the outset of a negotiation can significantly affect the ultimate result than the interceding negotiation process.

Accordingly, market participants accept greater risk by holding the investment in the hope the security will return to its [purchase price](/purchaseprice). Market participants are in many cases aware that their anchor is imperfect and endeavor to make adjustments to reflect subsequent data and analysis.
