# Trade Act of 1974
## What Is Trade Act of 1974?

The Trade Act of 1974 is a piece of legislation passed by the U.S. Congress to grow American participation in international trade and reduce trade questions. The enactment of the law occurred on Jan. 3, 1975. The Act gave the authority to reduce or take out trade barriers and to further develop associations with non-market Communist countries and countries with creating economies. Further, the Act expected to carry change to harmful and unfair competition laws.

## Understanding the Trade Act of 1974

The Act gave relief to American industries negatively impacted by increased international trade and put [tariffs](/duty) on imports from non-industrial nations. It additionally accommodated U.S. action against foreign countries whose import activities unfairly disadvantaged American labor and industry.

Everything considered, the Trade Act of 1974 and its subsequent cycles have been utilized more to open foreign markets to U.S. exports and investments than to shield American industries from unfair outside competition.

International trade has long been a disagreeable political and economic issue. Rivals contend it removes occupations from domestic workers. That's what defenders counter, while international trade might force domestic workers to move into different lines of work, free trade makes the most of specialization and division of labor to work on economic conditions in every participating country.

The expected purpose of the Trade Act of 1974 was to advance the development of an open, non-unfair, and fair world economic system. The fair global system would animate fair and free competition between the United States and foreign nations. It likewise expected to foster the economic growth of, and [full employment](/fullemployment) in, the United States.

Article II of the U.S. Constitution has been deciphered to vest authority to conduct foreign policy in the president. Notwithstanding, Article I, Section 8 gives Congress the powers to lay and collect duties and to control foreign commerce.

In this way, the ability to control trade with different nations must be assigned by Congress to the president. While the Trade Act of 1974 conceded the president authority to take part in trade negotiations, Congress limited presidential jurisdiction by requiring a determination that any agreement won't jeopardize national security and would advance the purposes of the Act.

## Fast Track of the Trade Act

The Trade Act of 1974 made fast track authority for the president to arrange trade agreements that Congress might support or object yet can't alter or delay. The fast track authority laid out under the Act was set to lapse in 1980. Be that as it may, it was extended by eight years in 1979, and again in 1988. The 1988 extension was until 1993 to take into account the negotiation of the Uruguay Round inside the system of the [General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade](/gatt) (GATT).

The Act received one more extension to April 1994, a day after the Uruguay Round finished up as the Marrakesh Agreement changed the GATT into the [World Trade Organization](/wto) (WTO). The Trade Act of 2002 reestablished the fast track. The Obama administration likewise looked for renewal for fast track authority in 2012.

At the point when negotiations to eliminate the culpable trade practice fail, the United States might make a move to raise import duties on the foreign country's products as a means to rebalance lost concessions."

"[T]he [Trump] administration announced tariffs on $50 billion worth of imports from China for supposed unfair practices, for example, forced technology transfer and intellectual property theft. When Beijing fought back with tariffs on U.S. agricultural products, Trump announced that he would hit one more $200 billion of imports from China with tariffs."
