# Supervisory Capital Assessment Program (SCAP)
## What Was the Supervisory Capital Assessment Program (SCAP)?

The Supervisory Capital Assessment Program (SCAP) was a financial stress trial of America's biggest banks, directed by the [Federal Reserve System](/federalreservesystem) once just, amidst the [financial crisis](/financial-crisis) of 2008-2009.

The test was an assessment of the [capital buffers](/capital-buffer) of U.S. banking institutions attempted in the spring of 2009. It was planned to measure the financial strength of the country's 19 biggest financial institutions moving forward.

The financial crisis had left many banks and institutions seriously [undercapitalized](/undercapitalization), and the stress tests were planned to demonstrate the way that well the banking sector could endure the impact of a major economic downturn.

## How the Supervisory Capital Assessment Program (SCAP) Worked

The stress tests were directed exclusively on banking institutions with assets more than $100 billion. These were basically the banks that the Fed considered "too big to even think about failing."

Federal banking supervisors tried to decide if every one of these institutions had an adequate cash buffer to endure losses while continuing to give customers access to credit. The stress test utilized a baseline scenario to measure every foundation's [Tier 1 common capital](/tier-1-common-capital-proportion) or accessible [cash reserves](/cash-reserves). The institutions likewise were tried for their performance against a speculative and extreme scenario, a sort of most dire outcome imaginable.

Banks could receive any of five grades:

- All around capitalized
- Satisfactorily capitalized
- Undercapitalized
- Fundamentally undercapitalized
- Fundamentally undercapitalized

The stress tests tried the banks' speculative performance in a set of scenarios, some more terrible than others. For instance, a stress test could ask, consider the possibility that all of the accompanying occurred simultaneously: A 10% unemployment rate, a 20% drop in the stock market, and a 40% decline in home prices from one side of the country to the other. Each bank was told to utilize the next nine fourth of its projected financials to decide if it would have sufficient capital to endure the recreated crisis.

## Aftereffects of the SCAP Test

While testing was complete, the end-product showed that 10 of the 19 tried banks would have had deficient capital to meet their business needs during a financial crisis.

In any case, each bank which went through testing met the legally ordered capital requirements. The Fed delivered the scores of the banks which went through the stress tests to the public. Banks that failed the stress tests went over ineffectively to the public.

The tests overall assisted with recognizing any conceivable approaching dangers of economic disaster inside the banking sector. The outcomes put pressure on the banks to keep higher reserves close by in the event of another financial crisis.
