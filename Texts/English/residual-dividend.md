# Residual Dividend
## What Is a Residual Dividend?

A residual dividend is a [dividend policy](/dividendpolicy) utilized by companies by which the amount of dividends paid to shareholders amounts to what profits are left over after the company has paid for its [capital expenditures](/capitalexpenditure) (CapEx) and [working capital](/workingcapital) costs.

Companies that utilization a residual dividend policy fund CapEx with accessible earnings before paying [dividends](/dividend) to shareholders. This means the dollar amount of dividends paid to investors every year will shift.

## How a Residual Dividend Works

A residual dividend policy means companies use [earnings](/earnings) to pay for CapEx first. Dividends are then paid with any leftover earnings generated.

A company's [capital structure](/capitalstructure) normally incorporates both long-term debt and equity. CapEx can be financed with a loan (debt) or by giving more stock (equity).

> Return on assets (ROA), calculated as net income partitioned by total assets, is commonly used to survey management's decision-production and the progress of a residual dividend policy.

## Special Considerations

While shareholders might acknowledge management's strategy of utilizing earnings to pay for CapEx, the investment community dissects how well the firm purposes asset spending to generate more income. The [return on asset](/returnonassets) (ROA) formula is net income partitioned by total assets, and ROA is a common device used to survey management's performance.

In the event that a dress manufacturer's decision to spend $100,000 on CapEx is the right one, the company can increase production or operate machinery at a lower cost, and both of these factors can increase profits. As [net income](/netincome) increases the ROA ratio improves, and shareholders might be more ready to acknowledge the residual dividend policy later on.

Notwithstanding, assuming the firm generates lower earnings and keeps on funding CapEx at similar rate, shareholder dividends decline.

## Requirements for a Residual Dividend

At the point when a business generates earnings, the firm can either hold the earnings for use in the company or pay the earnings as a dividend to stockholders. [Retained earnings](/retainedearnings) are utilized to fund current business operations or to buy assets. Each company needs assets to operate, and those assets might should be upgraded over the long run and ultimately supplanted. Business managers must consider the assets required to operate the business and the need to reward shareholders by paying dividends.

For the residual dividend policy to work, it expects the [dividend irrelevance theory](/dividendirrelevance) is true. The theory recommends that investors are unconcerned with which form of return they receive from a company â€” whether it be dividends or [capital gains](/capitalgain). Under this theory, the residual dividend policy doesn't influence the company's market value since investors value dividends and capital gains similarly.

The calculation for residual dividends is done inactively. Companies utilizing retained earnings to finance CapEx will more often than not utilize the residual policy. The dividends for investors are generally conflicting and capricious.

## Illustration of Residual Dividends

A dress manufacturer keeps a rundown of capital expenditures that are required in later years. In the current month, the firm necessities $100,000 to upgrade machinery and buy another piece of equipment.

The firm generates $140,000 in earnings for the month and spends $100,000 on CapEx. The leftover income of $40,000 is paid as a residual dividend to shareholders, which is $20,000 not exactly was paid in every one of the last three months.

Shareholders may be frustrated when management decides to bring down the dividend payment, and senior management must clarify the rationale behind the capital spending for legitimize the lower payment.
