## What is True Cost Economics?

True cost economics is an economic model that looks to incorporate the cost of negative [externalities](/externality) into the pricing of goods and services. Defenders of this type of economic system feel products and activities that straightforwardly or by implication make unsafe results living creatures and additionally the environment ought to be taxed likewise to mirror their hidden costs.

## Seeing True Cost Economics

True cost economics is most frequently applied to the production of commodities and addresses the difference between the market price of a commodity and total cultural cost of that commodity, for example, what it might negatively mean for the environment or public wellbeing (negative externalities). The concept additionally might be applied to concealed benefits — also called positive externalities —, for example, how the fertilization of plants by bees significantly affects the environment at no cost.

## True Cost Economics Theory

The school of thought behind true cost economics comes because of the perceived requirement for ethical consideration in [neoclassical economic theory](/neoclassical). The reasoning behind true cost economics depends on the conviction that the cultural cost of delivering a product or delivering a service may not be precisely reflected in its price. For an illustration of a cultural cost, consider the extra burden to taxpayers, consumers and the government of giving medical care to smokers — a cost not by any stretch borne by cigarette manufacturers.

At the point when the price of something neglects to mirror every one of the total costs associated with its production, delivering or impact, then, at that point, under true cost economics, a third-party (a regulator or government) may have the obligation to step in to impose a [tariff](/tariff) or tax to influence consumer behavior or potentially give the means to future remediation. Such an action would include constraining companies to "[internalize](/assimilation)" the negative externalities. This would perpetually make market prices increase.

An illustration of such a practice is the point at which a government manages the amount of pollution a company is permitted to make and release, for example, with the coal industry and mercury and sulfur emissions. Negative externalities may likewise be taxed, like carbon dioxide emissions. Such a tax is known as a [Pigovian tax](/pigoviantax), which is defined as any tax that tries to address an inefficient market outcome.

## True Cost Economics and Consumers

For consumers, the cost of numerous goods and services that are as of now affordable, and frequently underestimated, could see an extreme rise in costs if their "true costs" are accounted. For instance, if the environmental cost of extracting and refining the rare earth components that are essential for the vast majority modern electrical products were figured into their price, it could push that price to an inaccessible sum. Furthermore, on the off chance that one represented air, noise and different types of pollution brought about by the manufacturing and the utilization of another vehicle, then the price of the new vehicle would, by certain evaluations, increase by more than $40,000.
