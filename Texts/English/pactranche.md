## What Is a Planned Amortization Class (PAC) Tranche?

An arranged amortization class (PAC) tranche is a sub-type of asset-backed security that is intended to shield investors from prepayment risk and extension risk. An arranged amortization class tranche is intended to pay as per a primary payment schedule that is made utilizing a scope of [prepayment speed assumptions](/psa) (PSA). This scope of prepayment speeds is alluded to as the PAC collar.

## How Planned Amortization Class Tranches Work

Arranged amortization class tranches are structured products that offer the most stable cash flow and milestones. The companion tranches in a PAC tranche structure retain the majority of the prepayment and extension risk. So if the [modeling](/financialmodeling) for the product is at all accurate, investors are left with an investment that ought to perform as indicated by the schedule put down on paper.

The PAC tranche structure, with one generally safe tranche sitting on different tranches engrossing more risk, is the most common one. Of course, in view of the safety, a PAC tranche offers, it will include the most reduced yields inside the structure.

However long the genuine prepayment rate is between a designated scope of prepayment speeds, the life of the PAC tranche will remain somewhat stable, decreasing the risk that payment will be delayed and the life of the instrument extended longer than initially arranged. Likewise, this tranche likewise gets some measure of protection against [prepayment risk](/prepaymentrisk), which is passed down to different tranches in return for a higher rate of return on those lower tranches.

On account of a contracted lifespan for the PAC tranche, the investor can wind up with capital returned in a low-interest environment, in this manner bringing down the overall return for that money even assuming it is reinvested. On account of an extended lifespan, the investor probably has capital tied up in a lower-yielding investment while higher-yielding options flourish.
