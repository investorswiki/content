# NYSE Amex Equities
## What Is the NYSE Amex Equities?

The term NYSE Amex Equities alludes to an American stock exchange best known for trading small-cap, micro-cap, corporate bonds, [exchange traded funds](/etf) (ETFs), and different sorts of investments. The exchange was called the [American Stock Exchange](/amex) (AMEX) before being acquired by NYSE Euronext. The exchange went through a series of name changes since it began in 1849. Today, it's called the NYSE American and operates as a completely electronic exchange.

## Grasping the NYSE Amex Equities

The NYSE Amex Equities' foundations trace back similar to 1849 when [trades](/trade) occurred outside. At that point, it adopted the name New York Curb Agency as a method for mirroring the unconventional [transactions](/exchange) that occurred. The exchange moved inside around twenty years some other time when it took on the name New York Cub Exchange.

It was only after 1953 that it changed its name to the American Stock Exchange. Right now, the AMEX was quite possibly of the biggest exchange in the United States, second just to the [New York Stock Exchange](/nyse) (NYSE).

NYSE Amex Equities was rebranded in 2008 after Euronext acquired the former [American Stock Exchange](/amex). The change to NYSE Amex Equities was the first in quite a while when it was renamed the American Stock Exchange. At one time, the American Stock Exchange was the second-biggest exchange in the United States — second to the [New York Stock Exchange](/nyse). That job has since been filled by [Nasdaq](/nasdaq).

In 2009, NYSE [Euronext](/euronext) purchased the exchange and renamed it NYSE Amex Equities. The name possibly endured a couple of years when it turned into the NYSE MKT. After the [Securities and Exchange Commission](/sec) (SEC) endorsement of IEX, NYSE MKT rebranded to NYSE American to mirror the recently executed speed bump.

As referenced over, the exchange is completely electronic and is planned as such to limit latency speeds. It works with institutional trading with products like an electronic [designated market maker](/designated-market-maker-dmm) (DMM) assigned to each listed company and a defer mechanism to support midpoint trading. This unique blend of services gives [investors](/financial backer) with an extra method to enter and exit positions while limiting adverse selection.

> In 2016, NYSE American announced plans to present a 350-microsecond speed bump in trading small and micro-cap stocks — a concept made renowned by IEX's pioneer.

The NYSE American is among the biggest American stock exchanges by [trading volume](/volumeoftrade). The most active [shares](/shares) on the exchange operate in the energy, mining, medical, and drug [sectors](/sector). As per the company's website, the exchange gives a place to in excess of 8,000 developing companies to list their shares.

## Special Considerations

NYSE American was a member of the [National Association of Securities Dealers](/nasd) (NASD) from 1998 to 2004 before the exchange returned to private ownership. In mid 2017, the exchange announced plans to end floor trading as part of a change to another technology platform. This breaks from the custom of brokers wandering the exchange floor during normal trading hours.
