# Housing Bonds
## What Are Housing Bonds?

Housing bonds are debt securities, a variation of municipal [revenue bonds](/revenuebond), issued by state or nearby governments to fund-raise for affordable housing development projects.

## Grasping Housing Bonds

State and nearby governments issue housing bonds to finance the construction or rehabilitation of affordable housing. As well as repaying the bond [principal](/principal), the state or area must pay [interest](/interest) on the money it acquires. Housing bonds sometimes require citizen endorsement and can either be short-or long-term issuances.

A municipal authority might issue debt as bonds to raise capital to finance projects. The two types of municipal bonds are [general obligation (GO)](/generalobligationbond) bonds and revenue bonds. The interest payment and principal repayment of general obligation bonds are funded from the state or neighborhood government's financial money vaults. These bonds are backed by the [full faith and credit](/full-faith-credit) of the municipal government, which might have the authority to increase taxes to satisfy its payment obligations in a hurry bond. In the mean time, payment obligations on a revenue bond are backed by the projected revenue stream of the project for which the bond was issued. A housing bond is one type of a revenue bond.

As [private activity bonds (PABs)](/privateactivitybond), housing bonds can be issued in the interest of qualified profit and nonprofit engineers to finance low-income multifamily and senior housing projects. Likewise, the proceeds from housing bonds may likewise be issued to give low-cost mortgage financing to low-income families or people so they can purchase a home.

## Requirements for Housing Bonds

[Mortgages](/mortgage) gave through housing bonds are restricted to first-time homebuyers who earn something like the area [median](/median) income. Besides, the price of a home purchased with a housing bond mortgage is limited to 90% of the average area purchase price.

Housing bonds normally have low interest rates and can be issued as either a fixed or [variable-rate demand obligation (VRDO)](/variable-rated-demand-bond). The principal and interest payments to [bondholders](/bondholder) are produced using pledged mortgage repayments and investment earnings. The repayments made on mortgages by borrowers are collected by the [trustee](/trustee) of the housing bond who puts the funds in short-term investments until the scheduled time to pay interest to bondholders. In effect, payment on housing bonds is backed by the timely and reliable interest payment and principal repayment of the underlying mortgages by borrowers.

## Benefits of Housing Bonds

Housing bonds are beneficial to the state as well as to private investors. From one perspective, the government gains access to a large amount of cheap financing. On the other, the tax benefits offered by housing bonds are highly appealing to lenders in the upper tax brackets.

For investors, the interest paid by housing bonds is exempt from federal and, now and again, state income tax. The higher the [marginal tax rate](/marginaltaxrate), the more important a housing revenue bond's [tax exemption](/tax_exempt). In spite of the fact that investors subject to the [alternative least tax (AMT)](/alternativeminimumtax) might be subject to taxes, the exemption means that investors in high federal-tax brackets benefit from revenue bonds and other municipal bonds. This tax exemption assists with making up for the bonds' low interest rate.

Federal [low-income housing tax credits](/long-income-housing-tax-credit) are one more source of capital that might be utilized rather than, or as well as, housing bonds to finance affordable housing projects. The credits are nonrefundable federal income tax credits for part of the mortgage interest that qualified home purchasers pay every year.
