# Illiquid Option
## What Is an Illiquid Option?

An illiquid option is a [options contract](/optionscontract) that won't be quickly sold or changed over completely to cash rapidly at the common market price. Illiquid options have extremely low or no [open interest](/openinterest).

Along these lines, holders of these options will be unable to discard them at a fair price in the market and might be forced to hold on to their contracts until they lapse.

## Grasping Illiquid Options

[Liquidity](/liquidity) is the degree to which an asset can be immediately purchased or sold on the market. A [option](/option) is a flexible [security](/security). Traders buy options to conjecture on their current holdings. Stock options will ordinarily address 100 shares. Options commonly trade less every now and again than their underlying assets, like stocks or bonds.

An illiquid option has an exceptionally low level of liquidity. The liquidity of options is vastly different than those of stocks. The liquidity of stocks is ordinarily decided by the stocks' [daily trading volume](/volumeoftrade), though options are not really traded as intensely. Truth be told, there can be many various contracts for options available on the market.

On the off chance that you're holding an illiquid option, you will for the most part notice an extremely large [bid-ask spread](/bid-askspread) on the contract. This is on the grounds that there are insufficient buyers — and subsequently, insufficient interest created — to oblige those needing to sell.

## The most effective method to Determine Illiquidity

There are generally two manners by which to decide liquidity for an option. First is the daily volume, or how frequently it was traded that day. The higher the volume, the more liquid it is, while a lower volume will mean a lower level of liquidity.

The second method for deciding liquidity is through [open interest](/openinterest). The higher the open interest, the more liquid the option will be. In any case, assuming there is next to no open interest, that option can be considered illiquid.
