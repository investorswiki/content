# Formula Method
## What Is the Formula Method?

The formula method is utilized to work out termination payments on a rashly ended swap agreement, by which the ending party remunerates the losses borne by the non-ending party due to the early termination (i.e., before it develops).

The formula method can measure up to the next two acceptable termination repayment strategies: [indemnification](/indemnification-method) and agreement value methods.

## Grasping the Formula Method

The formula method was acquainted with lay out a reasonable methodology for working out termination payments on a rashly ended [swap](/swap), as opposed to an impromptu, made to order classification.

Termination payments are utilized to repay the party who didn't make the swap end ahead of schedule for its financial loss, or [opportunity cost](/opportunitycost), for ending the agreement before its set [expiration](/expirationdate) date. Regularly, [currency swaps](/currencyswap) will frequently utilize the formula method, however it stays one of the more uncommon methods for computing a swap's initial termination payments.

Of the three official methods for working out termination payments — as laid out by the [International Swaps and Derivatives Association](/isda) (ISDA) — the "agreement value method," which depends on the conditions accessible for a replacement swap, is the most common.

The third method, the [indemnification method](/indemnification-method), is likewise not frequently utilized. A swap might be ended early if a termination event, like a lawlessness, tax event, tax event upon merger, or credit event, happens. An event of default, for example, bankruptcy or inability to pay, can likewise cause early termination.

## Special Considerations

Swap agreements embraced by two counterparties are many times thought about legally binding financial contracts, and they have a pre-decided expiration date. Nonetheless, certain events can trigger an early termination before the stated expiration date. Assuming such an event is thought to have happened, the early termination must be assessed and the obligations of one party of the swap to the next not set in stone (taking into account the three ISDA-endorsed methods).

The formula method computes damages owed to the not to blame party by the to blame party in the early termination of a swap by following a clear calculation, or formula, which must be agreed upon by the two counterparties at the commencement of the swap agreement through the [termination clause](/termination-clause). Be that as it may, the formula method was rarely normalized; this prompted the development of other, better accounting methods, hence restricting the utilization of this method to compute early swap termination payments.

## Other Swap Early Termination Methods

The indemnification method requires the to blame counterparty to remunerate the not to blame counterparty for all losses and damages brought about by the early termination. This method was common when swaps were first developed, yet it has since been viewed as inefficient since it didn't really evaluate, or portray how to measure, the genuine losses and damages incurred from a rashly ended swap.

The agreement value method depends on the cost for starting a replacement swap transaction. The not to blame counterparty didn't cause the early termination and may in this way need to go into a replacement swap with an alternate counterparty.

Replacement swaps are utilized to work out termination payments since changes in market conditions since the initial (presently ended) swap were placed will mean that the terms of that swap may at this point not be applicable (or even accessible). The replacement swap will in this way probably have various terms and different interest rates. This method is the most common restitution for the early termination of a swap.

## Features
- The goal is to repay the not to blame party due to the early termination.
- The formula method is utilized to work out termination payments owed on a swap agreement that has been ended before its maturity.
- The formula itself must be agreed by each counterparty at the commencement of the swap agreement and explained in its termination clause.
- The formula method calculated damages owed to the not to blame party by the to blame party in the early termination of s swap by following a direct calculation, or formula.
- The two other accepted methods for working out termination payments, as laid out by the ISDA, are the "agreement value method" and "indemnification method."
