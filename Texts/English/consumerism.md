## What Is Consumerism?

Consumerism is the possibility that rising the consumption of goods and services purchased in the market is generally a helpful goal and that an individual's prosperity and happiness rely fundamentally upon getting consumer goods and material belongings. From an economic perspective, it is connected with the overwhelmingly [Keynesian](/keynesianeconomics) thought that [consumer spending](/consumer-spending) is the key driver of the economy and that reassuring consumers to spend is a major policy goal. Starting here of view, consumerism is a positive phenomenon that fuels economic growth.

## Grasping Consumerism

In common use, consumerism alludes to the propensity of individuals living in a [capitalist](/capitalism) economy to take part in a lifestyle of excessive materialism that rotates around reflexive, inefficient, or conspicuous overconsumption. In this sense, consumerism is widely understood to add to the destruction of traditional values and lifestyles, consumer abuse by big business, environmental debasement, and negative mental effects.

High rates of conspicuous consumption can be an inefficient zero-sum or even negative-sum activity as real resources are utilized something like produce goods that are not valued for their utilization but instead the picture they depict.

As conspicuous consumption, consumerism can impose colossal real costs on an economy.
