# Preferred Debt
## What Is Preferred Debt?

Preferred debt is a financial obligation that is viewed as more important than-or make take priority over-different types of debt. For instance, the first-or senior-mortgage would be viewed as preferred debt (while contrasting the first and second mortgage). This form of debt obligation normally must be paid first since it conveys more significance than different types of debt. Interest on preferred debt is normally free from any taxes.

## Grasping Preferred Debt

The principal types of preferred debt remember interest for mortgages, equity loans, and equity lines of credit. Any taxes owed to the IRS are viewed as a form of preferred debt too.

In a bankruptcy continuing, the holders of mortgages and different forms of preferred debt are normally classified as secured creditors. Assignment as a secured creditor frequently means there is a physical piece of property the debt is derived from, like real estate, related to a mortgage. In the [liquidation](/liquidation) of a debtor's assets during a bankruptcy continuing, the obligations of preferred debt must be released first. Loans of vehicles could likewise qualify the title holder as a secured creditor, with the outstanding obligation conceivably qualifying as preferred debt.

With preferred debt that depends on the physical property, it very well may be feasible to recover some, while perhaps not all, of the owed value by repossessing the property.

If so, the holder of the preferred debt could then try to claim a portion of the [cash assets](/quickassets) that stay from the borrower as the liquidation proceeds.

It is conceivable, contingent upon what assets are accessible, that recompense for preferred debt passes on no capital to pay other, subordinate debts or shareholders in liquidation. Even preferred securities are put after preferred and senior debt in terms of repayment order. Preferred securities would in any case be paid before common shareholders receive any compensation. The amount of preferred debt that a company continues its books, alongside different liabilities, could influence its overall valuation and ability to secure extra financing.
