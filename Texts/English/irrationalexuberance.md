## What Is Irrational Exuberance?

Irrational exuberance alludes to investor excitement that drives asset prices higher than those assets' fundamentals justify. The term was popularized by former Fed chair [Alan Greenspan](/alangreenspan) in a 1996 discourse, "**The Challenge of Central Banking in a Democratic Society.**" The discourse was given close to the beginning of the 1990s [dot-com](/dotcom) bubble, a textbook illustration of irrational exuberance:

> "Yet, how do we have any idea about when irrational exuberance has unduly escalated asset values, which then, at that point, become subject to surprising and delayed withdrawals as they have in Japan throughout the last decade? What's more, how would we factor that assessment into monetary policy?"

## Breaking Down Irrational Exuberance

Irrational exuberance is widespread and undue economic idealism. At the point when investors begin believing that the rise in prices in the recent past predicts the future, they are acting as though there is no uncertainty in the market, causing a [positive feedback loop](/positive-feedback) of ever-higher prices.

It is accepted to be a problem since it can lead to [bubbles](/bubble) in asset prices. Yet, when the eventually bubble bursts, investors rapidly go to [panic selling](/panicselling), now and again selling their assets for short of what they're worth in view of fundamentals. The panic that follows a bubble can spread to other asset classes, and might in fact cause a recession. The investors who get raised a ruckus around town — the ones who are still all-in just before the remedy — are the presumptuous ones who are certain that the bull run will last until the end of time. Trusting that a bull won't turn on you is a certain method for getting yourself gutted.

Alan Greenspan brought up the issue of whether central banks ought to address irrational exuberance through a preemptive tight monetary policy. He accepted that central ought to raise interest rates when apparently a speculative bubble is beginning to come to fruition.

## Model: The Late 1990's Dotcom Bubble

[Fed Chair Alan Greenspan](/alangreenspan) cautioned the markets about their irrational exuberance on December 5, 1996. However, he didn't tighten monetary policy until the spring of 2000, after banks and financiers had utilized the excess liquidity the Fed made in advance of the [Y2K bug](/y2k) to fund internet stocks. Having poured gasoline on the fire, Greenspan had no real option except to burst the bubble.

The stock market [crash](/dotcom-bubble) that followed eradicated over four years of gains in the tech-weighty Nasdaq composite index and cleared out a huge number of dollars in market capitalization.
