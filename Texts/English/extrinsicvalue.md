# Extrinsic Value
## What is Extrinsic Value?

Extrinsic value measures the difference between the market price of an option, called the [premium](/premium), and its [intrinsic value](/intrinsicvalue). Extrinsic value is likewise the portion of the worth that has been assigned to an option by factors other than the underlying asset's price. Something contrary to extrinsic value is intrinsic value, which is the inherent worth of an option.

## Essentials of Extrinsic Value

Extrinsic value, and intrinsic value, contain the cost or premium of an option. Intrinsic value is the difference between the underlying security's price and the option's [strike price](/strikeprice) when the option is [in the money](/inthemoney).

For instance, assuming a call option has a strike price of $20, and the underlying stock is trading at $22, that option has $2 of intrinsic value. The real option might trade at $2.50, so the extra $0.50 is extrinsic value.

On the off chance that a call option has value when the underlying security's price is trading below the strike price, the option's premium just originates from extrinsic value. On the other hand, if a [put option](/putoption) has value when the underlying security's price is trading over the strike price, the option's premium is just contained its extrinsic value.

## Factors Affecting Extrinsic Value

Extrinsic value is otherwise called "time value" on the grounds that the time left until the option contract terminates is one of the primary factors influencing the option premium. Under normal conditions, a contract loses value as it moves toward its expiration date since there is less time for the underlying security to well move. For instance, an option with one month to expiration that is [out of the money](/outofthemoney) will have more extrinsic value than that of an out of the money option with multi week to expiration.

Another factor that influences extrinsic value is [implied volatility](/iv). Implied volatility measures the amount an underlying asset might move over a predefined period. On the off chance that the implied volatility increases, the extrinsic value will increase. For instance, in the event that an investor purchases a call option with an annualized implied volatility of 20% and the implied volatility increases to 30% the next day, the extrinsic value would increase.

## Extrinsic Value Example

Expect a trader purchases a put option on XYZ stock. The stock is trading at $50, and the trader purchases a put option with a strike price of $45 for $3. It [expires](/expirationdate) in five months.

At the hour of purchase, that option has no intrinsic value on the grounds that the stock price is over the strike price of the put option. Accepting implied volatility and the price of the stock stay something similar, as the expiration date moves toward the option premium will advance toward $0.

In the event that the stock falls below the put strike price of $45, the option will have intrinsic value. For instance, if the stock tumbles to $40, the option has $5 in intrinsic value. On the off chance that there is still time until the option terminates, that option might trade for $5.50, $6, or more, since there is as yet extrinsic value too.

Intrinsic value doesn't mean profit. If the stock drops to $40 and the option lapses, the option is worth $5 due to its intrinsic value. The trader paid $3 for the option, so the profit is $2 per share, not $5.

## Features
- Extrinsic value is the difference between the market price of an option, additionally knowns as its premium, and its intrinsic price, which is the difference between an option's strike price and the underlying asset's price.
- Extrinsic value ascends with increase in volatility in the market.
