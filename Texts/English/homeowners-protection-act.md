# Homeowners Protection Act
## What Is the Homeowners Protection Act?

The Homeowners Protection Act of 1998 is a law intended to reduce the pointless payment of [private mortgage insurance (PMI)](/insurance) by homeowners who may as of now not be required to pay it. The Homeowners Protection Act covers generally private, residential mortgages purchased after July 29, 1999. The act, otherwise called the PMI Cancellation Act, orders that [lenders](/lender) unveil certain data about PMI.

The law additionally specifies that PMI must be automatically ended for homeowners who gather the required amount of equity in their homes (and in this way, are not generally required to have purchased PMI).

## Understanding the Homeowners Protection Act

Most lenders require a [down payment](/down_payment) that is equivalent to roughly 20% of the home's purchase price. This standard is intended to guarantee that the borrower has sufficient financial interest in the property to keep making payments, and — if the borrower can't make mortgage payments — that the lender has adequate equity available to cover lender foreclosure costs.

On the off chance that a borrower can't — or decides not to — concoct that amount, a lender might conclude that the loan is a risky investment, and, subsequently, require that the homebuyer take out PMI. If a borrower defaults on their mortgage — and their home goes into foreclosure — the purpose of PMI is to give extra protection to the lender.

An extra explanation that a homeowner might be required to purchase PMI coverage is assuming the mortgage the homeowner looks for has a high [loan-to-value (LTV) ratio](/loantovalue).

LTV is one of the measures of risk that lenders use in [underwriting](/underwriting) a mortgage. LTV separates the amount of the loan by the value of the home. Most mortgages with a LTV ratio greater than 80% expect that the borrower have PMI on the grounds that they are viewed as bound to [default](/default2) on the mortgage.

With PMI, homeowners are responsible for purchasing insurance coverage for their mortgage and for paying insurance premiums. These premiums may either be added to the borrower's month to month mortgage payments, or the extra cost might be absorbed by the borrower's interest rate (bringing about a higher interest rate).

PMI can be eliminated once a borrower pays down enough of the mortgage's principal (generally when their equity comes to 20%) or when their LTV ratio comes to 80%. Be that as it may, before the Homeowners Protection Act, numerous homeowners had issues canceling PMI. In certain examples, lenders might have agreed to end coverage when the borrower's equity came to 20%, however approaches for canceling PMI coverage varied widely among lenders, and homeowners had limited recourse assuming lenders wouldn't cancel PMI.

The Homeowners Protection Act safeguards homeowners by disallowing life-of-loan PMI coverage for borrower-paid PMI products and laying out uniform procedures for canceling PMI coverage. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) regulates and implements compliance with the Homeowners Protection Act.
