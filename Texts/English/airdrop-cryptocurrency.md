# Cryptocurrency Airdrop
In the cryptocurrency and blockchain ecosystem, the term "Airdrop" alludes to the distribution of digital assets to the public, either by ethicalness of holding a certain other token or just by uprightness of being an active wallet address on a specific blockchain.

During ICOs, the digital asset being offered is regularly purchased utilizing an alternate coin or token. On account of airdrops, there is no purchase required from the beneficiary, implying that the assets are distributed for free.
