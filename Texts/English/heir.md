# Heir
**What is a heir?**
"Heir" depicts a person who acquires property upon the death of another. It could be a spouse, child, relative or other close relative. A heir not entirely settled until a person kicks the bucket, in light of the fact that the heir apparent could bite the dust first.
**More profound definition**
Contingent on individuals included and the inheritance in question, who is and who isn't a heir can turn into a fragile subject. Convoluting the matter is the way that there are a number of various types of heirs:
**Presumptive heir** — One who might, under current conditions, be viewed as the heir. Notwithstanding, assuming one more child is brought into the world to the decedent prior to their death, that child might turn into the presumptive heir.
**Legally adopted heir** — A child who is legally adopted gains the right to be viewed as a heir upon adoption.
**Security heir** — A relative who is definitely not a direct relative, like a sibling, sister, auntie, uncle, cousin, nephew, niece or parent.
**Pretermitted heir** — A child who has been incidentally or inadvertently avoided with regards to a will can claim rights as a pretermitted heir.
In spite of the fact that the person might receive an inheritance through marital or community property laws, it is worth taking note of that a spouse isn't a heir except if the person is explicitly referenced in the will.
