The Financial Industrial Regulatory Authority (FINRA) permits no-load mutual funds to charge a 12b-1 fee (which pays for marketing and promotion expenses) of up to 0.25 percent of its average annual assets. This fee is remembered for the fund's expense ratio. No-load funds may likewise charge redemption fees, exchange fees, and account fees.

## No-load fund model
In the event that an investor puts $5,000 in a no-load fund, all $5,000 is invested in the fund. Not at all like no-load funds, loaded funds really do charge commissions or sales charges at the hour of the fund's sale.

In the event that the fund has deferred sales charges, the commission is removed from the proceeds at the hour of the sale.
