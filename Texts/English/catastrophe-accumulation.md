# Catastrophe Accumulation
## What Is Catastrophe Accumulation?

In the [insurance industry](/insurance), the term "catastrophe accumulation" alludes to the aggregate claims that would should be paid assuming at least one catastrophes were to happen across a whole region. In this sense, the catastrophe accumulation is a type of estimate of potential damages brought about by catastrophes like tremors or extreme climate events.

## How Catastrophe Accumulation Works

The fundamental business model for insurance companies is to collect [premiums](/premium) from a large number of policyholders, where the premiums charged are sufficiently high to support the claims that are probably going to be made against those policies. On the off chance that the claims rise over their expected level, notwithstanding, the insurance company might not be able to fund the claims through the beforehand collected insurance premiums, leading to a loss and potential [insolvency](/insolvency).

This fundamental test is especially intense while dealing with [catastrophic risks](/catastrophe-peril), like tremors or tropical storms. Dissimilar to most insurance contracts, in which the probability of a policyholder filing a claim isn't impacted by whether a second or third policyholder does as such, catastrophes can be considerably more dangerous to insurers. This is on the grounds that a single event might actually influence policyholders across a whole region, leading to a cascade of policy claims all simultaneously. From the insurance company's viewpoint, this is a sort of "assuming the worst" in light of the fact that the total value of these claims could immensely surpass the premiums collected on those policies.

To deal with this risk, insurance companies keep track of the potential losses associated with these types of catastrophes, gathering those estimates for every region or for the business as a whole. Insurance companies allude to this running total as their catastrophe accumulation, since it is basically the accumulation of the risk introduced by any expected catastrophe. For instance, a home insurance provider that safeguards against tremors could keep track of its catastrophe accumulation for a specific state or city that is particularly inclined to quakes. Contingent upon the level of catastrophe accumulation they record, the insurance company might have to raise their insurance premiums or purchase [reinsurance](/reinsurance) to deal with their risk.

## Genuine Example of Catastrophe Accumulation

Insurance companies assess the risk associated with [underwriting](/insurance-financier) another policy by analyzing the likely seriousness and frequency of losses. The seriousness and frequency will fluctuate as per the type of peril, the risk management, and reduction procedures being employed by the insured, and different factors like geology. For instance, the probability that a fire insurance policy will see a loss really relies on how close buildings are to one another, the distance away the nearest fire station, and fire prevention measures the building has in place.

Subsequent to considering these factors, the insurance company could try to estimate its most dire outcome imaginable by ascertaining its [probable maximum loss (PML)](/probable-maximum-loss-pml). For instance, an insurance company with exposure to fire-related risks could make a table that models annual aggregate PML for wildfires north of a 100-year period. Since catastrophic events are innately rare, long periods, for example, this might be expected to guarantee that a sufficiently large number of past events are remembered for the data set.

## Highlights
- Contingent upon their level of catastrophe accumulation, insurance companies might decide to raise premiums or purchase reinsurance.
- It is utilized by insurance companies to deal with their risks.
- A catastrophe accumulation is an estimate of the potential risk brought into the world by an insurance company in the event that at least one catastrophes were to happen inside a specific region.
