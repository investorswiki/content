## What Is a Venn Diagram?

A Venn diagram is an illustration that utilizations circles to show the relationships among things or finite gatherings of things. Circles that overlap have a commonality while circles that don't overlap don't share those traits.

Venn diagrams help to address the likenesses and differences between two concepts outwardly. They have long been recognized for their handiness as educational devices. Since the mid-twentieth century, Venn diagrams have been utilized as part of the starting logic educational program and in rudimentary level educational plans around the world.

## Understanding the Venn Diagram

The English logician John Venn advocated the diagram during the 1880s. He called them Eulerian circles after the Swiss mathematician Leonard Euler, who made comparative diagrams during the 1700s.

The term Venn diagram didn't show up until 1918 when Clarence Lewis, an American scholastic thinker and the possible organizer behind reasonable practicality, referred to the circular portrayal as the Venn diagram in his book "A Survey of Symbolic Logic."

> Venn diagrams have been utilized since the mid-twentieth century in study halls from the primary school level to early on logic.

Venn considered and showed logic and [probability](/probabilitydistribution) theory at Cambridge University, where he developed his method of utilizing diagrams to represent the branch of mathematics known as set theory.

Venn distributed a point of reference setting work, "The Logic of Chance," which made sense of the frequency theory of likelihood. In it, he contended that likelihood, in opposition to famous assumption, ought to be laid out in view of the routineness with which something is predicted to happen.

In another book, **Symbolic Logic,** Venn based on and developed mathematician George Boole's hypotheses on [algebra](/algebraic-method). This work assisted him with fostering the Venn diagram.

### Applications for Venn Diagrams

Venn diagrams are utilized to portray how things connect with one another against an overall scenery, universe, data set, or environment. A Venn diagram could be utilized, for instance, to compare two companies inside a similar industry by delineating the products the two companies offer (where circles overlap) and the products that are exclusive to each company (external circles).

Venn diagrams are, at a fundamental level, simple pictorial portrayals of the relationship that exists between two sets of things. Notwithstanding, they can be considerably more complex. In any case, the streamlined purpose of the Venn diagram to delineate concepts and gatherings has prompted their promoted use in many fields, including [statistics](/statistics), phonetics, logic, education, computer science, and business.

## Instances of Venn Diagrams

A Venn diagram could be drawn to outline fruits that come in red or orange tones. Below, we can see that there are orange fruits (circle B) like persimmons and tangerines while apples and cherries (circle A) come in red tones. Peppers and tomatoes come in both red and orange tones, as addressed by the overlapping area of the two circles.

You could likewise draw a Venn diagram to assist with choosing which of two cars to purchase. The Venn diagram shows the elements that are exclusive to every vehicle and the highlights that the two cars have.

Below, we see that Car A will be a sedan that is powered by fuel and gets 20 miles for each gallon, while Car B is a hybrid, gets 40 miles-per-gallon for mileage, and is a hatchback.

The concealed region where the two circles overlap shows the highlights that the two cars share practically speaking, which incorporate a radio, four entryways, Bluetooth capacity, and airbags.

The Venn diagram graphically conveys the similitudes and differences between the two cars to assist with choosing which to purchase.

## Features
- Things that have commonalities are displayed as overlapping circles while things that are distinct independent.
- Venn diagrams are presently utilized as illustrations in business and in numerous scholastic fields.
- A Venn diagram utilizes circles that overlap or don't overlap to show the commonalities and differences among things or gatherings of things.
## FAQ
### How Do You Read a Venn Diagram?
A Venn diagram is perused by seeing each of the circles that make up the whole diagram. Each circle is its own thing or data set. The segments of the circles that overlap demonstrate the areas that are in common among the various things though the parts that don't overlap show unique traits among the thing or data set addressed by the circle.
### What Is the Middle of a Venn Diagram Called?
The middle of a Venn diagram where at least two sets overlap is known as the convergence.
### Why Are They Called Venn Diagrams?
They are called Venn diagrams on the grounds that the diagram was developed by John Venn, an English logician.
### What Is a Venn Diagram in Math?
A Venn diagram in math is utilized in logic theory and set theory to show different sets or data and their relationship with one another.
