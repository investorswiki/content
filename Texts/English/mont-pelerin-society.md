## What Is the Mont Pelerin Society?

The Mont Pelerin Society (MPS) is a group of classical liberal economists, thinkers, and history specialists. Despite the fact that individuals can be heterogeneous in their analysis of causes and results, the Society notes that its individuals "see risk in the expansion of government, not least in that frame of mind, in the power of trade unions and business monopoly, and in the continuing threat and reality of inflation."

## Grasping the Mont Pelerin Society

The Mont Pelerin Society was established in 1947, when [Friedrich Hayek](/friedrich-hayek) welcomed a group of 36 researchers — generally economists, however a few history specialists and savants were incorporated too — to examine the destiny of modern radicalism. The group underscored that it didn't expect to make a universality or line up with any political factions. Rather, it was planned to act as a forum for similar researchers to discuss the destiny of classical progressivism and to examine and break down the functions, ethics, and deformities of the market-situated system in which its defenders accepted. It currently meets once like clockwork.

Its individuals have incorporated a few unmistakable endorsers of the more liberal, freedom advocate, and Austrian schools of economic idea; aside from Hayek himself, [Milton Friedman](/milton-friedman), [Ludwig von Mises](/ludwig-von-mises), and William F. Buckley Jr. have additionally been individuals. The group has counted nine Nobel prizewinners (eight in economics, including Hayek and Friedman, and one in writing) among its individuals.

## History of the Mont Pelerin Society

The original statement of the Society's founders noted concern about the developing "threats to civilization" that they saw from the rising power of governments across many parts of the globe. This statement (at the principal meeting of the group in 1947) came during the post-World War II economic and political scene. The Mont Pelerin Society was brought into the world in response to the formation of the Eastern Bloc, the control of Western economies by Depression-period and wartime socialism, and the rise of interventionist economic speculations to sheer dominance in scholarly community and public policy circles.

Consequently the primary battle in the principal long periods of the Society was characterized as that among progressivism and tyranny, where the former was being shunted aside or actively curbed worldwide as the last option killed the rule of law, the rights of the individual, and the right to a free society.

All the more as of late, the rise of "large government" in the West as well as reappearing dictatorship in parts of the world that had recently moved towards popularity based, liberal thoughts have been of concern. The Society advances [free-market](/freemarket) economics and ways of supplanting many capabilities currently gave by the government free enterprise. The Society likewise advocates in support of freedom of articulation and the political values of an open society.

> Hayek filled in as the Society's leader from 1947 to 1961. Other remarkable presidents included Milton Friedman (1970-72) and George Stigler (1976-78). The current president is Linda Whetstone.

## The Bottom Line

Albeit the lack of a formal, homogenous grouping (and hence policy statements) make it hard to judge what impact the group might have had on policy, the fact that there is impressive overlap between individuals from the group and the scholarly community, think tanks, and different organizations infer its thoughts are to be sure being dispersed into the policy banter.
