# Stock Market Crash of 1987
## What Was the Stock Market Crash of 1987?

The stock market crash of 1987 was a quick and serious downturn in U.S. stock prices that happened north of several days in late October 1987. While the crash originated in the U.S., the event impacted each and every major stock market in the world.

In the five years leading up to the 1987 crash, the Dow Jones Industrial Average ([DJIA](/djia)) had dramatically multiplied. On October 19, 1987 — known as [Black Monday](/blackmonday) — the DJIA fell by 508, or by 22.6%. So far ever, this was the largest percentage drop in one day. The crash started fears of extended economic shakiness around the world.

After this crash, the Federal Reserve and stock exchanges mediated by installing components called "[circuit breakers](/circuitbreaker)," designed to dial back future plunges and stop trading when stocks fall too far or too fast.

## Understanding the Stock Market Crash of 1987

Following five days of intensifying declines in the stock market, selling pressure hit a top on October 19, 1987, otherwise called Black Monday. Steep price declines were made because of significant selling; total trading volume was huge to the point that the computerized trading systems couldn't handle them. A few orders were left unfilled for north of 60 minutes, and these order imbalances prevented investors from discovering the true price of stocks.

Heightened threats in the Persian Gulf, a fear of higher interest rates, a five-year bull market without a significant correction, and the presentation of computerized trading have all been named as expected reasons for the crash. There were additionally more profound economic factors that might have been at fault.

Under the [Plaza Accord](/plaza-accord) of 1985, the Federal Reserve settled on an agreement with the central banks of the G-5 nations — France, Germany, the United Kingdom, and Japan — to devalue the U.S. dollar in international currency markets to control mounting U.S. trade deficits. By mid 1987, that goal had been accomplished; the gap between U.S. exports and imports had smoothed out, which helped U.S. exporters and contributed to the U.S. stock market boom of the mid-1980s.

In the five years preceding October 1987, the DJIA dramatically multiplied in value, creating unreasonable valuation levels and an overvalued stock market. The Plaza Accord was supplanted by the Louver Accord in February 1987. Under the Louver Accord, the G-5 nations agreed to settle exchange rates around this new balance of trade.

In the U.S., the Federal Reserve tightened monetary policy under the new Louver Accord to halt the downward pressure on the dollar in the time span leading up to the crash. Because of this contractionary monetary policy, growth in the U.S. money supply plunged from January to September, interest rates increased, and stock prices began to fall toward the finish of the second from last quarter of 1987.

## The Role of Program Trading and Automation

The stock market crash of 1987 revealed the job of financial and technological innovation in increased market volatility. In automatic trading, additionally called [program trading](/programtrading), human direction is removed from the equation, and buy or sell orders are generated automatically founded on the price levels of benchmark indexes or specific stocks. Leading up to the crash, the models being used would in general deliver strong positive feedback, generating more buy orders when prices were rising and more sell orders when prices began to fall.

After the crash, exchanges carried out circuit breaker rules and different insurances that lull the impact of trading irregularities. This permits markets additional opportunity to address comparable issues from now on. For instance, on the off chance that stocks dove by even 7% today, trading would be suspended for 15 minutes.

While program trading makes sense of a portion of the characteristic steepness of the crash (and the unnecessary rise in prices during the preceding boom), by far most of trades at the hour of the crash were as yet executed through a sluggish cycle, frequently requiring numerous telephone calls and cooperations between humans.

With the increased computerization of the markets today, including the approach of [high-frequency trading (HFT)](/high-frequency-trading), trades are much of the time handled in milliseconds. Because of unimaginably quick feedback circles among the algorithms, selling pressure can mount inside minutes, and huge losses can be knowledgeable about the cycle.
