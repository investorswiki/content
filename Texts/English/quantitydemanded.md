## What Is Quantity Demanded?

Quantity demanded is a term utilized in economics to portray the total amount of a decent or service that consumers demand over a given interval of time. It relies upon the price of a decent or service in a marketplace, whether or not that market is in [equilibrium](/equilibrium).

The relationship between the quantity demanded and the price is known as the demand curve, or just the demand. The degree to which the quantity demanded changes with respect to price is called the [elasticity](/elasticity) of demand.

## Understanding Quantity Demanded
### Inverse Relationship of Price and Demand

The price of a decent or service in a marketplace determines the quantity that consumers demand. Expecting that non-price factors are taken out from the equation, a higher price brings about a lower quantity demanded and a lower price brings about higher quantity demanded. Consequently, the price of a product and the quantity demanded for that product have an inverse relationship, as stated in the [law of demand](/lawofdemand).

> An inverse relationship means that higher prices bring about lower quantity demand and lower prices bring about higher quantity demand.

### Change in Quantity Demanded

A change in quantity demanded alludes to a change in the specific quantity of a product that buyers are willing and able to buy. This change in quantity demanded is brought about by a change in the price.

### Increase in Quantity Demanded

An increase in quantity demanded is brought about by a diminishing in the price of the product (and vice versa). A demand curve delineates the quantity demanded and any price offered on the market. A change in quantity demanded is addressed as a movement along a demand curve. The extent that quantity demanded changes relative to a change in price is known as the elasticity of demand and is connected with the slant of the demand curve.

## An Example of Quantity Demanded

Say, for instance, at the price of $5 per hot canine, consumers buy two hot dogs each day; the quantity demanded is two. In the event that sellers choose to increase the price of a hot canine to $6, then consumers just purchase one hot canine each day. On a graph, the quantity demanded moves leftward from two to one when the price ascends from $5 to $6. On the off chance that, notwithstanding, the price of a hot canine declines to $4, customers need to consume three hot dogs: the quantity demanded moves rightward from a few when the price tumbles from $5 to $4.

By graphing these combinations of price and quantity demanded, we can develop a demand curve interfacing the three points.

Utilizing a standard demand curve, every combination of price and quantity demanded is portrayed as a point on the descending slanting line, with the price of hot dogs on the y-hub and the quantity of hot dogs on the x-pivot. This means that as price diminishes, the quantity demanded increases. Any change or movement to quantity demanded is involved as a movement of the point along the demand curve and not a shift in the demand curve itself. However long consumers' inclinations and different factors don't change, the demand curve actually stays static.

Price changes change the quantity demanded; changes in consumer inclinations change the demand curve. In the event that, for instance, earth conscious consumers switch from gas cars to electric cars, the demand curve for traditional cars would innately shift.

## Price Elasticity of Demand

The extent to which the quantity demanded changes with respect to price is called elasticity of demand. A decent or service that is profoundly flexible means the quantity demanded shifts widely at various price points.

On the other hand, a decent or service that is inelastic is unified with a quantity demanded that remains relatively static at different price points. An illustration of an inelastic decent is insulin. Despite price point, the individuals who need insulin demand it at a similar amount.

## Features
