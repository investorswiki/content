# Combined Loan-To-Value Ratio - CLTV Ratio
## What Is the Combined Loan-To-Value Ratio - CLTV Ratio?

The combined loan-to-value (CLTV) ratio is the ratio of all secured loans on a property to the value of a property. [Lenders](/lender) utilize the CLTV ratio to decide a prospective home buyer's risk of default when more than one loan is utilized.

As a general rule, lenders will lend at CLTV ratios of 80% or more to borrowers with high credit ratings. The CLTV contrasts from the simple loan to value (LTV) ratio in that the LTV just remembers the first or primary mortgage for its calculation.

To calculate the combined loan-to-value ratio, partition the aggregate principal balances of all loans by the property's purchase price or fair market value. The CLTV ratio not entirely set in stone by isolating the sum of the things listed below by the lesser of the property's sales price or the [appraised value](/appraised_value) of the property.

- the original loan amount of the primary mortgage
- the drawn portion (outstanding principal balance) of a home equity credit extension (HELOC)
- the unpaid principal balance of all closed-end [subordinate financing](/subordinate-financing), like a second or third mortgage (With a closed-end loan, a borrower draws down all funds on the very beginning and may not make any payment arrangement changes or access any paid-down principal once the loan is closed.)

## What CLTV Ratio Shows

The combined loan to value (CLTV) ratio is a calculation utilized by mortgage and lending experts to decide the total percentage of a homeowner's property that is encumbered by liens (debt obligations). Lenders utilize the CLTV ratio along with a small bunch of different calculations, for example, the [debt-to-income ratio](/dti) and the standard loan to value (LTV) ratio, to survey the risk of extending a loan to a borrower.

Numerous financial analysts attribute loosened up CLTV standards to the [foreclosure crisis](/foreclosure-crisis) that tormented the United States during the late 2000s, among different factors. Beginning during the 1990s and particularly during the early and mid-2000s, home buyers habitually took out second mortgages at the hour of purchase in lieu of making down payments. Lenders excited not to lose these customers' business to competitors agreed to such terms regardless of the increased risk.

Prior to the real estate bubble that expanded from the late 1990s to the mid-2000s, the standard practice was for home buyers to make down payments totaling somewhere around 20% of the purchase price. Most lenders kept customers inside these boundaries by capping LTV at 80%.

At the point when the bubble started to warm up, a large number of these equivalent companies took moves toward permit customers to get around putting 20% down. A few lenders raised LTV covers or got rid of them totally, offering mortgages with 5% down payments or less, while others kept LTV requirements in place however raised CLTV covers, frequently to 100%. This maneuver empowered customers to require out second mortgages to finance their 20% down payments.

The foreclosure spike beginning in 2008 highlighted why CLTV is important. Having skin in the game, for example, a $100,000 initial cash outlay for a $500,000 house, gives a homeowner a strong incentive to keep up his mortgage payments. On the off chance that the bank forecloses, he loses his home as well as the heap of cash he paid to close.

Requiring equity in the property likewise insulates lenders from a dip in real estate prices. In the event that a property is valued at $500,000 and the total liens amount to $400,000, the property can lose up to 20% of its value with practically no lien holders getting a short payment at a foreclosure auction.

## Why CLTV Matters

A few home buyers decide to bring down their down payment by getting numerous mortgages on a property, which brings about a lower loan-to-value ratio for the primary mortgage. Likewise due to the lower LTV ratio, many home buyers successfully stay away from private mortgage insurance (PMI). Whether it is better to get a subsequent mortgage or cause the cost of PMI shifts per individual.

Subsequently, in light of the fact that the subsequent mortgagor assumes more risk, the interest rate on a subsequent mortgage is normally higher than the interest rate on a first mortgage. It is fitting that consumers think about the benefits and weaknesses of accepting different loans on one property. Practicing due diligence will assist with guaranteeing that what is picked is the best option for the given conditions.

## Loan-to-Value versus CLTV

[Loan-to-value (LTV)](/loantovalue) and CLTV are two of the most common ratios utilized during the mortgage underwriting process. Most lenders impose maximums on the two values, above which the prospective borrower isn't eligible for a loan. The LTV ratio considers just the primary mortgage balance. Thusly, in the above model, the LTV ratio is half, the consequence of partitioning the primary mortgage balance of $100,000 by the home value of $200,000.

Most lenders impose LTV maximums of 80% on the grounds that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac don't purchase mortgages with higher LTV ratios. Borrowers with great credit profiles can evade this requirement however must pay [private mortgage insurance ](/insurance)(PMI) as long as their primary loan balance is greater than 80% of the home's value. PMI shields the lender from losses when a home's value falls below the loan balance.

Primary lenders tend to be more liberal with CLTV requirements. Taking into account the model above, in the event of a foreclosure, the primary mortgage holder accepts its money in full before the second mortgage holder gets anything. Assuming that the property value diminishes to $125,000 before the borrower defaults, the primary lien-holder gets the whole amount owed ($100,000), while the second lien-holder just gets the excess $25,000 in spite of being owed $50,000. The primary lien-holder shoulders less risk on account of declining property values and in this manner can stand to lend at a higher CLTV.

## Model the CLTV Ratio

For instance, assume an individual is purchasing a permanent place to stay for $200,000. To secure the property, she gave a down payment of $50,000 and received two mortgages: one for $100,000 (primary) and one for $50,000 (secondary). Her combined loan-to-value ratio (CLTV) is in this way 75%: (($100,000 + $50,000)/$200,000).

## Highlights
- Lenders consider the CLTV ratio in deciding if a home buyer can stand to purchase a home.
- CLTV is like LTV yet incorporates all mortgages or liens and in addition to the principal mortgage.
- The real estate bubble of 2008-2009 highlighted the pertinence of keeping an eye on the CLTV ratio.
