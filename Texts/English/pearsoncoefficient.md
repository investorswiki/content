# Pearson Coefficient
## What Is the Pearson Coefficient?

The Pearson coefficient is a type of [correlation coefficient](/correlationcoefficient) that represents the relationship between two variables that are measured on a similar interval or ratio scale. The Pearson coefficient is a measure of the strength of the association between two continuous variables.

## Grasping the Pearson Coefficient

To track down the Pearson coefficient, likewise alluded to as the Pearson correlation coefficient or the Pearson product-second correlation coefficient, the two variables are placed on a dissipate plot. The variables are denoted as X and Y. There must be a linearity for the coefficient to be determined; a disperse plot not depicting any similarity to a linear relationship will be futile. The nearer the likeness to a straight line of the disperse plot, the higher the strength of association. Mathematically, the Pearson coefficient is represented the same way as a correlation coefficient that is utilized in linear regression, going from - 1 to +1. A value of +1 is the consequence of a perfect positive relationship between at least two variables. Positive correlations demonstrate that the two variables move in a similar course. On the other hand, a value of - 1 represents a perfect negative relationship. Negative correlations demonstrate that as one variable expands, different declines; they are conversely related. A zero demonstrates no correlation.

## Benefits of the Pearson Coefficient

For an investor who wishes to differentiate a portfolio, the Pearson coefficient can be valuable. Estimations from disperse plots of historical returns between pairs of assets, for example, equities-securities, equities-products, securities land, and so on, or more specific assets —, for example, [large-cap](/huge cap) equities, [small-cap](/small-cap) equities, and obligation developing market equities — will produce Pearson coefficients to help the investor in gathering a portfolio in light of risk and return parameters. Note, nonetheless, that a Pearson coefficient measures correlation, not causation, and that means that one variable produced an outcome in the other variable. In the event that enormous cap and small-cap equities have a coefficient of 0.8, it won't be understood what caused the somewhat high strength of association.

## Who Was Karl Pearson?

Karl Pearson (1857-1936) was an English intellectual and prolific supporter of the fields of math and statistics. He is credited as the principal pioneer behind modern statistics and an advocate of selective breeding. Beside the eponymous coefficient, Pearson is known for the concepts of chi-squared test and p-value, among others, and development of linear regression and classification of distributions. In 1911, Pearson established the world's most memorable university statistics department, the Department of Applied Statistics at University College London.

> In 1901, Pearson established the primary journal of modern statistics named Biometrika.

## Highlights
- The Pearson coefficient shows correlation, not causation.
- English mathematician and analyst Karl Pearson is credited for developing numerous statistical methods, including the Pearson coefficient, the chi-squared test, p-value, and linear regression.
- The Pearson coefficient is a mathematical correlation coefficient representing the relationship between two variables, denoted as X and Y.
- Pearson coefficients range from +1 to - 1, with +1 representing a positive correlation, - 1 representing a negative correlation, and 0 representing no relationship.
