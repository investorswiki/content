## What Is a State Bank?

A state bank is a financial institution that a state has chartered essentially to give commercial banking services. A state bank isn't equivalent to a [central](/centralbank) or reserve bank; these institutions are principally worried about impacting a government's [monetary policy](/monetarypolicy).

## Understanding State Banks

State banks were advocated by business analysts, for example, Arthur Lewis and Gunnar Myrdal, who were defenders of greater participation by the public sector in financial markets. Their contention was that government job streamlined the flaws and emergencies that the financial markets were inclined to. Thus, state banks ruled Western economies up until the 1970s.

The development of neoliberal financial experts and policy producers prompted a reevaluating of the state's job in an economy during the 1980s. Several state banks were privatized, leading to a reduction in their market share. In certain locales of the world, for example, Eastern Europe and South Asia, state banks are still among the greatest government institutions. For instance, the State Bank of India is the greatest bank in India and is positioned 236th in the world's 500 greatest organizations.

In the United States, the [Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC)](/office-comptroller-currency-occ) doesn't manage state banks. The OCC is a federal agency that manages banks operating nationally. The Federal Reserve (the Fed) controls some state banks, alongside those that are not under the jurisdiction of the [Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC).](/fdic)

State banks can in any case be large financial institutions; be that as it may, they are not permitted to extend cross country since they don't have a federal charter. State banks might have the option to offer all the more cross country types of assistance, for example, automated teller machines (ATMs), by cooperating with banks that have a more extensive presence around the country. In certain states, state banks have more authority than national banks in giving insurance arrangements and [private banking](/privatebanking) services.

## State Bank Services: Commercial, Insurance, and Private Banking Offerings

Most state banks center around personal banking services. These generally incorporate accepting deposits, offering checking accounts, as well as business, personal, and mortgage loans. Also, many state banks will give essential financial products (for example [certificates of deposit](/certificateofdeposit) (CDs)) and savings accounts to people and small businesses.

The Jonesburg State Bank in Jonesburg, MO, for instance, highlights these services above, alongside [mobile banking options](/mobile-banking) for its retail and business customers.

Some state banks will likewise give some [insurance](/insurance) arrangements. Common personal insurance policies incorporate auto, wellbeing, homeowners, and life insurance contracts. Special business insurance policies might safeguard against specific damages or wounds to employees, medical malpractice, and professional liability insurance, among others.

State banks likewise venture into private banking and wealth management services. The Iowa State Bank, for instance, offers people tailored financial plans, alongside expense based management services, business retirement plans, and IRAs and retirement planning, notwithstanding several insurance options. The team is going by two [financial advisors](/financial-counsel).

For wealthier people, private banking options can be broad. Notwithstanding more exclusive counsel, services can cover protecting and developing assets, more specialized [financing](/financing) arrangements, and giving wealth to people in the future. High levels of assets permit a few people to partake in alternative investments, for example, [hedge funds](/hedgefund) and real estate. UBS, Merrill Lynch, Morgan Stanley, and Credit Suisse are instances of private banks.
