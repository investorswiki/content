## What is net worth?
Net worth is a measure of wealth. Net worth is the amount of all [assets](/assets) owned by a person or a company, minus any obligations or [liabilities](/risk).
## More profound definition
There are marginally varying methods for computing the net worth of an individual and the net worth of a company. The two figures are the total of all assets minus all liabilities.

Different concepts utilized conversely with carrying value are mark to market, fair value, and fair market value, in spite of the fact that they can have various implications relying upon the unique situation.
Negative net worth happens when the liabilities of a company or an individual surpass the assets held. This occurs in one of two ways: either the liabilities increase over the long haul as more debt is taken on, or assets owned decline in value.
