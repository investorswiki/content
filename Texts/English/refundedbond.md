The sinking fund gives bond investors an additional element of security.

A refunded bond ought not be mistaken for a [pre-refunding bond](/prerefunding_bond), which is a debt security that is issued to fund a callable bond. With a pre-refunding bond, the issuer chooses to exercise its right to buy its bonds back before the scheduled maturity date.

The funds required to pay off refunded bonds are held in [escrow](/escrow) until the [maturity date](/maturitydate), for the most part by purchasing Treasury or agency paper. Refunded bonds can likewise be alluded to as pre-refunded bonds or prior issues.

By definition, the term "refunding" means refinancing another debt obligation. It isn't unfathomable for municipalities to issue new bonds to raise funds to retire existing bonds.

The interest generated from the treasuries assists in paying the interest on the refunded bonds up to the call with dating, at which point the proceeds held in escrow will be utilized to pay off existing holders of the refunded bond. The date of refunding will typically be the principal callable date of the bonds.
