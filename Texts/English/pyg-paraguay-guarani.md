The pegged exchange rate was one dollar to each 126 guaranies. Be that as it may, the value of the currency kept on dissolving on the black market and afterward more quickly once the peg was abandoned. Because of its fast devaluation, the Republic of Paraguay presented bigger denominations of bills and coins. The initial 50,000 guarani notes were issued in 1990, trailed by 100,000 guaranies in 1998.

Beginning around 1985, the value of the guarani has kept on declining strongly. For instance, the USD/PYG exchanged at 4,500 of every 2010, and by 2018 that rate was 5,700. By 2020 it tumbled to 7,000:1.
