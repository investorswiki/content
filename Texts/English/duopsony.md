# Duopsony
## What Is Duopsony?

A duopsony is a [economic condition](/economic-conditions) in which there are just two large buyers for a specific product or service. Combined, these two buyers determine market [demand](/demand), giving them considerably persuasive bargaining power**,** expecting that they are outnumbered by firms competing to sell to them. It very well may be compared with a [monopsony](/monopsony), or a market where there exists just a single large buyer.

Duopsony is otherwise called a "buyer's duopoly" and is connected with [oligopsony](/oligopsony), a term portraying a market where there are a limited number of buyers. This economic theory can be followed back to crafted by French mathematician [Augustin Cournot](/cournot-competition).

## Grasping Duopsony

Duopsony status gives a company sufficient leverage to be particular and drive down prices. At the point when there are a bigger number of sellers than buyers, the purchaser uses market power. A comparative theory applies to a [oligopoly](/oligopoly) — when there are just a small number of sellers or, more comparable still, a [duopoly](/duopoly) — where they are just two large sellers in a market.

A simple illustration of a duopsony would be a town having just two operating eateries that are hiring workers. In the event that there are numerous servers and culinary specialists in the town, the two eateries will wind up in a position of high bargaining power, possibly empowering them to pull off offering lower wages than they would assuming more firms were competing to hire.

The cooks and servers must choose the option to acknowledge the low pay except if they decide not to work. This shows that organizations that are part of a duopsony have the power not exclusively to lower the cost of supplies yet additionally to lower the price of labor.

On the other hand, a fishing fleet of small boats could have two [wholesale buyers](/wholesaling) in the small port town from which they sail. Those two buyers would hold a duopsony and have the option to apply leverage over the wholesale price of the fishing fleet's catch.

> The theory of oligopoly and oligopsony, known as [Cournot competition](/cournot-competition), was developed by French mathematician Augustin Cournot in his 1838 book **Researches on the Mathematical Principles of the Theory of Wealth.**

## Special Considerations

Duopsony bargaining power doesn't necessarily fundamentally lead to lower prices and a competitive advantage for buyers. Like any oligopsony or oligopsony, individuals from duopsony face a sort of [Prisoner's Dilemma](/detainees dilemma), where the buyers can both benefit collectively by colluding to keep prices low, however each exclusively has an incentive to destroy the other buyer by offering a higher price to sellers.

Contingent upon which strategy the buyers pick, this can lead to a low market price or a higher market price that all the more closely approaches a [competitive market](/perfectcompetition) price.

## Genuine Examples of Duopsony

Prior to the age of Amazon.com Inc's. (AMZN) dominance in the retail space, Walmart Inc (WMT) and ostensibly Costco Wholesale Corp. (COST) held duopsony power over their merchandise providers. Any provider of retail goods expected to disseminate through these chains or die. This gave these two companies strong bargaining positions and the ability to separate concessions from these different companies.

In the stock market, financial engineers recognized this, basically for Walmart. They made an index of companies that were dependent on selling to Walmart, called the Walmart providers' index.

Another genuine model is Apple's iOS and Google's Android. Combined, they command almost 100% of the mobile operating system [market share](/marketshare) worldwide. Accordingly, they hold huge influence over the market for mobile app distribution and the labor force of mobile app designers.

## Duopsony and Barriers to Entry

Being unique and in the minority companies endeavor to accomplish. Less competition generally yields stronger [pricing power](/pricingpower) and higher [profitability](/benefit). Regularly, different firms will try to cash in, dispensing with the duopsony, albeit this isn't so natural when the final result or service has high [barriers to entry](/barrierstoentry).

Profitability and long-term achievement relies on a company holding a sustainable competitive edge. In 1980, Harvard teacher Michael Porter based on this theory, introducing a model called "[Five Forces](/porter)" to assist managers and investors with looking at how much power companies use in their industries.

One of Porter's forces happens to be the power of customers. Customers have the power to drive prices lower and set the terms of a deal when there are less customers and more merchants. Thusly, sellers should become more competitive in their exchanges and offerings to win customer business.

> Different forces in Porter's model are the threat of new contestants, existing competition, the threat of [substitute products](/substitute), and the power of providers.

## Duopoly and Duopsony

There are a few rare situations where a company can be both a duopoly and duopsony. At the point when you fly you probably notice that the plane you are on probably is either made by Boeing Co. (BA) or Airbus. They are the fundamental sellers of planes to carriers, and, thus, likewise happen to be the primary buyers of the equipment used to build them.

There are many aviation component manufacturers competing to win contracts to assist with building the most recent Boeing and Airbus planes. Boeing and Airbus frequently hold the cards in talks, particularly among those organizations that supply [commoditized](/commoditize) products or components that planes can manage without.

## Highlights
- This pair of buyers hence alone determine market demand.
- Duopsony status is associated with high barriers to entry, forestalling new participants (buyers) from the market.
- Their combined bargaining power can lead to less competition and higher profitability, to the detriment of sellers.
- In a duopsony, there exists a market with just two large buyers for some product or service.
