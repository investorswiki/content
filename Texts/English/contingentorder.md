# Contingent Order
## What Is a Contingent Order?

A contingent order is an order that is linked to, and requires, the execution of another event. The contingent order turns out to be live, or is executed, when the event happens. A model is a [stop loss order](/stop-lossorder). The stop loss to sell is contingent upon a security initially being bought.

A contingent order is a type of [conditional order](/conditionalorder).

## Grasping the Contingent Order

Mainland orders are contingent on something different occurring before the contingent order is handled.

A contingent order can be:

1. An order including the simultaneous execution of at least two transactions.
1. An order where the execution relies on the execution of another order.
1. An order where the execution relies upon specific criteria, like price, volume, time, or different factors being met.

In a simultaneous transaction, the orders are contingent on one another, as need might arise to be handled simultaneously. On the off chance that they can't be handled simultaneously, the orders stay pending until they can be executed simultaneously.

A contingent order could likewise be founded on another order or event. For instance, a trader might make a [options](/option) buy order contingent on being filled on a stock buy order. Just once they own the stock should the options order be executed. The trader could likewise request the orders are executed simultaneously.

Criteria an order is contingent upon could likewise incorporate [volume](/volume), price, time, or a large group of other fundamental or [technical](/technicalindicator) instruments. For instance, an order might be contingent upon a security arriving at a certain price, having a certain amount of volume, and achieving both of these inside certain hours of the day.

## Contingent Order Uses

Contingent orders are valuable since they permit a trader to execute a strategy, or numerous positions, when the initial event happens. In the event that a trader needed to post every transaction in sequential order, it might leave them powerless against losses or changes in price. For instance, expect a trader needs to buy a stock at $50, yet they likewise need to place a stop loss at $49.85, and a sell order ([target](/pricetarget)) at $50.30 as soon they own the stock. This is called a [bracketed order](/bracketedbuyorder).

They could do this physically, however in the event that the stock price moves rapidly they may not get their orders out in time. Assuming the stop loss and target are conveyed contingent on the buy order being filled, the trader realizes that whether the stock goes up or down they have orders out to capture profit and control risk.

Likewise, there is one more problem with doing it physically. On the off chance that you buy a stock and try to place a sell order over the price and below the price (target and stop loss), the software presumably won't let you make it happen. This is on the grounds that the trading platform thinks you are trying to sell two times. Yet, assuming the stop loss and target are contingent upon the initial position, that's what it knows whether the stop loss or target is reached, that order [closes](/closeposition) the position and the other order can be canceled in light of the fact that the initial position no longer exists. The software realizes you are not trying to sell two times, thus it will let you put out the two orders simultaneously. One of the contingent orders will be canceled in the event that the other contingent order is filled, in this case.

Most brokers offer contingent order usefulness. This might come through different order types, for example, [basket orders](/baskettrade), multi-[leg](/leg) option orders, or bracket orders. The trader inputs what they need to happen first, and afterward sets the boundaries for the contingent order(s). On a bracket order (which makes contingent orders) that would mean putting in the initial request. Then, at that point, the stop loss and target are set. The stop loss and target orders are possibly conveyed assuming the initial order is executed.

## Contingent Order Example in the Options Market

Contingent orders are generally utilized in the options market, since certain options trades have numerous legs.

For instance, a [buy-write](/buy-write) strategy includes the simultaneous purchase of a long stock position and the composition of a [call option](/calloption) against that position. A trader might place a buy order for the long stock position that is contingent on the call option being [written](/composing an-option) at a certain price, or vice versa.

Without a contingent order, traders would need to execute two separate [transactions](/transaction). In the event that the price changed between the two orders, the trader could experience a moment of raised risk or possibly a more terrible (or better) price than expected on one of the transactions. The contingent order ensures that the position is opened precisely as the trader anticipates.

- A contingent order is one that depends on a specific event to happen before it very well may be made active.
- Orders can be contingent on one another, for example, when at least two orders should be executed simultaneously.
