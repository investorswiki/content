# Registered Education Savings Plan (RESP)
## What Is a Registered Education Savings Plan?

A Registered Education Savings Plan (RESP), sponsored by the Canadian government, encourages [investing](/investing) in a child's future post-optional education. Supporters of a RESP make contributions that build up tax-free earnings. The government contributes a certain amount to these plans for children under age 18.

Benefactors don't receive a [tax deduction](/tax-deduction) for investments in a RESP. There are no taxes due until funds are taken on a mission to pay for a child's education. Around then, contributions made into the RESP are returned tax-free, despite the fact that patrons' earnings from the plan are taxed. The money the government pays out is taxed to the understudies. In any case, since a large number of understudies have next to zero income, many can pull out the money tax-free.

## Understanding Registered Education Savings Plans (RESP)

A Registered Education Savings Plan (RESP) gives parents access Canada start saving for their children's education upon entering the world, with the government contributing part of the tab. Parents or watchmen essentially walk into a bank, [credit union](/creditunion) or other financial institution to open up an account. Anybody can contribute, whether it's mom, father, neighbor, or a most loved auntie or uncle.

The government then, at that point, matches the money up to a certain percentage and deposits it into the child's RESP. The extra funds the government deposits are called the Canadian Education and Savings Grant. The amount gave is graduated, in view of family income. Matching benefits apply just on the first $2,500 in contribution each year. The amount of the grant is capped at a maximum of $7,200.

Once in college, the child receives educational assistance payments (EAPs). These EAPs count as income for the child ([beneficiary](/beneficiary)). In the event that the beneficiary doesn't receive payments — either by the decision of the supporter or on the grounds that the beneficiary doesn't go to a post-optional institution — the giver will receive the amount in the RESP back tax-free.

The number of permitted plans per child is unlimited. In any case, there is a lifetime contribution limit of $50,000 per beneficiary from all RESPs combined.

## Advantages and disadvantages of Registered Education Savings Plans

By and large, the plans are not difficult to access and give strong investment incentives. Since parents will not initially pay taxes on the money, they have a dual incentive to put something aside for their child's education; they try not to pay taxes and get bonus money from the government for the child's education simultaneously.

There are a couple of gets. In the event that a child doesn't seek after an approved post-optional education training program, for example, college or trade school, in something like 36 years of opening the account, the government can request the grant money back. Likewise, any investment earnings that are removed from the RESP that are not utilized for education-related expenses cause income tax plus an extra 20% penalty.
