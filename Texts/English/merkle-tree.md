# Merkle Tree
A Merkle tree is an approach to sorting out and organizing large measures of data to make it more direct to process. On account of cryptocurrency and [blockchain](/blockchain), the Merkle tree is utilized to structure transaction data in a manner that is less demanding on resources.
At the point when a cryptocurrency transaction is made in a Merkle tree structure, it is hashed and afterward given an equivalent hash value. After every transaction is hashed in the Merkle tree, the hash values that are delivered are paired with another hash value and afterward hashed once more. For instance, the hash values 'Stomach muscle' and 'AC' are combined to make 'ABC'.
This course of matching hash values is rehashed until a last hash value is delivered. The last hash value, the Merkle root, gives a summary of the relative multitude of transactions it contains. The Merkle root summary is then embedded into the block header.

#### Data security
A Merkle tree structure gives a simple to-get to record of the transactions in a [block](/block). Thus, its exceptionally simple to check whether the data in a block have been changed or messed with. This is true on the grounds that any change to a transaction (or some other related data) in the Merkle tree would lead to a completely unique comparing Merkle root.

#### Efficient utilization of resources
On the off chance that digital forms of money didn't utilize Merkle trees, each verification request would include colossal measures of data being sent across the network. Organizing transaction data in a Merkle tree is an undeniably more efficient utilization of resources. Approving a transaction doesn't need a complete copy of the ledger as the hashed transaction data can be checked in a Merkle root, requiring significantly less data being sent across the hubs and, in this way, less computing power to dissect the overall data integrity.
At the end of the day, a Merkle tree structure empowers users to confirm that an individual transaction has been remembered for a block without going through the most common way of downloading the whole blockchain. The technology is an important apparatus for digital currencies to coordinate transaction data and function as efficiently as they do. Without Merkle trees, almost certainly, the greater demand for resources would result in less [nodes](/hub) participating in the network.
