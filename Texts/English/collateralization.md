# Collateralization
## What Is Collateralization?

Collateralization is the utilization of a significant asset as collateral to secure a loan. Assuming that the borrower defaults on the loan, the lender might seize and sell the asset to offset their loss.

For lenders, the collateralization of assets gives a level of consolation against [default risk](/defaultrisk). For borrowers with poor credit chronicles, it can assist them with getting loans. Collateralized loans are viewed as secured loans, so they generally have substantially lower interest rates than [unsecured loans](/unsecuredloan).

## Grasping Collateralization

A home mortgage and a vehicle loan are two common instances of collateralization. The house or the vehicle might be held onto by the lender assuming that the borrower defaults on the payments.

Collateralization is likewise common for business loans. A business owner might put up equipment, property, stock, or bonds as security for a loan to grow or work on the business.

On a collateralized loan, the principal — the original sum of money borrowed — is typically based on the appraised [collateral value](/collateral-value) of the property. Most secured lenders will loan around 70% to 90% of the value of the collateral.

For a lender, collateralized loans are intrinsically more secure than non-collateralized loans, so they generally have lower interest rates. Non-collateralized, or unsecured, loans incorporate credit cards and personal loans, which generally have a lot higher rates.

### Collateralized Investing: Buying on a Margin

In the investment industry, utilizing [securities](/security) as collateral is common. For instance, buying on a margin, and that means buying (in part) with borrowed money, is based on the utilization of different securities in the investor's account as collateral on the loan. Assuming the investor has adequate assets in the account to use as collateral, a brokerage firm will permit that investor to buy securities with borrowed money.

Assuming the investment is effective, the loan will be reimbursed from the profits. On the off chance that the investment loses money, the broker issues a [margin call](/margincall), (i.e., a demand for the investor to either deposit extra money or securities or sell a portion of the assets to bring the account up to the base value).

Typically, margin calls are for a percentage of the total amount borrowed. Assuming that an investor acquires $1,000, the brokerage would require that 25% of the loan ($250) be accessible as collateral. In this way, it's essential that investments bought on a margin increase in value for a positive return.
