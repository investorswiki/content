# Nonfinancial Asset
## What Is a Nonfinancial Asset?

A nonfinancial asset is an asset that gets its value from its physical traits. Models incorporate real estate and vehicles. It likewise incorporates all [intellectual property](/intellectualproperty), like licenses and trademarks. The classification of assets as nonfinancial assets is important to businesses as these things show up on an organization's balance sheet and decide a large number of factors, for example, an organization's [market value](/marketvalue) and debt profile.

## Grasping a Nonfinancial Asset

On an organization's balance sheet, nonfinancial assets stand as opposed to [financial assets](/financialasset). Financial assets depend on a contractual claim instead of a physical net worth. Financial assets incorporate stocks, bonds, and bank deposits and are generally simpler to sell than nonfinancial assets.

The value of a financial asset can be founded on the value of an underlying nonfinancial asset. For instance, the value of a [futures contract](/futurescontract) depends on the value of the [commodities](/product) controlled by that contract. Commodities are substantial items with inherent value, like coffee or soybeans, while futures contracts, which don't have an inherent physical value, are an illustration of a financial asset.

## Nonfinancial Assets versus Financial Assets

Nonfinancial and financial assets vary in view of how the assets are bought and sold. Numerous financial assets, for example, stocks and bonds, will trade on exchanges and can be bought and sold on any business day that the exchange is open. It is not difficult to get the current market price to buy or sell these assets. However long the market is [liquid](/liquidmarket), there will be a buyer for each seller and vice versa.

Then again, a nonfinancial asset, like a piece of equipment or a vehicle, can be trying to sell since there is certainly not an active market of buyers and sellers. The pricing of the nonfinancial thing might be hazy as there is no market standard. All things being equal, numerous nonfinancial assets are sold when the seller tracks down a likely buyer and arranges a sale price. The time it takes to track down a buyer, make the sale, and disperse the physical asset, make nonfinancial assets [illiquid](/illiquid).

## Nonfinancial Assets as Collateral

Both financial and nonfinancial assets might be utilized as collateral to back [secured debt](/secureddebt), remaining rather than [unsecured debt](/unsecureddebt), which is just supported by the borrower's ability to pay. One factor that makes a form of collateral more attractive to the lender is the ability to rapidly sell the asset assuming the borrower neglects to make principal or interest payments. A financial asset that trades on an exchange, similar to a stock or bond, is simpler to sell than a nonfinancial asset, so a financial asset is more attractive to a lender as collateral.

Expect, for instance, that XYZ manufacturing needs a $100,000 credit extension to operate the business, and they put up $60,000 in investment securities and a $40,000 piece of equipment as collateral for the loan. In the event that XYZ doesn't make principal and interest payments on the loan and defaults, the lender can sell the $60,000 in financial assets rapidly to cover the loss. Finding a buyer for the equipment, be that as it may, may take more time, so the nonfinancial asset is less attractive as collateral.
