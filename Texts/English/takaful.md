# Takaful
## What Is Takaful?

Takaful is a type of Islamic insurance wherein individuals contribute money into a pool framework to guarantee each other against loss or damage. Takaful-marked insurance is based on [sharia](/shariah) or Islamic strict law, which makes sense of how people are responsible to cooperate and safeguard each other. Takaful policies cover wellbeing, life, and general insurance needs.

Takaful insurance companies were acquainted as an alternative with those in the commercial insurance industry, which are accepted to conflict with Islamic limitations on [riba](/riba) (interest), **al-maisir** (gambling), and **al-gharar** (vulnerability) principles — which are all outlawed in sharia.

## Understanding Takaful

All gatherings or policyholders in a takaful plan consent to guarantee one another and make contributions to a pool or mutual fund as opposed to paying premiums. The pool of collected contributions makes the takaful fund. Every participant's commitment is based on the type of coverage they require and their personal conditions. A takaful agreement determines the idea of the risk and the length of the coverage, like that of a conventional insurance policy.

The takaful fund is managed and administered for the participants by a takaful operator, who charges a settled upon expense to cover costs. Similar as a conventional insurance company, costs incorporate sales and marketing, underwriting, and claims management.

Any claims made by participants are paid out of the takaful fund and any excess overflows, in the wake of making provisions for the logical cost of future claims and different reserves, have a place with the participants in the fund — not the takaful operator. Those funds might be distributed to the participants as cash dividends or distributions, or by means of a decrease in later contributions.

An Islamic insurance company operating a takaful fund must operate under the accompanying principles:

- It must operate as per Islamic cooperative principles.
- A reinsurance commission may just be received from or paid out to Islamic insurance and reinsurance companies.
- The insurance company must keep two separate funds: a participant and policyholder fund, and a shareholder fund.

## Takaful versus Conventional Insurance

- Conventional insurance is based on the idea and practice of charging interest. Islamic insurance, then again, is based on **tabarru,** where a piece of the contributions made by participants is treated as a donation. For this reason policyholders in takaful are typically alluded to as participants.
- Conventional insurance is viewed as a form of gambling.
