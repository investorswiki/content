## Utilizing Bull/Bear Ratio

To form the bull/bear ratio, investment advisors are surveyed week by week by Investors Intelligence. Investors Intelligence is a service that distributes daily market indicators and different things individuals can use to day trade. The bull/bear ratio is a well established indicator that shows shifting sentiments of market professionals like financial advisors.

A financial consultant's sentiment will influence the manner in which they speak with their clients and may even switch the manner in which they encourage their clients to invest, influencing the movement of the market. As the bull/bear ratio rises and falls, it demonstrates the portion of the investment community that is bullish (or anticipating that the market should go up), versus the portion that is bearish (or anticipating that the market should fall).

## Features
- The indicator is distributed week by week by the financial data firm Investors Intelligence.
- Assuming the ratio is greater than one, there is greater bullish sentiment since additional advisors anticipate that the market should rise; and bearish on the off chance that the ratio is short of what one.
- The bull/bear ratio is an economic indicator that tracks market sentiment by reviewing professional financial advisors.
