## What Is a Floating Price?

In a swap contract, the floating price is the leg that relies upon the level of a variable, for example, an interest rate, currency exchange rate, or price of an asset. Most swaps include a floating and a fixed leg, despite the fact that it is workable for the two legs to drift.

The party paying the floating rate anticipates that that rate should decline over the life of the swap.

## Figuring out Floating Price

A swap is an agreement between two gatherings to exchange groupings of cash flows for a set period of time. Typically, at the hour of contract commencement, something like one of these series of cash still up in the air by a random or unsure variable, for example, an interest rate, foreign exchange rate, equity price or commodity price.

Nonetheless, the most common and most fundamental type of swaps is the [plain vanilla](/plainvanilla) interest rate swap, trailed continuously most common, the currency swap.

In a plain vanilla interest rate swap, Party A consents to pay Party B a foreordained, fixed rate of interest on a notional principal on specific dates for a predefined period of time. Simultaneously, Party B consents to make payments in light of a floating interest rate to Party An on that equivalent notional principal on similar determined dates for a similar indicated time span.

## Plain Vanilla Swap

In a plain vanilla swap, the two cash flows are paid in a similar currency. The predetermined payment dates are called [settlement dates](/settlementdate), and the times between are called settlement periods. Since swaps are modified contracts, interest payments might be made yearly, quarterly, month to month, or at some not set in stone by the gatherings.

While the fixed-rate stream doesn't change for the duration of the swap, the floating rate stream changes periodically. The floating rate will change as its benchmark interest rate changes as per market conditions. The benchmark is much of the time [LIBOR](/libor) however may likewise be the yield on a one-year U.S. Treasury note or another interest rate.

Two gatherings, called counterparties, go into fixed-for-floating swap transactions to reduce their exposure to changes in interest rates or to endeavor to profit from changes in interest rates.

## Currency Swap

In a currency swap, the two [counterparties](/counterparty) exchange principal and fixed interest payments on a loan in one currency for principal and fixed interest payments on a comparable loan in another currency. Not at all like an interest rate swap, the gatherings to a currency swap will exchange principal sums toward the beginning and end of the swap. The two determined principal sums are set in order to be around equivalent to one another, given the exchange rate at the time the swap is initiated.

Here, the floating price is the exchange rate between the two currencies.
