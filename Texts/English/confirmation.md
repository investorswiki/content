# Confirmation
## What's the significance here?

In technical analysis, confirmation alludes to the utilization of an additional indicator or indicators to validate a trend suggested by one indicator. Since [technical indicators](/technicalindicator) are not perfect indicators of future price developments, a trader frequently has a good sense of reassurance choosing to follow up on a signal in the event that more than one indicator is conveying a similar message. On the off chance that various indicators convey conflicting messages, this is known as divergence.

In securities trading, a confirmation may likewise allude to a [fill](/fill), giving the subtleties of an executed trade.

## Figuring out Confirmation

Confirmation can likewise allude to a broker's written affirmation that they have completed a trade. These can be in electronic or paper form, and record information like the date, price, [commission](/commission), fees, and settlement terms of the trade. Brokers regularly send a confirmation in no less than multi week of the trade's completion.

Technical indicators fall into four broad categories: trend, momentum, volatility, and volume. While seeking confirmation for a trade signal given by one indicator, it is generally best to focus on an indicator from an alternate category. In any case, something very similar or comparable data sources are counted on various occasions, giving the illusion of confirmation when as a matter of fact minimal new information has been considered.

Confirmation is best met assuming at least one indicators from numerous categories are available:

- **Trend indicators** incorporate [moving averages](/movingaverage), [moving average convergence divergence](/macd) (MACD), and the parabolic SAR.
- **Momentum indicators** incorporate the [stochastic oscillator](/stochasticoscillator), the [commodity channel index](/commoditychannelindex) (CCI), and the [relative strength index](/rsi) (RSI).
- **Volatility indicators** incorporate [Bollinger Bands](/bollingerbands), standard deviation, and [average true range](/atr) (ATR).
- **Volume indicators** incorporate the [Chaikin Oscillator](/chaikinoscillator) (additionally used to measure momentum), [on-balance volume](/onbalancevolume) (OBV), and the volume rate of change.

## Confirmation Example Using Indicators

Assume a trader sees a [golden cross](/goldencross), which happens when the 50-day moving average crosses over the 200-day moving average. This is a signal to buy the stock, in light of a trend indicator (the moving averages). Since this signal alone doesn't guarantee higher prices, the trader could look for confirmation from an alternate type of indicator.

In this case, a high trading volume would support the buy signal, while lower volumes could make the [trader](/trader) reconsider taking a position in the stock. The OBV indicator would, subsequently, be an intelligent decision to confirm the trade: a rising OBV would confirm the golden cross' bullish signal, while a flat or falling OBV would propose that the price is approaching a top.
