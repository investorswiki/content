# Add-On
## What are add-ons?
Add-ons are the issuance of new stock by a company that has proactively disclosed its offering and has outstanding stock. Add-ons might be utilized to raise cash, fund new or existing tasks and pay for expanded operations. Add-ons fund-raise and increase a company's value, yet they can make current shares be diluted. Add-ons are likewise alluded to as secondary offerings.
## More profound definition
At the point when additional stock shares are issued by a company, current investors own a more modest portion of the company than they did prior to the add-on. For instance, on the off chance that a company issued 100,000 shares in its initial public offering and Bob bought 10,000 shares, he owned 10 percent of the company's stocks. On the off chance that the company, issues 20,000 additional shares and Bob buys no additional stocks, he presently possesses 8.3 percent of the company's stock. This is alluded to as dilution.
One of the manners in which companies are estimated is by their earnings per share. At the point when the number of a company's shares increases without the company's income expanding, the earnings per share decline. Diminished earnings per share ordinarily make the stock price drop. Notwithstanding, add-ons don't necessarily bring about the dilution of stock, especially in the event that the company is very well known.
## Illustration of add-ons
While add-ons are many times considered awful for current investors, this isn't generally the case. For instance, in the event that a company was worth $10 billion, brought more shares into the market, raised $2 billion and utilized that capital to buy out a contender, its market cap may fundamentally increase. While the owners would then claim more modest percentages of the pie than they did before the add-on, the pie would have developed substantially. The owners would now claim more modest slices of a larger pie.
Situations where companies utilize capital from add-ons to pay down debt or refinance debt at lower interest rates might work on the companies' main concerns and financial wellbeing. Additionally, rating agencies might upgrade the companies since they carry less debt. This might bring about increased shareholder value in the long term, and be seen as a positive financial move.
Companies here and there make secondary equity offerings to permit existing investors to sell large numbers of shares. For instance, secondary equity offerings might happen when a major investor, for example, the pioneer behind a private equity firm, sells a larger number of shares that would be hard to sell in the normal course of trading. Since these shares were at that point outstanding, they don't weaken the earnings per share and consequently don't negatively impact the share.
Stock warrants and options safeguard individual investors against dilution. The two instruments permit investors to buy shares at predetermined prices. Stock options give the holder the right to purchase outstanding stock at a predetermined price. Stock warrants, on the other hand, are issued straight by the company and are delivered by the company making new shares.
Impact day alludes to the day that the company makes its secondary shares accessible to the public. After the shares are disclosed, the stock's price may rapidly decline.
While add-ons can make current investors panic, they're not generally an indication of doom and gloom. Companies that utilization their capital to pay down debt, work on their financial main concern, or make sound business investments might be using sound judgment that harvest long-term gains for current shareholders. Short-term dilution might bring about long-term gains for investors who will hold on for the ride.
