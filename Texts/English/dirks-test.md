## What Is the Dirks Test?

The Dirks test (likewise alluded to as the personal benefits test) is a standard utilized by the [Securities and Exchange Commission](/sec) (SEC) to decide if somebody who receives and acts on insider information (a tippee) is at fault for [insider trading](/insidertrading). The Dirks test searches for two criteria: 1) whether the individual breached the company's trust (bankrupt rules of confidentiality by uncovering material nonpublic information) and 2) whether the individual did so intentionally.

Tippees can be found at real fault for insider trading assuming that they knew or ought to have realized that the tipper had committed a breach of fiduciary duty. The Dirks test originated from a 1983 Supreme Court ruling which stated that the breach of duty must bring about a personal benefit for the insider. The Court gave guidance to figure out what is a personal benefit, making a test that treats [tipping](/tipping) diversely relying upon whether the tips are given to family members and friends versus outsiders.

The Dirks test laid out the conditions under which tippees can be held at risk for insider trading. An individual doesn't actually need to take part in a trade to be at legitimate fault for unlawful insider trading.

## Special Considerations

The Supreme Court decided that a tipee may expect the insider's fiduciary duty to a partnership's [shareholders](/shareholder) not to trade on material nonpublic information if the tipee knows or ought to have known about the insider's breach.

The Court decided that there is no breach except if the insider tips for their very own benefit, instead of the tipee's personal benefit.

Mathew Martoma, a former portfolio manager at a large [hedge fund](/hedgefund), was sentenced in 2014 for insider trading including shares of a biotechnology company directing critical trials of an Alzheimer's medication.

His legal counselors pursued the conviction because the tipper, a conspicuous doctor and scientist at the University of Michigan, didn't receive personal benefit for sharing material nonpublic data with Martoma. In any case, the federal requests court upheld the conviction in 2017, refering to that no less than one tipper received a personal benefit from revealing inside information as $70,000 in counseling fees.
