# Accounting Interpretation
## What Is an Accounting Interpretation?

An accounting interpretation is a statement, issued by accounting standards bodies, explaining how existing [accounting standards](/accounting-standard) ought to be applied. Interpretations are generally not requirements, but instead frame [best practices](/best_practices) and give further clarification.

## Figuring out an Accounting Interpretation

As financial [transactions](/transaction) keep on advancing, new circumstances foster that might not have been anticipated by the existing accounting standards. At the point when questions emerge, accounting boards, for example, the [Financial Accounting Standards Board](/fasb) (FASB), the [American Institute of Certified Public Accountants](/american-institute-of-certified-public-accountants) (AICPA), and the [International Accounting Standards Board](/ias) (IASB), may decide to issue an interpretation framing the suggested rehearses for accounting. The IASB works under the oversight of the International Financial Reporting Standards Foundation (IFRS).

In different cases, a totally new standard might be issued for a class of financial transactions that didn't beforehand exist, for instance for industries that as of late arisen, like certain parts of the tech sector in the last twenty years. On the other hand, a standard could be refreshed, known as "ASU," or Accounting Standard Update, in the speech of the FASB, in the event that the idea of a change in a transaction is sufficiently critical to warrant an adjustment.

Accounting interpretations explain and expound on the financial reporting rules right now in circulation, assisting with guaranteeing that financial statements are accurate and comparable.

Accountants and others responsible for assembling [financial statements](/financial-statements) are expected to comply with new or reconsidered accounting standards, as well as pay careful regard for the interpretations that accompany them. Interpretations act as a helpful aide. They help to remove equivocalness and take out the risk that a lack of comprehension of existing rules could lead to accountants erroneously applying various strategies and, in vile cases, concocting creative approaches to [cook the books](/cookthebooks).

## Accounting Interpretation versus Accounting Standard

Accounting interpretations are planned to develop the concepts spread out by an accounting standard: a common set of principles and procedures that characterize the basis of [financial accounting](/financialaccounting) policies and practices.

Accounting standards underline the requirements for how to report business transactions. Their objective is to standardize financial statements and work on the transparency of financial reporting in all countries.

## Benefits of an Accounting Interpretation

The clearness offered by an accounting interpretation guarantees that reported financial figures are bound to be significant, accurate, and comparable across various companies. Ensuring that everybody follows similar principles is to the greatest advantage of investors since it assists them with arriving at better-educated conclusions about which stocks to invest in.

At times, investors could even opt to counsel accounting interpretations. Investors with a greater, cutting-edge handle of reporting requirements are vastly improved set to evaluate the [financial health](/financial-soundness) of a company than those with just fundamental information.

## Real World Example

In December 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Interpretation No. 48, offering explaining comments on the standards framed in FASB Statement No. 109, with respect to accounting for [income taxes](/incometax), in the wake of confirming that there were too numerous uncertainties in regards to its application.

In the interpretation, the accounting board "recommends a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return." The interpretation depicts the two-step cycle of recognition and measurement and the subsequent impact on financial statements with respect to income taxes payable or receivable, as well as the impact on [deferred tax assets](/deferredtaxasset) and [liabilities](/risk).

At the point when the FASB releases an interpretation, it will likewise refer to the justification behind it and make sense of how the interpretation will work on financial reporting. On account of No. 48, that's what FASB states "this Interpretation will bring about increased significance and likeness in financial reporting of income taxes since all tax positions represented as per Statement 109 will be assessed for recognition, derecognition, and measurement utilizing predictable criteria."
