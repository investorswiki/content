## What Is Vintage?

Vintage is a shoptalk term utilized by [mortgage-backed security](/mbs) (MBS) traders and investors to allude to a MBS that is seasoned throughout some time span. A MBS normally has a [maturity](/maturity) of around 30 years, and a specific issue's "vintage" opens the holder to less prepayment and default risk, albeit this diminished risk likewise limits price appreciation.

## How Vintage Works

The underlying loans of certain vintage MBS have unique qualities, for example, burnout, that make the vintage trade at a premium price. These unique qualities are a consequence of how underlying assets in MBS are pooled. MBS' underlying assets are generally assembled across certain geographical locales with comparable terms to [maturity](/maturity) and interest rates. This makes forecasting payment arrangements more unsurprising.

MBS are [investment vehicles](/investmentvehicle) overwhelmingly issued by a U.S. [government-sponsored enterprise](/gse) (GSE). The investments are included the debt obligations associated with gatherings of mortgage loans, prevalently residential property loans. The security, addressing a specific claim against the principal and interest payments owed by borrowers, is then issued by the making entity. MBS are traded on the secondary market.

## Vintage as Applied to MBS

The term vintage connects with the age of a thing as it connects with the year it was made. In the event that a thing was made in 2012, the [vintage year](/vintage_year) is 2012, and its age can be determined by deducting the vintage year from the current year.

The variation in the vintages of specific MBS might address various levels of risk to investors. With the U.S. subprime mortgage crisis that started in 2007, for instance, lenders had begun beginning large numbers of high-risk mortgages from around 2004 to 2007. Loans from those vintage years showed higher [default rates](/defaultrate), and were, hence, riskier, than loans made before and later.

## Special Considerations

While the vintage might be one factor used to determine the [inherent risk](/inherent-risk) of a certain MBS, different factors are likewise thought of. In this case, two MBS with a similar vintage might have various levels of assumed risk and, hence, may have different [perceived values](/perceived-value). A few extra factors incorporate the excess value of the mortgage pool, the current market value of the properties backing the mortgages and the accrued interest.

A MBS [payout](/payout) schedule shifts from numerous other investment vehicles. While bonds might pay semiannually, every year or at the recently settled upon [maturity date](/maturitydate), a MBS pays out to investors consistently. While a bond payment may just incorporate the earned interest until the maturity date, where a lump sum of the original principal is returned, MBS give regularly scheduled payments of both interest and a portion of the principal. The regularly scheduled payment required corresponds to the traditional payment schedule of mortgage debtors.
