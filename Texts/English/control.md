# Control
## DEFINITION of Control

Control alludes to having adequate amount of voting shares of a company to settle on every corporate decision. Otherwise called "corporate control," this privileged position exists due to majority shareholder support or a double class shareholder structure, yet can change through a takeover or [proxy contest](/proxyfight).

## BREAKING DOWN Control

As a rule, control lies in the hands of majority shareholders, who choose a [Board of Directors](/boardofdirectors) to address their interests. The board is accused of supervising management of the company and accordingly the overall strategy and bearing of the firm. The board individuals are given control, however exclusively by uprightness of majority (some of the time [supermajority](/supermajority)) support of the shareholders, or owners, of the company. At times, a double class structure gives control to a small secrecy of organizers/insiders, whose monetary interest in the company can be a simple part of the holdings of any remaining shareholders. One class, regularly designated Class An or Class B, will have a lopsided number of voting rights for this select group of people. This means that they, not the majority of shareholders, have control over the company. Meta (formerly Facebook) and Alphabet are two high-profile companies with a double class shareholding structure, yet they have been condemned by some for shareholder-unfriendly corporate governance rehearses.

## Change of Control

Change of control happens when a company is taken over by another. At the point when a takeover, whether friendly or [hostile](/hostile-takeover-bid), is completed, the board or majority of the board is chosen by the new owner. This new or patched up board presently is responsible for the stewardship of the company. A [activist shareholder](/activist-investor) can likewise force a change of control through a proxy fight. An activist investor, who accepts that a company can possibly further develop performance - and subsequently the price of the stock - would select a record of directors that he accepts would serve his shareholder interests, and probably, those of any remaining shareholders. His candidates, including a majority of the board, are put up for vote during the annual election period. Assuming the activist is fruitful in his undertaking, he will gain corporate control.
