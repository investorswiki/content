# Nepalese Rupee (NPR)
## What Is the Nepalese Rupee (NPR)?

The Nepalese rupee (NPR) is the national currency of Nepal. It is administered by the central bank of Nepal, the Nepal Rastra Bank. The most common symbol utilized while referring to the NPR is Rs, despite the fact that Rp is likewise in some cases utilized.

## Grasping Nepalese Rupee (NPR)

The NPR was presented in 1932, supplanting the previous currency, the Nepalese mohar. Its [exchange rate](/exchangerate) depends on a [peg](/currency-peg) set against the [Indian rupee (INR)](/inr). Prior to 1994, the NPR was pegged at a rate of 1 INR for every 1.45 NPR. Nonetheless, starting around 1994 the peg has been adjusted to 1 INR for each 1.60 NPR.

The NPR is separated into units known as "paisa" and is flowed in both coin and [banknote](/banknote) forms. One rupee is comprised of 100 paisa. Today, the NPR's coins are named in units of 1, 2, 5, 10, 25, and 50 paisa. The banknotes are named in units of 5, 10, 20, 50, 100, 500, and 1,000 paisa. The latest series of banknotes, delivered in 2015, feature pictures of Mount Everest alongside other neighborhood symbols of natural and social significance.

Executing in the NPR can be challenging for outsiders, since there are three primary exchange rates operating in Nepal: an official central bank rate, a legal private bank rate, and an illegal [black market](/blackmarket) rate. Of these, the most favorable exchange rates are generally found in the black market. Consequently, much neighborhood commerce happens at the black-market exchange rates.

Most travelers, be that as it may, will utilize the private banks and will thusly get a less favorable rate. The equivalent is true for formal exchange-rate organizations and the unfamiliar exchange services offered at the Kathmandu airport. These authorized agents will execute at the private banking rates.

In view of the legal ambiguities included, explorers are encouraged to acquire and keep receipts for all their currency exchange transactions, to have the option to demonstrate that main legal agents were utilized.
