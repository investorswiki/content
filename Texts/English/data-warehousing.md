A data warehouse is intended to permit its users to run inquiries and investigations on historical data derived from value-based sources.

Data added to the warehouse don't change and can't be altered. The warehouse is the source that is utilized to run [analytics](/data-analytics) on past occasions, with an emphasis on changes after some time. Warehoused data must be stored in a way that is secure, reliable, simple to recover, and simple to make due.

After a set of data has been incorporated, it goes through data cleaning, the most common way of combing through it for errors and correcting or it are found to reject any that.

The tidied up data are then changed over from a database organization to a warehouse design. When stored in the warehouse, the data goes through sorting, consolidating, and summarizing, so it will be simpler to utilize. Over the long haul, more data are added to the warehouse as the different data sources are refreshed.

A key book on data warehousing is W. H. Inmon's "Building the Data Warehouse," a pragmatic aide that was first distributed in 1990 and has been reprinted several times.

Today, businesses can invest in cloud-based data warehouse software services from companies including Microsoft, Google, Amazon, and Oracle, among others.

## Data Warehousing versus Databases

A data warehouse isn't equivalent to a database:

- A database is a value-based system that screens and updates real-time data in order to have just the latest data available.
- A data warehouse is customized to aggregate structured data over the long haul.

For instance, a database could have the latest address of a customer, while a data warehouse could have every one of the addresses for the customer for the past 10 years.
