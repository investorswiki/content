## What Is a Wrap-Around Insurance Program?

A wrap-around insurance program is a policy that gives [punitive damages](/punitive-damages) coverage for employment practices liability claims. Should a legal reward in excess of compensatory damages be awarded to an offended party to rebuff a litigant and prevent them from committing future punitive actions, this form of [insurance](/insurance) will assist with covering those costs.

## Understanding a Wrap-Around Insurance Program

A wrap-around insurance program is likewise alluded to as a wrap-around policy since it is set up related to a [Employment Practices Liability Insurance (EPLI)](/employers-liability-insurance) policy. EPLI guarantees against claims from employees that employers have disregarded their rights. Eligible claims for such lawsuits can go from any form of discrimination to wrongful termination.

The most common award from these types of lawsuits is punitive or money related damages. These are generally issued to cover a scope of necessities, including [medical costs](/medical-expenses), loss of income, and pain and languishing.

Employers carry EPLI policies to cover the costs they could bring about assuming legal action is pursued. Assuming that an employee feels that [workers' compensation](/laborers compensation) doesn't enough cover their loss — maybe in light of the fact that they feel their employer's negligence caused their injury — they might choose to sue their employer for punitive damages like pain and languishing.

EPLI tends to this risk and is intended to cover expenses not protected by laborers' compensation or general [liability insurance](/liability_insurance): an essentially mandatory form of insurance that gives a level of coverage to medical expenses and lost wages for employees or their beneficiaries while harmed, falling sick, or killed because of their job.

> Employment Practices Liability Insurance (EPLI) puts limits on the sums paid out per employee, per injury, or per illness.
