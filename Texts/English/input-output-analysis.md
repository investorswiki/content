# Input-Output Analysis
## What Is Input-Output Analysis?

Input-output analysis (I-O) is a form of macroeconomic analysis in view of the interdependencies between various economic [sectors](/area) or industries. This method is commonly utilized for assessing the impacts of positive or negative economic shocks and examining the ripple effects all through an economy. I-O economic analysis was originally developed by [Wassily Leontief ](/wassily-leontief)(1906-1999), who later won the [Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences](/nobel-memorial-prize-in-economic-sciences) for his work around here.

## Grasping Input-Output Analysis

The foundation of I-O analysis includes input-output tables. Such tables incorporate a series of lines and columns of data that measure the [supply chain](/supplychain) for all sectors of an economy. Industries are listed in the headers of each line and every column. The data in every column relates to the level of inputs utilized in that industry's production function.

For instance, the column for car manufacturing shows the resources required for building vehicles (e.g., the amount of steel, aluminum, plastic, hardware, etc). I-O models commonly incorporate separate tables showing the amount of labor required per dollar unit of investment or production.

While input-output analysis isn't commonly used by [neoclassical economics](/neoclassical) or by policy advisers in the West, it has been employed in [Marxist](/marxian-economics) economic analysis of composed economies that depend on a [central planner](/centrally-arranged economy).

## Three Types of Economic Impact

I-O models estimate three types of impact: direct, indirect, and induced. These terms are one more approach to alluding to initial, secondary, and tertiary impacts that ripple all through the economy when a change is made to a given input level. By utilizing I-O models, [economists](/economist) can estimate the change in output across industries due to a change in inputs in at least one specific industries.

- The direct impact of an economic shock is an initial change in expenditures. For instance, building a bridge would require spending on concrete, steel, construction equipment, labor, and different inputs.
- The indirect, or secondary, impact would be due to the providers of the inputs hiring workers to fulfill need.
- The induced, or tertiary, impact would result from the workers of providers purchasing more goods and services for [personal consumption](/pce). This analysis can likewise be run in reverse, seeing what effects on inputs were probable the reason for noticed changes in outputs.

## Illustration of Input-Output Analysis

This is an illustration of the way I-O analysis works. A nearby government needs to build another bridge and needs to legitimize the cost of the investment. To do as such, it hires an economist to conduct an I-O study.

The economist converses with engineers and construction companies to estimate how much the bridge will cost, the supplies required, and the number of workers that will be hired by the construction company.

The economist changes over this information into dollar figures and runs numbers through an I-O model, which creates the three levels of impacts. The direct impact is essentially the original numbers put into the model, for instance, the value of the [raw inputs](/rawmaterials) (concrete, steel, and so on.).

The indirect impact is the positions made by the supplying companies, so concrete and steel companies. These companies need to hire workers to complete the project. They either have the funds to do so or need to borrow the money to do as such, which would anotherly affect banks.

The induced impact is the amount of money that the new workers spend on goods and services for them as well as their families. This incorporates nuts and bolts like food and dress, however since they have more [disposable income](/disposableincome), it additionally connects with goods and services for delight.

The I-O analysis studies the ripple effects on different sectors of the economy brought about by the nearby government needing to build another bridge. The bridge might require certain costs from the government, using taxes, however the I-O analysis will show the benefits the project creates by hiring companies that hire workers that spend in the economy, assisting it with developing.

## Features
- Three types of impacts are modeled in input-output analysis. They are direct impact, indirect impact, and induced impact.
- Input-output analysis is utilized to estimate the impacts of positive or negative economic shocks and dissects the ripple effects all through the economy.
- Input-output tables are the foundation of input-output analysis, portraying lines and columns of data that measure the supply chain for each of the sectors of an economy.
- These impacts on the economy are resolved when certain input levels are changed.
- The utilization of input-output analysis isn't common in the Western world or neoclassical economics yet frequently utilized in Marxist economics while central planning of an economy is required.
- Input-output analysis is a macroeconomic analysis in light of the interdependencies between various economic sectors or industries.
