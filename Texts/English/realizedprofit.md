# Realized Gain
## What Is a Realized Gain?

A realized gain comes about because of selling an asset at a price higher than the original purchase price. It happens when an asset is sold at a level that surpasses its [book value](/bookvalue) cost.

While an asset might be carried on a balance sheet at a level far above cost, any gains while the asset is as yet being held are viewed as unrealized as the asset is just being valued at [fair market value](/fairmarketvalue). In the event that selling an asset brings about a loss, there is a [realized loss](/realizedloss) all things considered.

A realized gain can measure up to a [unrealized gain](/unrealizedgain).

## How Realized Gains Work

Realized gains and unrealized gains change extensively. Realized gains are those that have been completed by selling an existing position for more than whatever was paid for it. An unrealized ("paper") gain, then again, is one that has not been realized yet.

## Balance Sheet Elimination

Realized gains might happen through the sale of a [asset](/asset) when a company decides to dispense with it from the balance sheet. Asset sales can happen in light of multiple factors and purposes and are reported on the [financial statements](/financial-statements) of a company during the period where the asset sale happens.

Asset sales are routinely checked to guarantee the asset is sold at fair market value or [arm's length](/armslength) price. This regulation guarantees companies are esteeming the sale properly in the marketplace and thinks about whether the asset is sold to a related or unrelated party.

At the point when an asset is sold, a realized profit is accomplished, and the firm typically sees an increase in its [current assets](/currentassets) and a gain from the sale. The realized gain from the sale of the asset might lead to an increased tax burden since realized gains from sales are ordinarily [taxable income](/taxableincome). This is one drawback of selling an asset and turning an unrealized "paper" gain into a realized gain.

In many business cases, companies cause no tax until a realized and unmistakable profit happens.

## Realized versus Unrealized Gains

While realized gains are completed, an unrealized gain is a potential profit that exists on paper, coming about because of an investment. It is an increase in the value of an asset that presently can't seem to be sold for cash, for example, a stock position that has increased in value yet at the same time stays open. A gain becomes realized once the position is sold for a profit.

At the point when unrealized gains present, it as a rule means an investor accepts the investment has room for higher future gains. If not, they would sell now and perceive the current gain. Moreover, unrealized gains in some cases come about in light of the fact that holding an investment for a significant time frame period brings down the tax burden of the gain.

For instance, on the off chance that an investor holds a stock for longer than one year, their tax rate is diminished to the long-term [capital gains tax](/capital_gains_tax). Further, to move the capital gains tax burden to another [tax year](/taxyear), they can sell the stock in January of a procedure year, as opposed to selling in the current year.

Investors ought to likewise note the qualification between realized gains and realized income. Realized income alludes to [income](/income) that you have earned and received, like income from wages or a salary as well as income from interest or [dividend](/dividend) payments.
