## What is Linux?

Linux is a well known open-source, profoundly adjustable operating system (OS). It works with communication among software and hardware, fueling a lot of the present world - from computers to cars.
Made in 1991 by Linus Torvalds, Linux is open-source software that is presently part of a large assortment of systems. As open-source, Linux is unreservedly accessible for both commercial and non-commercial use. Anybody can utilize, alter, and appropriate the source code under the terms of its licenses.
Inferable from its flexibility, Linux is available in a great many applications, including work stations, PCs, web servers, [supercomputers](/supercomputer), cell phones, TVs, switches, digital cameras, instruments, and vehicles.
Technically speaking, Linux is a piece: a computer program that is the core element of an operating system. Basically, the piece makes an interpretation of computer code into binary data that the hardware can comprehend.
Utilizing the Linux piece alone seems to be the computer experience a great many people are utilized to. So engineers around the world have added extra parts and applications to make it more easy to understand. In this way, Linux is generally distributed as bundles (collections of software apparatuses). These modified renditions of Linux are called distros (short for Linux Distributions).

### What are the types of Linux distributions?
Over the long haul, networks and companies have worked with Linux to make systems that suit their inclinations or necessities. There is a long rundown of various Linux distros, from one side of the planet to the other. While some are altogether local area based (like Debian or Arch Linux), others have corporate support (like Fedora or openSUSE). Different distros aim to do various things. For example, they might be centered around privacy (TAILS), convenience (Ubuntu), or customization (Arch).

### How could somebody need to utilize Linux?
Overall, Linux is a flexible, efficient, and secure system. It very well may be altered in view of the inclinations of the client. Its lightweight infrastructure takes into consideration quicker computer speeds, and could in fact be utilized to renew an old machine. The numerous Linux distros empower users to pick a system that takes special care of their requirements - whether it be simplicity, security, privacy, or advanced personalization.
