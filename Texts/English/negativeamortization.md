# Negative Amortization
## What Is Negative Amortization?

Negative amortization is a financial term alluding to an increase in the [principal](/principal) balance of a loan made by a disappointment cover the [interest](/interest) due on that loan. For instance, on the off chance that the interest payment on a loan is $500, and the borrower just pays $400, then, at that point, the $100 difference would be added to the loan's principal balance.

## Figuring out Negative Amortization

In an ordinary loan, the principal balance is steadily diminished as the borrower makes payments. A negative amortization loan is basically the reverse phenomenon, where the principal balance develops when the borrower neglects to make payments.

Negative amortizations are highlighted in certain types of [mortgage](/mortgage) loans, for example, [payment option adjustable-rate mortgages (ARMs)](/option_arm), which let borrowers determine the amount of the interest portion of every regularly scheduled payment they choose for pay. Any portion of interest that they opt not to pay is then added to the principal balance of the mortgage.

One more type of mortgage that incorporates negative amortizations is the alleged [graduated payment mortgage (GPM)](/graduatedpaymentmortgage). With this model, the [amortization schedule](/amortization_schedule) is structured so the first payments incorporate just a portion of the interest that will later be charged. While these partial payments are being made, the missing interest portion will be added back to the principal balance of the loan. In later payment periods, the regularly scheduled payments will incorporate the full interest part, making the principal balance decline all the more quickly.

Albeit negative amortizations manage the cost of flexibility to borrowers, they can eventually demonstrate exorbitant. For instance, on account of an ARM, a borrower might decide to postpone paying interest for a long time. Albeit this can assist with facilitating the burden of regularly scheduled payments in the short term, it can open borrowers to extreme future [payment shock](/paymentshock) if interest rates spike later on. In this sense, the total amount of interest paid by borrowers may eventually be far greater than if they hadn't depended on negative amortizations, in the first place.

## Certifiable Example of Negative Amortization

Think about the following speculative model: Mike, a first-time home-purchaser, wishes to keep his month to month mortgage payments as low as could really be expected. To accomplish this, he opts for an ARM, choosing for pay just a small portion of the interest on his regularly scheduled payments.

Let us accept that Mike got his mortgage when interest rates were generally low. Notwithstanding this, his month to month mortgage payments eat up a huge percentage of his month to month pay â€” in any event, when he exploits the negative amortization offered by the ARM.

In spite of the fact that Mike's payment plan might assist him with dealing with his expenses in the short-term, it likewise opens him to greater long-term interest rate risk, since, in such a case that future interest rates rise, he might not be able to manage the cost of his adjusted regularly scheduled payments. Besides, on the grounds that Mike's low-interest-payment strategy is making his loan balance decline more slowly than it would some way or another, he will have more principal and interest to repay in the future than if he had essentially paid the full interest and principal he owed every month.
