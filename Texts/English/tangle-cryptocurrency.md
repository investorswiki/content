# Tangle (IOTA)
## What Is the IOTA Tangle?

The IOTA Tangle is a creative type of distributed ledger technology (DLT) that is explicitly designed for the [Internet of Things (IoT)](/internet-things) environment. The IOTA technology depends on another type of DLT, not the traditional blockchain model. It was made by the IOTA Foundation, a non-benefit foundation incorporated and registered in Germany. The IOTA Foundation's mission is to support the development and standardization of new DLTs, including the Tangle.

The design limitations of existing blockchain systems for certain applications prompted the development of virtual currency alternatives that could be utilized to fill various needs. IOTA Tangle was developed to enable miniature transactions without fees for the developing ecosystem of IoT gadgets. IoT gadgets are network-enabled gadgets, including products like smart apparatuses, home security systems, computer peripherals, [wearable technology](/wearable-technology), switches, and smart speaker gadgets that have Wi-Fi associations, Bluetooth associations, or [near-field communication](/near-field-communication-nfc) (NFC).

Tangle was made with the commitment of high scalability, no fees, and near-moment transfers.

## Understanding the IOTA Tangle

IOTA is a cryptocurrency; its architecture is called the IOTA Tangle. Tangle utilizes a proof-of-work (PoW) system for validating transactions on a distributed ledger. Tangle's PoW system is like the one utilized by bitcoin, however it utilizes less energy and requires less investment than other PoW systems (counting the one utilized by bitcoin).

The interconnectedness of Tangle's architecture doesn't need total verification across the ledger. All things being equal, all parties are confirming all the while and, accordingly, the energy and time required to complete transactions are abbreviated. Likewise, Tangle's verification interaction implies to guarantee that there are no copy transactions that would lead to [double-spending](/doublespending).

Nonetheless, the system itself was not adequate to safeguard against a monstrous, facilitated attack. As the Iota Foundation noted, "On the off chance that an attacker controls the majority of hashing power in the network they can likewise control the bearing of consensus. In particular, such an attacker would have the option to double spend and split the network."

To safeguard against this sort of attack, Iota developed a job called the "Organizer." The Iota Foundation was in charge of running the Coordinator program. An announcement in May 2019 informed the cryptocurrency community that the IOTA foundation planned to eliminate the job of the Coordinator as part of an entire system upgrade called Coordicide.

In IOTA's whitepaper, Tangle is depicted as the replacement of blockchain technology: "The Tangle normally succeeds the blockchain as its next evolutionary step, and offers includes that are required to lay out a machine-to-machine micropayment system."

## Special Considerations
### Benefits of Tangle

One more benefit of Tangle technology is the cost of operating it. For [blockchain](/blockchain)- based digital currencies, as bitcoin, there is a transaction fee exacted for all transactions happening on the network (regardless of the transaction value). Since the transaction putting away and processing mechanism of Tangle requires no excavators, there are no transaction fees.

As the number of small-sized micropayments (payments that include fractional amounts) increments altogether later on, transaction costs will utilize blockchain-based cryptocurrency unfeasible for such payments. High transaction costs have proactively prompted the problem of bitcoin dust. Bitcoin dust alludes to the small amount of bitcoin extra or unspent in a transaction that is lower in value than the base furthest reaches of a substantial transaction. In this way, processing the transaction is unthinkable, catching a little amount of bitcoin in a wallet or address.

### Iota's System Upgrade

Before the announcement of the send off of Iota's major system upgrade, called Coordicide, the job of the organizer was important to safeguard client funds inside the Tangle network. The organizer was a security mechanism that guaranteed the validness of transactions and forestalled double-spends. The job of facilitators was to invalidate the impact of any conflicts in the record; on account of a conflict, an organizer was expected to dismiss a transaction.

Be that as it may, since a facilitator was free to support a wide range of transactions, they could endorse flawed ones too. In theory, another transaction issued by an organizer that approved an erroneous transaction wouldn't be approved by different facilitators, in this manner keeping up with network integrity. In theory, this mechanism of requiring extra endorsements was planned to guarantee that main genuine transactions were approved by the system and with a higher level of confidence, speed, and proficiency.

In any case, the core fundamental of the philosophy of distributed ledger technology (DLT) is that they ought to lack a centralized authority. Tangle ran afoul of this philosophy; it required the organizers to appropriately monitor its system and forestall attacks. Along these lines, Tangle had a central authority confirming its transactions; this is all precisely exact thing cryptocurrency was planned to get rid of.

Pundits of Tangle said that the necessity of the organizer job permitted the Iota Foundation to pick which transactions would receive priority. Likewise, this job gave an opportunity to a single point of attack: If, for reasons unknown, a facilitator stopped working or was assumed control over, affirmations in the network would halt.

The IOTA Foundation had been working for quite a long time to dispose of the requirement for the organizer job. This initiative, which was at last announced in May 2019, is called Coordicide.

The way that Iota experienced delays in moving away from this form of centralization was supposedly the primary explanation Iota's lead designer and fellow benefactor Sergey Ivancheglo served David S\u00f8nsteb\u00f8, the Iota Foundation's director and another prime supporter, with a claim for generally $8.5 million.

In late December 2019, the IOTA network was down for 24 hours, conceivably due to an organized attack. When the IOTA Reference Implementation (IRI) system denoted a transaction as "currently represented" in one bundle, it was disregarded in the next bundle, which brought about a corrupt ledger state from which the node was unable to recuperate. The episode drove David S\u00f8nsteb\u00f8 to say Coordicide shouldn't occur too rapidly (and unquestionably not until every one of the bugs had been resolved).
