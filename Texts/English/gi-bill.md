## What is the GI Bill?
The GI Bill is a package of education benefits from the Department of Veterans Affairs that gives active-duty military members, veterans, and at times their children and mates, money to seek after degrees and training. Millions who have served active duty, remembering for the Reserves and National Guard, have received this benefit.
## More profound definition
- **The Montgomery GI Bill:** The Montgomery GI bill is the most established of the two GI Bills, and was passed to help vets getting back from WWII go to college. The program has gone through a number of changes throughout the long term. By and large, service members must contribute $100 each month, and in the wake of finishing a term of service — around three years for active duty members, something else for Reservists — are eligible for a month to month education benefit for a long time. The benefit may not cover every single educational cost.

-  **The Post-9/11 GI Bill:** Benefits under the Post-9/11 GI Bill are accessible to service members who completed 90 days of active duty service after Sept. 10, 2001. Under this program, veterans can receive up to 100 percent of tuition and books, with lower percentages paid in the event that a service member served less time. The Post-9/11 bill likewise offers a stipend for everyday costs, in view of an area's cost of living. Everyday costs average $1,611 each month.

GI Bill benefits might be accessible to the mates and wards of service members who were killed, totally disabled, injured, abducted or taken prisoner in the line of duty. There are a few limitations on when and how long life partners and wards can utilize the benefit. Children, for instance, must utilize the benefit between the ages of 18 and 26, and can receive a maximum of 45 months of benefits. Life partners must utilize the benefit in the span of 10 years of discharge, or in something like 20 years of the date a service member is killed while on active duty.
