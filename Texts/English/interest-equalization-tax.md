At the point when the IET was first endorsed into law on July 18, 1963, it contained an expiration date of January 1, 1966. It was extended and once again extended on different occasions until its last expiration in 1974. The IET was anticipated to raise a rough sum of $30 million for every year it was in effect. With the anticipated sum — and in light of the fact that the tax was laid out as a method for decreasing the balance-of-installment deficit — by and large, the IET is considered to have worked for its planned purpose.

Before the IET was laid out, in the years somewhere in the range of 1961 and 1964, the US balance-of-installment deficit was averaging around $2.5 billion. In the years right after the IET was put into effect, the deficit dropped essentially, to $1.3. billion by 1966. The next year, the deficit rose to even more, at $3.5 billion. Yet, by 1968, the IET had canceled the deficit totally and supplanted it with a [surplus](/surplus) of $93 million.
