# Opening Cross
## What Is the Opening Cross?

The opening cross is a method the Nasdaq uses to decide the [opening price](/openingprice) for an individual share of the stocks that trade on its exchange. This method collects data on the buy and sell interest among market participants for a specific security two minutes before the market opens. The Nasdaq makes this information accessible to all investors.

As indicated by Nasdaq, the opening and closing cross processes give all investors access to a similar information, and guarantees their orders seek a similar treatment. This carries fairness and transparency into the marketplace. It additionally productively matches buyers and sellers to guarantee market [liquidity](/liquidity) (that is, the ability for investors to track down ready buyers assuming they need to rapidly sell their positions).

## Figuring out the Opening Cross

Notwithstanding, things can change in the world of share prices whenever — even when a stock exchange like Nasdaq is technically closed. Events and news declarations that happen outside those hours can make the stock open lower or higher in the morning than where it closed the other day. Subsequently, many retail and, surprisingly, professional traders won't execute orders too close to the open or close of a market, particularly with market orders (those to be executed right away), dreading volatility to either the upside or downside.

The opening cross attempts to limit such volatility, by mirroring the change in sentiment with respect to a stock between the closing price the other day and the opening price in the morning. Along these lines, it prevents amazes soon after the "market open" — that is, the point at which the Nasdaq exchange opens for business — which is normally one of the most active trading periods. This gives investors greater confidence that the quoted price decently reflects market interest conditions inside the principal minutes of the trading day.

## How the Opening Cross Works

Nasdaq's customary trading hours are between 9:30 a.m. what's more, 4:00 p.m. Eastern time, Monday through Friday. In any case, Nasdaq acknowledges trade demands for several hours after the market closes and several hours before it opens.

The opening cross interaction consolidates these solicitations, conducting a [auction process](/auction). Buyers and sellers place offers and counteroffers until prices match, bringing about a trade. The objective is to accomplish maximum execution by getting the best number of shares of a given security to trade at a single price.

Nasdaq makes the subsequent data accessible electronically. This gives market participants a greater window into the [bid-ask spread](/bid-askspread), and recognizes any [order imbalances](/order-imbalance), meaning situations where buyers and sellers can't be matched.

> Nasdaq [Market-on-Open](/marketonopen-order-moo) (MOO) orders can be placed, changed, or canceled from 7:30 a.m. until 9:28 a.m. Eastern time on non-weekend days.

## Illustration of an Opening Cross

Under the open-cross system, price matches utilize a 10% threshold, or buffer, to work out the opening price of a stock.

For instance, on the off chance that a buyer offers $100 per share for a given stock and a seller needs $110, the midpoint of the offer is $105. This midpoint is then duplicated by 10%. The subsequent $10.50 is then added to the buyer's offering price, moving it to $110.50 and deducted from the seller's price, moving it to $99.50. This lets investors know that the opening price for the shares in question is somewhere in the range of $99.50 and $110.50.

The opening cross plays out this type of calculation for all stocks and gives refreshed information to expected buyers and sellers like clockwork electronically.

Additionally, the open cross system shows point by point information about the prices at which orders are expected to [clear](/clearing) against one another, the number of paired buy-sell offers, and the imbalance between offers. As possible buyers and sellers see this data, they then place additional trades, which the system likewise consolidates.
