# Scrap Value
## What Is Scrap Value?

Scrap value is the worth of a physical asset's individual parts when the asset itself is considered as of now not usable. The individual parts, known as scrap, are worth something in the event that they can be put to different purposes. Sometimes scrap materials can be utilized with no guarantees and different times they must be handled before they can be reused. A thing's scrap value — additionally called [residual value](/residual-value), separation value, or [salvage value](/salvagevalue) — is determined by the supply and demand for the materials it tends to be broken down into.

## Everything that Scrap Value Can Say to You

In financial accounting, [capital assets](/capitalasset) or long-term assets, like machinery, vehicles, and furniture, have a [useful life](/usefullife). After the asset has carried on with its helpful life, it could be discarded. Nonetheless, given that a broken down or obsolete asset might in any case have some residual value, a few organizations can [dispose](/asset-removal plan) of the asset by selling it for its current value.

Scrap value is the estimated cost that a fixed asset can be sold for in the wake of factoring in full [depreciation](/depreciation). The asset that is discarded is normally salvaged into different parts, with each part valued and sold separately.

In the insurance industry, scrap value is the money that can be recuperated for a harmed or abandoned property. With auto or property insurance, the estimated scrap value is deducted from any loss settlement, if the insured keeps the property. For instance, expect an individual has a collision protection policy with a $2,000 [deductible](/deductible). The insured is in an accident. The loss endured amounts to $9,000, however the estimated exchange value (scrap value) is $4,500. In the event that the insured keeps the vehicle, he will receive a settlement check from the insurer for $2,500: ($9,000 - $2,000 - $4,500 = $2,500).

### Negative Scrap Value

The scrap value of an asset can be negative if the cost of discarding the asset brings about a net cash outflow that is a contributing factor in the scrap value.

For instance, consider the value of land owned by a company that just marginally went up in value toward its helpful life's end. The scrap value of the land might be negative assuming the cost of crushing any building on the land is higher than the cost of the land and the market price for the individually annihilated parts that can be sold.

## Illustration of How to Use Scrap Value

Contingent upon the method of depreciation adopted by a company, for example, the [straight-line method](/straightlinebasis) or [declining-balance method](/decliningbalancemethod), the scrap value of an asset will change.

For instance, expect a company purchases machinery worth $75,000 and estimates that the valuable life of the machinery is 8 years at a depreciable rate of 12%. Utilizing the straight-line depreciation method, the annual depreciation each year will be 12% x $75,000 = $9,000. The residual amount that the company can get assuming it discards the machinery following eight years is as per the following:

- **Scrap value** = $75,000 - ($9,000 x 8) = $3,000

On the off chance that the company, all things considered, utilized the declining-balance method of depreciation, its salvage value can be calculated as:
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td> Year</td><td> Asset Value ($)</td><td> Depreciation at 12% Rate ($)</td><td> Year-End Value ($)</td></tr>
<tr>
<td> 1</td><td> 75,000</td><td> 9,000</td><td> 66,000</td></tr>
<tr>
<td> 2</td><td> 66,000</td><td> 7,920</td><td> 58,080</td></tr>
<tr>
<td> 3</td><td> 58,080</td><td> 6,969.60</td><td> 51,110.40</td></tr>
<tr>
<td> 4</td><td> 51,110.40</td><td> 6,133.25</td><td> 44,977.15</td></tr>
<tr>
<td> 5</td><td> 44,977.15</td><td> 5,397.26</td><td> 39,579.89</td></tr>
<tr>
<td> 6</td><td> 39,579.89</td><td> 4,749.59</td><td> 34,830.30</td></tr>
<tr>
<td> 7</td><td> 34,830.30</td><td> 4,179.64</td><td> 30,650.66</td></tr>
<tr>
<td> 8</td><td> 30,650.66</td><td> 3,678.08</td><td> 26,972.58</td></tr>
<tr>
<td> Total Depreciation</td><td> </td><td> 48,027.42</td><td>  </td></tr>
</tbody>
</table>
- **Scrap value** = $75,000 - $48,027.42 = $26,972.58

The scrap value can likewise be utilized to ascertain the depreciation expense. Utilizing our model above, in the event that the company estimated a $3,000 residual value for the machinery toward the finish of 8 years, then it can work out its depreciation expense each year to be ($75,000 - $3,000)/8 = $9,000.

Having an estimate for the scrap value of a long-term asset can assist a company with sorting out its annual depreciation cost, which is an important measure since it influences the level of a company's [net income](/netincome).

## Features
- Scrap value is the worth of a physical asset's individual parts when the asset itself is considered at this point not usable.
- Scrap value is the estimated cost that a fixed asset can be sold for subsequent to factoring in full depreciation.
- Scrap value is otherwise called residual value, salvage value, or separation value.
- After a long-term asset — like machinery, vehicle, or furniture — has carried on with its valuable life, it could be discarded.
