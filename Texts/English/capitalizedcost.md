Capitalized costs are not expensed in the period they were incurred however recognized throughout some undefined time frame by means of depreciation or amortization.

## Figuring out Capitalized Costs

While capitalizing costs, a company is following the matching principle of accounting. The matching principle tries to record expenses in similar period as the connected revenues. All in all, the goal is to match the cost of an asset to the periods in which it is utilized and is thusly generating revenue, rather than when the initial expense was incurred.

The costs associated with building the warehouse, including labor costs and financing costs, can be added to the [carrying value](/carryingvalue) of the fixed asset on the balance sheet. These capitalized costs will be expensed through depreciation in ongoing periods when revenues produced from the factory output are additionally recognized.

These capitalized costs move from the balance sheet to the [income statement](/incomestatement), expensed through depreciation or amortization. For instance, the $40,000 coffee roaster from above might have a helpful life of seven years and a $5,000 salvage value toward the finish of that period. Depreciation expense connected with the coffee roaster every year would be $5,000 [($40,000 historical cost - $5,000 salvage value)/7 years].
