# Time Series
## What Is a Time Series?

A period series is a sequence of data points that happen in successive order over some period of time. This can be diverged from [cross-sectional data](/cross_sectional_analysis), which catches a point in time.

In investing, a period series tracks the movement of the picked data points, for example, a security's price, over a predefined period of time with data points recorded at customary stretches. There is no base or maximum amount of time that must be incorporated, permitting the data to be assembled in a manner that gives the data being looked for by the investor or analyst examining the activity.

## Figuring out Time Series

A period series can be taken on any variable that changes over the long haul. In investing, it is common to utilize a period series to follow the price of a security after some time. This can be followed over a shorter period of time, like the price of a security on the hour throughout a business day, or the long term, like the price of a security at close on the last day of each and every month throughout five years.

Time series analysis can be helpful to perceive how a given asset, security, or economic variable changes after some time. It can likewise be utilized to look at how the changes associated with the picked data point compare to shifts in different variables throughout a similar time span.

Time series is additionally utilized in several non-financial settings, like measuring the change in population after some time. The figure below portrays such a period series for the growth of the U.S. population throughout the century from 1900-2000.

## Time Series Analysis

Assume you wanted to examine a period series of daily closing stock prices for a given stock over a period of one year. You would get a rundown of the relative multitude of closing prices for the stock from every day for the past year and show them in sequential order. This would be a one-year daily [closing price](/closingprice) time series for the stock.

Diving a bit further, you could break down time series data with technical analysis tools to know whether the stock's time series shows any seasonality. This will assist with determining on the off chance that the stock goes through pinnacles and box at ordinary times every year. Analysis in this area would require taking the noticed prices and relating them to a picked season. This can incorporate traditional calendar seasons, like summer and winter, or retail seasons, for example, holiday seasons.

On the other hand, you can record a stock's share price changes as it connects with an economic variable, for example, the [unemployment rate](/unemploymentrate). By corresponding the data points with data connecting with the chose economic variable, you can notice designs in circumstances exhibiting dependency between the data points and the picked variable.

> One expected issue with time series data is that since every variable is dependent on its prior state or value there can be a great deal of [autocorrelation](/autocorrelation), which can bias outcomes.

## Time Series Forecasting

Time series forecasting utilizes data in regards to historical values and associated examples to foresee future activity. Most frequently, this connects with trend analysis, cyclical variance analysis, and issues of seasonality. Similarly as with all forecasting methods, achievement isn't guaranteed.

The [Box-Jenkins Model](/box-jenkins-model), for example, is a technique intended to forecast data ranges in light of contributions from a predetermined time series. It forecasts data utilizing three principles, [autoregression](/autoregressive), differencing, and [moving averages](/movingaverage). These three principles are known as p, d, and q individually. Every principle is utilized in the Box-Jenkins analysis and together they are all in all displayed as a [autoregressive integrated moving average](/autoregressive-integrated-moving-average-arima), or ARIMA (p, d, q). ARIMA can be utilized, for example, to forecast stock prices or earnings growth.

Another method, known as [rescaled range analysis](/rescaled-rangeanalysis), can be utilized to identify and assess the amount of persistence, haphazardness, or [mean reversion](/meanreversion) in time series data. The rescaled reach can be utilized to extrapolate a future value or average so that the data might be able to check whether a trend is stable or liable to reverse.

## Cross-Sectional versus Time Series Analysis

Cross-sectional analysis is one of the two general comparison methods for stock analysis. Cross-sectional analysis sees data collected at a single point in time, as opposed to throughout some stretch of time. The analysis starts with the foundation of research objectives and the definition of the variables that an analyst needs to measure. The next step is to distinguish the cross section, like a group of friends or an industry, and to set the specific point in time being assessed. The last step is to conduct analysis, in view of the cross section and the variables, and reach a resolution on the performance of a company or organization. Basically, cross-sectional analysis shows an investor which company is best given the metrics they care about.

Time series analysis, known as [trend analysis](/trendanalysis) when it applies to technical trading, centers around a single security after some time. In this case, the price is being decided with regards to its past performance. Time series analysis shows an investor whether the company is improving or more awful than before by the measures they care about. Frequently these will be works of art like [earnings per share](/eps) (EPS), debt-to-equity, [free cash flow](/freecashflow) (FCF, etc. In practice, investors will as a rule utilize a combination of time series analysis and cross-sectional analysis before pursuing a choice. For instance, taking a gander at the EPS over the long run and afterward likewise checking the industry benchmark EPS.

## Features
- Albeit cross-sectional data is viewed as something contrary to time series, the two are in many cases utilized together in practice.
- Forecasting methods utilizing time series are utilized in both fundamental and technical analysis.
- Time series analysis can be valuable to perceive how a given asset, security, or economic variable changes after some time.
- A period series is a data set that tracks a sample over the long run.
- Specifically, a period series permits one to see what factors influence certain variables from one period to another.
## FAQ
### How Do You Analyze Time Series Data?
Statistical techniques can be utilized to dissect time series data in two key ways: to generate derivations on what at least one variables mean for some variable of interest over the long run, or to forecast future trends. Dissimilar to cross-sectional data, which is basically one cut of a period series, the arrow of time permits an analyst to make more conceivable causal claims.
### How Are Time Series Used in Data Mining?
[Data mining](/datamining) is a cycle that transforms reams of raw data into helpful data. By using software to search for designs in large clumps of data, businesses can become familiar with their customers to foster more effective marketing strategies, increase sales, and decline costs. Time series, like a historical record of corporate filings or financial statements, are especially helpful here to distinguish trends and examples that might be forecasted into what's to come.
### What Are Some Examples of Time Series?
A period series can be developed by any data that is measured over the long haul at equally separated stretches. Historical stock prices, earnings, GDP, or different sequences of financial or economic data can be investigated as a period series.
### What Is the Distinction Between Cross-Sectional and Time Series Data?
A cross section takes a gander at a single point in time, which is helpful for contrasting and dissecting the effect of various factors on one another or portraying a sample. Time series includes continued sampling of similar data over the long haul. In practice, the two forms of analysis are commonly utilized; and when accessible, are utilized together.
