# Real Economic Growth Rate
## What Is the Real Economic Growth Rate?

The real economic growth rate, or real GDP growth rate, measures [economic growth](/economicgrowth), as communicated by [gross domestic product](/gdp) (GDP), starting with one period then onto the next, adjusted for inflation or deflation. At the end of the day, it uncovers changes in the value of all goods and services delivered by an economy — the economic output of a country — while accounting for price vacillations.

## Understanding the Real Economic Growth Rate

The real economic growth rate is communicated as a percentage that shows the rate of progress in a country's GDP, commonly over time. Another economic growth measure is the [gross national product](/gnp) (GNP), which is some of the time preferred on the off chance that a country's economy is substantially dependent on foreign earnings.

The real GDP growth rate is a more helpful measure than the nominal GDP growth rate since it considers the impact of [inflation](/inflation) on economic data. The real economic growth rate is a "steady dollar" figure, staying away from the distortion from periods of extreme inflation or [deflation](/deflation) to give a more reliable measure.

## Ascertaining the Real Economic Growth Rate

GDP is the sum of consumer spending, business spending, government spending, and total [exports](/trade), minus total [imports](/import). The calculation for considering in inflation to show up at the real GDP figure is as follows:

**Real GDP = GDP/(1 + inflation since base year)**

The [base year](/base-year-examination) is a designated year, refreshed periodically by the government and utilized as a comparison point for economic data like the GDP. The calculation for the real GDP growth rate is based on real GDP, as follows:

**Real GDP growth rate = (latest year's real GDP - the last year's real GDP)/the previous year's real GDP**

Real economic growth can likewise be calculated by backing inflation out of nominal GDP. Nominal economic growth is comprehensive of inflation, while real economic growth isn't. This calculation is finished by figuring in a GDP deflator. A GDP deflator is the quotient of nominal GDP separated by real GDP partitioned by 100, so this method is just valuable in deciding real GDP on the off chance that the GDP deflator is as of now known.

**Real GDP = (Nominal GDP/GDP Deflator) *100**

## How the Real Economic Growth Rate Is Used

A country's real economic growth rate is useful to government policymakers while making [fiscal policy](/fiscalpolicy) choices. These choices may be applied to spike economic growth or control inflation.

Real economic growth rate figures fill two needs:

1. The real economic growth rate figure is utilized to compare the current rate of economic growth with previous periods to ascertain the general trend in growth over time.
1. The real economic growth rate is useful while contrasting the growth rates of comparative economies that have substantially various rates of inflation. A comparison of the nominal GDP growth rate for a country with simply 1% inflation to the nominal GDP growth rate for a country with 10% inflation would be substantially deceptive on the grounds that nominal GDP doesn't adjust for inflation.

Economic growth rates are additionally helpful for businesses and investors. An organization or company hoping to venture into new markets might leverage GDP data to better figure out growth opportunities in certain countries. On the other hand, an investor seeking to broaden into emerging markets might be fit to utilize GDP to comprehend geographical areas they might receive the best growth.

## Special Considerations

The GDP growth rate changes during the four phases of the [business cycle](/businesscycle): top, [contraction](/contraction), trough, and expansion. In an extending economy, the GDP growth rate will be positive since businesses are developing and making position for greater productivity.

In any case, assuming that the growth rate surpasses 3% or 4%, economic growth might slow down. A period of contraction will follow when businesses hold off on investing and hiring, as this will bring about consumers having less money to spend. On the off chance that the growth rate turns negative, the country will be in [recession](/recession).

GDP is calculated as the sum of public consumption, domestic investment, government spending, and net imports. It is workable for a country to encounter negative growth in one area yet encountering net real economic growth. A few specific transactions are excluded from both nominal and real GDP.

Real economic growth just reports the sale of end results; goods in production (for example a vehicle that is somewhat gathered) are not counted. Real economic growth likewise prohibits the sale of utilized goods, the sale of goods delivered outside of the United States, financial transactions (for example stocks and bonds), and volunteer services.

## Features

- Real GDP can be calculated by adjusting nominal GDP by inflation.
- Real economic growth is utilized by policymakers to decide growth over time by looking at GDP from changed time spans.
