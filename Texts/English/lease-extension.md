## What Is a Lease Extension?

A lease extension alludes to a legal agreement that broadens the term of an existing lease or rental agreement. Extensions are not a requirement in a business relationship but rather are frequently granted just before an original agreement is set to lapse. They are common in relationships among landlords and tenants of commercial and residential property, or between parties who lease vehicles, machinery, plants, and equipment.

## How Lease Extensions Work

A lease is a contract that requires the [lessee](/lessee), or the client, to pay the [lessor](/lessor), or owner, for the utilization of an asset for a predetermined period of time. Leases are common for rental properties or for the utilization of equipment, vehicles, or machinery and plants. At the point when the asset being leased is unmistakable property, it might likewise be alluded to as a rental agreement.

At the point when a lease terminates, both the lessor and the lessee have a couple of options accessible. The lessee can clear or surrender access to the property, or the two parties can consent to a lease renewal. This option might require some renegotiation of the terms of the new lease. The last option is to expand the lease. The terms of the original lease are typically still in force, yet the time period for an extension will in general be more limited. So on account of a [residential rental property](/residentialrentalproperty), the landlord might keep a portion of the original lease terms like the rental amount due, however expand the period of tenancy for the lessee.

The lease extension is a conventional document that must incorporate certain subtleties. It ought to name every one of the parties engaged with the agreement, as well as the dates on which the extension starts and finishes. The extension document ought to likewise reference the prior agreement being extended. Some lease extensions — especially in real estate — are granted automatically. They might indicate a certain timeframe for the extension or may consider the utilization of the property on a [month-to-month](/month-to-month-tenancy) basis.

## Special Considerations

Lease extensions are an important part of the lessor-lessee relationship as they reduce the [risk](/risk) required for each party. For instance, a landlord who consents to a lease extension can keep the original lease terms unblemished including any provisions about notices to empty. This means the tenant needs to give prior written notice before abandoning the property. The landlord can have confidence there are no curve balls, and will not need to risk a vacant unit. Essentially, a lease extension can give tenants some stability. With a legitimate extension in place, tenants will not need to surrender their units after the lease lapses.

Businesses enter lease agreements and consent to lease extension agreements for different reasons. The primary justification for leasing an asset instead of buying it is risk management. A business might choose to lease a bundle of land so it is protected from the risk of changes in land prices. This permits the business to zero in on its core capability as opposed to real estate.

One more justification behind leasing is to improve on disposal. A construction company, for example, may choose to lease a piece of heavy equipment, instead of buy it, so it doesn't need to deal with selling the equipment after it is not generally required. A lessee might pay more each hour to utilize the equipment, however this can be beneficial on the off chance that it saves time and the cost of selling the equipment sometime in the future.

## Instances of Lease Extensions

A lease extension might be executed between a [landlord](/landlord) and a tenant. In this case, in the event that the two players decide to proceed with the tenancy, the landlord might issue a lease extension when the original lease is set to lapse.

Lease extensions may likewise be granted to lessees via vehicle sales centers. We should expect a consumer leases a vehicle for a very long time. After that period, the lessee might choose to buy or start one more lease for a brand new vehicle. The dealership might grant an extension of the original lease in the event that the new replacement vehicle isn't yet accessible.
