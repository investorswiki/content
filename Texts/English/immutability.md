# Immutability
Immutability means unchangeability. In computer science, an immutable item is an article whose state can't be altered after its creation.
Immutability is one of the key highlights of Bitcoin and blockchain technology. Immutable transactions make it inconceivable for any entity (for instance, a government or corporation) to control, supplant, or distort data stored on the network.
Since all historical transactions can be audited anytime, immutability enables a high degree of data integrity.
The immutability of public blockchains can upgrade the current trust and audit system. It can reduce the time and cost of audits since checking data turns out to be a lot easier or successfully repetitive.
Immutability can likewise increase the overall productivity of numerous businesses by furnishing them with the opportunity to keep a full historical record of their business processes. Immutability can likewise give lucidity to numerous business questions, as it enables a verifiable, shared source of truth.
While immutability is one of the core benefits of Bitcoin and blockchain, the data stored on blockchains aren't totally strong to weaknesses. In the event that a malicious entertainer can gather the majority of the network [hash rate](/hash-rate), it could change the generally immutable data in an attack called the 51% attack.
In such a scenario, the attacker would have the option to prevent new transactions from acquiring affirmations or even reverse transactions completely. Be that as it may, on account of Bitcoin, dealing with this amount of hashing power would be tremendously costly, requiring substantial hardware and considerable amounts of power.
Then again, Proof of Work networks with lower hash rates are vulnerable to such an attack, as gathering the required amount of hashing power to attack the network isn't a particularly unreasonable accomplishment.
