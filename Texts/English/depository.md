## What Is a Depository?

The term depository alludes to a facility wherein something is deposited for storage or protecting or an institution that acknowledges currency deposits from customers, for example, a [bank](/bank) or a savings association. A depository can be an organization, bank, or institution that holds [securities](/security) and aids the trading of securities. A depository gives security and [liquidity](/liquidity) in the market, utilizes money deposited for safekeeping to loan to other people, invests in different securities, and offers a funds [transfer](/transfer) system. A depository must return the deposit in a similar condition upon request.

## Grasping Depositories

As referenced above, depositories are buildings, offices, and warehouses that permit consumers and businesses to deposit money, securities, and other important [assets](/resource) for safekeeping. Depositories might incorporate banks, safehouses, vaults, [financial institutions](/financialinstitution), and different organizations.

Depositories fill various needs for the overall population. To begin with, they dispose of the [risk](/risk) of holding physical assets to the owner. For example, banks other financial institutions give consumers a place to deposit money into time and demand deposit accounts. A [time deposit](/timedeposit) is an interest-bearing account and has a specific date of maturity, for example, a [certificate of deposit (CD)](/certificateofdeposit), while a [demand deposit](/demanddeposit) account holds funds until they should be removed, for example, a checking or savings account. Deposits can likewise come as securities like stocks or bonds. At the point when these assets are deposited, the institution holds the securities in electronic form otherwise called [book-entry form](/bookentrysecurities), or in dematerialized or paper format like a physical certificate.

These organizations likewise assist with making liquidity in the market. Customers give their money to a financial institution with the conviction the company holds it and gives it back when the customer needs it back. These institutions acknowledge customers' money and pay [interest](/interest) on their deposits after some time. While holding the customers' money, the institutions loan it to others as [mortgage](/mortgage) or business loans, generating more interest on the money than the interest paid to customers.

## Special Considerations

Transferring the ownership of [shares](/shares) starting with one investor's account then onto the next account when a [trade](/trade) is executed is one of the primary functions of a depository. This diminishes the paperwork for executing a trade and velocities up the transfer cycle. One more function of a depository is the elimination of risk of holding the securities in physical form like theft, loss, fraud, damage, or defer in deliveries.

An investor who needs to purchase precious metals can purchase them in [physical bullion](/bullion) or paper form. Gold or silver bans or coins can be purchased from a dealer and kept with a third-party depository. Investing in gold through [futures contracts](/futurescontract) isn't equivalent to the investor possessing gold. All things considered, gold is owed to the investor.

A trader or hedger hoping to take genuine delivery on a futures contract must initially lay out a long (buy) futures position and hold on until a short (seller) tenders a notice to delivery. With gold futures contracts, the seller is resolving to deliver the gold to the buyer at the contract [expiry date](/expirationdate). The seller must have the metal — in this case, gold — in an approved depository. This is addressed by holding [COMEX](/comex) approved electronic depository warrants which are required to make or take delivery.

## Types of Depositories

The three fundamental types of depository institutions are [credit unions](/creditunion), savings institutions, and commercial banks. The primary source of funding for these institutions is through deposits from customers. Customer deposits and accounts are insured by the [Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC)](/fdic) up to certain limits.

These institutions center basically around consumer mortgage lending yet may likewise offer [credit cards](/creditcard) and commercial loans.
