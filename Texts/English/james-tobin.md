## Public Service

Applying the study of economics to certifiable issues directed James Tobin's work all through his career and he once noted, "Economics has forever been a policy-situated subject. Except if it is applied to the dire policy issues of the day, it will end up being a sterile exercise, without use or interest."

In 1961, President Kennedy welcomed James Tobin to act as one of three economists on his Council of Economic Advisers. The group helped the [executive branch](/separation-abilities) on economic policy issues and distributed the **1962** **Economic Report**, a statement of stabilization and growth policies known as the "new economics".

## Portfolio Selection Theory

James Tobin received the Nobel Prize in economics in 1981 for his analysis of financial markets and their relations to expenditure choices, employment, production, and prices.

His portfolio selection theory characterizes how financial markets influence the investment choices of families and businesses in view of weighted risks and expected rates of return. Tobin underscored that these microeconomic choices made inside a home or business influence macroeconomic aggregates, for example, overall [consumption](/purchaser spending), employment, and inflation.

## The Tobin Tax

James Tobin developed the "Tobin Tax" in response to the collapse of the Bretton Woods agreement in 1971. Unpredictable floating currency exchange rates supplanted fixed currency exchange rates once founded on the U.S. dollar's connect to a gold standard.

As money moved rapidly in an environment of shifting rates, Tobin proposed to reduce this volatility with a small tax imposed on each transaction of exchange starting with one currency then onto the next. This tax would deter short-term currency speculation and cushion the effect of such speculation on small [developing economies](/emergingmarketeconomy), which couldn't contend with large financial institutions.

The "Tobin Tax" was not officially executed or utilized until after James Tobin's death in 2002 and Tobin's original purpose of stopping currency speculation has been obscured by thoughts of involving the tax to globally raise revenue for economic and social development.
