# Time Charter Equivalent (TCE)
## What Is Time Charter Equivalent (TCE)?

Time charter equivalent (TCE) is a shipping industry measure used to work out the average daily [revenue](/revenue) performance of a vessel. Time [charter](/corporatecharter) equivalent is calculated by taking voyage revenues, deducting voyage expense, including channel, shelter and port costs, and afterward partitioning the total by the round-trip voyage duration in days. It gives shipping companies a device to measure period-to-period changes.

## Understanding Time Charter Equivalent

The time charter equivalent is calculated as:

>
> (Voyage Revenues - Voyage Expenses)
>
> Round Trip Duration in Days
>

It can likewise be calculated on an every day basis in view of period, spot and [weighted average](/weightedaverage).

TCE revenue is utilized as a measure of performance to follow performance starting with one period then onto the next however it is a non-GAAP measure. Companies might in any case decide to report it in their [financial statements](/financial-statements) as a reference.

The TCE is involved via cargo brokers in the shipping industry to introduce chartering opportunities to shipowners. Chartering opportunities vary widely in possible revenues and costs. The TCE is a method for depicting these opportunities in a normalized manner — basically dollars each day — making examinations more straightforward for shipowners.

## Why Per-Day Costs Matter

The single biggest variable costs of a voyage are fuel and the cost connected with group upkeep, and this changes in direct relationship to the speed at which the voyage is performed. The speed of the loaded part of the voyage is agreed with the charterer when the voyage charter is negotiated. The ship owner or on the other hand, in the event that there is one, the time charterer picks the speed of the vessel for the stabilizer voyage (when the ship is vacant of cargo) cruising the ship to a position where it can load a cargo for the voyage charter. In the two cases the more slow the ship, the lower the fuel cost as consumption will be lower and the quicker the ship, then the higher the fuel consumption and thusly the cost.

The more slow a ship cruises, the more extended the voyage (more days) however the less fuel it consumes. So the calculation of the TCE will be impacted in two ways (as the Freight lump sum continues as before). The net freight will go up in light of the savings made on the fuel and yet, it will be isolated by additional days bringing the TCE down. In this way a ship ought to possibly go more slow on the off chance that the cost of fuel, saved by more slow cruising, counterbalances the reduction of the TCE brought about by the increase in the number of days the voyage endured. At last, on the off chance that the fuel cost saving legitimizes more slow cruising, the owner will shift focus over to the lost opportunity of the days that might have been spent on the next voyage compared with the improvement in TCE from more slow steaming on the current voyage. This is a vital point however the decision must be taken toward the beginning of a voyage.

## Features
- Seeing TCE gives shipping companies a method for following period-by-period changes.
- Time charter equivalent (TCE) is a method for deciding the net profit or loss of operating a vessel each day.
- Voyage expenses are essentially fuel and the costs connected with keeping up with the group locally available in terms of salary yet in addition food and quarter.
