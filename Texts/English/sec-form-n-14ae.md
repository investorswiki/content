# SEC Form N-14AE
## What Is SEC Form N-14AE?

SEC Form N-14AE is no longer utilized for registration filings to the [Securities and Exchange Commission](/sec) (SEC) regarding open-end funds. This obsolete form was supplanted with [SEC Form N-14](/sec-form-n-14).

## Understanding SEC Form N-14AE

SEC Form N-14AE was made to fulfill SEC Rule 488, which governs the effective date for registration of securities by [open-end management investment companies](/openendmanagementcompany).

It was a statement required of open-end funds registering securities with automatic effectiveness under Rule 488. That rule was itself a consequence of Rule 145, which made the protections of the [Securities Act of 1933](/securitiesact1933) applicable to investors offered securities in recently excluded situations like mergers and business combination transactions.

Rule 488 determines standards for effective registration dates of securities issued in transactions under Rule 145.

The SEC announced in 2006 that it would suspend SEC forms N-14AE and N-14AE/An and that businesses formerly required to file those forms could promptly begin filing under SEC forms N-14 and N-14/A, where space was accessible to make a registration statement under Rule 488.

Recent Form N-14/A submissions are posted online by the SEC, as are Form N-14 submissions.

### Sections in a Registration Statement

Each [registration](/registration) statement, of which SEC Form N-14AE was one type, consists of two sections.

- The [prospectus](/prospectus), which must be made accessible to prospective investors. This contains definite exposures about the company's business, its assets, its management, its possibilities, and any risks it knows about that could influence the company's performance.

In addition to company filings, the database includes information given by mutual funds, money market funds, exchange-traded funds (ETFs), variable annuities, and individuals.
