# Current Yield
## What Is the Current Yield?

Current yield is a speculation's annual income (interest or dividends) separated by the [current price](/currentprice) of the security. This measure inspects the current price of a bond, as opposed to taking a gander at its [face value](/facevalue). Current yield addresses the return an investor would hope to earn, if the owner purchased the bond and held it for a year. In any case, current yield isn't the [actual return](/actualreturn) an investor gets on the off chance that he holds a bond until maturity.

## Breaking Down Current Yield

Current yield is most frequently applied to bond investments, which are securities that are issued to an investor at a [par value](/parvalue) (face amount) of $1,000. A bond conveys a [coupon](/coupon) amount of interest that is stated on the face of the bond certificate, and bonds are traded between investors. Since the market price of a bond changes, an investor might purchase a bond at a discount (not as much as par value) or a premium (more than par value), and the purchase price of a bond influences the current yield.

## How Current Yield Is Calculated

On the off chance that an investor purchases a 6% coupon rate bond for a discount of $900, the investor earns annual interest income of ($1,000 X 6%), or $60. The current yield is ($60)/($900), or 6.67%. The $60 in annual interest is fixed, no matter what the price paid for the bond. Then again, on the off chance that an investor purchases a bond at a premium of $1,100, the current yield is ($60)/($1,100), or 5.45%. The investor paid something else for the premium bond that pays a similar dollar amount of interest, in this way the current yield is lower.

Current yield can likewise be calculated for stocks by taking the [dividends](/profit) received for a stock and partitioning the amount by the stock's current market price.

## Figuring in Yield to Maturity

[Yield to maturity (YTM)](/yieldtomaturity) is the total return earned on a bond, expecting that the bond owner holds the bond until the maturity date. For instance, we should expect that the 6% coupon rate bond purchased for a discount of $900, will mature in the 10 years. To compute YTM, an investor makes an assumption about a discount rate, with the goal that the future principal and interest payments are discounted to introduce value.

In this model, the investor gets $60 in annual interest payments for a considerable length of time. At maturity, the owner gets the par value of $1,000, and the investor perceives a $100 capital gain. The current value of the interest payments and the capital gain are added to figure the bond's YTM. On the off chance that the bond is purchased at a premium, the YTM calculation incorporates a [capital loss](/capitalloss) when the bond matures at par value.

## Features
- Since the market price of a bond might change, investors might purchase bonds at either a discount or a premium, where the purchase price of a bond influences the current yield.
- In fixed income investing, a bond's current yield is a venture's annual income, including both interest payments and dividends payments, which are then separated by the current price of the security.
- With equities, the current yield can likewise be calculated by taking the dividends received for a stock and isolating that amount by the stock's current market price.
