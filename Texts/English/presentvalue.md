# Present Value (PV)
## What Is Present Value (PV)?

Present value (PV) is the current value of a future sum of money or stream of [cash flows](/cashflow) given a predefined [rate of return](/rateofreturn). Future cash flows are discounted at the discount rate, and the higher the [discount rate](/discountrate), the lower the current value representing things to come cash flows. Deciding the suitable discount rate is the key to appropriately esteeming future cash flows, whether they be [earnings](/earnings) or debt obligations.

## Grasping Present Value (PV)

Present value is the concept that states an amount of money today is worth more than that equivalent amount from now on. At the end of the day, money received in what's in store isn't worth however much an equivalent amount received today.

Getting $1,000 today is worth more than $1,000 a long time from now. Why? An investor can invest the $1,000 today and presumably earn a rate of return throughout the next five years. Present value considers any interest rate an investment could earn.

For instance, on the off chance that an investor receives $1,000 today and can earn a rate of return of 5% each year, the $1,000 today is certainly worth more than getting $1,000 a long time from now. In the event that an investor hung tight five years for $1,000, there would be an opportunity cost or the investor would miss out on the rate of return for the five years.

## Inflation and Purchasing Power

[Inflation](/inflation) is the cycle wherein prices of goods and services rise over the long haul. Assuming you receive money today, you can buy goods at the present prices. Presumably, inflation will make the price of goods rise from here on out, which would bring down the purchasing power of your money.

Money not spent today could be expected to lose value later on by some implied annual rate, which could be inflation or the rate of return assuming the money was invested. The current value formula discounts the future value to the present dollars by factoring in the implied annual rate from one or the other inflation or the rate of return that could be accomplished assuming a sum was invested.

## Discount Rate for Finding Present Value

The discount rate is the investment rate of return that is applied to the current value calculation. All in all, the discount rate would be the renounced rate of return in the event that an investor decided to acknowledge an amount in the future versus a similar amount today. The discount rate that is picked for the current value calculation is profoundly subjective in light of the fact that it's the expected rate of return you'd receive assuming you had invested the present dollars for a while.

Much of the time, a [risk-free rate of return](/risk) not entirely set in stone and utilized as the discount rate, which is frequently called the [hurdle rate](/hurdlerate). The rate addresses the rate of return that the investment or project would have to earn to worth seek after. A U.S. Treasury bond rate is many times utilized as the risk-free rate since Treasuries are backed by the U.S. government. Thus, for instance, in the event that a two-year Treasury paid 2% interest or [yield](/yield), the investment would have to essentially earn over 2% to legitimize the risk.

The discount rate is the sum of the time value and an important interest rate that numerically increments future value in nominal or absolute terms. On the other hand, the discount rate is utilized to sort out future value in terms of present value, permitting a lender to choose the fair amount of any future earnings or obligations comparable to the current value of the capital. "Discount" alludes to future value being discounted to introduce value.

The calculation of discounted or present value is critical in numerous financial calculations. For instance, [net present value](/npv), bond yields, and pension obligations all depend on discounted or present value. Learning how to utilize a financial calculator to create present value calculations can assist you with concluding whether you ought to acknowledge such proposals as a cash rebate, 0% financing on the purchase of a vehicle, or pay [points on a mortgage](/points).

1. Input the future amount that you hope to receive in the numerator of the formula.
1. Decide the interest rate that you hope to receive among now and the future and plug the rate as a decimal in place of "r" in the denominator.
1. Input the time span as the type "n" in the denominator. Thus, if you need to work out the current value of an amount you hope to receive in three years, you would connect the number three for "n" in the denominator.
1. There are a number of online calculators, including this current value calculator.

## Future Value versus Present Value

A comparison of present value with [future value](/futurevalue) (FV) best illustrates the principle of the time value of money and the requirement for charging or paying extra risk-based interest rates. Basically, the money today is worth more than a similar money tomorrow in view of the progression of time. Future value can connect with the future cash inflows from investing the present money, or the future payment required to repay money borrowed today.

Future value (FV) is the value of a current [asset](/asset) at a predefined date later on based on an assumed rate of growth. The FV equation assumes a steady rate of growth and a single upfront payment left immaculate however long the investment would last. The FV calculation permits investors to foresee, with changing degrees of exactness, the amount of profit that can be generated by various investments.

Present value (PV) is the current value of a future sum of money or stream of cash flows given a predetermined rate of return. Present value takes the future value and applies a discount rate or the interest rate that could be earned whenever invested. Future value lets you know an investment worth in the future while the current value lets you know the amount you'd require in the present dollars to earn a specific amount from here on out.

## Analysis of Present Value

As stated before, computing present value includes making an assumption that a rate of return could be earned on the funds throughout the time span. In the discussion above, we checked out at one investment throughout one year. Nonetheless, in the event that a company is choosing to proceed a series of projects that has an alternate rate of return for every year and each project, the current value turns out to be less certain in the event that those expected rates of return are not sensible. It's important to consider that in any investment decision, no interest rate is guaranteed, and inflation can disintegrate the rate of return on an investment.

## Illustration of Present Value

Suppose you have the decision of being paid $2,000 today earning 3% annually or $2,200 one year from now. Which is the best option?

- Utilizing the current value formula, the calculation is $2,200/(1 +. 03)^1^ = $2135.92
- PV = $2,135.92, or the base amount that you would should be paid today to have $2,200 one year from now. All in all, on the off chance that you were paid $2,000 today and based on a 3% interest rate, the amount wouldn't be sufficient to give you $2,200 one year from now.
- On the other hand, you could compute the future value of the $2,000 today in a year's time: 2,000 x 1.03 = $2,060.

Present value gives a basis to evaluating the fairness of any future financial benefits or liabilities. For instance, a future cash rebate discounted to introduce value might be worth having a possibly higher purchase price. A similar financial calculation applies to 0% financing while buying a vehicle.

Paying some interest on a lower retail cost might figure out better for the buyer than paying zero interest on a higher retail cost. Paying mortgage points currently in exchange for lower mortgage payments later seems OK provided that the current value representing things to come mortgage savings is greater than the mortgage points paid today.

## Features
- Present value states that an amount of money today is worth more than a similar amount from here on out.
- Unspent money today could lose value later on by an implied annual rate due to inflation or the rate of return in the event that the money was invested.
- All in all, present value shows that money received in what's to come isn't worth however much an equivalent amount received today.
- Computing present value includes assuming that a rate of return could be earned on the funds over the period.
## FAQ
### How Do You Calculate Present Value?
Present value is calculated by taking the future cashflows expected from an investment and discounting them back to the current day. To do as such, the investor needs three key data points: the expected cashflows, the number of years wherein the cashflows will be paid, and their discount rate. The discount rate is a vital factor in impacting the current value, with higher discount rates leading to a lower present value, as well as the other way around. Utilizing these factors, investors can compute present value utilizing the formula:<span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mtable

### What Are Some Examples of Present Value?
To illustrate, consider a scenario where you hope to earn a $5,000 lump sum payment in five years' time. Assuming the discount rate is 8.25%, you need to understand what that payment will be worth today so you work out the PV = $5000/(1.0825)5 = 3,363.80.
### Why Is Present Value Important?
Present value is important on the grounds that it permits investors to judge whether the price they pay for an investment is fitting. For instance, in our previous model, having a 12% discount rate would reduce the current value of the investment to just $1,802.39. In that scenario, we would be exceptionally hesitant to pay more than that amount for the investment, since our current value calculation shows that we could find better opportunities somewhere else. Present value calculations like this play a critical job in areas like investment analysis, risk management, and financial planning.
