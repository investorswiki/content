## What Is a Discouraged Worker?

A discouraged worker is a person who is eligible for employment and can work, but who is currently unemployed and has not endeavored to track down employment in the last a month. Discouraged workers usually have given up on looking for a job because they found no suitable employment options or failed to secure a job when they applied.

## Understanding Discouraged Workers

The U.S. Department of Labor's [Bureau of Labor Statistics](/bls) (BLS) characterizes discouraged workers as "those persons not in the labor force who need and are available for work, and who have searched for a job sometime in the prior 12 months, but were not counted as unemployed because they had not looked for work in the a month going before the survey." That's what the BLS adds "discouraged workers were not currently searching for work specifically because they accepted no jobs were available for them or there were none for which they would qualify."

As discouraged workers are done searching for employment, they are not counted as active in the labor force. This means that the headline [unemployment rate](/unemploymentrate), which depends exclusively on the active labor force number, doesn't consider the number of discouraged workers in the country.

### Causes for Worker Discouragement

The causes for worker discouragement are complex and shifted. At times, workers fall out of the workforce because they are not equipped to deal with mechanical change in their working environment. An illustration of this occurred during the [Great Recession](/great-recession), while the manufacturing sector shed senior staff unable to deal with the new computer numeric control (CNC) machines, used for cutting wood and other hard materials, as per a report by The Washington Post.

Nick Eberstadt of the American Enterprise Institute (AEI) has accused the "departure from work" on a lack of supply of skilled, able, and willing workers and a rising dependence on [disability insurance](/disability-insurance). His theory is backed by Alan Krueger's 2016 research, which found that self-reported pain and disability insurance was higher among discouraged workers.

Other potential purposes behind discouraged workers include limitations that limit employment options for formerly incarcerated individuals and jobs that are perceived as being unavailable to a specific orientation.

## BLS Accounting for Discouraged Workers

To better examine unemployment in the U.S., the BLS made alternative measures for the underutilization of labor. U-4, U-5, and U-6 capture discouraged workers.

- U-4 equals the total number of unemployed individuals, plus discouraged workers.
- U-5 equals the total number of unemployed individuals, discouraged workers, and other imperceptibly joined workers.
- U-6 equals the total number of unemployed individuals, all barely appended workers, plus individuals employed parttime who are seeking full-time employment.

At the close of 2019, the U-4 rate, seasonally adjusted, was 3.7%, just a shade higher than the headline, or official, unemployment rate of 3.5%. Fast forward a year to December 2020, and the U-4 rate, seasonally adjusted, was 7.1%, compared with the official rate of 6.7%.

Figures from 2020 were altogether affected by that year's economic crisis. In any case, the current U-4 number isn't so terrible as the 2009 annual average, which remained at 9.7% in the pains of the Great Recession.

## Helping the Discouraged

The U-4 rate assists with quantifying the number of discouraged workers that exist and keep tabs on the change in their numbers. Further analysis of age groups, race, and geographic location is likewise made conceivable by U-4 measures.

Policymakers at federal, state and neighborhood levels can use these numbers to formulate plans to help them. Such plans might comprise of training programs, education [subsidies](/subsidy), or [tax credits](/taxcredit) for companies that hire long-term unemployed individuals.

## Features
- Discouraged workers are not included in the headline unemployment number. All things considered, they are included in the U-4, U-5, and U-6 unemployment measures.
- Discouraged workers are workers who have stopped searching for work because they found no suitable employment options or failed to be shortlisted while going after a position.
- The causes for worker discouragement are complex and changed.
