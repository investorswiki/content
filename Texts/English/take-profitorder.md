# Take-Profit Order - T/P
## What is a Take-Profit Order (T/P)

A take-profit order (T/P) is a type of [limit order](/limitorder) that specifies the exact price at which to close out an open position for a profit. In the event that the price of the security doesn't arrive at the limit price, the take-profit order doesn't get filled.

## Essentials of a Take-Profit Order

Most traders use take-profit orders in conjunction with [stop-loss orders](/stop-lossorder) (S/L) to deal with their open positions. On the off chance that the security rises to the take-profit point, the T/P order is executed and the position is closed for a gain. On the off chance that the security tumbles to the stop-loss point, the S/L order is executed and the position is closed for a loss. The difference between the market price and these two points helps characterize the trade's [risk-to-remunerate ratio](/riskrewardratio).

The benefit of utilizing a take-profit order is that the trader doesn't need to worry about physically executing a trade or re-thinking themselves. Then again, take-profit orders are executed at the best possible price no matter what the [underlying security's](/underlying-security) behavior. The stock could start to breakout higher, but the T/P order might execute at the absolute starting point of the breakout, resulting in high [opportunity costs](/opportunitycost).

Take-profit orders are best utilized by short-term traders interested in dealing with their risk. This is on the grounds that they can get out of a trade when their planned profit target is reached and not risk a possible future downturn in the market. Traders with a long-term strategy don't incline toward such orders since it cuts into their profits.

Take-profit orders are often placed at levels that are defined by other forms of technical analysis, including chart pattern analysis and support and resistance levels, or utilizing money management techniques, for example, [the Kelly Criterion](/kellycriterion). Many trading system developers likewise use take-profit orders while placing automated trades since they can be obvious and act as a great [risk management](/riskmanagement) technique.

## Take-Profit Order Example

Suppose that a trader spots a [ascending triangle](/ascendingtriangle) chart pattern and opens a new [long position](/long). Assuming the stock has a breakout, the trader expects that it will rise to 15 percent from its current levels. On the off chance that the stock doesn't breakout, the trader wants to quickly exit the position and continue on toward the next opportunity. The trader might create a take-profit order that is 15 percent higher than the market price to automatically sell when the stock arrives at that level. Simultaneously, they might place a stop-loss order that's five percent below the current [market price](/market-price).

The combination of the take-profit and stop-loss order creates a 5:15 risk-to-compensate ratio, which is ideal expecting that the chances of arriving at every outcome are equivalent, or on the other hand assuming the chances are slanted toward the breakout scenario.

By placing the take-profit order, the trader doesn't need to worry about diligently tracking the stock throughout the day or re-thinking themselves concerning how high the stock might follow the [breakout](/breakout). There is an obvious risk-to-compensate ratio and the trader knows what to expect before the trade even happens.
