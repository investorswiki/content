# Foreclosure Crisis
## What Was the Foreclosure Crisis?

The foreclosure crisis was a period of radically raised property seizures in the U.S. housing market somewhere in the range of 2007 and 2010. The foreclosure crisis was one part of the financial crisis and [Great Recession](/great-recession) that developed during this period. The excessive extension of mortgage credit, muddled schemes of mortgage debt securitization, and fast increase in the number of foreclosures (in an industry poorly ready to handle them all) each contributed to the crisis.

## Figuring out the Foreclosure Crisis

[Foreclosure](/foreclosure) is the legal cycle that happens when a homeowner neglects to make full [principal](/principal) and [interest](/interest) payments on their mortgage. On the off chance that this issue isn't redressed inside a predetermined [grace period](/grace_period), the lender has the option to expel the homeowner, assume command over the property, and afterward sell it off.

The foreclosure crisis crested in Sept. 2010, when roughly 120,000 homes were repossessed in a one-month period. In any case, its underlying foundations lay in a downturn in the housing market that started right on time in 2007 and bloomed into a crisis when [Lehman Brothers](/lehman-brothers) pronounced [bankruptcy](/bankruptcy) in Sept. 2008.

### Excess Mortgage Credit

Excessively low interest rates due to expansionary monetary policy at the U.S. Federal Reserve, combined with favorable to housing policy by the executive branch, during the 2000s made a boom in home buying and the extension of credit for home mortgages. This prompted generally crude or nonexistent oversight of [underwriting](/underwriting) processes as [commission](/commission)- hungry [lenders](/lender) foolishly doled out crowds of riskier [subprime mortgages](/subprime_mortgage) based on some of the time predatory conditions to individuals with low [income](/income) and creditworthiness. This cycle was worked with by the innovation of mortgage debt securitization that allowed lenders to give the risks of these loans to investors and loan.

The volume of mortgage debt relative to the economy's ability to quickly repay rose. Total mortgage debt in the U.S. outperformed U.S. [Gross Domestic Product (GDP)](/gdp) beginning in the first quarter 2008. Beforehand this ratio (total mortgage debt to GDP) had run between around 30% to 60% for the greater part of the twentieth century.

### Debt Securitization

[Mortgage banks](/mortgagebanker) regularly stashed fees and afterward speedily sold the loans on to frequently distracted [financial institutions](/financialinstitution), which failed to do suitable [due diligence](/duediligence) on the loans. The mortgages were securitized into Mortgage-Backed Securities and more complex instruments, which were accepted at an opportunity to be an adequate tool to deal with the default risk of any one mortgage by consolidating it with different loans to successfully pool the risk and afterward convey it across all holders of the issued security.

Notwithstanding not conclusively being an adequate risk management tool (especially when essentially all home prices fell and defaults became widespread) the securitization of the loans by and large darkened the connections between who held the loans and the borrowers.

### Increase in Foreclosures

As the Federal Reserve hit the monetary brakes and slow down the huge flow of credit expansion in 2006, issues began to become apparent in the industry. More tight credit conditions made it harder for lenders to keep on expanding risky mortgages and made existing mortgages with adjustable interest rates more expensive for existing borrowers. Somewhere in the range of 2006 and 2008, delinquency rates on home loans dramatically increased and would keep on moving through 2010 as the crisis spread.

When [defaults](/default2) rose, banks unexpectedly found themselves facing so many foreclosure events that they couldn't handle them productively. Prior to and during the crisis, mortgage servicing companies handled large numbers of loans without adequate audit of the data going with them. It was generally accepted that defaults on home loans and the subsequent foreclosures would be individual or at most neighborhood events, which could undoubtedly be handled and liquidated in the course of lenders' and loan servicers' normal operations.

Hurried securitization during the housing boom had, generally speaking, prompted poor record-keeping of the genuine ownership of some random mortgage loan. At times, banks failed to start foreclosures on homes for quite a long time after homeowners had stopped making payments. Record-keeping processes had become so messy that banks couldn't generally be certain they really owned mortgages for properties being dispossessed, and, surprisingly, now and again abandoned mortgage loans that they didn't legally claim.

Many bank employees essentially marked all that ran over their work areas, expecting all desk work to be authentic. When the volume of foreclosures rose essentially, [robo-signers](/robo-underwriter) made critical issues when they approved ill-advised administrative work, either on the grounds that they had no clue about the thing they were signing or on the grounds that they needed to handle extremely many records to accomplish the appropriate work to confirm them.

> Employees that closed down foreclosure records without surveying them appropriately became known as robo-underwriters.

The effects of off base and dark desk work combined with a run-up in the number of home loans going into default cross country made widespread issues. A few banks dispossessed some unacceptable properties, misjudged home values, or, at times, gave legal counselors for homeowners facing foreclosure the chance to toss foreclosure cases out completely.

## Resolution of the Foreclosure Crisis

In 2009, the government eventually arrived at a settlement with the country's five largest mortgage servicers:

- Partner (formerly known as GMAC)
- Bank of America
- Citi
- JPMorgan Chase
- Wells Fargo

The agreement, known as the National Mortgage Settlement, cost the servicers more than $50 billion in punishments and consumer relief payments.

Impacted borrowers received principal reductions or renegotiates for [underwater loans](/underwater-mortgage), allowing them to keep away from foreclosure and remain in their homes. Also, the settlement required a redesign of the loan servicing systems directed by the banks.

Borrowers who lost homes due to foreclosure by these banks in states party to the settlement agreement became eligible for payments of roughly $1,480. The total settlement pay-out added up to generally $1.5 billion.

## Features
- This untidy cycle now and again drove banks to dispossess some unacceptable property, err home values, and, at times, give legal counselors for homeowners facing foreclosure the chance to toss the case out altogether.
- Prior to and during the crisis, mortgage servicing companies handled large numbers of loans without adequate survey of the data going with them.
- The foreclosure crisis was a period of definitely raised property seizures in the U.S. housing market somewhere in the range of 2007 and 2010.
- Excessive credit expansion during the housing boom, mortgage debt securitization, and a financial system ill-equipped to cope with a widespread increase in defaults generally contributed to the crisis.
