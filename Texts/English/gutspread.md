# Gut Spread
## What Is a Gut Spread?

A gut spread, or "guts", is a [options](/optionscontract) strategy made by buying or selling a [in-the-money](/inthemoney) (ITM) put simultaneously as an ITM [call](/calloption). Long gut spreads are utilized by options traders when they accept that the underlying stock will move fundamentally, yet are uncertain whether it will be up or down. Conversely, a short gut spread is utilized when the underlying stock isn't expected to make any critical movement.

A gut spread varies from a vanilla options spread in that the last option uses [out-of-the-money](/outofthemoney) (OTM) options.

## Understanding the Gut Spread

A gut spread is effectively equivalent to a commonplace options spread, yet contrasts in the way that a gut spread utilizes more costly in-the-money (ITM) options at either [strike price](/strikeprice). These ITM options are alluded to as the "guts" since they are meatier in terms of [intrinsic value](/intrinsicvalue) than their OTM equivalents.

On the off chance that the price moves essentially, the call or put will be worth money, while the other option will cause a loss. The loss on the losing leg is capped at the amount paid for the option. The long strategy will bring about a loss in the event that the price doesn't move essentially, or stays something very similar, since the [extrinsic value](/extrinsicvalue) of the option will be lost. The loss may just be a partial loss, since either of the options might in any case be in the money and subsequently have some value.

Selling an ITM call and put makes the contrary difference. The seller, or [writer](/composing an-option), is expecting that the price won't move without a doubt. Selling an ITM call and put orders a higher [premium](/option-premium) than selling OTM calls and puts. On the off chance that the price of the underlying moves altogether, the call or put will lose money. The loss could be exceptionally big, contingent upon how far the underlying moves. The loss is offset by the premium received. It is conceivable that one or the two options terminate ITM, in this way, the maximum profit is the extrinsic value of the options sold.

## Genuine Example of a Gut Spread in a Stock

Expect a trader trusts that Apple Inc. (APPL) stock price will have a big move throughout the next five weeks due to a [earnings announcement](/earnings-announcement). They choose to buy ITM call and put options, making a gut spread, on options that terminate in about a month and a half. This expiration permits the trader to hold through the earnings release.

- Apple is presently trading at $225.
- The trader buys an ITM call with a strike of $220 for $12.85 per contract. Since each contract controls 100 shares, the cost for the call is $1,285 plus [commissions](/commission).
- The trader buys an ITM put with a strike of $230 for $10.40. The put costs a total of $1,040 plus commissions.
- The total cost of the trade is $2,325.

If the price of the underlying moves to $240 at option expiry, the trader will in any case lose $325. This is on the grounds that the call is worth $20 per share, or $2,000. The put is worth nothing. They burned through $2,325 on the trade, however just have an option worth $2,000.

In the event that the price moves to $260 at option expiry, the trader has a profit of $1,675. This is on the grounds that the call is worth $40 per share, or $4,000. The put is worth nothing. They burned through $2,325 on the trade.

In the event that the price is close $225 at expiry, the call is worth $5 per contract and the put is worth $5 for the contract, for a total of $1,000 for 100 shares each. They lose $1,325.

Assuming the price of Apple drops to $200, the put is worth $30, or $3,000 for the 100 shares. Deducting what they paid from put profit, they make $675.

## Features
- A long gut spread profits on the off chance that the price of the underlying makes a large price move prior to the options lapsing, while a short gut spread profits on the off chance that the price of the underlying doesn't move a lot of prior to the options terminating.
- A gut spread includes all the while buying and selling in-the-money options at various strike prices on the equivalent underlying.
- This varies from a standard options spread that would rather utilize two out-of-the-money (OTM) options contracts.
