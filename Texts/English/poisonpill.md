## What Is a Poison Pill?

The term poison pill alludes to a defense strategy utilized by a [target firm](/targetfirm) to prevent or deter a potential [hostile takeover](/hostiletakeover) by an acquiring company. Potential targets utilize this strategy in order to make them look less appealing to the expected acquirer.

In spite of the fact that they're not generally the first — and best — method for defending a company, poison pills are generally exceptionally effective.

## Understanding Poison Pills

[Takeovers](/takeover) are genuinely common in the business world, where one company makes an offer to take command over another. Bigger companies will more often than not take over more modest ones to get into another market, when there are [operational benefits](/operationalefficiency) by combining the two elements, or when the acquirer needs to eliminate the competition. Takeovers, however, aren't generally amicable and become hostile when the target would entertain or not like to be dominated.

The poison pill strategy has been around since the 1980s and was contrived by New York-based legal firm Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen, and Katz. The name comes from the poison pill spies carried in the past to try not to be questioned by their foes in the event they were caught. It was planned as a method for preventing an acquiring company from buying a majority share in the possible target or from negotiating with shareholders straightforwardly when takeovers were becoming exceptionally regular and common.

At the point when a company turns into the target of a hostile takeover, it might utilize the poison pill strategy to make itself less alluring to the potential [acquirer](/acquirer). As the name indicates, a poison pill is comparable to something that is hard to swallow or acknowledge. A company targeted for an undesirable takeover might utilize a poison pill to make its [shares](/shares) unfavorable to the acquiring firm or individual. Poison pills additionally altogether raise the cost of acquisitions and make big disincentives to totally dissuade such endeavors.

The mechanism safeguards minority [shareholders](/shareholder) and maintains a strategic distance from the change of control of company management. Implementing a poison pill may not necessarily indicate that the company isn't willing to be acquired. On occasion, it very well might be sanctioned to get a higher valuation or better terms for the [acquisition](/acquisition).

## Special Considerations

There are three major likely disservices to poison pills:

1. Stock values become diluted, so shareholders frequently need to purchase new shares just to keep even.
1. Institutional investors are discouraged from buying into corporations that have aggressive defenses.

## Types of Poison Pills

### Flip-in Poison Pill

A [flip-in poison pill](/flip-in-poison-pill) strategy involves allowing the shareholders, with the exception of the acquirer, to purchase extra shares at a discount. However purchasing extra shares furnishes shareholders with instantaneous [profits](/benefit), the practice weakens the value of the limited number of shares previously purchased by the acquiring company. This right to purchase is given to the shareholders before the takeover is finalized and is much of the time set off when the acquirer hoards a certain threshold percentage of shares of the target company.

When set off, each shareholder — excluding the acquirer — is qualified for buy new shares at a discounted rate. The greater the number of shareholders who buy extra shares, the more diluted the acquiring company's interest becomes. This makes the cost of the bid a lot higher.

As new shares clear a path to the [market](/market), the value of shares held by the acquirer diminishes, in this way making the takeover endeavor more costly and more troublesome. On the off chance that a bidder knows that such a plan could be initiated, they might be inclined not to seek after a takeover. Such provisions of a flip-in are many times publicly available in a company's local laws, or [charter](/corporatecharter), and indicate their possible use as a takeover defense.

### Flip-Over Poison Pill

A flip-over poison pill strategy permits stockholders of the target company to purchase the shares of the acquiring company at a profoundly discounted price on the off chance that the hostile takeover endeavor is fruitful. For instance, a target company shareholder might gain the right to buy the stock of its acquirer at a two-for-one rate, consequently [diluting](/dilution) the [equity](/equity) in the acquiring company. The acquirer might try not to proceed such acquisitions on the off chance that it sees a dilution of value post-acquisition.

To cancel any conceivable takeover endeavors by Schnatter, the company's board of directors adopted a Limited Duration Stockholders Rights plan — a poison pill provision. Named the wolf-pack provision, It basically multiplied the share price for any individual who endeavored to store up in excess of a certain percentage of the company's shares without board endorsement.

**The New York Times** reported that the plan would produce results assuming Schnatter and his members brought their combined stake up in the company to 31%, or on the other hand assuming that anybody purchased 15% of the [common stock](/commonstock) without the board's endorsement.

Since Schnatter was excluded from the [dividend](/dividend) distribution, the strategy effectively made a hostile takeover of the company ugly: the potential acquirer would need to pay two times the [value](/value) per share of the company's common stock. It prevented him from trying to assume control over the company he established by buying its shares at market price.

### Netflix
