# Mutualization
## What Is Mutualization?

Mutualization is the method involved with changing an association's business structure from a [joint stock company ](/jointstockcompany)to a mutual structure where the stockholders or customers own a majority of shares. They become eligible to receive cash distributions from the company in direct extent to the amount of revenue the company acquires from every member.

This form of business structure is otherwise called a cooperative. Something contrary to mutualization is [privatization](/privatization) or demutualization.

## How Mutualization Works

The mutual business structure can be highly beneficial to members, every one of whom will receive a dividend for working with the company. In any case, this distribution might be a tax-free event, contingent upon the laws of the jurisdiction in which the member lives. An illustration of a mutualized company is a [grocery chain](/hypermarket) in which every customer can turn into a member and receive money every year for shopping at that staple chain. The bank and insurance company Mutual of Omaha and Liberty Mutual (separately) are prime instances of mutual companies. The organization that began Liberty Mutual is in fact, owned by policyholders.

In effect, the owners of the company that goes through mutualization, are as yet active clients in that they actually disparage the services being referred to, just as they did before the company moved its business model. Furthermore, much of the time, the members are given the power to assist with settling on choices in regards to choosing senior management faculty. Now and again, members can choose board members, as well as board executives.

While numerous ills of businesses can take on the mutualization paradigm, this activity is predominantly preferred by the accompanying types of interests:

1. Savings banks
1. Savings and loan companies
1. Insurance companies

With most insurance companies, at the finish of each and every calendar year, company members receive distributions from the whole profits earned all through the previous 12 months. Yet, banks and other financial institutions wouldn't go into this arrangement with such zeal, in the event that they didn't see a high probability of gain, on their finishes. Furthermore, this normally comes as cost-cutting measures. These institutions effectively share reduce their own costs in infrastructure and operations, by mutualizing their assets.

## The Demutualization Flipside

Numerous institutions will generally steer their structures the other way of mutualization by choosing to demutualize their assets, in a cycle wherein member-owned companies transform their model to a shareholder-owned structure. This step is in many cases a forerunner to the company sending off of an initial public offering (IPO). This would recommend a takeoff from insurance companies that have the actual word "mutual" embedded in their names in light of the fact that the act of demutualizing runs counter to the sort of culture that their handles propose.

Regardless, in these situations, strategy holders are either offered money, or shares in the company, in exchange for giving up their rights of ownership, shares, or money in exchange for their ownership rights.
