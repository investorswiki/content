## What Is Written-Down Value?

Written-down value is the value of a [asset](/asset) subsequent to accounting for [depreciation](/depreciation) or [amortization](/amortization). In short, it mirrors the current worth of a resource owned by a company according to an accounting viewpoint. This value is remembered for the company's balance sheet in its financial statements.

Written-down value is likewise called [book value](/bookvalue) or net book value.

## How Written-Down Value Works

In accounting, there are different [conventions](/accounting-show) intended to better match sales and [expenses](/expense) to the period where they are incurred. One approach that companies frequently embrace is alluded to as depreciation or amortization.

Companies generally use depreciation for [physical assets](/physicalasset), like machinery, and amortization for [intangible assets](/intangibleasset), like licenses and software. The two methods permit firms to expense resources of economic value throughout a more extended time period. All in all, as opposed to deduct the full purchase price from [net income](/netincome) (NI) right away, companies can stretch the cost of assets over various periods.

For instance, assuming a company bought a piece of machinery, it wouldn't need to expense it in the year that it was bought yet can stretch out the cost of the machinery over a number of years until it is sold or neglected; a period known as its [useful life](/usefullife).

Written-down value is a method used to decide a formerly purchased asset's current worth and is calculated by deducting accumulated depreciation or amortization from the asset's original value. The subsequent figure will show up on the company's [balance sheet](/balancesheet).

## Amortization Methods

Amortization can be utilized to [write-down](/writedown) the value of debt or [intangible assets](/intangibleasset) and is somewhat more muddled than depreciation methods. The asset's book value is decreased on the company's books as per a set schedule.

Different methods can be utilized for amortizing various types of assets. Theoretical assets, for example, [patents](/patent), are ordinarily written-down yearly. Bonds, then again, frequently utilize a [effective interest method](/effective-interest-method) of amortization.

In the interim, [amortization schedules](/amortization_schedule) for outstanding loans regularly follow the repayment schedule of the loan with differentiation for interest and principal. Some extra amortization methods are additionally accessible including [diminishing balance](/decliningbalancemethod) and ballooning.

The written-down value of an amortized asset is important in light of the fact that it assists the company with keeping tabs on them. At the point when an asset is amortized to zero, it tends to be removed the books or may should be reestablished.

## Depreciation Methods

Written-down value can be calculated by a method of [depreciation](/depreciation) that is some of the time called the diminishing balance method. This accounting technique diminishes the value of an asset by a set percentage every year. Different other depreciation techniques likewise exist in accounting and are utilized to [capitalize the expenses](/capitalizedcost) of various types of assets.

One model is [straight line depreciation](/straightlinebasis), which deducts a similar cost consistently founded on splitting the difference between the asset's cost and its expected [salvage value](/salvagevalue) by the number of years it is expected to be utilized.

The written-down value of a depreciated asset is important on the grounds that it is remembered for the far reaching value of a company's total assets. Depreciated assets regularly start on the books at their purchased price and are frequently sold before they are depreciated to zero.

The depreciated value of an asset is additionally important in assisting with determining the selling price of the asset. While selling the asset, the book value is utilized to assist with determining the minimum value for which it will be sold.

[Real assets](/realasset) normally sell at a cost range inside their book value and the highest [fair market value](/fairmarketvalue). In the event that a gain happens from the sale of an asset, it will be taxable much of the time. The [taxable gain](/taxablegain) on a sale not entirely settled by contrasting the sales from the thing with its written-down value.
