# Securities Lending
## What Is Securities Lending?

Securities lending is the practice of loaning shares of stock, commodities, [derivative contracts](/derivative), or different securities to different investors or firms. Securities lending requires the borrower to put up collateral, whether cash, different securities, or a [letter of credit](/letterofcredit).

At the point when a security is loaned, the title and the ownership are likewise moved to the borrower. A [loan fee](/stock-loan-fee), or borrow fee, is charged by a brokerage to a client for borrowing shares, along with any interest due connected with the loan. The loan fee and interest are charged as per a Securities Lending Agreement that must be completed before the stock is borrowed by a client. Holders of securities that are loaned receive a [rebate](/stock-loan-rebate) from their brokerage.

Securities lending gives liquidity to markets, can produce extra interest income for long-term holders of securities, and considers short-selling.

## Understanding Securities Lending

Securities lending is generally worked with between [brokers](/specialist) or [dealers](/seller) and not straight by individual investors. To settle the transaction, a securities lending agreement or loan agreement must be completed. This presents the terms of the loan including duration, interest rates, lender's fees, and the idea of the collateral.

As per current regulations, borrowers ought to give something like 100 percent of the security's value as collateral. Collateral for securities additionally relies upon its volatility. The base initial collateral on securities loans is no less than 102 percent of the market value of the loaned securities plus, for debt securities, any accrued interest. What's more, the fees and interest charged on a securities loan will frequently rely heavily on the fact that it is so challenging to find those securities wanted for borrow. The more scant the supply of accessible securities, the higher the cost.

Normal securities lending requires clearing brokers, who work with the transaction between the borrowing and lending parties. The borrower pays a fee to the lender for the shares and this fee is split between the lending party and the clearing agent.

## Benefits of Securities Lending

Securities lending is important to [short selling](/shortselling), in which an investor borrows securities to sell them right away. The borrower desires to profit by selling the security and buying it back later at a lower price. Since ownership has been moved briefly to the borrower, the borrower is at risk to pay any dividends out to the lender.

In these transactions, the lender is compensated as settled upon fees and furthermore has the security returned toward the finish of the transaction. This permits the lender to improve its returns through the receipt of these fees. The borrower benefits through the possibility of drawing profits by shorting the securities.

Securities lending is likewise engaged with hedging, [arbitrage](/arbitrage), and fizzles driven borrowing. In these situations, the benefit to the securities lender is either to earn a small return on securities currently held in its portfolio or to conceivably meet cash-financing needs.

## Seeing Short Selling

A [short sale](/shortsale) includes the sale and [buyback](/buyback) of borrowed securities. The goal is to sell the securities at a higher price, and afterward buy them back at a lower price. These transactions happen when the securities borrower accepts the price of the securities is going to fall, permitting him to produce a profit in light of the difference in the selling and buying prices. No matter what the amount of profit, if any, the borrower earns from the short sale, the settled upon fees to the lending brokerage are due once the agreement period has ended.

### Rights and Dividends

At the point when a security is moved as part of the lending agreement, all rights are moved to the borrower. This incorporates [voting rights](/votingright), the right to dividends, and the rights to some other distributions. Frequently, the borrower sends payments equivalent to the dividends and different returns back to the lender.

## Illustration of Securities Lending

Assume an investor accepts that the price of a stock will fall from its current price of $100 to $75 soon. The stock isn't extremely unpredictable and generally trades in defined ranges. To profit from this thesis, the investor borrows 50 shares of the company from a securities firm and sells them for $5,000 (50 shares x $100 current price).

Accepting the share price drops to $75, the investor will then purchase 50 shares for $3,750 (50 shares x $75 price) and return them to the securities firm. In this case, the profit on this short-sale transaction is $1,250 ($5,000 - $3,750). Nonetheless, short-sales don't necessarily in every case work out as expected. On the off chance that the investor has misjudged and the company's shares wind up expanding in price as opposed to decreasing, the investor should purchase the stock back at a higher price than the price at which they sold it and will cause a loss on this transaction.
