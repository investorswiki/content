# On Chain Transactions (Cryptocurrency)
## What Are On-Chain Transactions?

On-chain transactions allude to [cryptocurrency](/cryptocurrency) transactions that happen on the [blockchain](/blockchain) and stay dependent on the state of the blockchain for their legitimacy. On-chain transactions are considered legitimate only when the blockchain has been refreshed to mirror the transactions on the public ledger. On-chain transactions offer security and transparency since they can't be altered once they're confirmed and recorded on the network. Nonetheless, there are a few downsides to on-chain transactions, which incorporate higher fees and slow processing times.

## Figuring out On-Chain Transactions

On-chain transactions are transactions that happen on a blockchain that are considered the distributed, public ledger. On-chain transactions are those that have been approved or verified and lead to an update to the overall blockchain network.

Transactions that happen on a blockchain must be approved by a number of the network's participants, who are called excavators. A transaction is only legitimate once the participants confirm the transaction and a consensus is arrived at about its legitimacy. The transaction subtleties are then recorded on the block and distributed to the network's participants.

Contingent on the network protocol, once a transaction earns adequate confirmations from network participants in view of the network's [consensus mechanism](/consensus-mechanism-cryptocurrency), it turns out to be practically irreversible. Commonly, it must be reversed on the off chance that the majority of the blockchain's hashing power comes to a consensus to reverse the transaction.

## Timing of On-Chain Transactions

On-chain transactions should happen in real-time to keep blockchain transactions secure, unquestionable, transparent, and instantaneous. Notwithstanding, in reality, it rarely happens that way. On-chain transactions can consume most of the day to gather an adequate number of verifications and authentications from network participants before confirming a transaction. Likewise, the diggers need to approve the transactions by utilizing PCs to tackle convoluted math problems each time a block transaction is added to the blockchain.

In the event that the transaction volume is high or there's congestion inside the network, it might take more time for the excavators to approve the transactions, especially assuming that there are all a limited number of diggers. Subsequently, different gatherings engaged with the transactions must hang tight for a resolution. In any case, participants might have the option to pay a transaction fee so it tends to be approved sooner.

During the initial phase of a blockchain when the transaction volume is low, on-chain transactions might offer instant settlements. New network protocols and cryptocurrencies that are pointed toward giving instant settlement are advancing into the mainstream.

## Public Ledger

On-chain transactions are time-stepped and replicated all through the blockchain network, which gives transparency and security. On-chain transactions are likewise permanent, meaning they can't be changed, which assists with supporting the security by forestalling a hack in which transaction subtleties could be altered. On-chain transactions are shared with all participants in the network, giving transparency, which likewise keeps transactions from being altered by a fraudster through a malicious attack.

Despite the fact that there are benefits to the distributed ledger of a blockchain network, public telecom and recording of on-chain transaction subtleties may likewise give adequate pointers to connect addresses to participants' characters. Thus, the public sharing of the transaction could represent a threat to the anonymity feature of the blockchain and the security of its participants. For example, it is feasible to some extent know a client's identity on the off chance that one carefully studies the transaction examples of sends and receipts around similar addresses, similar to those utilized for purchasing online goods.

## Cost of On-Chain Transactions

On-chain transactions likewise include some major disadvantages, as diggers command a fee for offering their validation and authentication services for confirming a transaction on the blockchain in the most limited conceivable time. On occasion, this fee can be high, contingent on the network's scalability potential and transaction volume. For example, high fees have prompted the problem of [Bitcoin Dust](/bitcoin-dust), where fractional measures of bitcoins can't be executed. Nonetheless, for blockchain networks that are in their beginning phases of growth, when the transaction volume is low, their fees could be tiny or zero.

## How Is On-Chain Different from Off-Chain Transactions?

[Off-chain transactions](/offchain-transactions-cryptocurrency) are conducted outside of the blockchain network. Off-chain transactions should be possible by the participants in which they have an agreement that a third-party guarantees the transaction or confirms that it's legitimate or complete. The two participants could likewise exchange their private keys so that the crypto assets are exchanged without moving any money out of their digital wallets.

By the by, off-chain transactions happen with next to no changes to the blockchain. Subsequently, there is compelling reason need to hang tight for validation by blockchain excavators, which can speed up the interaction and lead to lower transaction fees. In any case, since off-chain transactions are not recorded on the blockchain, there is no network record of the transaction and the financial subtleties, which could be an issue in the event that there was a dispute between the two gatherings.

Conversely, on-chain transactions are handled on the blockchain network and are permanent. Albeit on-chain transactions take more time to process due to the validation interaction by the diggers, it enormously improves the security by having the transaction approved by participants and recorded on the blockchain network.

Whether an on-chain transaction or an off-chain transaction is best relies upon the participants in question and what they want the most. In the event that the goal is security, immutability, and an approved transaction, an on-chain transaction would probably be best, however in the event that low transaction fees and speed are important, an off-chain transaction may be better.

## Real-World Examples of On-Chain Transactions

A cryptocurrency with a generally fast transaction speed is NEO, which is under 25 seconds [block time](/block-time-cryptocurrency). [Burstcoin](/burstcoin) (BURST) is another coin that not just has faster block time than pillars like Bitcoin, it additionally utilizes undeniably less energy to mine coins due to its [proof of capacity](/proof-capacity-cryptocurrency) system.

Once checked and confirmed on the blockchain, on-chain transactions can't be reversed except if the majority of the network's hashing power consents to do as such, making on-chain transactions more solid and extortion safe.

## Highlights
- The speed of on-chain transactions relies upon the verification method of the blockchain.
- Off-chain transactions don't happen on the blockchain network, yet all things considered, are executed on another electronic system like PayPal.
- On-chain transactions offer security and transparency since they can't be altered once they're confirmed and recorded on the blockchain network.
- On-chain transactions allude to transactions that are recorded and checked on the blockchain.
