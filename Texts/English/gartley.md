# Gartley Pattern
## What Is the Gartley Pattern?

The Gartley pattern is a harmonic chart pattern, in view of [Fibonacci](/fibonaccilines) numbers and ratios, that assists traders with distinguishing reaction ups and downs. In his book **Profits in the Stock Market**, H.M. Gartley set out the foundation for [harmonic](/harmonicaverage) chart patterns in 1935. The Gartley pattern is the most commonly utilized harmonic chart pattern. Larry Pesavento later applied Fibonacci ratios to the pattern in his book **Fibonacci Ratios with Pattern Recognition**.

## Gartley Patterns Explained

The Gartley pattern is the most common harmonic chart pattern. Harmonic patterns operate on the reason that Fibonacci arrangements can be utilized to build geometric designs, for example, [breakouts](/breakout) and [retracements](/retracement), in prices. The Fibonacci ratio is common in nature and has turned into a famous area of concentration among [technical analysts](/technical-examiner) that utilization devices like Fibonacci retracements, extensions, fans, clusters, and time regions.

Numerous technical analysts utilize the Gartley pattern related to other chart patterns or [technical indicators](/technicalindicator). For instance, the pattern might give a big picture outline of where the price is probably going to go over the long-term, while traders center around executing short-term trades toward the anticipated trend. The breakout and breakdown price targets may likewise be utilized as [support](/support) and [resistance levels](/resistance) by traders.

The key benefit of these types of chart patterns is that they give specific experiences into both the timing and extent of price developments as opposed to just gander at either.

Other well known geometric chart patterns utilized by traders incorporate [Elliott Waves](/elliottwavetheory), which makes comparative expectations of [trends](/trend) later on in view of the presence of the price developments and their connection to one another.

## Distinguishing Gartley Patterns

This is the way the Gartley pattern is structured:

The Gartley pattern above shows a [uptrend](/uptrend) from point 0 to point 1 with a price [reversal](/reversal) at point 1. Utilizing Fibonacci ratios, the retracement between point 0 and point 2 ought to be 61.8%. At point 2, the price inverts again toward point 3, which ought to be a 38.2% retracement from point 1. At point 3, the price turns around to point 4. At point 4, the pattern is complete and buy signals are created with an upside target that matches point 3, point 1, and a 161.8% increase from point 1 as the last price target. Customarily, point 0 is utilized as a [stop loss](/stop-lossorder) level for the overall trade. These Fibonacci levels needn't bother with to be exact, however the nearer they are, the more solid the pattern.

The bearish form of the Gartley pattern is essentially the inverse of the bullish pattern and predicts a bearish [downtrend](/downtrend) with several price targets when the pattern arrives at completion by the fourth point.

## Real World Example of a Gartley Pattern

Here is an illustration of a Gartley pattern showing up in the AUD/USD currency pair:

In the chart over, the Gartley pattern is trailed by a bullish move higher. Point X, or 0.70550 could be utilized as a stop-loss point for the trade. The take-profit point could be set at Point C, or around 0.71300.

## Features
- Gartley patterns ought to be utilized related to different forms of technical analysis that can act as confirmation.
- Gartley patterns are the most common harmonic chart pattern.
- The stop-loss point is frequently situated at Point 0 or X and the take-profit is much of the time set at point C.
