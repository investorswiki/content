# Predictive Modeling
## What Is Predictive Modeling?

Predictive modeling is the method involved with utilizing known results to make, process, and approve a model that can be utilized to forecast future outcomes. It is a tool utilized in [predictive analytics](/predictive-analytics), a data mining technique that endeavors to respond to the inquiry "what could occur from now on?"

## Grasping Predictive Modeling

By investigating historical occasions, companies can utilize predictive modeling to increase the probability of forecasting occasions, customer behavior, as well as financial, economic, and market risks.

The quick migration to digital products has made a sea of data that is promptly available to organizations. [Big data](/big-data) is used by companies to work on the dynamics of the customer-to-business relationship. This huge amount of real-time data is recovered from sources, for example, social media, internet perusing history, cell telephone data, and [cloud computing](/cloud-computing) platforms.

Nonetheless, the data is generally unstructured and too complex for humans to dissect in a short period of time. Due to the sheer volume of data, companies utilize predictive modeling tools-frequently by means of computer software programs. The programs interaction gigantic amounts of historical data to survey and recognize patterns inside the data. From that point, the model can give a historical record as well as an assessment of what behaviors or occasions are probably going to happen again or later on.

## Applications of Predictive Modeling

Predictive analytics utilizes predictors or known features to make predictive models that will be utilized in obtaining an output. A predictive model can figure out how various points of data interface with one another. Two of the most widely utilized predictive modeling techniques are [regression](/regression) and [neural networks](/neuralnetwork).

In the field of statistics, regression alludes to a linear relationship between the information and output variables. A predictive model with a linear function requires one predictor or feature to foresee the output or outcome. For instance, a bank that desires to recognize [money laundering](/moneylaundering) in its beginning phases could consolidate a linear predictive model.

The bank needs to recognize which of its customers are probably going to participate in money laundering activities eventually in time. Utilizing the bank's customer data, a predictive model is worked around the dollar amount of money transfers that customers made during a period of time.

The model is instructed to perceive the difference between a money laundering transaction and a normal transaction. The optimal outcome from the model ought to be a pattern that signals which customer laundered money and which didn't. In the event that the model sees that a pattern of fraud is emerging for a specific customer, it will make a signal for action, which will be gone to by the bank's fraud prevention unit.

## Predictive Modeling Tools

Predictive models are likewise utilized in neural networks, for example, machine learning and deep learning, which are fields in artificial intelligence (AI). The neural networks are enlivened by the human brain and are made with a web of interconnected hubs in hierarchical levels, which addresses the foundation for AI. The power of neural networks lies in their ability to handle non-linear data relationships. They are able to make relationships and patterns between variables that would demonstrate incomprehensible or too time-consuming for human analysts.

From one perspective, a bank can enter referred to variables, for example, the value of transfers initiated by its customers into its model to figure out who is probably going to take part in money laundering. Then again, a neural network can make an all the more powerful pattern by making a relationship between input variables. These info variables could incorporate time signed in, geographic location of the client, IP address of the client's gadget, recipient or source of the funds, and some other variable or behavior that is probably going to be engaged with money laundering activity.

Other predictive modeling techniques utilized by financial companies incorporate decision trees, time series data mining, and Bayesian analysis. Companies that make the most of big data through predictive modeling measures are better able to comprehend how their customers draw in with their products and can distinguish possible risks and opportunities for the company.
