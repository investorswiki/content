# Future Purchase Option
## What Is a Future Purchase Option?

A future purchase option (otherwise called a future increase rider) is a feature of [long-term disability insurance](/disability-insurance) (LDI) and some life insurance policies that allows policyholders to increase their insurance coverage occasionally, or as their income increases. These increases are affected without new medical underwriting, known as guaranteed insurability.

This guarantee is conceded in exchange for paying a higher premium over the life of the policy.

## Figuring out Future Purchase Option

The future purchase option is regularly legitimate until the policyholder arrives at a predefined age. Claiming a future purchase option means that even in the event that a policyholder fosters a serious medical issue that would make it costly or difficult to fit the bill for another policy, they can by and by purchase extra coverage under their existing policy on the grounds that the future purchase option doesn't need the policyholder to finish another medical exam.

A future purchase option is likewise frequently accessible with [long-term care](/ltcinsurance) (LTC) insurance, which is intended to cover extended nursing care costs, for example, a long stay in a nursing home. The cost to purchase extra insurance through the future purchase option relies upon the policyholder's age. Additionally, the insurance company chooses how much extra coverage to issue in light of the policy's original coverage amount and the economy's inflation rate.

The extra cost for a future purchase option [rider](/rider) is much of the time generally low, making up roughly 2% of the total policy cost. In any case, premiums for future purchase options increase with age as they are calculated in view of the age at which the option is reestablished. Policyholders can increase their benefits occasionally, say each a few years. This arrangement is great for policyholders who have passed a certain age, say 60 or 70, and are at greater risk of being hospitalized and can really bear the cost of the high premiums required to sign up for such options.

## Future Purchase Option versus Inflation Protection

A future purchase option isn't the main way a policyholder can increase their coverage over the long run; another option is a [inflation protection rider](/insurance-inflation-protection), which fills a comparative need. As a matter of fact, many brokers will suggest inflation protection for more youthful customers since it increases the value of a policy's benefits after some time, keeping pace with inflation, so if and when they at any point need care, benefits will in any case cover the increased cost.

Note that inflation protection is typically offered to policyholders even on the off chance that their income doesn't increase, while some future purchase options will be contingent on demonstrating a higher income.

## Future Purchase Options and Younger Policyholders

The future purchase option might have great pricing however just allows the policyholder to increase coverage close to the beginning of the policy term, though an inflation protection rider will cost all the more yet persistently increase the policyholder's coverage throughout the span of the term. Furthermore, in the event that a policyholder declines to exploit the future purchase option when the insurance company offers it, it probably won't be offered once more.

Note that practices change among insurance companies. Purchasing inflation protection can be more costly, however may give better coverage over the long haul. On the off chance that the policyholder can manage the cost of the extra cost, purchasing some sort of protection against inflation is normally smart, particularly on account of a long-term care policy, since medical services costs have been rising fundamentally quicker than the cost of living.
