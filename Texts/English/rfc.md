The Reconstruction Finance Corp. (RFC) was an agency authorized by the U.S. government to loan money to help the country's weak banks after the [stock market crash of 1929](/stock-market-crash-1929) and during the Great Depression that followed.

Congress made the RFC in 1932 with a limited command to issue emergency loans to banks, rail lines, and farmers undermined with insolvency. Its scope immediately expanded and it before long started lending money to state and neighborhood governments to finance public infrastructure projects. It outlasted the Great Depression and later aided finance industries that were key to the country's part in World War II.

The RFC was not completely annulled until 1957.

Congress made the RFC basically to support the country's banks, which were falling under the type of panic withdrawals from their customers as the Great Depression grabbed hold.

It was planned to remain in business for just 10 years, however the RFC proceeded and, surprisingly, expanded all through the 1930s and the 1940s.

The Emergency Relief Act, made in the mid year of 1932, expanded the agency's scope and power. It permitted the RFC to stretch out loans to neighborhood and state public fills in as well as farmers and small businesses.

In its initial years, under President Herbert Hoover, the RFC utilized its expanded powers. After Franklin D. Roosevelt got down to business and [the New Deal](/new-deal) came full circle, the agency looked for all the more overwhelmingly to support the recovery exertion.

The RFC expanded even further during World War II to give financing to the construction and operation of war plants and even loans to Allied foreign governments.

### Starting points

The bank panic was one of the side effects of the Great Depression, which started with the collapse of the stock market in 1929 and would go on until 1939. At that point, America had in excess of 24,000 independent banks, a large portion of them serving small networks and rural areas.

An endless series of banks collapsed as their customers arranged and pulled out their savings until the vaults were unfilled and the banks closed. The excess customers lost their life savings. The panic spread from one town to another.

The Federal Reserve had been made in 1913 explicitly to prevent this type of crisis by giving emergency loans to banks. However, just nationally-contracted banks were required to be Fed individuals. State-sanctioned banks, including the majority of those small neighborhood banks, were not individuals.

### The Hoover Administration

In 1932, the Reconstruction Finance Corp. was made by Congress with the support of President Herbert Hoover. Its mission was to give emergency loans to three key sectors of the economy: banks, railways, and farm crops.

The U.S. Treasury initially gave $500 million in funds to be distributed by the RFC.

### The New Deal

The scope of the RFC and its funding expanded hugely after the election of President Franklin D. Roosevelt. Its independence was a key benefit of the RFC, from the legislator's perspective: Its spending didn't need Congressional authorization and didn't show up in the federal budget.

The agency started to loan money to state and nearby governments to fund state and neighborhood public ventures and to pay for relief programs for the jobless. Assistance to cash-tied farmers was greatly increased.

As the Great Depression proceeded, numerous homeowners defaulted on their mortgages. The banks, fearing more defaults, made it even more challenging to get a mortgage. In yet one more expansion of RFC powers, it was empowered to make the Federal National Mortgage Association to guarantee mortgages. That association actually exists and is known as Fannie Mae.

### World War II

By 1940, U.S. contribution in World War II appeared inevitable. No less than eight auxiliaries were added to the RFC to finance the development of materials important to the war and to supplant imported materials that had become unobtainable.

## End of the Reconstruction Finance Corp.

Post-depression and post-war, crafted by the RFC started to slow down.

In 1948, Congress started a series of examinations of political corruption inside the RFC. One allegation was that the RFC had conceded a loan to a customer of Boeing Corp. in return for Boeing's support of President Harry S. Truman.

The Senate Committee on Banking and Currency commanded an immediate reorganization, leading to a restructuring of the RFC in 1952.

Regardless of the work to redo the agency, allegations of blunder kept on encompassing the RFC. Just one year after the restructuring, Congress passed the RFC Liquidation Act.

The agency was defunded and its leftover capabilities were gradually moved to different agencies. The Small Business Administration was made in part to make up for a shortfall in government lending to small businesses that the RFC's vanishing made.

In 1957, the everything except ancient RFC was destroyed altogether.
