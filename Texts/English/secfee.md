The proceeds of the SEC fee are collected from the brokerage firms and are in the end channeled back to the [U.S. Treasury](/ustreasury). National securities exchanges in the U.S. must likewise pay this transaction-based fee, which, in their case, is derived from the volume of securities sold over their platforms.

In particular, this fee applies to the sale of most classes of equities and equity-related options however doesn't impact the purchase of equities in any capacity.

The SEC every year changes the SEC fee, by either expanding or decreasing that figure. On rarer events, the SEC makes mid-year adjustments. Regardless, the purpose of the adjustments is to normalize the SEC's total transaction fee consumption in a given year. For instance, assuming a securities exchange's transaction volume builds, the SEC will diminish the fee rate, due to the fact that every transaction must now contribute a smaller amount, for the exchange to hit its target on the whole.

Oppositely, assuming transaction volume diminishes, every transaction must thusly be charged a higher fee to empower the SEC to take in that equivalent target amount.
