## What is Telephone Bond?

Telephone bonds are debt securities, so named on the grounds that they were issued by early telephone companies to raise funds for [capital expenditures](/capitalexpenditure).

## Understanding Telephone Bond

Telephone bonds have existed since the mid 1900s and were the primary means for early telephone companies to obtain funding. Telephone bonds guaranteed a safe, consistent income since the companies giving them were [monopolies](/monopoly) whose revenue transfer, traditional landline telephone service subscriptions and significant distance charges, didn't face competitive disruption. Prior to 1984, the U.S. telephone industry saw little competition, further diminishing the risk of [default](/default2) on telephone bonds.

While [utilities](/utility) produce standard revenues through their subscription operations, building out and keeping up with their infrastructure requires large measures of capital. Network upgrades and developments commonly require telecom companies to raise debt. Since AT&T worked as a [regulated monopoly](/legalmonopoly) for the majority of the twentieth century, investors considered its debt issuances to be very safe.

After the breakup of AT&T's Bell System in 1984, industry [deregulation](/liberate) supported competition, adding an element of risk to telephone company debt. The telecommunications industry changed further as cable TV companies worked out broadband internet networks and remote cell service superseded landline service. Contending telecommunications companies found themselves raising debt to create, keep up with and upgrade new networks as innovations advance and consumers become more dependent on moving large measures of data across networks. The quicker remote technology advances, the quicker companies must spend to upgrade networks trying to remain ahead of contenders.

Utilities generally allude to essential services, especially water, power and gas, which require [infrastructure](/infrastructure) investment to guarantee their availability to the public. As telecommunications services have created some distance from landline telephone networks, they act less like a utility and more like a commodity, particularly where customers can browse various remote network suppliers.

Funding for plain-vanilla utility infrastructure undertakings, for example, the electrical grid or water supply pipelines frequently come from [utility revenue bonds](/utility-revenue-bond) issued by regions. These securities repay bondholders through revenues earned through utilization of the infrastructure. Since districts generally depend on a single electrical grid and water supply system to offer types of assistance to the public, these revenues accompany a functional guarantee closely looking like the situation in the beginning of the telephone, which likewise worked largely on a single network.
