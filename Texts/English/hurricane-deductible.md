## What Is Hurricane Insurance?

There is no such thing as in reality, hurricane insurance as a specific, separate type of policy. The term typically alludes to what is, stringently talking, a hurricane deductible on a homeowners insurance policy: an extra amount a homeowner must pay before the insurer will cover the damage or destruction brought about by a hurricane. A percentage of the property's worth, this deductible is common in 19 hurricane-inclined states and Washington D.C.

Hurricane insurance can likewise allude to special types of [catastrophe insurance](/catastrophe-insurance) that specifically cover flooding or extreme breezes (which really cause the harm to the property). These policies are likewise common — and now and again required — in high-risk hurricane states, like Florida and Texas.

## Figuring out Hurricane Insurance

Hurricane deductibles are separate from ordinary homeowners insurance deductibles and depend on a percentage of the home's value. While a customary homeowners insurance policy deductible is a fixed dollar amount — say, $500 or $2,000 — a hurricane deductible may be 2% to 5% percent of a home's insured value, or $2,000 to $5,000 for each $100,000 in home coverage.

Hurricane deductibles originally developed in 1992 after Hurricane Andrew's enormous damage to South Florida caused major losses for homeowners insurance companies, however they turned out to be more broad in 2005, in the wake of Hurricane Katrina. Insurance companies go to [reinsurers](/reinsurance) while they're experiencing difficulty paying large amounts of claims at the same time, however even reinsurance companies were battling under such huge losses. Therefore, insurance companies started requiring hurricane deductibles in 19 states and Washington, D.C. Homes in these states, which are on the Gulf of Mexico or Atlantic Coasts, are defenseless to hurricane damage.

For a homeowner to be required to pay a hurricane deductible, there typically must be a named hurricane in the area. In some cases an extreme typhoon will trigger the deductible. The hurricane deductible will be in effect for any damage that happens until the tempest is downsized. Rules shift by state.

Even when a hurricane deductible doesn't have any significant bearing, a windstorm deductible may. A windstorm deductible applies to damage from any sort of high wind. It can run a little lower than a hurricane deductible, in some cases as low as 1% of the property's insured worth.
