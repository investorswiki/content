## What Is Shitcoin?

The term shitcoin alludes to a [cryptocurrency](/cryptocurrency) with practically zero value or a digital currency that has no immediate, perceptible purpose. The word is a derogatory term frequently used to depict [altcoins](/altcoin) or cryptocurrencies that were developed after [bitcoins](/bitcoin) became well known.

The decreased value of a shitcoin is frequently due to failed investor interest since it was not made with honest intentions or in light of the fact that its price depended on speculation. Thusly, these currencies are viewed as terrible investments.

## How Shitcoins Work

Interest in cryptocurrencies increased substantially since bitcoins were presented in 2009. Their prosperity has drawn in organizations hoping to exploit [blockchain](/blockchain) technology to make their own altcoins, which are digital assets that piggyback off the fundamental design of bitcoin. Engineers ordinarily declare the number of tokens that are at last made accessible — the supply of bitcoin is capped at 21 million, while ether supplies are capped at 18 million every year.

Setting a supply limit makes [scarcity](/scarcity), as investors comprehend that extra tokens won't be made after a certain point. More tokens would hypothetically [dilute](/weakening) the value of their holdings, the same way another stock issuance might reduce the value of a share of stock.

With the [supply](/supply) of an altcoin fixed, its value ought to be dependent on [demand](/demand). Yet, since most cryptocurrencies have limited viable use — trading genuine goods and services utilizing cryptocurrencies isn't yet a common event — their values depend on pure [speculation](/speculation).

Despite the fact that there might be some interest in a coin when it dispatches, its price remains generally level. Yet, the price increments dramatically over a short period of time as investors commit.

A few states, specifically those in South Korea and China, have taken a distinct fascination with stamping out cryptocurrency mining operations, while others, like Japan, have energized the utilization of cryptocurrencies in the more extensive [market](/market).

## Special Considerations

In view of the cryptocurrency market — with which investors might battle to draw historical equals — and on the grounds that the underlying technology used to oversee blockchains may not be surely known by a large percentage of investors, there is adequate room for abuse. It very well may be challenging to distinguish whether a cryptocurrency is suitable, or on the other hand in the event that bilking investors was made.

Assessing why an altcoin is valued at a specific price requires an unexpected approach in comparison to determining the price of securities or traditional currencies. Altcoins are not backed by states, meaning investors can't take a gander at [gross domestic product](/gdp) (GDP) growth, debt levels, or [inflation](/inflation) to determine whether an altcoin is [undervalued](/undervalued) or [overvalued](/overvalued).

Adding to the confusion of whether an altcoin is really significant is that most data about altcoins is found on the Internet, where it very well may be challenging to pin down whether the data is true or just manufactured to make buzz.
