# Systematic Withdrawal Schedule
## What Is a Systematic Withdrawal Schedule?

A systematic withdrawal schedule is a method of pulling out funds from an annuity account that determines the amount and frequency of the payments to be made to the annuitant. Annuitants are not guaranteed lifelong payments as they are with the standard [annuitization](/annuitization) method, yet they give a flood of income to retired people.

With the systematic withdrawal schedule, one decides rather to pull out funds from an account until it is purged, bearing the risk that the funds become exhausted before one kicks the bucket.

## Understanding the Systematic Withdrawal Schedule

Systematic withdrawals are frequently applied to mutual funds, [annuities](/annuity), and sometimes for [brokerage accounts](/brokerageaccount). Systematic withdrawal schedules consider shares of investments to be liquidated to give the stated number of withdrawals in the plan.

## Special Considerations

Options in contrast to systematic withdrawal schedules incorporate investing an energy based segmentation approach, i.e., bucket strategy, into place; buying an immediate annuity from an insurance company and residing off the month to month benefit the company pays out. Other withdrawal methods can incorporate investing one's savings and spending just the interest and dividends and setting a year's worth of withdrawals in a money market fund for month to month withdrawals. In this last method, the funds would be renewed toward the finish of every year by selling off the investments with the highest yield. Every one of the three plans can turn out a revenue to a retired person.

## Advantages and Disadvantages of a Systematic Withdrawal Schedule

An advantage of a systematic withdrawal schedule is that it can streamline an individual's [wealth management](/wealthmanagement) strategy, especially during retirement. It can likewise assist with coming tax time.

The investor picking this withdrawal method, rather than the annuitization method, wouldn't be limited to a set amount of money consistently and could, as a matter of fact, eliminate the funds from the account moderately rapidly if essential. The ability to access funds could be valuable on account of an emergency.

The disadvantage is that it doesn't guarantee a lifelong income stream for the annuitant, putting the risk of a more extended than-anticipated life expectancy on the shoulders of the annuitant rather than on the insurance company offering the annuity. In the event that the annuity runs out, the retired person would require different types of revenue to fund their retirement.

## Illustration of a Systematic Withdrawal Schedule

Consider, for instance, an annuitant possessing four mutual funds. Fund A holds 35% of all funds, Fund B holds 30%, Fund C holds 20%, and Fund D holds 15%. In the event that the annuitant sets up a $2,000 month to month withdrawal, $700 (35%) of the withdrawal amount will come from Fund A, $600 (30%) would come from Fund B, $400 (20%) would come from Fund C, and $300 (15%) would come from Fund D.
