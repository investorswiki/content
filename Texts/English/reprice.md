## What Is Reprice?

Repricing includes the exchange of worthless [employee stock options](/eso) for new options that have intrinsic value. This is a common practice for companies to keep or boost executives and other profoundly valued employees when the value of the company's shares falls below the [exercise price](/exerciseprice) or break-even point for the options issued in the original incentive program.

## Grasping Reprice

While repricing isn't new, it turned into a common event after the Internet bubble burst in 2000 and again following the financial crisis of 2008-09 as many stock prices encountered a deep bear market. As company share prices dropped pointedly, employee stock options found themselves underwater, implying that their [strike prices](/strikeprice) transcended current market prices.

For example, a company might have issued employee stock options that could be exercised at $30 after a [vesting period](/vesting), when the shares traded at $35. This option effectively granted holders the right to buy shares at $30 no matter what the market price from now on. In any case, no one will consent to buy the stock at $30 in the event that it tumbles to $25 a share in the open market.

In this manner, to hold and boost executives and profoundly valued employees, companies basically reclaimed the worthless stock options and issued new options. The more up to date options would probably be struck close or just below the current price of the share price. This, in effect, is equivalent to a standard option being out-of-the-money (OTM). This is an important issue as many valued employees agreed to substantial pay cuts from previous positions while joining new companies. This is true, especially for new businesses. The hope is that the employee will compensate for any shortfall many times over as the company's stock price increases.

## Special Considerations

A few companies changed their incentive programs to grant restricted stock rather than stock options. Others issued options that changed over quickly into shares to dispose of vulnerability later on. Which route the company takes relies upon the tax and reporting issues unique to it. Repricing will increase the option expenses a firm must deduct from [net income](/netincome).

Likewise, the new stock options granted must utilize the current fair market value of the underlying stock as their "strike." For privately held companies, the board of directors must decide another value on the common stock of the company, and that straightforwardly influences generally existing shareholders.

Under the [Financial Accounting Standards Board](/fasb) (FASB) rules, when the company cancels an existing stock option and grants another option "six months and" after a day, it is technically not a reprice. Consequently, it evades variable accounting treatment. For that period of time among cancellation and new granting, the employee just has a commitment that they will get the new options.

Another approach is called a "restricted stock swap," the company cancels the underwater (worthless) stock options and replaces them with genuine restricted stock.

At last, the company might issue extra stock options, leaving the original options in place. This is called a "make-up grant." This puts existing shareholders at the risk of extra [dilution](/dilution) should the stock price flood, putting the original underwater options, harking back to the money.

## Features
- Repricing happens when a company resigns employee stock options that have become very out-of-the-money with new options that have a lower strike price.
- Repricing might have tax suggestions for both the responsible firm and beneficiaries.
- This is done when a company's share price falls well below the exercise price of the original employee stock options issue.
- By repricing, the company effectively replaces now-worthless options with those that have value to keep top managers or key employees.
## FAQ
### For what reason Do Companies Reprice Stock Options?
Stock options are viewed as incentives to draw in excellent ability to a firm, as well as to hold top notch ability, and much of the time, propel employees. At the point when the value of stock options becomes worthless due to adverse changes in the economy, companies will reprice the stock options to take value back to them.
### Might You Reprice at any point Stock Options?
Indeed, stock options can be repriced. There are numerous approaches to reprice stock options, including bringing the exercise price down to the current market price for outstanding options. Another method is altogether cancel the outstanding options and replace them with at-the-money options.
### Could You at any point Exercise Underwater Stock Options?
Indeed, technically you can exercise underwater stock options yet it isn't prescribed to do as such, in light of the fact that you will pay more for the shares than the current market price. For instance, on the off chance that your exercise price is $15 and the current market price of the stock is $12, you would pay more for the shares than they are worth assuming you exercised them. Moreover, practicing underwater options considers no tax-loss benefits.
