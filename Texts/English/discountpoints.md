# Discount Points
## What Are Discount Points?

Discount points are a type of [prepaid interest](/prepaidinterest) or fee that [mortgage](/mortgage) borrowers can purchase to bring down the amount of interest on their subsequent regularly scheduled payments — spending more up front to pay less later, in effect. Discount points are tax deductible.

## Understanding Discount Points

A type of [mortgage points](/points), discount points are a one-time, up-front mortgage closing cost that gives the borrower access to a discounted interest rate for the lifetime of the loan. Each discount point generally costs 1% of the total loan amount, and each point brings down the loan's interest rate by one-eighth to one-fourth of a percent.

For instance, on a $200,000 loan, each point would cost $2,000. Expecting the interest rate on the mortgage is 4.5% and each point brings down the interest rate by 0.25%, buying two points costs $4,000 and brings about an interest rate of 4.0%. Contingent upon the length of the mortgage at this interest rate, this could bring about huge savings over the long haul. We should take a gander at how the payments play out on such a loan — expecting the classic 30-year mortgage:

The longer the life span of a loan, the more you pay interest on it — that is the means by which financing works overall. So points are ideally appropriate for a [fixed-rate](/fixed-rate_mortgage), long-term mortgage (20 to 30 years) that most probable won't be refinanced anytime soon.

## Step by step instructions to Pay for Mortgage Points

A borrower who pays discount points is probably going to need to meet these costs from cash on hand. Notwithstanding, numerous situations exist, especially in buyer's real estate markets, in which a seller offers to pay up to a certain dollar amount of the [closing costs](/closingcosts). In the event that other closing costs, for example, the loan origination fee and the title insurance charge, don't meet this threshold, then the buyer can frequently add discount points and effectively bring down their interest rate for free.

Lessening your mortgage interest rate with discount points doesn't necessarily in all cases require paying from cash on hand — especially in a [refinance](/refinance) situation, in which the lender can roll discount points, as well as other closing costs, into the new loan balance. This prevents the borrower from hacking up more money at the closing table; of course, it likewise decreases their [equity position](/home_equity) in their home.

> Since the [Internal Revenue Service](/irs) (IRS) considers discount points to be prepaid mortgage interest, they generally are tax deductible over the life of the loan. In the event that they and the home purchase meet certain conditions, they can be completely deductible for the year when they were paid.

## Could You at any point Negotiate Mortgage Points?

Points are most certainly open to negotiation. The number of points you buy — or whether you buy any whatsoever — is up to you. Regularly, when lenders are displaying the mortgage options for which you qualify, they'll show you several distinct rates, including the ones that you can get assuming you purchase discount points.

Stringently talking, you're not arranging the actual points but rather a lower interest rate for the life span of the loan. The terms of the points — the cost of each point, and the amount it brings down the annual percentage rate (APR) — are basically fixed by the financial institution. In any case, they aren't set in stone. In the event that you've looked (consistently really smart while mortgage hunting) and can show them a better deal somewhere else, then, at that point, they could match it — particularly assuming that you have a strong credit history and appear to be a responsible, positive client.

> Albeit both are types of mortgage points, don't mistake discount points for [origination points](/originationpoints). Origination points are fees that lenders charge for concluding a mortgage — part of the closing costs on a home purchase. Origination points basically are a surcharge that doesn't connect with the interest rate and generally aren't optional, negotiable, or tax deductible.

## Would it be advisable for you to Buy Discount Points?

For lenders, discount points enjoy a distinct benefit: They receive cash up front, rather than sitting tight for money as interest payments over the long run. This can improve the financial institution's [liquidity](/liquidity).

Borrowers likewise gain benefits from discount points — the fundamental one being lower payments over the life of your loan. Fundamentally, you are paying some interest ahead of time — at the onset of your mortgage — in exchange for a diminished interest rate down the road. Nonetheless, this benefit applies provided that you plan to hold onto the mortgage sufficiently long to set aside cash from the more modest interest payments.

For instance, a borrower who pays $4,000 in discount points to save $80 each month in interest charges necessities to keep the loan for quite a long time, or four years and two months, to break even. On the off chance that the borrower figures they could sell the property or refinance their loan before 50 months have passed, then they ought to consider diminishing what they pay in discount points and taking a somewhat higher interest rate.

By and large, the longer that you plan to possess the home, the more that points assist you with saving money on interest over the life of the loan. By the day's end, however, the benefits of discount points rely upon the math. On the off chance that you can stand to shell out two or three thousand additional up front, then, at that point, they can bring about huge cost savings over the long term, especially assuming the home requires renovations. Or on the other hand they can be a superfluous cost that the borrower might have stayed away from with some more structured planning.
