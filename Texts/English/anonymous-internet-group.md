# Anonymous (Internet Group)
## What Is Anonymous (Internet Group)?

Anonymous is a loosely organized Internet group of hackers and political activists that started as a collective in 2003 on 4chan, an anonymous internet visit board. Members of the Anonymous community impart and work together through social network services and scrambled Internet discussion channels.

Anonymous is generally widely known for its digital assaults against states, government-associated groups, corporations, and the Church of Scientology.

People who wish to be recognized as part of the group wear Guy Fawkes covers in public to hide their characters. Fellow Fawkes, otherwise called Guido Fawkes, was a member of a group of provincial English Catholics who were engaged with the Gunpowder Plot — a failed death plot — of 1605. The Gunpowder Plot was an endeavor to secure greater strict tolerance under King James. In the wake of exploding the House of Lords, King James' residence, his girl Elizabeth, was to be introduced as the Catholic head of state.

Afterward, Fawkes would become inseparable from the Gunpowder Plot, the disappointment of which has been celebrated beginning around 1605 in the UK. On this day, Fawkes likeness is generally singed on a huge fire, commonly joined by firecrackers.

## Actions and Methods of Anonymous (Internet Group)

To the degree Anonymous has a cognizant ethos, it highlights decentralized networks keen on participating in mutual objectives. These objectives have historically gone from political statements to tricks and [hacks](/hacktivism), in some cases in reprisal for actions taken against the group itself — or those for whom members of a given operation feel an affinity.

Groups of Anonymous members have tossed support behind political developments, for example, the Arab Spring. Common methods of protest or counter incorporate "circulated denial of administration" (DDoS) assaults on states or organizations. Among the group's most exceptionally publicized activities are the actions taken against Visa, [Mastercard](/mastercard-card), and Paypal, in response to moves those organizations made to freeze payments to WikiLeaks in 2010. These actions are known as Operation Payback.

## Reach and Decline of Anonymous (Internet Group)

The decentralized idea of Anonymous can make it challenging to judge the degree of its compass or power in some random activity. In viable terms, the strength of an Anonymous action has all the earmarks of being proportional to the number of individuals intrigued and engaged with an action. This structure likewise means any loose group keen on participating in a collective operation can call itself Anonymous (or claim to be part of the group).

The frequency of operations claimed by Anonymous members declined essentially after the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) penetrated the group through a witness in 2011. A group of former hackers assisted the FBI in recognizing a major part in an arm of the group called LulzSec. This in the end prompted his capture. The captured hacker, referred to online as Sabu, turned into a witness. LulzSec disbanded and Sabu made a subsequent operation, AntiSec, in its wake, this time under the course of the FBI. A hacking operation that yielded private data — including credit card numbers — from the geopolitical intelligence firm Strategic Forecasting, otherwise called Stratfor, prompted the capture of another Anonymous-connected hacker.

The identity and structure of Anonymous make it challenging to decide the specific effects of these occasions. The undeniable lull in claims made by the group soon after 2011 drove speculation that greater watchfulness among members drove major players to keep a lower profile. Nonetheless, the group keeps on declaring actions and issue alerts by means of its official website and Twitter account.
