# Decentralized Finance (DeFi)
DeFi means "decentralized finance" and alludes to the ecosystem involved financial applications that are being developed on top of blockchain systems.
DeFi might be defined as the movement that advances the utilization of decentralized organizations and open source software to make numerous types of financial services and products. The thought is to create and operate financial [DApps](/decentralized-applications-dapps) on top of a transparent and trustless system, for example, permissionless blockchains and other peer-to-peer (P2P) protocols.
Right now, the three biggest elements of DeFi are:
- Making monetary banking services (e.g., issuance of stablecoins)
- Giving peer-to-peer or pooled lending and borrowing platforms
- Empowering advanced financial instruments, for example, DEX, tokenization platforms, derivatives and expectations markets

Inside those three fields, there are several types of DeFi services. A couple of different instances of products and utilize cases incorporate funding protocols, software development tools, [index](/index) construction, subscription payment protocols, and data analysis applications. DeFi dApps may likewise be utilized for [KYC](/knowyourclient), [AML](/aml), and other identity management services.
Decentralized finance brings various benefits when compared to traditional financial services. Using [smart contracts](/smart-contract) and distributed systems, conveying a financial application or product turns out to be substantially less complex and secure. For example, numerous dApps are being developed on top of the Ethereum blockchain, which gives diminished operational costs and lower entry barriers.
Summarizing, the DeFi movement is shifting traditional financial products to the open source and decentralized world, which eliminates the requirement for middle people, lessens overall costs, and extraordinarily further develops security.
