<!--AFAB929DEAF021FDF9D147BD62C333FC-->
They devise their strategy and place a stop-limit buy order at $1,121. $1,121 is the [trigger](/trade-trigger) price meaning the stop order portion of the price will be triggered at this level. But the trader wants to control the amount they pay, therefore they limit the price they will pay to $1,122. That means assuming the price moves above $1,121 they will buy any shares available between $1,121 and $1,122, but no higher.

The price moves above $1,121 and the order is filled, expect at an average price of $1,121.30. On the off chance that the price would have gapped above $1,121 and opened the next day at $1,125, the trader would have received no shares due to their buy stop-limit order. On the off chance that they utilized a standard buy stop order (no restriction), they would purchase at any price above $1,121 which means they would have bought at $1,125.

The price didn't gap higher though, thus the trader was filled with their buy stop limit at $1,121.30. Now that they realize they have a position, they place another order to exit at a profit. The trader accepts the price will try to climb to test the $1,200 region. They place a sell limit order just below that at $1,195. At the time this order is placed the price is close $1,121, so an order at $1,195 is over the market. The price proceeds higher and eventually hits the trader's sell order at $1,195, closing out the trade for a profit of $73.70 per share.
