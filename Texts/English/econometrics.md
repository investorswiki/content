# Econometrics
## What Is Econometrics?

Econometrics is the utilization of statistical and mathematical models to foster theories or test existing [hypotheses](/hypothesistesting) in economics and to [forecast](/forecasting) future trends from historical data. It subjects real-world data to statistical trials and afterward compares the results against the theory being tried.

Contingent upon whether you are interested in testing an existing theory or in utilizing existing data to foster another hypothesis, econometrics can be partitioned into two major categories: theoretical and applied. The people who routinely participate in this practice are commonly known as econometricians.

## Understanding Econometrics

Econometrics dissects data involving statistical methods to test or foster economic theory. These methods rely on statistical inferences to measure and examine economic theories by leveraging tools, for example, [frequency distributions](/frequencydistribution), probability, and [probability distributions](/probabilitydistribution), statistical inference, correlation analysis, simple and different regression analysis, simultaneous conditions models, and time series methods.

Econometrics was pioneered by [Lawrence Klein](/lawrence-klein), Ragnar Frisch, and [Simon Kuznets](/simon-kuznets). Every one of the three won the Nobel Prize in economics for their contributions. Today, it is utilized regularly among scholastics as well as practitioners like Wall Street traders and analysts.

An illustration of the application of econometrics is to study the [income effect](/incomeeffect) utilizing observable data. An economist might conjecture that as a person increases their income, their spending will likewise increase.

In the event that the data show that such an association is present, a [regression](/regression) analysis can then be led to understand the strength of the relationship among income and consumption and whether or not that relationship is statistically critical — that is, it appears to be far-fetched that it is due to chance alone.

## Methods of Econometrics

The first step to econometric methodology is to get and examine a set of data and characterize a specific hypothesis that makes sense of the nature and state of the set. This data might be, for instance, the historical prices for a stock index, observations collected from a survey of consumer finances, or unemployment and inflation rates in different countries.

Assuming you are interested in the relationship between the annual price change of the [S&P 500](/sp500) and the unemployment rate, you'd collect the two sets of data. Then, at that point, you could test the possibility that higher unemployment prompts lower stock market prices. In this model, stock market price would be the dependent variable and the unemployment rate is the independent or explanatory variable.

The most common relationship is linear, implying that any change in the explanatory variable will have a positive correlation with the dependent variable. This relationship could be explored with a simple regression model, which adds up to generating a best-fit line between the two sets of data and afterward testing to perceive how far every data point is, on average, from that line.

Note that you can have several explanatory variables in your analysis — for instance, changes to GDP and inflation notwithstanding unemployment in making sense of stock market prices. At the point when more than one explanatory variable is utilized, it is referred to as [multiple linear regression](/mlr). This is the most commonly involved tool in econometrics.

### Different Regression Models

There are several different regression models that are optimized relying upon the nature of the data being dissected and the type of inquiry being posed. The most common model is the ordinary [least squares](/least-squares-technique) (OLS) regression, which can be directed on several types of [cross-sectional](/cross_sectional_analysis) or time-series data. On the off chance that you're interested in a binary (yes-no) result — for example, that you are so liable to be fired from a job in light of your productivity — you could utilize a strategic regression or a probit model. Today, econometricians have hundreds of models at their disposal.

Econometrics is presently directed utilizing statistical analysis software bundles intended for these purposes, like STATA, SPSS, or R. These software bundles can likewise effectively test for statistical significance to determine the probability that correlations could arise by chance. [R-squared](/r-squared),[ t-tests](/t-test), [p-values](/p-value), and [null-hypothesis](/null_hypothesis) testing are methods utilized by econometricians to assess the legitimacy of their model results.

## Limitations of Econometrics

Econometrics is now and again criticized for relying too vigorously on the interpretation of raw data without connecting it to laid out economic theory or searching for causal instruments. It is crucial that the discoveries revealed in the data are able to be sufficiently made sense of by a theory, even on the off chance that that means fostering your own theory of the underlying processes.

Regression analysis additionally doesn't prove causation, and just in light of the fact that two data sets show an association, it very well might be spurious. For instance, drowning passings in pools increase with GDP. Does a growing economy make individuals drown? This is far-fetched, however perhaps more individuals buy pools when the economy is blasting. Econometrics is largely concerned with correlation analysis, and it is important to remember that correlation doesn't approach causation.

## The Bottom Line

Econometrics is a popular discipline that integrates statistical tools and modeling for economic data, and it is frequently utilized by policymakers to forecast the result of policy changes. Like with other statistical tools, there are numerous opportunities for error when econometric tools are utilized carelessly. Econometricians must be careful to justify their decisions with sound reasoning as well as statistical inferences.

## Features
- Econometrics can likewise be utilized to try to forecast future economic or financial trends.
- A few economists have criticized the field of econometrics for prioritizing statistical models over economic reasoning.
- Econometrics relies on procedures, for example, regression models and null hypothesis testing.
- Econometrics is the utilization of statistical methods to foster theories or test existing speculations in economics or finance.
- Similarly as with other statistical tools, econometricians ought to be careful not to infer a causal relationship from statistical correlation.
## FAQ
### What Is Autocorrelation in Econometrics?
[Autocorrelation](/autocorrelation) measures the relationships between a single variable at different time spans. For this reason, it is once in a while called lagged correlation or serial correlation, since it is utilized to measure how the past value of a certain variable could predict future values of a similar variable. Autocorrelation is a valuable tool for traders, particularly in technical analysis.
### What Is Endogeneity in Econometrics?
A [endogenous variable](/endogenous-variable) is a variable that is impacted by changes in another variable. Due to the complexity of economic systems, it is hard to determine every one of the unpretentious relationships between different factors, and a few variables might be partially endogenous and partially exogenous. In econometric studies, the researchers must be careful to account for the possibility that the [error term](/errorterm) might be partially correlated with other variables.
### What Are Estimators in Econometrics?
An estimator is a statistic that is utilized to estimate some reality or measurement about a larger population. Estimators are frequently utilized in circumstances where estimating the entire population isn't practical. For instance, it is preposterous to expect to measure the specific employment rate at a specific time, yet it is feasible to estimate unemployment in light of a randomly-picked sample of the population.
