# Peer-to-Peer (P2P)
Peer-to-peer (frequently abbreviated as P2P) is a distributed networking or computing architecture that partitions tasks or responsibilities across several computer systems (every one going about as an individual peer). P2P networks can be utilized to share any sort of digital data, including cryptocurrencies.
In a P2P network, each peer might be alluded to as a node, and the collective work of these nodes keeps up with the system ready. In this specific circumstance, every node (peer) acts both as a client and as a server comparable to different nodes. This means that all peers play a similar job, getting and broadcasting digital data.
Consequently, the structure of a P2P network is supported by its users, who can both give and use resources. There is no such thing as a central server or host, which makes P2P systems totally different from traditional client-server models, where the data is distributed unidirectionally (from a centralized server to its clients).
The decentralized structure of P2P systems makes them highly resistant to cyber assaults and furthermore more versatile. The more users go along with it, the stronger and adaptable it gets. Bigger P2P networks accomplish high levels of security since there is no single point of disappointment (inherent to the more traditional models).
The peer-to-peer architecture became famous in 1999 with the release of document sharing systems, where users could share digital sound records with others without depending on a central server or host. From that point forward, different P2P networks have arisen. Famous models with differing use cases incorporate BitTorrent (record sharing), Tor (anonymous communication software), and Bitcoin (decentralized economic system).
P2P technology plays an important job in the [blockchain](/blockchain) and cryptocurrency industries. At the point when [Bitcoin](/bitcoin) was made, [Satoshi Nakamoto](/satoshi-nakamoto) defined it as a "Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System." This means that users can send and receive Bitcoins from one side of the planet to the other without depending on a central server or go-betweens. In different terms, Bitcoin is a decentralized and distributed form of money, kept up with by a big network of computer nodes.
