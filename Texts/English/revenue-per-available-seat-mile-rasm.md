# Revenue Per Available Seat Mile (RASM)
## What Is Revenue Per Available Seat Mile (RASM)?

Revenue per accessible seat mile (RASM) is a unit of measurement commonly used to compare the effectiveness of different airlines. It is acquired by partitioning operating income by [available seat miles](/availableseatmiles) (ASM). Generally, the higher the RASM, the more profitable the airline under question. Revenue is addressed in pennies and isn't exclusively limited to ticket sales, as different factors of productivity and profitability are considered.

## Figuring out Revenue Per Available Seat Mile (RASM)

Revenue per accessible seat mile (RASM) is a term airlines use to portray and assess their [financial performance](/financialperformance). Revenue per accessible seat mile (RASM) is more enveloping than total revenue since it factors in all operating revenue, in terms of capacity, as opposed to just passenger revenue.

Revenue per accessible seat mile (RASM) has been adopted as a most loved standard unit of measurement by most airlines and [investment analysts](/expert) that follow the airlines. Pundits battle, notwithstanding, that airlines, as most businesses, have customarily preferred the utilization of metrics that can project them in the best conceivable light.

By unequivocally including all wellsprings of revenue, RASM incorporates the heap of revenue sources air transporters have explored different avenues regarding including fees or charges for stuff, seat selection, food and drink, and Wi-Fi. Airlines list their RASM — likewise alluded to as "operating unit revenue" — in their quarterly and annual [financial statements](/financial-statements).

## Computing Revenue Per Available Seat Mile (RASM)

The RASM addresses the total operating revenue per seat (vacant or full) flown per mile. To work out their RASM for a given period, an airline partitions its total operating revenues by the accessible seat miles:

RASM = Total Operating Revenues/Available Seat Miles.

Total [operating revenue](/operating-revenue) is the income the airline produces from its primary business activities. This incorporates the money airlines make from selling tickets and money from seat overhauls, stuff fees, food and refreshments, and reservation change fees.

Accessible seat miles (ASM) measures the carrying capacity of an airplane that is accessible to create revenue. To compute seat miles, the airline increases the accessible seats on a plane by the number of miles that plane will fly per flight.

> Airlines incorporate income derived from their normal regular business operations in their RASM calculation and reject one-time operating adjustments or occasions, for example, the sale of company [assets](/resource).

## Revenue Per Available Seat Mile (RASM) versus Cost Per Available Seat Mile (CASM)

[Cost per accessible seat mile](/casm) (CASM) — otherwise called "unit cost" or "operating expenses per ASM" — is another common metric airlines use to measure productivity and performance. CASM is a measure of cost proficiency and addresses the average cost to fly an aircraft seat (either vacant or ticketed) one mile. CASM varies from RASM in a critical manner. While RASM centers around revenues earned, CASM centers around expenses influencing an airline's [bottom line](/bottomline).

Airlines remember different operating costs for their CASM calculation, for example, operating expenses, maintenance expenses, administration, and [overhead](/overhead). One analysis of CASM is that a few airlines bar fuel costs in their calculation, which then calls into question the exactness of the measurement.

To work out CASM, the airlines partition their operating costs by the accessible seat miles. The CASM is measured in pennies. Airlines generally report this [metric](/metrics) on their quarterly and annual financial statements. A low CASM demonstrates the airline is efficient at dealing with its costs, which could lead to higher profit edges.

This differentiations with RASM, which measures the revenue or income the airline produces. Airlines aim for a high and developing RASM as a measurement of financial strength.

## Special Considerations

Revenue per accessible seat mile (RASM) is an especially important measurement for low-cost airlines. Large numbers of these airlines discount the cost of their fundamental fares altogether to draw in customers. Basically the same as the [loss leader strategy](/lossleader) common in retail sales, the airlines know the revenue they produce from these essential fares will likely not be sufficient to keep up with profitability.

All things considered, the airline should become skilled at [upselling](/intriguing selling), or tempting the customer to purchase extra things, for example, inflight amusement, feasts, and drinks. Since RASM incorporates these forms of revenue, it's an important measurement in tracking an airline's financial performance.

## Highlights
- Airlines use revenue per accessible seat mile (RASM) to measure the total operating revenue they create per seat (unfilled or full) per mile flown.
- The calculation for revenue per accessible seat mile (RASM) is total operating revenues partitioned by the accessible seat miles.
- Airlines favor involving RASM as a measurement to show their financial performance since it incorporates extra wellsprings of revenue, for example, stuff fees, reservation change fees, and inflight dinners.
