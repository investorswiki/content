## What Is the Revenue Regulation Fund (RRF)?

The term Revenue Regulation Fund (RRF) alludes to a [sovereign wealth fund](/sovereign_wealth_fund) (SWF) laid out and worked by the government of Algeria. Founded in 2000, it is officially known as the **Fond de Regulation des Recettes.** It was Africa's largest sovereign wealth fund. The RRF is funded basically by [tax](/taxes) revenue collected from companies taking advantage of the nation's oil and gas reserves. There was no refreshed data accessible for the fund as of June 2022.

## Understanding the Revenue Regulation Fund (RRF)

Sovereign wealth funds are state-owned [investment vehicles](/investmentvehicle). The beginning of these funds might be commodity-or noncommodity-related. Funding is derived from different sources including fiscal [surpluses](/surplus), tax revenue, resource exports, surpluses from the balance of payments, and [transfer of payments](/transferpayment) from the government.

The purpose of individual funds might fluctuate. These objectives might include saving for people in the future, funding social and economic development, funding for a nation's private sector, political reasons, protecting an economy from [volatility](/volatility) in [commodity](/commodity) prices, as well as capital growth and preservation.

The Revenue Regulation Fund or the Fond de Regulation des Recettes was one of Africa's largest sovereign wealth funds. As referenced above, it was laid out in 2000 in Algeria, Africa's largest nation in body of land, with the Sahara Desert making up four-fifths of its nation. The fund starts from surplus [revenues](/revenue) earned from taxes on the development of Algeria's hydrocarbons â€” essentially its oil and gas reserves. The primary justification for its send off was to act as an economic stabilization factor to cushion the impact of volatility in oil and gas prices on the government of Algeria.

Like most SWFs, the RRF works largely out of the public eye and its operations are wrapped in secrecy. It had about $57 billion in [assets under management](/aum) (AUM) starting around 2012, as per a report from the European Investment Bank. That figure developed to $72.6 billion of every 2019, as reported in Ressources, a French-language magazine that covers natural resources industries in Africa. In any case, Sovereign Wealth Fund Institute, an organization that provides data on the world's SWFs and positions them in light of [assets](/resource), reported that the RRF had no assets as of June 2022.

## Revenue Regulation Fund (RRF) versus Other Sovereign Wealth Funds

The Brown Capital Management Africa Forum noticed that there was an increased interest in state-supported investment funds like the RRF throughout recent years. They will quite often be laid out in response to high commodity prices or large foreign exchange reserves. Albeit some investment funds are recent manifestations by developing nations, others are deep rooted. Africa's numerous sovereign wealth funds are somewhat new and unpredictable.

RRF is among the numerous SWFs found in Africa. The Libyan Investment Authority, laid out by oil-rich Libya, has about $67 billion in assets. A lot more modest funds are run by the governments of Botswana (the Pula Fund: $4.1 billion), Angola (Fundo Soberano de Angola: $3 billion), and Nigeria (Nigeria Sovereign Investment Authority: $3 billion).

As of June 2022, the five largest SWFs in the world were:

- Norway Government Pension Fund Global: $1.34 trillion
- China Investment Corporation: $1.22 trillion
- Abu Dhabi Investment Authority: $708.8 billion
- [Kuwait Investment Authority](/kia): $708.4 billion
- GIC Private Limited: $690 billion
