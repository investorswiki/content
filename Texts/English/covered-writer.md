# Covered Writer
## What Is a Covered Writer?

A covered writer is an investor or trader who holds the [underlying security](/underlying-security) as a [hedge](/hedge) against the options contract they are selling. Since the investor as of now possesses the underlying asset, they might cover any call before or at the expiration date of the option, in this way limiting risk.

## Figuring out a Covered Writer

A covered writer is an options seller who claims the underlying asset addressed by the [options contract](/optionscontract). Since the covered writer holds the underlying security, if and when the option contract is worked out, the covered writer can "cover" the understanding without the need to go out of the shadows marketplace.

Covered writers limit their risk by possessing the underlying security. This strategy is a conservative approach and is as opposed to [naked writing](/naked-writer). Naked composing is the point at which the options seller doesn't hold the underlying security, and whenever called, must go into the market to buy the asset.

## How Does a Covered Writer Make Money?

The covered writer profits by getting [premiums](/premium) paid by the purchaser of the options contract. Those contracts give the buyer of the option the right, yet not the obligation, to buy, on the off chance that it's a [call](/calloption), or sell, assuming it's a put, the asset at a specific price on or by a specific future date.

Envision you own 100 shares of ZXY stock, which is trading at $100 per share. You can sell the right, or the option, to buy that stock six months in the future at a set price of $105.

Since that stock could be worth more than $105 toward the finish of the six months, the buyer of the option will pay $5 per share for the opportunity to buy the ZXY stock at a potential discounted rate later. The buyer has no obligation to buy the stock should the asset devalue before the [expiration date](/expirationdate) of the option. In the present, the seller gets $500 premium for their stock, and might possibly earn $10,500 assuming the buyer decides to buy the stock toward the finish of six months.

By paying this premium, the buyer is investing in a certain amount of risk by betting that the stock could go up. For instance, toward the finish of six months, the stock could rise to $125, and that means the buyer could sell it for $12,500.

## Covered Writers in Other Situations

Option contracts might turn out to be very convoluted by their association with stock trading and the application of a call option on a physical property. In the event that you are a homeowner, you could get yourself a covered writer.

For instance, Robert possesses a home worth $300,000 and a We-R-Land Development approaches him with an offer to buy the property for $350,000. Be that as it may, the engineer will possibly buy the property assuming specific real estate laws are put set up throughout the next five years.

Operating as a covered writer, Robert might sell the designer a call option on the property with a price of the option at a 3% payment of the all out cost, or $10,500. We-R-Land Development may then secure the $350,000 purchase price no matter what the [market value](/marketvalue) increase of the home toward the finish of those five years.

Nonetheless, in the event that the real estate laws are not sanctioned and the designer decides not to buy the property, as the covered writer, Robert will in any case have made $10,500.
