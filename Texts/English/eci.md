# Employment Cost Index (ECI)
## What Is Employment Cost Index (ECI)?

The Employment Cost Index (ECI) is a quarterly economic series distributed by the Bureau of Labor Statistics that subtleties the growth of total employee compensation. The index is prepared and distributed by the [Bureau of Labor Statistics](/bls) (BLS), a unit of the United States Department of Labor.

It tracks movement in the cost of labor, as measured by wages and benefits, at all levels of a company. The data is broken down by industry group, occupation, and union versus non-union workers. The data is accumulated through separate surveys of non-ranch businesses (around 4,500 inspected) and state and nearby governments (around 1,000 tested). The index has a base weighting of 100.

Wages track the amount employers pay in salaries and hourly labor while benefits measure a combination of health care coverage, retirement plans and paid downtime. Employees regularly see their paychecks broken down into these two parts with an overwhelming majority of the payment coming from wages. Employers utilize the index to assess the labor market and the amount of raises they can doll out each quarter.

## Understanding Employment Cost Index (ECI)

The Employment Cost Index basically measures the change in total employee compensation each quarter. It is based on a survey of employer payrolls directed by the Bureau of Labor Statistics in the last month of each quarter. The thought is that wage pressure increases in lockstep with inflation since compensation tends to increase before companies climb prices for consumers.

In this way, it is viewed as an inflationary tailwind when the Employment Cost Index exhibits a steepening trend line or a surprisingly extraordinary increase for a given period. Likewise, as [inflation](/inflation) increases, yields and interest rates additionally rise, bringing about a lessening in bond prices.

Economists utilize the index to measure the change in labor costs and check the strength of the economy. It shows how the cost of compensating employees change each passing quarter. A vertical slanting trend generally addresses a strong and developing economy. At the end of the day, employers are giving profits to their employees through wages and benefits.

Employee benefits are calculated as cost each hour worked across 21 benefits, going from [Social Security](/socialsecurity) to paid downtime for occasions. The survey covers all occupation in the private economy, excluding ranches and families, and the public sector, minus the Federal government. The BLS distributes gauges for every one of these categories notwithstanding seasonally adjusted and non seasonally adjusted headline numbers.

## Special Considerations

Businesses and the federal government utilize the index for two unique reasons. Employers notice the index to make suitable adjustments in pay and benefits over time. Assuming that the index bounces 2% from the previous year or quarter, an employer might be leaned to give workers an equivalent raise. At times, employers might receive a larger raise to draw in the best ability. Government agencies, then again, watch the benchmark index to check the strength of the economy. It can illuminate authorities when the economy is overheating or the state of wage growth.

### Investors

The ECI is watched by investors largely for its inflationary bits of knowledge. Wages address the overwhelming majority of the total cost for a company to create a product or deliver a service in the marketplace. The relative percentage will fluctuate by industry, making the data release important on a between industry level.

ECI is one of the super economic indicators utilized by the Federal Reserve to set monetary policy. One more benefit of the methodology utilized in the ECI is that wage changes that happen because of a shift in the occupational mix of workers can be caught here utilizing a "crate of occupations" approach like that of the CPI. Consequences of the ECI are more averse to be impacted by individuals shifting to lower or more lucrative positions.

ECI is a lagging indicator; rising costs at this level address economic overheating that has proactively been noticeable at before points in the economic food chain (commodity costs, retail sales, gross domestic product), and recommend that some rise in inflation is unavoidable.

This indicator can move the markets assuming it shows stamped differences from street gauges. Rising compensation costs are typically given to consumers since they are a large corporate expense.

The ECI is utilized as part of the formula that works out productivity. Investors ought to continuously compare the ECI to total productivity figures, paying particular consideration regarding relative rates inside industries in which they have a stake.

- Hourly earnings displayed in the month to month "Employment Situation Report" give some progress into each release, taking a portion of the surprise value out of wages.
- ECI can be unpredictable when periodic bonuses, commission payments and so forth are considered (especially at year-end); economist interpretation is frequently expected to process the report completely.
