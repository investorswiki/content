# Copula
## What Is a Copula?

Copula is a likelihood model that addresses a multivariate [uniform distribution](/uniform-distribution), which looks at the association or reliance between numerous variables. Put in an unexpected way, a copula separates the joint or marginal probabilities of a pair of variables that are enmeshed in a more complex multivariate system. The copula is then the unique index or set of directions for portraying how those pairs fit together in the more complex system. This method is valuable as it can help distinguish [spurious correlations](/spurious_correlation) saw in the data. It is likewise helpful in fine-tuning derivatives pricing models where the price of one security relies upon the price of some [underlying security](/underlying-security) (e.g., an options contract or CDO).

Albeit the statistical calculation of a copula was developed in 1959, it was not applied to financial markets and finance until the late 1990s.

## Figuring out Copulas

Latin for "connection" or "tie," copulas are a set of mathematical devices utilized in finance to assist with recognizing capital adequacy, market risk, credit risk, and operational risk. Copulas depend on the reliance of returns of at least two assets, and would typically be calculated utilizing the [correlation coefficient](/correlationcoefficient). Notwithstanding, correlation works best with [normal distributions](/normaldistribution), while distributions in financial markets are most frequently non-normal in nature. The copula, subsequently, has been applied to areas of finance, for example, options pricing and portfolio [value-at-risk](/var) (VaR) to deal with slanted or asymmetric distributions.

Copulas are very complex mathematical capabilities and require sophisticated calculations and computing power to be useful in genuine applications.

> Copulas were first developed by mathematician Abe Sklar in 1959. Sklar's theorem states that any multivariate joint distribution can be simplified and communicated in terms of univariate marginal distribution capabilities alongside a unique copula that contains the data on how those distributions fit together.

## Copulas and Options Pricing

Options theory, especially options pricing is an exceptionally specific area of finance. Multivariate options are widely utilized where there is a need to hedge against a number of risks at the same time, for example, when there is an exposure to several currencies. The pricing of a basket of options is certainly not a simple task. Progressions in [Monte Carlo simulation methods](/montecarlosimulation) and copula capabilities offer an enhancement to the pricing of bivariate contingent claims, like derivatives with embedded options.

## Features
- The word copula comes from the Latin for "connection" or "tie" together, where the term is utilized in phonetics to portray such connecting words or expressions.
- Today, copulas are employed in advanced financial analysis to better comprehend results that include fat tails and skewness.
- A copula is a statistical method for figuring out the joint probabilities of a multivariate distribution.
