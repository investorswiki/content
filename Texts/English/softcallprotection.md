# Soft Call Provision
## What Is Soft Call Provision?

A soft call provision is a feature added to [fixed-income securities](/fixed-incomesecurity), which becomes effective after the [hard call protection](/hardcallprotection) has passed, that specifies a premium be paid by the [issuer](/issuer) if early [redemption](/redemption) happens.

## Seeing Soft Call Provision

A company issues [bonds](/bond) to fund-raise to satisfy short-term debt obligations or fund long-term capital ventures. Investors who purchase these bonds loan money to the issuer in return for periodic interest payments, known as [coupons](/coupon), which address the return on the bond. At the point when the bond develops, the principal investment is repaid to bondholders.

In some cases bonds are callable and will be featured as such in the [trust indenture](/trust_indenture) when issued. A [callable bond](/callablebond) is beneficial to the issuer when interest rates drop since this would mean recovering the existing bonds early and reissuing new bonds at lower interest rates. Nonetheless, a callable bond is definitely not an appealing venture for bond investors, as this would mean interest payments will be stopped once the bond is "called."

To empower investment in these securities, an issuer might incorporate a [call protection](/callprotection) provision on the bonds. This provision can be a hard call protection, where the issuer can't call the bond inside that time span, or a soft call provision, which happen after the hard call protection has expired.

A soft call provision expands a callable bond's engaging quality, which acts as an additional restriction for issuers would it be advisable for them they choose to early reclaim the issue. Callable bonds might carry soft call protection notwithstanding, or in place of, hard call protection. A soft call provision expects that the issuer pay bondholders a [premium to par](/premiumbond) in the event that the bond is called early, typically after the hard call protection has passed.

> Convertible bonds can incorporate both soft and hard call provisions, where the hard call can terminate, however the soft provision frequently has variable terms.

## Special Considerations

The thought behind a soft call protection is to deter the issuer from calling or changing over the bond. Nonetheless, the soft call protection doesn't stop the issuer to call in the bond. The bond might be called in the long run, yet the provision brings down the risk for the investor by ensuring a certain level of return on the security.

Soft call protection can be applied to a commercial lender and borrower arrangement. [Commercial loans](/commercial-loan) may incorporate soft call provisions to keep the borrower from refinancing when interest rates drop. The terms of the contract might require payment of a premium upon the refinancing of a loan inside a certain period in the wake of closing that diminishes the lenders' effective yield.

## Soft Call versus Hard Call

A hard call protection shields bondholders from having their bonds called before a certain time has elapsed. For instance, the trust indenture on a 10-year bond could state that the bond will stay uncallable for a considerable length of time. This means that the investor will partake in the interest income that is paid for no less than six years before the issuer can choose to retire the bonds from the market.

A soft call provision could likewise show that a bond can't be recovered early in the event that it is trading over its issue price. For a [convertible bond](/convertiblebond), the soft call provision in the indenture could stress that the underlying stock arrives at a certain level before changing over the bonds. For instance, the trust indenture could state that callable bondholders be paid 3% to the premium on the principal call date, 2% a year after the hard call protection, and 1% assuming the bond is called three years after the expiration of the hard call provision.
