# SEC Form NSAR-A
## What Is SEC Form NSAR-A?

SEC Form NSAR-A was a semi-annual filing with the [Securities and Exchange Commission](/sec) (SEC) that registered the financial information of investment management companies at the end of the initial six months of their [fiscal year](/fiscalyear) (FY) as part of their N-SAR form filing requirement. The form was phased out in 2018, and replaced with Form N-CEN.

## Understanding SEC Form NSAR-A

The [N-SAR](/sec-form-n-sar) was specific to registered investment management companies, requiring them to unveil financial information, like sales of shares, and portfolio turnover rate, included in the company's annual or semi-annual shareholder reports.

SEC Form NSAR-An and all of its related filings were covered under Section 30 of the [Investment Company Act of 1940](/investmentcompanyact) and Sections 13 and 15(d) of the [Securities Exchange Act of 1934](/seact1934), which each require investment companies and trusts to file semi-annual and annual reports with the SEC.

In addition to financial information, the form also gave a few details on an investment management company's leadership, advisors, [underwriters](/underwriter), and affiliations. The form was instituted to safeguard investors by providing basic information so they could pick a company they trust with their investments.

> Form N-SAR and its associated filings are no longer required to be filed by investment companies, although the SEC accepted Forms N-SAR, and amendments to recently filed Forms N-SAR, up until June 1, 2019.

## SEC Form NSAR-A versus SEC Form N-CEN

SEC Form N-CEN was introduced to modernize investment company reporting. However it contains many of the same elements present in SEC Form NSAR-A, it also replaced or eliminated outdated things found in the old form with additional relevant ones. Many of the changes were made to reflect current needs, including information regarding securities lending and [exchange-traded funds](/etf) (ETFs).

Another notable change was the time span covered. SEC Form N-CEN ought to be filed annually, rather than at regular intervals, and submitted within 75 days of the end of the fund's FY.

All registered investment companies are required to file the new N-CEN document in Extensible Markup Language (XML) format. In any case, as an alternative, an online electronic form that can be manually inputted has also been made available on the SEC's [Electronic Document Gathering, Analysis and Retrieval](/edgar) (EDGAR) system.
