## What Is Coattail Investing?

Coattail investing is an investment strategy mirroring the trades of notable and generally fruitful investors. By setting these trades, investors "ride the coattails" of regarded investors in order to bring in money in their own accounts.

Today, through public filings, media coverage, and reports written by fund managers, the average investor can rapidly realize where these big investors are setting their money.

## How Coattail Investing Works

The [Securities and Exchange Commission](/sec) (SEC) requires investors who oversee more than $100 million to unveil their holdings once at regular intervals. This information is contained in [SEC Form 13F](/form-13f), which can be openly gotten to online by the public.

By perusing these filings, investors can keep track of the investment choices of generally fruitful investors like Warren Buffett or Carl Icahn. In doing as such, notwithstanding, investors ought to know that as a result of the 90-day defer in getting new information, they might act "in conflict" with the investor they wish to impersonate.

Investors who wish to carry out a coattail investing strategy ought to likewise be careful while concluding which model investor to pick. For example, long-term investors who wish to limit incessant changes to their portfolio might be better fit to follow Warren Buffett as compared to a [activist investor](/activist-investor) like Carl Icahn. Then again, investors with short time skylines may not be appropriate to following Buffett's naturally understanding way of investing.

> Since timing is ostensibly more important for activist investors, coattail investing might be more proper for 'purchase and-hold' investors that have long time skylines.

To represent the course of coattail investing, consider the 13F filing made on August 14, 2019, by Berkshire Hathaway (BRK), Warren Buffett's holding company. From this filing, we can see that for the quarter ending June 30, 2019, Buffett increased his positions in Amazon (AMZN), Bank of America (BAC), U.S. Bancorp (USB), and Red Hat (RHT) by roughly 11%, 3.5%, 2.5%, and 1.2%, individually. We can likewise see that he reduced his position in Charter Communications (CHTR) by just under 5%.

Any remaining positions in Buffett's portfolio were unchanged, mirroring his generally stable investment style. Investors wishing to copy Buffett's approach could regularly audit his company's 13F filings and adjust their portfolios likewise.
