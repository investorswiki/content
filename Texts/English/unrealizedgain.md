# Unrealized Gain
## What Is an Unrealized Gain?

An unrealized gain is an increase in the value of a [asset](/asset, for example, a stock position or a commodity like gold, that presently can't seem to be sold for cash.

A gain becomes [realized](/realizedprofit) when the position is sold for a profit. It is workable for an unrealized gain to be deleted assuming that the asset's value dips under the price at which it was bought.

## How an Unrealized Gain Works

An unrealized gain happens when the [current price](/currentprice) of a security is higher than the price the investor initially paid for the security, incorporating any fees associated with the purchase. Numerous investors calculate the current value of their investment [portfolios](/portfolio) in view of unrealized values. By and large, [capital gains](/capitalgain) are taxed just when they are sold and become realized.

At the point when unrealized gains are available, it ordinarily means an investor accepts the investment has room for higher future gains. If not, they would sell now and perceive the current gain.

Investors might decide to sit on unrealized gains for tax benefits. Most assets held for over one year are taxed at the long-term [capital gains tax](/capital_gains_tax) rate, which is either 0%, 15%, or 20% relying upon one's income. Assets held for one year or less are taxed as ordinary income, with rates going from 10% to 37%.

In 2022, a single filer making $41,675 will pay 0% on realized long-term capital gains, and an individual making $459,750 will pay just 15%. Assuming those equivalent individuals held their investments for one year or less, their realized gains would be taxed at the 22% and 35% rates separately.

An investor may likewise decide to hold on to sell investments on the off chance that gains realized late in the year would place them in a higher tax bracket and, in this way, increase their tax burden. That investor might be better off waiting until January to sell, at which point they can incorporate that profit into their [tax plan](/tax-planning) for the year.

## Recording Unrealized Gains

Unrealized gains are recorded diversely relying upon the type of security. Securities that are [held-to-maturity](/held-to-maturity-security) are not kept in financial statements, but rather the company might choose to remember a disclosure about them for the [footnotes to its financial statements](/commentary).

Securities that are [held-for-trading](/held-for-trading-security) are recorded on the balance sheet at their [fair value](/fairvalue), and the unrealized gains and losses are recorded on the income statement.

Therefore, the increase or diminishing in the fair value of held-for-trading securities influences the company's net income and its [earnings-per-share](/eps) (EPS). Securities that are [available-for-sale](/available-for-sale-security) are likewise recorded on a company's balance sheet as an asset at fair value. Be that as it may, the unrealized gains and losses are kept in [comprehensive income](/comprehensiveincome) on the balance sheet.

## Unrealized Gain versus Unrealized Loss

The opposite of an unrealized gain is a [unrealized loss](/unrealizedloss). This type of loss happens when an investor clutches a losing investment, for example, a stock that has dropped in value since the position was opened. Like an unrealized gain, a loss becomes realized once the position is closed at a loss.

Unrealized gains and unrealized losses are frequently called "paper" profits or losses since the genuine gain or loss isn't determined until the position is closed. A position with an unrealized gain may ultimately transform into a position with an unrealized loss as the market changes and vice versa.

## Illustration of an Unrealized Gain

In the event that an investor purchased 100 shares of [stock](/stock) in ABC Company at $10 per share, and the fair value of the shares accordingly ascends to $12 per share, the unrealized gain on the shares still in their possession would be $200 ($2 per share * 100 shares). On the off chance that the investor in the end sells the shares while the trading price is $14, they will have a realized gain of $400 ($4 per share * 100 shares).
