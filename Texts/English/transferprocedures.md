# Transfer Procedures
## What Are Transfer Procedures?

Transfer procedures are the means by which the ownership of a stock (or other security) moves starting with one party then onto the next. This cycle is effected by a [transfer agent](/transferagent), who follows a detailed, documented series of steps represented by the securities and exchange commission ([SEC](/sec)) to guarantee that a transaction has been completed. Transfer procedures are utilized at whatever point a buyer and seller transact between each other (the asset is transferred from the seller's custodian to the buyer's), or when the owner of an asset changes brokerage firms or transfers assets between at least one brokerage accounts that they control.

Numerous events happen simultaneously during the account transfer technique. Even with today's modern technology, a fruitful account transfer starting with one customer's account then onto the next can take as long as seven days although it is best to plan ahead for any potential postponements. In the U.S., stocks are regulated to clear in T+2 trading days. The clearing time was diminished from T+3 quite a while back and will probably decrease as time goes on.

## How Transfer Procedures Work

The accompanying information on transfer procedures is given by [FINRA](/finra), a financial regulator in the United States: Most assets held in brokerage accounts are transferred these days between [broker-dealers](/broker-dealer) through an automated electronic cycle. The National Securities Clearing Corporation ([NSCC](/nscc)) operates the Automated Customer Account Transfer Service ([ACATS](/acat)) to facilitate the transfer of a customer account starting with one broker-dealer then onto the next. Transfers including the most common asset classes,that is, cash, stocks, corporate bonds issued by domestic companies, and listed options, are promptly transferable through ACATS.

ACATS fills in as a transfer agent, who has record of the personal details of an owner of a share of stock. At the point when a share's ownership changes, the transfer agent drops the stock certificate (or the electronic record thereof) of the seller and makes another stock certificate for the buyer. Although automated, the account transfer process is somewhat complicated and is impacted by certain factors and regulations, the most important of which are examined below.

When the getting firm obtains the trade information, it enters certain customer data, remembering the name for the account, Social Security number, and account number at the conveying firm into ACATS. Shortly after the data is entered, an automated function permits the conveying firm to see that a request to transfer the account has been made. When the customer account information is appropriately matched, and the getting firm chooses to accept the account, the conveying firm will take approximately three days to move the assets to the new firm. This is called the delivery interaction. Altogether, the validation interaction and delivery process generally take about six days to complete. Generally, transfers where the conveying entity isn't a broker-dealer (for instance a bank, mutual fund, or credit union) will take additional time. In addition, transfers of accounts requiring a custodian, similar to an Individual Retirement Account ([IRA](/ira)) or a Custodial Account for a minor child, may take additional time.
