# Guaranteed Minimum Accumulation Benefit (GMAB)
## What Is a Guaranteed Minimum Accumulation Benefit?

The guaranteed least accumulation benefit (GMAB) is a [variable annuity](/variableannuity) rider that guarantees a base value to the annuitant after the [accumulation period](/accumulationperiod) or one more set period, normally some place close to 10 years. The GMAB rider safeguards the value of the annuity from market vacillations. This optional benefit is accessible for an extra cost, which changes per insurance provider.

## Understanding the Guaranteed Minimum Accumulation Benefit

The guaranteed least accumulation benefit might be utilized assuming the annuity's [market value](/marketvalue) falls below the base guaranteed value. In certain situations, the cumulative costs of the benefit are returned to the annuity in the event that the value of the annuity is higher than the base benefit, dispensing with the need to utilize the rider.

Notwithstanding the guaranteed least accumulation benefit, which confines [withdrawals](/withdrawal) until after the accumulation period, other guaranteed least living benefit riders might have a holding period or require annuitization. These incorporate a guaranteed least income benefit (GMIB) and a guaranteed least withdrawal benefit (GMWB).

> Furthermore, there are two different riders: a guaranteed lifetime withdrawal benefit and a standalone lifetime benefit.

## GMAB versus Other Guaranteed Benefits

A guaranteed least income benefit (GMIB) guarantees the annuitant a base income during retirement, offering protection against market volatility. On the off chance that the investor annuitizes the contract, payments will be founded on the amount in the fund and a set interest rate. This sort of rider is subject to both age limits and holding periods.

A guaranteed least withdrawal benefit (GMWB) is a hybrid product that guarantees that a percentage of the retirement fund will be eligible for annual withdrawals until the depletion of the initial investment. Percentages change however regularly range from 5% to 10%. The amount accessible for withdrawal might have age limitations.

In the event that the investments perform well, annuitants can exploit a step-up option, getting higher guaranteed withdrawals. A guaranteed lifetime withdrawal benefit (GLWB), likewise thought to be a hybrid product, guarantees an investor a specific percentage of the fund's value for withdrawal during their lifetime, offering further protection against market variances. A GLWB is some of the time called a GMWB with a lifetime option.

A standalone lifetime benefit (SALB) is like the GLWB yet doesn't need the purchase of an annuity. Generally, an investor needing access to their funds would need to [annuitize](/annuitization) or face punishments. The SALB offers lifetime access to the fund, paying little heed to market performance, with fees and certain limitations.
