# Import and Export Price Indexes (MXP)
## What Are the Import and Export Price Indexes (MXP)?

The U.S. import and export price indexes (MXP) measure the change in prices of goods and services purchased from abroad by U.S. consumers and organizations ([imports](/import)) and sold to foreign purchasers ([exports](/export)). The MXP measure changes in the prices of non-military goods and services.

The indexes give data with regards to the strength of the U.S. economy and consumer spending, the demand for U.S. goods abroad, and the pace of rising import prices.

The MXPs are distributed for the vast majority various types of commodities, goods and service industries, location of beginning, and location of the objective. The [indexes](/indexing) are refreshed one time per month and reflect import and export price changes from the previous month. The U.S. import and export price indexes (MXP) are delivered by the [Bureau of Labor Statistics](/bls) (BLS) International Price Program (IPP).

## How Import and Export Price Indexes (MXP) Work

The U.S. import and export price indexes (MXP) measure changes in prices of goods and services imported into and exported from the U.S. for the top five trading partners for the United States, including:

- Canada
- China
- Germany
- Japan
- Mexico

The import and export price indexes address one of the three major metrics that help the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) measure the change in prices of goods and services in the U.S. economy. The other two metrics incorporate the [Consumer Price Index (CPI)](/consumerpriceindex), which measures price changes for a basket of consumer goods, and the [Producer Price Index (PPI)](/ppi), which measures price changes in commercial goods sold.

## How MXP Data Is Compiled?

The indexes are made by ordering the price data that is collected from exporter declarations and entry records of imported goods. The BLS characterizes its indexes as "containing data on changes in the prices of non-military goods and services traded between the U.S. what's more, the remainder of the world." These measures, it adds, "show how prices of a market [basket of goods](/basket_of_goods) and services in international trade change starting with one period then onto the next."

Not all goods are remembered for the indexes, a portion of the rejections include:

- Military goods
- Show-stoppers
- Utilized things
- Charity gifts
- Railroad gear
- Things leased for under a year
- Remade and fixed things

Not all U.S. international trade is directed in [U.S. dollars](/usd-united-states-dollar) (USD). The BLS expresses 6% of imports and exports at present overviewed are priced in foreign currencies. For its indexes, all prices are switched over completely to the nearby currency, utilizing an average [exchange rate](/exchangerate) from the month prior to the pricing month.

The International Price Program (IPP) chooses foundations based on their trade value in imports and exports consistently. A BLS field economist normally visits the company to lay out it as part of the program and select the products to be priced monthly. From that point, prices are generally collected through a secure internet address or a few cases, by telephone or by fax.

## Instructions to Read the Import and Export Price Indexes

By distributing the MXP as an index, it assists with estimating changes in prices when compared to a base year. The indexes utilize the base year of 2000, which compares to the index value of 100. The price changes can be measured with respect to the base year and its comparing 100 index value.

For instance, the import price index of 106.8 for consumer goods in October 2017 means that there was a 6.8% increase in import prices beginning around 2000. Essentially, a 39.2 index perusing for PCs in October 2017 means a 60.8% reduction in prices starting around 2000 (or 100-39.2).

## How Import and Export Price Indexes (MXP) Are Used

The MXP fill some needs. In addition to other things, they can be utilized to:

- **Flatten government trade statistics**: Because trade statistics are reported and collected in nominal dollar terms, analysts can utilize MXPs to change over them into real values.

## Illustration of the Import and Export Price Indexes

Normally, the data from the U.S. import and export price indexes (MXP) are compared on a month-to-month or year-to-year basis. In any case, the index point changes are changed over into percentage terms. For instance, suppose the accompanying data was reported:

- Oct. 2017 export price index = 162.6
- Oct. 2016 export price index = 168.4
- Year-to-year index point change = - 5.8

To change over completely to a percentage:

- Year-to-year index point change = - 5.8
- Partition the point change by the previous period of 168.4 (for Oct. 2016)
- Partition - 5.8/168.4 = - 0.034
- Convert the decimal to a percent: Multiply 100 by - .034 = - 3.4%

As such, the year-to-year percentage change in the export price index was - 3.4% from Oct. 2016 to Oct. 2017.
