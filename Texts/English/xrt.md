## What Is XRT?

XRT is an extension printed after the [ticker symbol](/stocksymbol) for a stock. It demonstrates that the stock is trading on a [ex-rights](/ex-rights) basis. (XRT is a truncation for the word ex-rights.) Ex-rights means that the buyer of the stock doesn't reserve the options to purchase more shares at a lower price any longer since those rights have expired. XRT is imprinted on the ticker tape — or displayed on the electronic ticker — for clearness and to stay away from debates or confusion about where the rights presently remain.

XRT is likewise the ticker symbol for the SPDR S&P Retail exchange-traded fund (ETF). This is an index fund that tracks a broad-based, equivalent weighted index of U.S. retail industry stocks.

## Figuring out XRT

XRT is a symbol added as an extension to the ticker symbol for a stock that is trading ex-rights. On the ticker, the extension is added after a dot and after the ticker symbol. For example, a trade of stock Apex Borax Company with the ticker symbol ABC that is ex-rights would display as "ABC.XRT" on the ticker.

[Rights](/rightsoffering) are a type of financial instrument that give the purchaser of a stock the right to purchase a bigger number of shares at a lower price than the trading price for the principal little while after the initial purchase. It is said that rights are "connected" to a stock, albeit at times these rights are detachable. After that predefined initial time span in which the rights are joined, those rights expire; as of now, the stock is supposed to be traded "ex-rights." When a stock stirs things up around town expiration period and goes ex-rights, it as a rule trades for lower than it has been for a short period of time, on the grounds that the beneficial rights are not generally connected to it.

## The Function of Rights

The function of joining rights to a stock through a rights offering is to work with buyers keeping up with their position in the stock in the event that the stock issues more shares not long after the buyer purchases. It functions much the same way to the manner in which a price guarantee accomplishes for the purchase of a retail product, where the purchaser doesn't have to worry that the price of a product will soar in light of the fact that the price is guaranteed for a certain period of time.

This is the explanation the price of the stock goes down when the rights expire in light of the fact that there could be presently not a guarantee that the purchaser can keep an ownership percentage at a similar price. This makes the stock less important to the purchaser.
