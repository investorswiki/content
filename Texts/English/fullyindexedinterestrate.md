# Completely Indexed Interest Rate
## What Is a Fully Indexed Interest Rate?

A completely indexed interest rate is a [variable interest rate](/variableinterestrate) that is calculated by adding a margin to a predetermined index interest rate, for example, LIBOR or the Fed Funds rate. Completely indexed interest rates can differ comprehensively founded on the assigned margin over that baseline rate or what maturity term the underlying index is set at.

## Completely Indexed Interest Rate Explained

Generally, a standard indexed rate is in many cases the most minimal rate a bank will charge to its highest credit quality borrowers. It is additionally normal the rate banks charge for lending to different banks. Well known indexes for indexed rates incorporate the [prime rate](/primerate), LIBOR, and different U.S. Treasury bill and note rates.

Completely indexed interest rates are utilized for variable-rate credit products. The margin on a completely indexed interest rate product is determined by the underwriter and in light of the borrower's credit quality. [Adjustable-rate mortgages](/arm) (ARMs) are one of the most common completely indexed interest rate products.

Indexed rates form the basis for completely indexed interest rate products. They can likewise be utilized as the primary rate for a variable rate interest product.

## Margin

Loan specialists commonly assign a margin to most variable rate products, and the margin is added to a predetermined index rate to act as the completely indexed interest rate charged to borrowers on credit balances. In a variable completely indexed interest rate product, the margin will normally continue as before over the lifetime of the loan with the [interest rate](/interestrate) adjusted in view of changes to the standard indexed rate.

Margin is determined in the underwriting system. Higher credit quality borrowers can generally hope to be assigned a more modest margin while lower credit quality borrowers will pay a higher margin.

For instance, on the off chance that the completely indexed interest rate on a personal loan is tied to the half year LIBOR index with a margin of 3% then the rate would be 10% assuming the half year LIBOR index were at 7%. On the off chance that the half year LIBOR index were to increase to 8%, the new completely indexed interest rate would be 11%.

## Adjustable-Rate Mortgages

Adjustable-rate mortgages (ARMs) are one of the credit market's most well known variable rate products. An adjustable-rate mortgage can be best when a borrower accepts mortgage rates will fall. These mortgages start with a fixed rate for a predetermined number of years and afterward follow with a variable rate that resets in light of the loan terms.

A [2/28 ARM](/228arm) would have a fixed rate for a considerable length of time followed by an adjustable rate for a considerable length of time. A [5/1 ARM](/5-1_arm) might have a fixed rate for a considerable length of time followed by an adjustable rate that resets consistently.

During the variable-rate time period, the loan will be founded on an indexed rate plus a margin. An open variable rate will increase or diminish when a change happens with the indexed rate. In the event that a loan has specific terms for resetting the interest rate, for example, toward the finish of every year then the interest rate will be adjusted to the completely indexed rate at the hour of the adjustment.
