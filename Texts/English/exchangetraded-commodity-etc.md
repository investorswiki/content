# Exchange-Traded Commodity (ETC)
## What Is an Exchange-Traded Commodity (ETC)?

An exchange-traded commodity (ETC) is a type of security that can offer traders and investors without direct access to spot or derivatives [commodities markets](/commodity-market) exposure to commodities like metals, energy, and livestock. An ETC can follow individual commodities or a basket of several commodities and can give an intriguing alternative to trading commodities with regards to the [futures market](/futuresmarket).

## Understanding Exchange-Traded Commodities (ETCs)

ETCs are convenient for investing in single markets like livestock, precious or industrial metals, natural gas, and other [commodities](/commodity) that are frequently challenging for individual investors to access. An illustration of a commodity basket ETC, then again, is one that tracks various metals (not just one) or tracks a group of agricultural commodities, like wheat, soybeans, and corn.

The performance of an ETC is associated with one of two sources. It very well may be founded on the [spot commodity](/spotcommodity) price (the price for immediate delivery) or in view of the futures price (a derivative contract for delivery sometime not too far off). ETCs commonly endeavor to follow the daily performance of the underlying commodity, yet not be guaranteed to long-term performance.

> How ETCs are structured changes relying upon the company giving the product. Certain [exchanges](/exchange, for example, the London Stock Exchange (LSE) and Australian Securities Exchange (ASX), offer products called ETCs that have a specific structure.

Just like other investment funds, ETCs charge a management fee, called the [expense ratio](/expenseratio), which remunerates the company for running the ETC. Moreover, every ETC has a [net asset value ](/nav)(NAV), which is viewed as the fair value of each share in light of the value of the holdings underlying the ETC. Since shares of the ETC trade on an exchange, its value on the market could change above or below the NAV value.

## Exchange-Traded Commodities (ETCs) versus Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs)

ETCs permit investors to zero in on a single commodity, though [exchange-traded funds](/etf) (ETFs) will generally invest all the more comprehensively over a wide assortment of securities or companies.

Like ETFs, ETC shares are listed and traded on exchanges, with prices fluctuating in view of price changes of the ETC's underlying commodities. In any case, dissimilar to ETFs, ETCs are structured as [notes](/note), which are debt instruments endorsed by a bank for the guarantor of the ETC, yet which are backed by the commodities they track as [collateral](/collateral).

Along these lines, ETCs ought not be mistaken for [commodity ETFs](/commodity-etf), which invest directly in and hold physical commodities, like agricultural goods, natural resources, and precious metals. The ETC doesn't buy or sell the commodity or futures contract directly. That note is collateralized by physical commodities, which are bought utilizing the cash from inflows into the ETC.

Involving assets as collateral diminishes the risk if the [underwriter](/underwriter) of the note defaults. This is like a [exchange-traded note](/etn) (ETN), then again, actually the ETC is collateralized by holdings in the physical commodity, while an ETN isn't.

## Types of Exchange-Traded Commodity (ETC)

Inverse ETCs are more complex instruments that move up when a commodity drops down, or vice versa.

Leveraged ETCs, in the mean time, are structured so that commodity developments are duplicated by a specific factor, like a few, bringing about a few times the [volatility](/volatility) of the underlying commodity. Utilizing [leverage](/leverage) expands the potential for gains, yet in addition expected losses.
