# Both-to-Blame Collision Clause
## What Is a Both-to-Blame Collision Clause?

A both-to-blame collision clause is part of the ocean marine insurance policy that states that if a ship (vessel) slams into one more ship due to the negligence of both, owners and shippers of both vessels must share in the losses in extent with the monetary values of their cargo and interests before the collision. The owners of the cargo and company responsible for shipment are both required to pay for losses.

## How a Both-to-Blame Collision Clause Works

As [globalization](/globalization) develops, the shipping industry additionally develops. In the event of a collision, the company's [liabilities](/liability), and consequently risk, will be limited to ocean marine insurance. An ocean marine insurance gives coverage against losses to ships. It safeguards in the event of damage or destruction of a ship's frame or potentially the ship's freight.

A few protections likewise gave under this insurance include:

- A collision of the ship with another ship or item.
- A ship sinking, overturning, or being abandoned.
- Fire, piracy, casting off (tossing over the edge of property to save other property).
- Barratry (fraud or an unlawful act by a ship's master or team).

Damage due to wear and tear, moistness, decay, shape, and war are excluded from the coverage.

## Special Considerations

The Hague-Visby Rules give that, on the off chance that the carrier has practiced due diligence to give a secure ship, they are not responsible for claims coming about because of a collision partly or wholly brought about by careless route (Article IV Rule 2(a)). Normally, both vessels are partly to blame for a collision and cargo interests may then introduce their claims in tort against the non-carrying vessel.

Under U.S. law, claimants could recover their claims in full from the owners of the other vessel, who could then recover one half from the carriers. This rule bypasses the navigational mistake defense. It likewise causes what is happening in which cargo interests couldn't recover compensation in the event that the carrying vessel was wholly to blame. The both-to-blame collision clause is intended to save the protection a carrier has under the Hague-Visby Rules by giving a contractual indemnity against the cargo interests.

## Illustration of Both-to-Blame Collision Clause

In the event that Ship A crashes into Ship B, due to the shortcoming of Ship B, the owner of any goods in Ship A, which are damaged or lost by the issue of Ship B, can claim 100 percent of the damage from the owners of Ship B.

Notwithstanding, due to the Both-to-Blame Collision Clause, and in conditions where apportionment of blame is considered to be 50/50, the owner of Ship B has the privilege to claim half of their liability from the owners of Ship A.

This leaves Ship A with a bill for half the cost of the damage, so Ship A passes that cost back to the owner of the goods, via the Both-to-Blame Collision Clause in the Bill of Lading.
