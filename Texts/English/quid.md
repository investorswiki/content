## What Is a Quid?

Quid is a shoptalk articulation for the British pound sterling, or the [British pound](/gbp) (GBP), which is the currency of the United Kingdom (U.K.). A quid is equivalent to 100 pence, and it is generally accepted to come from the Latin phrase "[quid pro quo](/quidproquo)," which translates into "something for something," or an equivalent exchange for goods or services. In any case, the specific historical background of the word as it relates to the British pound is as yet uncertain.

## Figuring out Quid

Quid, as it portrays one pound sterling, is remembered to have initial come into utilization at some point in the late 17^th^ century, however nobody is very certain why this word became inseparable from the British currency. A few researchers accept that Italian migrants might have originated the word thanks to "scudo," the name for gold and silver coins of different groups that were utilized in Italy from the 16^th^ century through the 19^th^ century.

Another possibility is that the word traces back to Quidhampton, a town in Wiltshire, England, that used to be home to a Royal Mint paper mill. It's conceivable that any [paper money](/paper_money) that was made in this mill could have been called a quid. Albeit the word's starting point keeps on being a secret, the pound sterling has a rich history of over 12 centuries as the world's most established currency still being used. Today, the U.K. is one of a handful of the European countries that doesn't utilize the [euro](/euro) as a common currency. The U.K. is comprised of England, Northern Ireland, Scotland, and Wales.

## The Pound Sterling in History

Antiquarians trace the pound sterling as far as possible back to 775 A.D. at the point when Anglo-Saxon kings utilized silver pennies, called sterlings, as currency. Somebody who collected 240 of them had 1 pound of sterlings, thus the name "pound sterling." In Latin, Libra means " weight" and Libra Pondo translated to pound weight, which is the reason the British pound bears an extravagant "L" or \u00a3 symbol.

The standard of 240 pence in one pound sterling stayed the standard for almost 1,200 years until 1971. This was the point at which the British Parliament initiated [decimalization](/decimalization) to make 100 pence equivalent one pound sterling.

A real pound coin didn't exist until 1489 when Henry VII was king, and it was called a sovereign. Notwithstanding the United Kingdom, the British pound has recently filled in as currency in a considerable lot of the settlements of the British Empire including Australia, New Zealand, and Canada.

Shillings were first minted in 1504, with 12 pence in 1 shilling and 20 shillings in a single pound. Gold coins began in 1560. Between 775 A.D. furthermore, 1971, British coins have been made into a wide range of [denominations](/category). A portion of these coins were called pennies, halfpennies, farthings, half-crowns, and twofold florins. Different coins included groats, threepenny pieces, and twopence. The majority of these groups are presently not in circulation, while others became [banknotes](/banknote).

## Banknotes

English banknotes were made during the rule of King William III after he began the [Bank of England](/boe) in 1694. They were transcribed around then. The primary bill being used during that time was a 10-pound note. Be that as it may, an extensive period of extreme [inflation](/inflation) or rising prices later forced the government to issue five-pound notes. By 1717, the term "pound sterling" turned out to be almost obsolete when Europe moved to a [gold standard](/goldstandard), rather than a silver standard, until the mid 1900s. Contemporary pound sterling, whether in coins or bills, has no silver at all.
