# Crack-Up Boom
## What Is a Crack-Up Boom?

A crack-up boom is an economic crisis that includes a recession in the real economy and a collapse of the monetary system due to nonstop credit expansion and bringing about impractical, fast price increases. This concept of a crack-up boom was developed by Austrian economist [Ludwig von Mises](/ludwig-von-mises) as a part of the Austrian business cycle theory (ABCT).

The crack-up boom is portrayed by two key highlights: 1) unnecessarily expansionary monetary policy that, notwithstanding the normal outcomes depicted in ABCT, leads to crazy [inflation](/inflation) expectations and 2) a subsequent episode of [hyperinflation](/hyperinflation) which closes in the abandonment of the currency by market participants and a simultaneous recession or depression.

## Grasping a Crack-Up Boom

The crack-up boom creates out the very interaction of credit expansion and the subsequent distortion of the economy that happens during the normal boom phase of [Austrian business cycle theory](/austrian_school). In the crack-up boom, the [central bank](/centralbank) endeavors to support the boom endlessly regardless of outcomes, for example, inflation and asset price [bubbles](/bubble). The problem comes when the government consistently pours increasingly more money, infusing it into the economy to give it a short-term support, which eventually sets off a fundamental breakdown in the economy. In their efforts to prevent any downturn in the economy, monetary specialists keep on growing the supply of money and credit at a speeding up pace and try not to switch off the taps of [money supply](/moneysupply) until it is too late.

In Austrian business cycle theory, in the normal course of an economic boom driven by the expansion of money and credit the structure of the economy becomes twisted in manners that eventually bring about shortages of different commodities and types of labor, which then, at that point, lead to expanding consumer price inflation. The rising prices and limited availability of important inputs and labor put pressure on businesses and causes a rash of failures of different investment ventures and business bankruptcies. In ABCT this is known as the real resource crunch, which sets off the defining moment in the economy from boom to bust.

As this crisis point draws near, the central bank has a decision: either to accelerate the expansion of the money supply to try to assist businesses with paying at the rising costs and wages they are faced with and postpone the recession, or to cease from doing as such at the risk of permitting a few businesses to fail, asset prices to fall, and disinflation (and perhaps a [recession](/recession) or [depression](/depression)) to happen. The crack-up boom happens when the central bank picks and sticks with the main option.

Economist [Friedrich Hayek](/friedrich-hayek) broadly depicted this situation as like getting a "major problem." Once the central bank chooses to accelerate the course of credit expansion and inflation to head off any recession risk, then, at that point, it ceaselessly faces a similar decision of either speeding up the cycle further or facing an even greater risk of recession as distortions build in the real economy.

As part of this interaction, consumer prices rise at a speeding up rate. In view of current price increases and market's comprehension participants might interpret central bank policy, consumer expectations of future inflation additionally rise. These make positive feedback that leads to speeding up price inflation that can far exceed the rate of central bank money expansion and become what is then known as hyperinflation.

With each subsequent round of credit expansion and price increases, individuals can never again manage the cost of the high prices, so the central bank must grow even more to oblige these prices, which pushes the prices even higher. Rather than rising a couple of percent consistently, consumer prices can rise by 10%, half, 100%, or more very quickly or days. The value of the [currency](/currency)[ depreciates](/devaluation) radically, and the [financial system](/financial-system) faces extreme stress.

The "crack-up" part of the crack-up boom happens as money in the economy starts to lose its economic function as money. Price inflation accelerates to the point that money fails to satisfy its economic function and individuals abandon it for barter or different forms of money. Under normal conditions, money functions as a generally accepted medium of exchange, a unit of account, a store of value, and a standard of deferred payment. Hyperinflation subverts these functions, and as market participants stop utilizing and accepting the money, the system of indirect exchange in view of the utilization of money that makes up a modern economy "cracks-up."

Right now, further expansion of the supply of money and credit by the central bank, regardless of how fast, has no effect as the [economic stimulus](/economic-stimulus) or fights off recession. The economy transforms the corner into recession notwithstanding the central bank's expectation as the monetary system simultaneously breaks down totally, compounding the economic crisis.

## History of the Crack-Up Boom

The engineer of the possibility of the crack-up boom, Ludwig von Mises, who was an advocate of [laissez-faire economics](/laissezfaire), a steadfast rival of all forms of [socialism](/socialism) and interventionism, and a prominent member of the Austrian School of Economics, composed broadly on monetary economics and inflation during his career.

In the mid 1920s, von Mises witnessed and discredited hyperinflation in his native Austria and adjoining Germany. Von Mises assumed an instrumental part in assisting Austria with keeping away from a crack-up boom yet could simply sit back and watch as the German Reichsmark collapsed one year later. He was determined that not keeping credit expansion in check could make ready for a deadlier portion of hyperinflation that would eventually push the economy to the brink of collapse.

Von Mises portrays the cycle later in his book **Human Action**. "[I]f once public assessment is persuaded that the increase in the quantity of money won't proceed and ever reached a conclusion, and that, subsequently, the prices of all [commodities](/commodity) and services won't cease to rise, everyone becomes anxious to buy however much as could be expected and to confine his cash holding to a base size," he said. "For under these conditions, the ordinary costs incurred by holding cash are increased by the losses brought about by the progressive fall in [purchasing power](/purchasingpower)."

## Instances of a Crack-Up Boom

A few economies, other than Germany, have collapsed after a period of credit expansion and hyperinflation, including Argentina, Russia, Yugoslavia, and Zimbabwe. A later model is Venezuela. Long periods of corruption and fizzling government policies have driven the South American country's economy to collapse in an uncommon fashion. Therefore, a large number of Venezuelans face poverty, food shortages, and power outages. As per the [International Monetary Fund (IMF)](/imf), Venezuela's economy shrunk by more than 35% somewhere in the range of 2013 and 2017. Uncontrolled inflation hasn't made a difference.

By mid-2019, inflation in the country was reported to be basically as high as 10 million percent, implying that a product that once cost the equivalent of one bolivar proceeded to cost the equivalent of 10 million bolivars. Things have gotten so terrible that a month to month salary in Venezuela was reportedly sufficiently not to even cover the cost of a single gallon of milk.

## Special Considerations

A crack-up boom is something that can occur in an economy that depends on fiat money (in one or the other paper or electronic form) and (normally) fiduciary media, rather than the [gold standard](/goldstandard) or other physical commodity money, on the grounds that the accessible stock commodity places a physical limit on the quantity of money that can be issued and the market discipline forced by a convertible gold standard forestalls the overissuance of credit. If they at any point become money, electronic digital currencies whose underlying calculations place inflexible limits on the quantity and rate that new units can be made (or mined) may give a comparative benefit of preventing hyperinflation and a crack-up boom.

## Highlights
- A crack-up boom is the crash of the credit and monetary system due to constant credit expansion and price increases that can't be supported long-term.
- In the face of exorbitant credit expansion, consumers' inflation expectations accelerate to the point that money becomes worthless and the economic system crashes.
- The term was instituted by Ludwig von Mises, a prominent member of the Austrian School of Economics and personal witness to the damages of hyperinflation.
