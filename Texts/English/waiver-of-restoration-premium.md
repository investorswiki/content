# Waiver of Restoration Premium
## What Is a Waiver of Restoration Premium?

In the [insurance industry](/insurance), a waiver of restoration premium is a legal clause expressing that the policyholder won't be charged an extra fee, or "restoration premium," assuming their coverage go on in the wake of paying out a claim.

Waivers of this sort are generally found in liability policies, for example, automotive or [health insurance policies](/healthinsurance).

## How Waivers of Restoration Premium Work

Under a standard insurance policy, the policyholder will pay a series of insurance premiums, ordinarily one time each month, to receive coverage from a set of specific risks. In the event that any of these risks emerge, the policyholder can file a claim with their insurance company and receive compensation for the damages they maintained.

From the insurance company's point of view, these types of policies are profitable assuming claims are moderately rare, and assuming that the insurance company can earn an adequate [return](/returnoninvestment) from investing the premiums that they receive from their customers.

Of course, when a policyholder has filed a claim against their policy, that insurance contract is probably going to be substantially less profitable for the insurer. To relieve this risk, insurance companies often increase the month to month premiums charged to the policyholder once that policyholder has filed at least one claims. These extra fees, or "restoration premiums," assist with reestablishing the previous level of profitability of the insurance contract, when seen according to the point of view of the insurer. The policyholder then, at that point, has the decision of whether to go on with their current insurance provider or, more than likely look for coverage from a contender able to acknowledge lower premiums.

Assuming a policyholder has negotiated an insurance contract that contains a waiver of restoration premium clause, then that policyholder wouldn't be required to pay higher premiums subsequent to filing at least one claims. All things being equal, coverage would keep on being given at a similar rate as before the claim was filed.

Albeit this waiver is to the benefit of the policyholder, it might unexpectedly require the base insurance premiums of the contract to be higher than they in any case would be in the event that the waiver of restoration premium was excluded. In this manner, contingent upon the conditions, including a waiver of restoration premium clause could conceivably be the best option monetarily.

> To try not to pay restoration premiums, a few policyholders decide to pay for their expenses out-of-pocket as opposed to filing an insurance claim, especially on the off chance that the expense being referred to is somewhat small.
