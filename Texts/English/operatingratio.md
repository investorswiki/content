The operating ratio shows how efficient a company's management is at keeping costs low while generating revenue or sales. The more modest the ratio, the more efficient the company is at generating revenue versus total expenses.

## How the Operating Ratio Works

The calculation for the operating ratio is:

1. Find total operating expenses, which ought to be farther down the income statement.
1. Add total operating expenses and cost of goods sold or COGS and attachment the outcome into the numerator of the formula.
1. Partition the sum of operating expenses and COGS by the total net sales.

## What Does the Operating Ratio Tell You?

Investment analysts have numerous approaches to investigating company performance. Since it focuses on core business activities, one of the most famous ways of breaking down performance is by assessing the operating ratio. Alongside [return on assets](/returnonassets) and [return on equity](/returnonequity), estimating a company's operational efficiency is frequently utilized. It is helpful to follow the operating ratio throughout some undefined time frame to distinguish trends in operational effectiveness or shortcoming.

An operating ratio that is going up is considered a negative sign, as this demonstrates that operating expenses are expanding relative to sales or revenue. Alternately, on the off chance that the operating ratio is falling, expenses are decreasing, or revenue is expanding, or a mix of both. A company might have to execute cost controls for margin improvement on the off chance that its operating ratio increments after some time.

## Parts of the Operating Ratio

Operating expenses are basically all expenses aside from taxes and interest payments. Likewise, companies will regularly exclude [non-operating expenses](/non-operating-expense) in the operating ratio.

Operating expenses are the costs associated with running the business that isn't directly tied to the production of the product or service. Operating expenses incorporate [overhead expenses](/overhead) like sales, general, and administrative costs. An illustration of overhead may be the expense of the corporate office for a company in light of the fact that albeit important, it's not directly tied to production. Operating expenses can include:

- Accounting and legal expenses
- Bank charges
- Sales and marketing costs
- Non-promoted [research and development expenses](/research-and-development-expenses)
- Office supply costs
- Rent and utility expenses
- Repair and maintenance costs
- Salary and pay expenses

Operating expenses can likewise incorporate the cost of goods sold, which are the expenses directly tied to the production of goods and services. In any case, most companies separate operating expenses from the cost of goods sold. Thusly, the two costs must be added together to form the numerator in the operating ratio calculation. Cost of goods sold can incorporate the following:

- Direct material costs
- Direct work
- Rent of the plant or production office
- Benefits and wages for the production laborers
- Repair costs of gear

Revenue or net sales is the top line of the income statement and is the amount of money a company produces before expenses are taken out. A few companies list revenue as net sales since they have returns of merchandise from customers by which they credit the client back, which is deducted from revenue.

These details are listed on the [income statement](/incomestatement). Companies must obviously state which expenses are operational and which are designated for different purposes.

## Illustration of the Operating Ratio

Below is the income statement for Apple Inc. (AAPL) as of June 27, 2020, as indicated by their Q3 report.

- Apple reported total revenue or net sales of $59.68 billion for the period.
- The total cost of sales (or cost of goods sold) was $37.00 billion while total operating expenses were $9.59 billion.
- We work out the numerator of the operating ratio by adding $37.00 billion (COS) + $9.59 billion (operating expenses) for a total of $46.59 billion for the period.
- The operating ratio is calculated as follows: $46.59 billion/$59.68 billion, which equals 0.78 or 78%.

The operating ratio for Apple means that 78% of the company's net sales are operating expenses. Apple's operating ratio must be inspected north of several quarters to get a feeling of whether the company is dealing with its operating costs really. Likewise, investors can monitor operating expenses and cost of goods sold (or cost of sales) separately to determine whether costs are either expanding or decreasing over the long run.

## Operating Ratio versus Operating Expense Ratio

The [operating expense ratio](/operating-expense-ratio) (OER) is utilized in the real estate industry and is a measurement of what it costs to operate a property compared to the income that the property produces. It is calculated by partitioning a property's operating expense (minus depreciation) by its gross operating income. The OER is utilized for looking at the expenses of comparable properties.

Then again, the operating ratio is the comparison of a company's total expenses compared to the revenue or net sales created. The operating ratio is utilized for company analysis in different industries while the OER is utilized in the real estate industry.

## Limitations of the Operating Ratio

A limitation of the operating ratio is that it does exclude debt. A few companies take on a great deal of debt, meaning they are committed to paying large interest payments, which are excluded from the operating expenses figure of the operating ratio. Two companies can have a similar operating ratio with immeasurably different debt levels, so contrasting debt ratios before accompanying any conclusions is important.

Likewise with any financial measurement, the operating ratio ought to be monitored over numerous reporting periods to determine on the off chance that a trend is available. Companies can at times cut costs in the short term, in this manner blowing up their earnings briefly. Investors must monitor costs to check whether they're expanding or decreasing after some time while additionally contrasting those outcomes with the performance of revenue and profit.

Contrasting the operating ratio and different firms in a similar industry is likewise important. In the event that a company has a higher operating ratio than its peer average, it might show failure and vice versa. At last, likewise with all ratios, it ought to be utilized as part of a full ratio analysis, as opposed to in detachment.

## Features
- An operating ratio that is decreasing is considered to be a positive sign, as it shows that operating expenses are turning into an undeniably more modest percentage of net sales.
