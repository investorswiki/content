The two types of bonds require a base payment of $25 and limit annual bond purchases to $10,000 per [Social Security](/socialsecurity) number. Interest accrues consistently and accumulates at regular intervals, so the bondholder even earns interest on interest. The bondholder can't [redeem](/recovery) the bond for a considerable length of time subsequent to purchasing, and in the event that she redeems it inside the initial five years she'll relinquish three months of interest.
