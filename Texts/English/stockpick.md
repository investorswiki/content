# Stock Pick
## What Is a Stock Pick?

A stock pick is when an analyst or investor uses a systematic form of analysis to conclude that a particular stock will make a good investment and, therefore, should be added to their [portfolio](/portfolio). This is otherwise called [active management](/activemanagement). The position can be either [long](/long) or [short](/short) and will depend on the analyst or investor's outlook at the particular stock's cost.

## Understanding a Stock Pick

Stock picking can be a very difficult process because there is never a foolproof method for determining what a stock's price will do from now on.

Active management funds utilize teams of analysts who pick stocks for investment and continually update the portfolio depending on how market conditions and the company's conditions change. Active management is different from [passive management](/passivemanagement), which hopes to replicate an index and does not have much [turnover](/portfolioturnover) in the portfolio.

## Picking a Stock

These active management [exchange traded funds](/etf) (ETFs), [mutual funds](/mutualfund), or separate accounts, can utilize a [bottom-up](/bottomupinvesting) or [top-down](/topdowninvesting) strategy to pick stocks. It is common for a fund company to offer a "high conviction" fund that includes a small number of stocks that analysts have picked as their best high-performance bets for the next several years. Typically, these high conviction funds hold 20 to 40 stocks. This is a lot smaller number than the average actively managed fund, and certainly a smaller number than a fund that tracks an index.

They take a gander at a company's revenues, costs, and profits. They examine its cash levels and debt levels and study financial ratios, for example, the [debt-to-equity (D/E) ratio](/debtequityratio) and the [price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio](/price-earningsratio), among numerous others. They then compare this information to the company's all's peers to see the company's standing inside the industry.

In addition to examining the company's financial statement, it needs to be aware of other related items, like any company litigation or future patents if applicable. Investors and analysts likewise need to examine the entire industry and sector that the company is in to understand any strengths or weaknesses in that sector and its outlook for the short term and the long term.

As a result, even on the off chance that the company loses market share in social media, it has other sources of revenue to mitigate those losses.

Jay believes that the upside potential of company ABC outweighs any downside potential, and that company ABC is poised for growth and strong earnings; he decides to purchase shares of company ABC.
