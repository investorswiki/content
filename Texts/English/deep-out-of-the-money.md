# Deep Out of the Money
## What Is Deep Out of the Money?

An option is viewed as deep out of the money in the event that its [strike price](/strikeprice) is fundamentally above (for a call) or essentially below (for a put) the current price of the underlying asset. Typically, this means the strike price of the option must be in excess of a couple of strikes in the [option chain](/optionchain) away from the price of the underlying asset.

## Seeing Deep Out of the Money

For a [call option](/calloption) to have value at [maturity](/maturity) or expiration, the price of the underlying asset must be over the option's strike price. For a put option, the price of the underlying must be below the option's strike price. On the off chance that nor is true, the option will lapse worthless. The fact that it will terminate worthless makes thus, the deeper out of the money the option, the almost certain.

Out of the money options have no intrinsic value and trade on their [time value](/timevalue). The deeper out of the money the option, the more overstated this becomes. On the other hand, [in the money](/inthemoney) options have both intrinsic value and time value.

For instance, on the off chance that the current price of the underlying stock is $60, a [put option](/putoption) with a strike price of $45 would be viewed as deep out of the money. A put option with a strike of $40 would be even deeper out of the money.

## Trading Strategy

While a deep of out the money option appears to be worthless, the derivative actually holds some value. All options, both all through the money, contain time value. Time value measures the benefit of having an option with time staying until maturity with in any event some chance that the price of the underlying will move towards the ideal strike.

Hence, while a deep [out of the money](/outofthemoney) call or put has no [intrinsic value](/intrinsicvalue), a few investors will pay a small amount for the leftover time value. Nonetheless, this time value diminishes as the option draws nearer to its expiry date.

The conspicuous feature of deep out of the money options is their extremely low cost compared to comparable options with strike prices nearer to the price of the underlying. The risk that the options will lapse worthless is great however so is the possible size of the reward, should the option move in the money before [expiration](/expirationdate). On the off chance that the last option turns out to be true, the percentage payoff can be immense. The small amount paid for the option could increase many times over. 100 percent gains are on the low side of potential outcomes.

It is enticing to buy deep out of the money options on numerous assets all at once on the grounds that a couple of should find true success to make an overall portfolio gain. Be that as it may, [commissions](/commission) compound the costs and a few specialists believe these types of options to bet with a high conceivable payoff yet with exceptionally low chances of progress.
