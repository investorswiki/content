# Nasdaq Capital Market
## What Is the Nasdaq Capital Market?

The Nasdaq Capital Market is one of [Nasdaq's](/nasdaq) U.S. market tiers containing beginning phase companies that have moderately lower market capitalizations. Listing requirements for companies on the Nasdaq Capital Market are less severe than for the two other Nasdaq market tiers, which center around bigger companies with higher [market capitalization](/marketcapitalization).

## Figuring out the Nasdaq Capital Market

The Nasdaq Capital Market, referred to until 2005 as the Nasdaq SmallCap Market, essentially records alleged small cap stocks (ordinarily those with market capitalizations of around $300 million to $2 billion). The name change mirrored a shift in center towards listing companies that need to raise capital. It's intended to be a less encumbered entrance for a smaller company or a [Special Purpose Acquisition Company](/spac) (SPAC) to capitalize and develop through a Nasdaq listing.

Albeit the initial [listing requirements](/listingrequirements) are loose, the [corporate governance](/corporategovernance) required to keep a Nasdaq listing is something similar across all tiers. This means Nasdaq Capital Market companies must have a code of conduct, an audit committee, independent directors, etc.

## Listing Requirements for the Nasdaq Capital Market

The Nasdaq Capital Market makes it simpler for beginning phase companies to get listed, especially when compared to other senior exchanges with additional onerous requirements. To list initially on the Nasdaq Capital Market, companies must meet every one of the criteria under something like one of three listing standards â€” the equity standard, the market value of listed securities standard, or the total resources/total revenue standard.

Every one of the standards share a few requirements like 1,000,000 publicly held shares, 300 shareholders, and three [market makers](/marketmaker) (MMs). Notwithstanding, these likewise vary in important ways. The equity standard requires [stockholders' equity](/shareholdersequity) of $5 million, where the other two require just $4 million; and it likewise requires an operating history of two years, while the other two don't need an operating history. The market value of listed securities standard requires a market value of listed securities of $50 million and a market value of publicly held shares of $15 million. The net income standard is the only one requiring a net income, $750,000 in the most recent fiscal year or in two of the last three years, however has the least requirement for market value of publicly held shares at $5 million.

In spite of the fact that companies can pick the standard that best accommodates their situation, the listing standards and the required governance are more tough than some beginning stage capital markets. In light of the costs associated with meeting these standards, companies listing on the Nasdaq Capital Market frequently helpfully surpass the base requirements before they choose to list. Other beginning stage capital markets like the alternative investments market, or [AIM](/alternative-speculation market), have situated themselves as lighter regulation objections to give bridge listings to companies as they develop enormous enough for the Nasdaq.
