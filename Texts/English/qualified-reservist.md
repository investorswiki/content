# Qualified Reservist
## What Is a Qualified Reservist?

A qualified reservist is a member of the military reserve who isn't active, however when called to duty, is eligible to make an early withdrawal from a retirement account without causing the standard early distribution penalty.

Under most conditions, the IRS forces a penalty of 10% on the taxable amount removed from a retirement account by a taxpayer more youthful than 59\u00bd years old. Qualified reservists are rare exemptions for this rule. In any case, their withdrawals are subject to federal and state taxes.

To qualify, reservists must be arranged or called to active duty after Sept. 11, 2001, for over 179 days or an endless period. Distributions should be either from a [individual retirement account](/ira) (IRA) or from employees' elective deferrals to a [401(k)](/401kplan), [457](/457plan), or [403(b)](/403bplan). Additionally, distributions must be during the period of active duty.

Certain rules permit reservists to repay retirement account distributions during the two-year period when active duty closes, even assuming that the repayment contributions surpass annual contribution limits.

## Grasping Qualified Reservists

Qualified reservist rules are genuinely recent, enacted as part of the Pension Protection Act of 2006. Initially, the rules simply applied to active reservists on Dec. 30, 2007, or before. Be that as it may, the 2008 HEART Act, or Heroes Earnings Assistance and Relief Tax Act, extended the rules for qualified reservists proceeding.

The HEART Act gave U.S. service members and their families many forms of financial assistance as a further means of expressing gratitude toward and compensating them for their service. The HEART Act contains several provisions intended to permit service members and reservists to make a smooth financial progress both into active duty and afterward back into their civilian lives.

## Upsides and downsides of Being a Qualified Reservist

Serving in the reserves can introduce financial difficulties. Married couples with kids, for example, face surprising childcare costs when one or both grown-up family members are called into active duty overseas. Likewise with a large number of the HEART Act provisions, qualified reservist rules give extra financial flexibility to reservists.

Assuming that there is a compromise, it's that there are important limitations. For instance, service-member employees can't make further elective contributions to their retirement plans after the date of distribution. This can adversely affect a potential retirement nest egg.

Maybe the greatest impediment of the qualified reservist rules is that missing even a single year of savings in a 401k or IRA can have an effect in retirement. This is particularly true right off the bat in the retirement-savings process, as the money taken out won't get an opportunity to compound over several years. Therefore, even a withdrawal of a couple thousand dollars, as considered qualified reservists, can cost $10,000 or more north of several decades.
