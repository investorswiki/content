# Merged Mining
Merged mining alludes to the act of mining at least two cryptographic forms of money simultaneously, without forfeiting overall mining performance. Basically, a miner can utilize their computational power to mine blocks on different chains simultaneously using what is known as Auxiliary Proof of Work (AuxPoW).
The thought behind AuxPoW is that the work done on one blockchain can be leveraged as legitimate work on another chain. The blockchain that gives the proof of work is called the parent blockchain, while the one that acknowledges it as legitimate is the helper blockchain.
To perform merged mining, all the elaborate digital forms of money must utilize a similar algorithm. For example, Bitcoin utilizes SHA-256, implying that practically whatever other coin that utilizes SHA-256 can be mined along with Bitcoin - as long as the technical executions are appropriately finished.
Prominently, the parent blockchain is barely impacted as it needs to goes under no sort of technical modification. Then again, the assistant blockchain should be customized to actually receive and acknowledge crafted by the parent chain. Normally, adding or eliminating support for merged mining requires a hard fork.
In theory, merged mining can be a fascinating method for a small (low-hash) blockchain to increase their security, by utilizing the hashing power of Bitcoin or another bigger chain. This might actually reduce the possibility of 51% assaults, as long as enough miners consent to embrace merged mining.
Notwithstanding, numerous engineers can't help contradicting such a thought, and claim that merged mining gives a false feeling of safety. Basically on the grounds that a somewhat big mining pool that isn't especially predominant on Bitcoin could undoubtedly arrive at 51% hashing power on the smaller chain. A counterargument to this is that on the off chance that the reward or incentive is sufficient to mine this helper chain, it will attract more miners, hence diminishing centralization and expanding security.
Other than that, some say that merged mining diminishes security in light of the fact that the economic losses are eliminated from the cycle. For example, Bitcoin miners can utilize their hashing power on the smaller chain without taking a chance with their Bitcoin [block rewards](/block-reward). As an outcome, miners would have less motivations to act really on the smaller chain.
