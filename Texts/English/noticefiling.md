# Notice Filing
## What Is a Notice Filing?

A notice filing alludes to any informational documents that an investment advisor registered with the Securities Exchange Commission might be required to submit to state securities specialists. Notice filing requirements kick in when a SEC-registered investment advisor offers services to state-based clients, similar to state pension funds, or different elements.

Notice filings must continuously incorporate duplicates of [ADV forms](/form_adv), which are documents specifying an advisory firm's investment style, assets under management (AUM), and key officers. These filing measures safeguard consumers, by bearing the cost of them accurate and transparent perspectives on the advisors they might consider trusting to deal with their investment assets.

## Understanding Notice Filing

Notice filings encountered an uptick in frequency, following Congress' entry of the [National Securities Markets Improvements Act of 1996 (NSMIA)](/nsmia). This legislation, which was made as part of a work to change the Investment Company Act of 1940 and the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, emphatically altered the relative jobs of state and federal government in directing investment advisors and representative vendors.

In making this new system, Congress required states to conform their record-keeping and financial regulation requirements, so they all the more closely look like federal record-keeping requirements. Basically: NSMIA aims to bind together state and federal securities regulation capabilities.

Strangely, NSMIA at the same time restricted the scope of state securities regulation of certain securities knowns as "covered securities," which involve the accompanying types of investments:

- The underlying securities that mutual funds and other registered investment companies invest in.
- Nationally traded securities, for example, those listed on the New York Stock Exchange.
- Securities that meet all requirements to trade over Nasdaq.

> By checking the state-based securities authorities, consumers can decide if the investment advisors that they are examining hiring, are required to issue a notice filing.

## Parts Included With a Notice Filing

An ADV form indicates the investment style, assets under management, and key officers of an advisory firm. The ADV form has two fundamental parts. The main part gives insights concerning an advisor's education, business, and any punitive actions brought against them during the past decade. The subsequent part includes the advisor's service fees and investment strategies.

While vetting expected advisors, it's essential for consumers to dissect an advisor's ADV form before committing their assets.

## Electronic Filing Requirements

All SEC-registered investment advisors are required to present an initial electronic filing with the [Investment Adviser Registration Depository (IARD)](/investment-adviser-registration-depository-iard), where they must reveal information about their separate regulatory status with state specialists, including seeing filings or state registrations as of now in effect.

The fees that advisors must pay to register with IARD rely upon the volume of regulatory assets they have under management. Advisors can utilize the electronic filing of ADV forms to issue notice filings for extra states where they carry on with work, and each state might charge its own set of fees for every individual notice filing.
