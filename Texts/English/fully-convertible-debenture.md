# Fully Convertible Debenture (FCD)
## What Is a Fully Convertible Debenture?

A fully convertible debenture (FCD) is a type of debt security wherein the whole value is convertible into equity shares at the issuer's notice. The ratio of conversion is chosen by the issuer when the debenture is issued. Upon conversion, the investors partake in similar status as ordinary shareholders of the company.

## Seeing Fully Convertible Debentures (FCDs)

A [debenture](/debenture) is a medium to long-term debt instrument utilized by large companies to borrow money at a fixed rate of interest. This fixed-income security is [unsecured](/unsecureddebt), importance there is no collateral pledged to guarantee the interest payments and principal repayments. Consequently, a debenture is backed by the full faith and credit of the issuer. Assuming the company defaults or fails, the debenture holder will get the invested funds back solely after all [secured creditors](/secured-creditor) are paid.

A debenture can be nonconvertible or convertible. A nonconvertible debenture won't be changed over into equity. It thusly orders a higher interest rate than convertible debentures. A convertible debenture can be changed over into common shares of the responsible company after a predetermined time. This time is determined by the [trust indenture](/trust_indenture). The convertible holder enjoys the benefit of partaking in any share price appreciation of the company after conversion. Thus, convertibles are issued with lower interest rates than nonconvertible debentures.

At the hour of issuance, the trust indenture features the conversion time, conversion ratio, and the conversion price. The conversion time is the period from the allotment date of the debentures. After that time has elapsed, the issuer can exercise its option to change over the securities. The [conversion ratio](/conversionratio) is the number of shares every debenture changes over into and can be communicated per bond or per 100 bonds. The [conversion price](/conversionprice) is the price at which the debenture holders can change over their debt securities into equity shares. The price is ordinarily more than the current market price of the stock.

The primary difference among FCDs and most other convertible debentures is that the responsible company can force conversion into equity. With different types of convertible securities, the owner of the debenture might have that option. Not at all like pure debt issues, for example, [corporate bonds](/corporatebond), fully convertible debentures don't represent a [credit risk](/creditrisk) for the responsible company on the grounds that FCDs eventually convert to equity.

## Fully versus Partially Convertible Debentures

A convertible debenture can be partially or fully changed over into equity. [Partially convertible debentures](/debentureredemptionreserve) (PCDs) include reclaiming a small portion of the value of the security for cash and changing over the other part into equity. A fully convertible debenture (FCD) includes a full conversion of the debt security into equity at the issuer's notice. The full conversion of debentures to equity is a method used to pay off debt in kind with equity. This [payment in kind](/pikbond) wipes out the need to repay the principal with cash.

## Benefits of Fully Convertible Debentures

Fully convertible debentures give investors a method for participating in the growth of a company while diminishing short-term risk. Long before conversion, holders of FCDs are qualified for receive a surge of interest payments. While typically lower than those for nonconvertible debentures, these payments precede any dividends to shareholders. Furthermore, FCD owners receive payment no matter what the profitability of the firm. For moderately [illiquid](/illiquid) long-term investments, that can be a substantial advantage.

One more benefit of fully convertible debentures is that they can assist the giving with firming to endure troublesome financial circumstances. Assuming the company issues a large number of nonconvertible debentures that mature at a specific time, the firm could face a credit crunch assuming that there is a [recession](/recession) around then. With fully convertible debentures, the firm tries not to need to concoct the money to repay the principal. Even better, the firm can force conversion and dispense with interest payments. Since FCD holders then become shareholders, they additionally eventually gain assuming that the company recuperates.

## Analysis of Fully Convertible Debentures

The clearest downside of fully convertible debentures for investors is the ability of the responsible company to force conversion. Firms are probably going to force conversion on occasion that are beneficial to existing shareholders as opposed to FCD investors.

Assume that the trust indenture determines that the responsible company has the option to switch the FCD over completely to equity at half over the current price in five years. In the event that the share price falls half on the grounds that the business did ineffectively, the company could have to improve [cash flow](/cashflow) at the earliest opportunity. FCD investors will presumably be forced to change over at a substantial loss when the five years are up.

Then again, existing shareholders won't have any desire to [dilute their equity](/weakening) assuming share prices are three times higher in light of the fact that the business got along nicely. The company could defer conversion to the extent that this would be possible, maybe until the need to further develop cash flow emerges during a recession. By then, share prices are probably going to be lower, restricting the gains of fully convertible debenture holders.
