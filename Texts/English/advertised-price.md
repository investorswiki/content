Advertised prices might be negotiable, however a base advertised price (MAP) is the lowest price that might be advertised for a specific thing by law.

## Grasping Advertised Price

Advertised prices are utilized to make the public aware of the price of a thing available to be purchased for the purpose of promotion. An advertised price in stores might be non-negotiable, while the advertised price for greater ticket things, like cars, boats, furniture, college tuition, medical bills or procedures, and rent, might be negotiable from their advertised price.

There are severe laws in North America against false or deceiving selling price portrayals, for example, sales made over an advertised price. Solid fines are payable by a company that sells a product over its advertised price, besides in situations where the advertised price was a slip-up that was corrected expeditiously.

As per New York City's Consumer Affairs Bureaus, an advertised price "will mean the price of a [stock keeping unit](/stock-keeping-unit-sku) which a retail store has caused to be spread through promotional methods like an in-store sign, or paper, circular, TV or radio advertising."

That's what it specifies "no retail store will charge a retail price for any stock keeping thing, whether exempt under region c of this section, which surpasses the lower of any thing, shelf, sale, or advertised price of such stock keeping thing."

In the event that a rival offers a similar product for a lower advertised price, the company will either match the lower price or refund the difference assuming the customer has previously purchased the product from it. A few retailers have been known to match a contender's advertised price and furthermore add on a rate based discount for a buyer.
