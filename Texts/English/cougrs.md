# Certificate of Government Receipts (COUGR)
## What Is a Certificate of Government Receipts (COUGR)?

A Certificate of Government Receipts (COUGR) is a [U.S. Treasury](/ustreasury) bond that is stripped of its coupon payments. The coupon portion of a Treasury is held by an intermediary dealer, like a bank, while COUGRs just pay an investor the face value at maturity. Even without the coupon payments, COUGRs are as yet attractive to investors on the grounds that the bond is sold at a discount to face value.

## Understanding a Certificate of Government Receipts (COUGR)

A Certificate of Government Receipts addresses one of several assortments of stripped U.S. Treasury securities. Normally, when an investor buys a U.S. Treasury bond, they hope to receive ordinary, semi-annual [coupon](/coupon) payments at a fixed interest rate until maturity, at which point the bond pays back its [principal](/principal).

An investment firm creates a stripped bond by purchasing a normal bond and afterward accounting separately for its principal and interest cash flow parts. The institution then sells the principal part of the bond without the coupon.

All in all, when an investor purchases a stripped bond they do so expecting just to receive the [face value](/facevalue) of the bond at maturity. To make the transaction attractive to investors, the institutions that sell stripped bonds do as such at a [discount](/discount) to the face value of the bond.

The investor's return comprises exclusively of the difference between the face value of the bond at maturity and the discounted price the investor pays at purchase.

## The Family of Stripped Bonds

Between about 1982 and 1986, different investment firms offered their own kind of stripped Treasury bonds. BNP Paribas offered COUGRs as a synthetic investment. Different options available during the 1980s included [Certificates of Accrual on Treasury Securities](/cats) (CATS), sold by Salomon Brothers, [Treasury Income Growth Receipts](/tigrs) (TIGRs), sold by Merrill Lynch, and [Lehman Investment Opportunity Notes](/lion) (LIONs), sold by Lehman Brothers.

The U.S. Treasury presented [Separate Trading of Registered Interest and Principal of Securities](/treasurystrips) (STRIPS) in 1985, permitting the sale of the principal and coupon parts of Treasury bonds as a government security.

STRIPS act exactly as other stripped bonds act and by eliminating the financial institution from the stripping equation, STRIPS successfully killed the market for new issues of such securities from banks. Interested investors might in any case have the option to track down COUGRs, TIGRs, and CATS on secondary bond markets, nonetheless.

## Stripped Bonds versus Zero-Coupon Bonds

Stripped bonds share similitudes with [zero-coupon bonds](/zero-couponbond). From the investor's standpoint, both offer an issuance at an attractive discount to face value and pay face value at maturity. From the guarantor's standpoint, notwithstanding, the two assortments act in an unexpected way.

Stripped bonds get from an interest-bearing bond, though zero-coupon bonds basically offer the difference among discounted and face value in lieu of coupon payments. Coupon payments for stripped bonds actually exist decoupled from the bond's principal. Much of the time, this permits bond traders to sell every coupon payment as a standalone zero-coupon bond.
