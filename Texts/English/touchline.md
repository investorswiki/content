## What Is a Touchline?

A touchline is the highest price that a buyer of a specific [security](/security) will bid, or the most reduced price at which a seller will offer (or sell) at some random time in the trading day.

The touchline is in this way addressed by the [bid-ask spread](/bid-askspread) of a security. As the bid and ask move, so will the touchline.

## Figuring out a Touchline

A touchline determines the best bid or ask for a specific security anytime. Very [liquid](/liquidasset) securities will generally have a narrow bid-ask spread, while [illiquid](/illiquid) securities will have a far reaching. The [EUR/USD](/eur-usd-euro-us-dollar-currency-pair) currency pair, for instance, is viewed as exceptionally liquid and in this way has a small bid-ask spread.

In the event that a security has different buyers who are bidding at $5, $5.10, and $5.15, the touchline bid price would be $5.15. This is the highest price somebody will post a bid at.

Simultaneously, on the off chance that the security has different sellers at $5.20, $5.30, and $5.35, the touchline ask price would be $5.20. This is the least price somebody will post an offer at. The bid-ask spread on this security is $5.15 for the bid and $5.20 for the ask. The spread, or difference between the bid and ask, is $0.05.

## Bid-Ask Spread

A touchline addresses the best bid as well as ask price for a given asset. This connects with the bid-ask spread, which is the amount by which the ask price surpasses the bid price for a [asset](/asset) in the market. The bid-ask spread is basically the difference between the highest price that a buyer will pay for an asset and the most reduced price that a [seller](/seller) will acknowledge to sell it.

The bid-ask spread mirrors the supply and [demand](/demand) for a specific asset, with the bids addressing the demand and the asks addressing the [supply](/supply). The depth of the bids and asks can essentially affect the bid-ask spread, causing it to broaden substantially in the event that one offsets the other or on the other hand assuming both aren't robust.

[Market makers](/marketmaker) and traders exploit the bid-ask spread and the depth of bids and asks to net the spread difference. This is one of the principal ways traders and market makers get a profit. For instance, a market maker might bid at $5.10 and furthermore offer at $5.15. On the off chance that somebody sells to the market maker, the market maker will have bought at $5.10. On the off chance that somebody buys from the market maker at $5.15, the market maker will have made $0.05 on each share traded.

The size of the bid-ask spread starting with one asset then onto the next contrasts primarily due to the difference in [liquidity](/liquidity) of every asset. Certain markets are more liquid than others. A few less-liquid assets might have spreads that ultimately depend on 1% or a greater amount of the bid price.

## Illustration of a Touchline in an Active Stock

The accompanying picture is a screen capture of the bid and ask prices in Twitter Inc. (TWTR) at a specific time during the day.
<!--495C432EA04B90E970D803CAD150AA8B-->
The bid price is the highest bid somebody will post at that specific moment, and the ask is the least posted price somebody will offer at that specific moment. For this picture, the bid touchline is $40.12, and the offer touchline is $40.13.

The bid and ask prices aren't static. Somebody might sell straightforwardly to the bid or buy straightforwardly from the offer, which will eliminate the shares posted costing that much.

In this model, there are 1,000 (10 x 100 shares, or 10 x [Round Lot](/roundlot)) shares being bid at $40.12. If somebody somehow happened to sell 1,000 shares to the bid price, the bid price wouldn't be $40.12 any longer, but instead the next highest bid. In a liquid stock, the next bid or offer is normally 1 penny below the current bid, or 1 penny over the current offer. In this case, the next bid would be $40.11 under normal conditions.

## Features
- Bid and ask prices are not static â€” somebody might sell straightforwardly to the bid or buy straightforwardly from the offer, which eliminates the shares posted costing that much.
- The bid price is the highest bid somebody will post at that specific moment, and the ask is the most reduced posted price somebody will offer at that specific moment.
- A touchline is the highest bid and most reduced offer, as addressed by the most impenetrable bid-ask spread in a security.
