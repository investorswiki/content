## What is Found Money

Found money alludes to any amount of money that has been rediscovered subsequent to being overlooked or abandoned by the actual owner.

## Figuring out Found Money

The term "found money" portrays anything from a roll of disposed of dollar bills one finds in the lower part of a washing machine to an uncollected asset found by [beneficiaries](/beneficiary) long after the account holder has died. Yet again found money relates to money that has been lost until it is found.

Each U.S. state has an unclaimed property agency that attempts to return neglected funds to their actual owners. These funds incorporate neglected bank deposits, undisbursed retirement funds and even uncashed payroll checks.

Each state has its own policy for how to deal with neglected funds that go unclaimed. Now and again, this money defaults to state cash safes after a certain time span. A few states permit the funds to endlessly stay in an in-between state. For instance, in New York the Abandoned Property Law expects substances to return unclaimed funds to the state's Comptroller's Office of Unclaimed Funds. The state [comptroller](/comptroller) fills in as the custodian of unclaimed funds until the money is guaranteed by the actual owners.

There are a wide range of forms of unclaimed funds, for example, bank accounts, retirement funds that stayed with a previous employer; and old bonds. When unclaimed assets are returned to their legitimate owner, they become "found money."

## Illustration of Found Money

Take for instance the case of Fran Goldsmith. Her dad Fred died in 2001. Fran was the [executor](/executor) of his will and the sole beneficiary of his numerous assets. It took Fran over a year to sort out his accounts as a whole. She moved a portion of his investments into her name, keeping them open. Her desired ones to close were liquidated.

During this cycle, one of her dad's shareholder accounts escaped everyone's notice. Throughout the long term, the account stayed open and the shares of ABC Fruits stayed in Fred's name. In 2017, the company was bought out by a national chain. The company offered to buy out any existing shareholders and attempted to find Fred Goldsmith. Rather they found Fran Goldsmith, the new legitimate owner of the shares, and offered her the buyout all things considered.

After accepting the buyout of $5,000 for her dad's last leftover account, Fran kidded to her friends about how this was more "found money" than she had at any point pulled out of her dryer's build up trap.
