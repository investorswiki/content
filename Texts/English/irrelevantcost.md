# Irrelevant Cost
## What Is an Irrelevant Cost?

Irrelevant costs are costs, either positive or negative, that wouldn't be impacted by a management decision. Irrelevant costs, like fixed overhead and sunk costs, are along these lines disregarded when that decision is made. Be that as it may, it's critical for a manager to have the option to distinguish an irrelevant cost in order to save the business possibly.

## Understanding Irrelevant Costs

Classifying costs as either irrelevant or important is valuable for managers making decisions about the profitability of various alternatives. Costs that stay something similar, paying little heed to which alternative is picked, are irrelevant to the decision being made.

Since an irrelevant cost might be a [relevant cost](/relevantcost) in an alternate management decision, it is important to officially define and document costs that ought to be excluded from consideration while reaching a decision.

It assists with understanding the difference among irrelevant and significant costs to pursue a critical business choice. These costs can either make your company more profitable or put the company under. These small decisions are exceptionally essential in everyday business. Here are a few instances of why irrelevant or important costs must be thought of:

- Shutting down a specific division within the business,
- Accepting a special order at a lower or higher price,
- Outsourcing a product or making it in-house,
- Selling a half-finished product or continue processing it.

> It tends to be noticed that fixed costs are frequently irrelevant in light of the fact that they can't be altered in some random situation.

## Types of Irrelevant Costs

Fixed [overhead](/overhead) and sunk costs are instances of irrelevant costs that wouldn't influence the decision to close down a division of a company, or make a product instead of purchasing it from a provider. For instance, on the off chance that a company bought a machine that broke and couldn't be returned, this sunk cost would be irrelevant to the decision to supplant the machine or get a provider to do the manufacturing. Moreover, the wages of employees retained after the sale of a division would be irrelevant to the decision to sell it.

The [book value](/bookvalue) of fixed assets like machinery, equipment, and inventory is one more illustration of irrelevant sunk costs. The book value of a machine is a sunk cost that doesn't influence a decision involving its replacement.

Instances of irrelevant costs:

- Sunk costs: Expenditures which have previously been incurred
- Committed costs: Future costs which can't be altered
- Non-cash expenses: Depreciation and amortization
- Overheads: General and administrative overheads

## Irrelevant Costs versus Significant Costs

A significant cost is any cost that will be different among different alternatives. There is rarely a "one-size fits all" situation for pertinent or irrelevant costs. Therefore they are many times called differential costs. They contrast among various alternatives.

Significant costs are impacted by a managerial decision in a certain business situation. As such, these are the costs which will be incurred in one managerial alternative and kept away from in another.

Instances of significant costs include:

- Future cash flows: Cash expenses which will be incurred later on,
- Avoidable costs: Only the costs which can be kept away from in a certain decision,
- Opportunity costs: Cash inflow which would need to be forfeited,
- Incremental Costs: Only the incremental or differential costs connected with the various alternatives.

## Features
- Irrelevant costs are those that won't change in the future when you go with one choice versus another.
- Instances of irrelevant costs are sunk costs, committed costs, or overheads as these can't be stayed away from.
- Important costs are costs that will be impacted by a managerial decision.
- Irrelevant costs are costs that won't be impacted by a managerial decision.
- There is no right solution for every business, it will frequently modify per situation.
