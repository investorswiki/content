# Annualized Rate of Return
## What Is an Annualized Rate of Return?

An annualized [rate of return](/rateofreturn) is calculated as the equivalent annual return an investor gets over a given period. The [Global Investment Performance Standards](/gips) direct that returns of portfolios or composites for periods of short of what one year may not be annualized. This forestalls "anticipated" performance in the remainder of the year from happening.

## Figuring out Annualized Rate

[Annualized](/annualize) returns are returns over a period downsized to a year period. This scaling system permits investors to compare the returns of any assets over any period impartially.

## Calculation Using Annual Data

Working out the annualized performance of an investment or index utilizing yearly data utilizes the accompanying data points:

P = principal, or initial investment

G = gains or losses

n = number of years

AP = annualized performance rate

The generalized formula, which is exponential to consider [compound interest](/compoundinterest) after some time, is:

AP = ((P + G)/P) ^ (1/n) - 1

## Annualized Rate of Return Examples

For instance, expect an investor invested $50,000 into a mutual fund and, after four years, the investment is worth $75,000. This is a $25,000 gain in four years. Accordingly, the annualized performance is:

AP = (($50,000 + $25,000)/$50,000) ^ (1/4) - 1

In this model, the annualized performance is 10.67 percent.

A $25,000 gain on a $50,000 investment more than four years is a 50 percent return. It is inaccurate to say the annualized return is 12.5 percent, or 50 percent partitioned by four since this doesn't produce into results compound interest. If turning around the 10.67 percent result to compound north of four years, the outcome is precisely exact thing is expected:

$75,000 = $50,000 x (1 + 10.67%) ^ 4

It is important not to mistake annualized performance for annual performance. The annualized performance is the rate at which an investment develops every year over the period to show up at the last valuation. In this model, a 10.67 percent return every year for a considerable length of time develops $50,000 to $75,000. However, this doesn't express anything about the genuine annual returns over the four-year period. Returns of 4.5 percent, 13.1 percent, 18.95 percent and 6.7 percent develop $50,000 into approximately $75,000. Additionally, returns of 15 percent, - 7.5 percent, 28 percent, and 10.2 percent give a similar outcome.

## Involving Days in the Calculation

Industry standards for most investments direct the most exact form of annualized return calculation, which utilizes days rather than years. The formula is something similar, with the exception of the type:

AP = ((P + G)/P) ^ (365/n) - 1

Expect from the previous model that the fund returned $25,000 north of a 1,275-day period. The annualized return is then:

AP = (($50,000 + $25,000)/$50,000) ^ (365/1275) - 1

The annualized performance in this model is 12.31 percent.

## Features
- It contrasts from the annual performance of an investment, which can shift impressively from year-to-year.
- The annualized rate of return is communicated as a percentage and is steady throughout the long term that the investment has given returns.
- The rate of return takes a gander at gains or losses on investments over changing periods of time, while the annualized rate checks out at the returns consistently.
- The annualized rate of return is an interaction for deciding investment returns on an annual basis.
