Companies will involve floating charges for the purpose of getting a [loan](/loan). Normally, a loan may be secured by fixed assets like property or equipment. Nonetheless, with a floating charge, the underlying assets are typically [current assets](/currentassets) or short-term assets that can change in value.

## Grasping a Floating Charge

Floating charges permit business owners to access [capital](/capital) secured with dynamic or circulating assets. The assets backing the floating charge are short-term current assets, ordinarily consumed by a company in one year or less. The floating charge is secured by the current assets while permitting the company to utilize those assets to run its business operations.

Current assets are those business possessions that the firm can rapidly liquidate for cash and incorporate the [accounts receivable](/accountsreceivable), inventory, and marketable securities, among different things. For instance, in the event that inventory is utilized as [collateral](/collateral) for a loan, the company can in any case sell, restock, and change the value and quantity of its inventory.

## Crystallization of Floating to Fixed Charges

In the event that a company neglects to repay the loan or enters liquidation, the floating charge becomes solidified or frozen into a fixed charge. With a fixed charge, the assets become fixed by the lender so the company can't utilize the assets or sell them.

Crystallization can likewise occur on the off chance that a company closes operations or on the other hand in the event that the borrower and lender go to court and the court names a [receiver](/receiver). When solidified, the now-fixed rate security can't be sold, and the lender might claim it.

Normally, fixed charges are secured by unmistakable assets, like buildings or equipment. For instance, in the event that a company takes out a [mortgage](/mortgage) on a building, the mortgage is a fixed charge, and the business can't sell, transfer or discard the underlying resource — the building — until it repays the loan or meets different conditions illustrated in the mortgage contract.
