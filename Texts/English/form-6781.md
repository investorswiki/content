## What Is Form 6781: Gains and Losses From Section 1256 Contracts and Straddles?

Form 6781: Gains and Losses From Section 1256 Contracts and Straddles is utilized to report gains and losses from straddles or financial contracts that are named as Section 1256 contracts.

A straddle is a strategy that includes holding contracts that offset the risk of loss from one another. For instance, in the event that a trader purchases both a call option and a put option for similar investment security simultaneously, they have formed a straddle.

Most options and futures traders should utilize this form when they complete their taxes every year. For reported investments, 40% of the gain or loss is reported as short-term, and the excess 60% is reported as long-term.

## Who Can File Form 6781: Gains and Losses From Section 1256 Contracts and Straddles?

Individual tax filers must report gains and losses for contracts as per mark-to-market rules.

Form 6781 has separate sections for [straddles](/straddle) and [Section 1256 contracts](/section-1256-contract), so investors need to recognize the specific type of investment utilized.

Section 1256 contracts incorporate regulated [futures contracts](/futurescontract), foreign currency contracts, [options](/option), dealer equity options, or dealer securities futures contracts. These investments are viewed as sold at year-end (even on the off chance that the positions are not really closed) for tax purposes. They are assigned their [fair market value](/fairmarketvalue) to determine gains and losses.

For instance, expect a trader bought a regulated futures contract on May 5, 2019, for $25,000. Toward the end of the tax year, they actually have the contract in their portfolio valued at $29,000. This trader's mark-to-market profit is $4,000. The trader reports this on Form 6781 (treated as 60% long-term and 40% [short-term capital gain](/short-term-gain)). On January 30, 2020, the trader sells their long position for $28,000. Since they've previously recognized a $4,000 gain on their 2019 tax return, the trader will record a $1,000 loss (calculated as $28,000 minus $29,000) on their 2020 tax return (treated as 60% long-term and 40% [short-term capital loss](/short-termloss)).

Investors report gains and losses for straddles and Section 1256 contract investments by utilizing Form 6781, yet hedging transactions are dealt with in an unexpected way. Since Section 1256 contracts are viewed as sold consistently, the [holding period](/holdingperiod) of the underlying asset doesn't determine whether the gain or loss is short-term or long-term: all gains and losses on these contracts are viewed as 60% long-term and 40% short-term. All in all, Section 1256 contracts permit an investor or trader to take 60% of the profit at the more great [long-term tax](/long-term_capital_gain_loss) rate even on the off chance that the contract was just held for a year or less.

> Form 6781: Gains and Losses From Section 1256 Contracts and Straddles expect that investors trading foreign securities contracts in foreign exchanges report gains or losses from that contract on Form 6781, even on the off chance that those contracts would generally not be treated as a Section 1256 contract.
