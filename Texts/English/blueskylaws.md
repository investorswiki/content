## History of Blue Sky Laws

The term "blue sky law" is said to have originated in the mid 1900s, acquiring far reaching use when a Kansas Supreme Court justice declared his craving to shield investors from speculative endeavors that had "no more basis than such countless feet of 'blue sky.'"

In the years leading up to the [1929 stock market crash,](/stock-market-crash-1929) such speculative endeavors were overflowing. Many companies issued stock, advanced real estate, and other investment deals while making elevated, unverified commitments of greater profits to come. There was no [Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)](/sec), and minimal regulatory oversight of the investment and financial industry. Securities were sold without proving material evidence to support these claims. At times, subtleties were fraudulently hidden to attract more investors. Such activities added to the hyper-speculative climate of the 1920s that prompted inflation of the stock market before its unavoidable collapse.

Albeit blue sky laws existed during that time span — Kansas enacted the soonest one, in 1911 — they would in general be pitifully phrased and authorized, and the deceitful could undoubtedly keep away from them by carrying on with work in another state. After the stock market crash and the beginning of the [Great Depression](/great_depression), Congress enacted several Securities Acts to control the stock market and the financial industry on a federal level and to lay out the SEC.

In 1956 the [Uniform Securities Act](/uniformsecuritiesact) was passed, a model law giving a system that guides states in the making of their own securities legislation. It forms the foundation for 40 out of 50 state laws today, and itself is in many cases nicknamed the Blue Sky Law. Subsequent legislation, for example, the National Securities Markets Improvement Act of 1996, pre-empts blue sky laws where they copy federal law.
