# Anonymous Trading
## What Is Anonymous Trading?

Anonymous trading happens when high profile investors execute trades that are apparent in an order book however don't uncover their identity. While most traders trade non-anonymously, there are several reasons that larger traders like to keep their participation in a market a secret.

Many stock exchanges, for example, the [London Stock Exchange](/lse) (LSE), [Toronto Stock Exchange](/toronto-stock-exchange-tsx) (TSX), New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), and [NASDAQ](/nasdaq), as well as dark pools, offer anonymous trading for certain users.

## Grasping Anonymous Trading

Anonymous trading is basically used to abstain from tipping off the market of a pending action, which could lead to [front-running](/frontrunning) behavior or maneuvering for the best position in an order book.

For example, a large institutional buyer that is interested in obtaining a huge number of shares probably shouldn't spread the word about their expectations before they can complete the purchase. The risk is that smaller investors could [bid up](/bidding-securities) the price wanting to sell it to the institutional buyer for a quick [arbitrage](/arbitrage) profit, or [pennying](/sub-pennying) could be utilized to gain execution priority unjustifiably.

Pennying is when different traders increase the bid by a penny, cutting in front of a the initial bid a trader penny lower. Traders will frequently do this on the off chance that they can see that there is an interested party able to buy large measures of stock. They cut them off, realizing that the larger party will probably keep buying even at higher prices.

Anonymous trading can happen through three different primary settings:

1. **Anonymous Exchanges**: Many large stock exchanges began to offer anonymous trading while accessing the [central order book](/order-book) due to competition from [electronic communication networks](/ecn) (ECNs) that offer anonymous trading. Other stock exchanges offer hybrid trading systems that give a decision of automated anonymous order execution and non-anonymous auction order execution.
1. **Dark Pools**: Many ECNs offer anonymous trading through [dark pools](/dark-pool). Dark pools are private asset exchanges intended to give extra liquidity and namelessness to trading large blocks of securities from the public eye.
1. **Inter-Dealer Brokers (IDBs):** [IDBs](/between dealerbroker) work with and execute trades for institutional clients in listed and OTC financial markets. IDBs frequently work with large blocks of securities where there is low trading volume or when clients look for namelessness on their orders. At the point when an IDB executes a trade for the benefit of a client, just the name of the broker is revealed and not the

## Dark Pools

Dark pools are private exchanges for trading securities that are not accessible by the investing public. Otherwise called "[dark pools of liquidity](/dark_pool_liquidity)," the name of these exchanges is a reference to their complete lack of [transparency](/transparency). Dark pools came about basically to work with [block trading](/blocktrade) by institutional investors who didn't wish to impact the markets with their large orders and acquire adverse prices for their trades.

Dark pools are sometimes projected in an unfavorable light at the same time, in reality, they fill a need. Be that as it may, their lack of transparency makes them vulnerable to potential [conflicts of interest](/irreconcilable circumstance) by their owners and predatory trading rehearses by some high-frequency traders. While dark pools offer distinct benefits to large players, the lack of transparency that is their greatest selling point likewise brings about a number of hindrances. These incorporate price divergence from the public markets and the potential for abuse.

## Special Considerations

Most anonymous trading is led by specialists and options [market makers](/marketmaker). Anonymous trades will more often than not be associated with a greater price impact, which is the reason the traders making these large orders need to be anonymous. All things considered, posting anonymous orders can be a tip-off to different traders that the anonymous trader would rather not be known, which all by itself might cause front-running or pennying.

It ought to be noticed that no trading on regulated exchanges is absolutely anonymous. At last, [settlement](/settlementdate) requirements to happen and regulators must have the option to access trade data in the event that a suspicious transaction happens. In this sense, anonymous means identity protection from different traders yet not from regulators and different gatherings that must work with the genuine trade and the [clearing](/clearing) of the trade.

Small retail traders don't have to worry about anonymous trading since their orders have little price impact, different traders are not fundamentally concerned with other small trader's actions, and most retail traders trade through large brokers where there are huge number of traders so their identity is darkened to different traders in any case.

## Illustration of Anonymous Trading on a Stock Exchange

A trader's specific identity isn't publicly available while putting a trade through an ECN or exchange. Different traders don't have the foggiest idea about the name of the person making the transaction, yet the brokerage or firm used to make the trade is noticeable.

For instance, a transaction list on a Toronto Stock Exchange (TSX) listed stock will give the time of the transaction, the price, the quantity, the exchange, as well as the buyer and seller broker/firm codes. This could give hints concerning who is buying or selling, especially assuming it is a firm with not many clients, or a firm trades its own capital.

> On the TSX, an entity can have its name stay hidden by contributing an anonymous order. This appears as a code 001, and that means anonymous.
>

Every month, the TSX distributes reports on anonymous trading, uncovering the number of anonymous trades that were directed by each firm in the previous month. This gives a transparency to anonymous trading, yet still keeps different traders from realize in real-time who is putting trades.

For retail traders trading through a large broker, anonymous trading isn't important on the grounds that there are such countless clients at the brokerage that the broker will be continually making trades in many equities. Just incredibly large [volume](/volume) going through a specific broker might tip off different participants who realize that certain clients trade with that broker.

## Highlights
- Retail traders don't have to concern themselves with trading anonymously since they regularly don't have a huge price impact and different traders aren't especially concerned with smaller one-time orders.
- No regulated order is genuinely anonymous since the trades actually should be settled and cleared, regulators actually need access to trade data in the event that they need it.
- Anonymous trading might be important to large traders who would rather not give signs to different traders that they are buying or selling.
