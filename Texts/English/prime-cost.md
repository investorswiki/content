It alludes to a manufactured product's costs, which are calculated to guarantee the best [profit margin](/profitmargin) for a company. The prime cost computes the [direct costs](/directcost) of raw materials and labor that are engaged with the production of a decent. Direct costs do exclude indirect expenses, like advertising and administrative costs.

1. Total or add the two figures of direct raw materials and direct labor costs together.

## Everything Prime Cost Can Say to You

A prime cost is the total direct costs, which might be fixed or variable, of manufacturing a thing available to be purchased. Businesses utilize prime costs as an approach to measuring the total cost of the production inputs expected to make a given output. By dissecting its prime costs, a company can set prices that yield wanted profits. By bringing down its prime costs, a company can increase its profit or undermined its rivals' prices.

Companies need to compute the prime cost of every product manufactured to guarantee they are generating a [profit](/profit). Self-employed people, for example, craftsmans who make and sell uniquely designed furniture, frequently utilize the prime cost calculation to guarantee they are making the time-based compensation they want while likewise profiting from every product made.

Indirect costs, like utilities, manager salaries, and delivery costs, are excluded from prime costs. One justification for why indirect costs are excluded from the prime cost calculation is that they can be challenging to evaluate and designate.

## Illustration of How to Use Prime Cost

Suppose, for instance, a professional carpenter is recruited to build a lounge area table for a customer. The prime costs for making the table incorporate direct labor and [raw materials](/rawmaterials), like timber, hardware, and paint. The materials directly adding to the table's production cost $200. The carpenter charges $50 each hour for labor, and this project requires three hours to complete. The prime cost to create the table is $350 ($200 for the raw materials + $150 in direct labor). To produce a profit, the table's price ought to be set over its prime cost.

Consider a similar carpenter who developed and sold another hand-created table for $250. The cost of the raw materials was $200, and it took him three hours to develop. Regardless of labor costs, the carpenter realized a gain of $50. On the off chance that his direct labor costs were $15 each hour, he realized an unobtrusive gain of $5. Accordingly, self employed people genuinely should utilize the prime cost method while figuring out what price to set for their goods and services.

On the off chance that a similar craftsman wanted a labor wage of $20 each hour and a profit of $100, the prime cost and price would be $260 ($200 for materials and $60 for labor) and $360 (prime cost + wanted profit), individually.

## The Difference Between Prime Costs and Conversion Costs

Conversion costs are additionally used to work out profitability in view of the cost of production, however these incorporate direct labor as well as [overhead](/overhead) expenses incurred due to the transformation of raw materials into completed products. Overhead costs are defined as the expenses that can't be directly credited to the production interaction yet are vital for operations, for example, power or different utilities required for the manufacturing plant. Direct labor costs are equivalent to those utilized in prime cost calculations.

Conversion costs are likewise utilized as a measure to check the efficiencies in production processes however consider the overhead expenses avoided with regard to prime cost calculations. Operations managers likewise use conversion costs to figure out where there might be squander inside the manufacturing system. Conversions costs and prime costs can be utilized together to assist with ascertaining the base profit required while deciding prices to charge customers.

## Limitations of Using Prime Cost

Since prime cost just considers direct costs, it doesn't capture the total cost of production. Thus, the prime cost calculation can be misdirecting assuming indirect costs are somewhat large. A company probably causes several different expenses that wouldn't be remembered for the calculation of the prime cost, for example, manager salaries or expenses for unexpected supplies expected to keep the factory running. These different expenses are viewed as manufacturing overhead expenses and are remembered for the calculation of the conversion cost. The conversion cost considers labor and overhead expenses, yet not the cost of materials.

A second limitation of prime cost includes the difficulties associated with recognizing which production costs are for sure direct. There are various expenses associated with delivering goods available to be purchased. To compute the prime cost of a thing precisely, there must be an unmistakable division between those expenses that can directly connection to the production of every unit versus those that are required to run the overall business. The specific expenses remembered for the prime cost calculation can differ contingent upon the thing being created.
