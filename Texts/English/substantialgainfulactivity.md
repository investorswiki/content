# Substantial Gainful Activity (SGA)
## What Is Substantial Gainful Activity (SGA)?

Substantial gainful activity (SGA) addresses the month to month threshold salary utilized by the U.S. [Social Security Administration](/ssa) (SSA) to qualify individuals for disability benefits. The SSA refreshes the dollar amount every year to reflect [inflation](/inflation) (or rising prices) and generally keeps a higher threshold for legally blind individuals.

## Figuring out Substantial Gainful Activity (SGA)

Substantial gainful activity addresses the amount of month to month income below which an individual becomes eligible for disability benefits under [Social Security](/socialsecurity). The SSA utilizes the SGA amount as a key determinant in whether it considers a person disabled for the motivations behind its programs.

Individuals unable to take part in activities that earn them more than the month to month SGA threshold fit the bill for disability payments. The SSA doesn't consider those capable of taking part in activities that earn more than the threshold disabled for the motivations behind its programs.

The threshold amounts used to compute the SGA amount contrast for blind and non-blind individuals. The people who meet the SSA's statutory definition of blindness have a higher SGA threshold than the people who don't, and that means blind individuals can generally earn more each month than non-blind individuals before they become ineligible for disability benefits.

### Month to month Income Limit

The SSA set the 2022 SGA amount for non-blind individuals at $1,350 each month. This means that any individual able to take part in employment that earns $1,350 or more each month won't meet the qualification criteria to receive disability benefits in 2021. The SSA set the SGA threshold for blind individuals at $2,260 in 2022.

### Cost-of-Living Adjustment (COLA)

Beneficiaries of Social Security and Supplemental Security Income (SSI) will receive a 5.9% [cost-of-living adjustment](/cola) (COLA) in 2022. The COLA adds to month to month benefits to adapt to rising prices — called [inflation](/inflation). In spite of the fact that your specific regularly scheduled payment will rely upon your situation, on average, a disabled worker that got compensated $1,282 each month before the COLA will get compensated $1,358 month to month in 2022 after the COLA.

## SSDI versus SSI

The SSA gives disability payments to individuals through two programs. Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI) covers individuals who have paid into the Social Security program through payroll deductions.

[Supplemental Security Income](/ssi) (SSI) pays benefits to disabled individuals who meet a specific set of financial qualification requirements, regardless of whether recently employed. For non-blind individuals, the SSA involves the SGA threshold to determine qualification for benefits from one or the other program.

For legally blind individuals, notwithstanding, the SSA just purposes the SGA to determine qualification for payments under the SSDI program. For blind individuals who receive disability payments under the SSI program, the SSA doesn't involve SGA thresholds in its initial determination of qualification.

When the SSA endorses disability benefits for an individual, it permits that person to keep on getting benefits for a concise period after that person becomes able to reappear the labor force and earn more than the SGA amount every month. This gives an incentive to disabled individuals to look for gainful employment and return the labor force in an alternate capacity as long as possible, if possible.
