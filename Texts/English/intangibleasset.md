# Immaterial Asset
## What is an immaterial asset?
Immaterial assets are [items of value](/assets) owned by a business that need physical traits. They incorporate thoughts and concepts, which can be more difficult to value than physical assets like real estate, machinery, or stock. Theoretical assets incorporate goodwill and intellectual property, for example, trademarks and copyrights, patents, business processes, and software.
## More profound definition
The concept of an immaterial asset is key to deciding a company's value and reputation. Goodwill is an illustration of a theoretical asset that can be challenging to value yet is a vital factor in deciding a company's total worth. Goodwill is placed as a detail on the [balance sheet](/balancesheet) when one company purchases another, and it addresses the perceived value in dollars of the acquired company's reputation, brand, customer base, and picture. Goodwill addresses the probability representing things to come sales outcome of the company being acquired.
Different things that are viewed as immaterial assets include:
- **Patents:** A patent is the description of a clever concept that could be completed as a gadget, product or interaction.
- **Trademarks:** Customers like to purchase notable brands they associate with quality products.
- **Copyrights:** Creators of original works are conceded exclusive rights for their utilization and distribution, as a rule for a limited period of time.
- **Software:** Computer software is generally (however not dependably) viewed as a theoretical asset.

Deciding the realistic value of immaterial assets is frequently troublesome. For instance, Coca-Cola values its brand and logo — key trademarks — at $13 billion, greater than the value of all its physical assets, which it values at $12.6 billion. While the company would be unable to prove its brand valuation, the vast majority would recognize the brand has a great deal of value.
## Immaterial asset model
Balthazar's Widget Manufacturing Corporation has just been purchased by a contender. The company's physical assets — including offices, equipment, and stock — were valued at $150 million, however the purchase price was $295 million. The explanation was Balthazar's elusive assets, which remembered $100 million for goodwill and $45 million in specific computer systems.
