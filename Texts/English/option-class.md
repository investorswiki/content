# Option Class
## What Is an Option Class?

An option class alludes to all the [call options](/calloption) or all the [put options](/putoption) listed on an exchange for a particular [underlying asset](/underlying-asset). For instance, every one of the calls available for trade on Apple Inc. (AAPL) stock would be part of similar options class. Every one of the puts listed on Apple would be part of another, related class.

The number of options available for purchase or sale inside a given option class will rely upon the size and trading volume of the underlying asset, as well as overall market conditions.

## Understanding Option Classes

Option classes are utilized to arrange options on an exchange for investors. All major public market exchanges use option classes to list the option available for trade on a given underlying asset. Frequently exchanges and financial destinations will break the class up into series. A [option series](/optionseries) is every one of the calls or puts at different strike costs and with a similar expiry for a given underlying asset.

For instance, every one of the calls or puts that lapse in June would be an option series. An option series is a part of the larger option class. Therefore, while review options cites, a few locales might show the whole option class, yet regularly it will be arranged by expiry date (series).

### Options Across the Market

Other markets, for example, [over-the-counter](/otc) (OTC) or institutional markets may not necessarily use option classes due to the complexity and altered organizing of the [options](/option) being traded.

Just like with stocks, exchange-traded options must be traded through a broker who interfaces with [market makers](/marketmaker) to assist with working with trading. Option exchanges utilize standard [bid-ask](/bid-and-ask) pricing models. While option prices are produced from advanced analytics, their daily trading prices are as yet affected by [supply and demand](/law-of-supply-demand) in the market.

[Broker-dealers](/broker-seller) generally require at least $2,000 in capital for endorsement of an options trading account. Rules and regulations for options trading are overseen by the [Options Clearing Corporation](/occ) (OCC).

## Special Considerations

Generally, when access to an options trading platform is laid out, investors will actually want to see the full listing of option classes for their preferred underlying security. Options are typically listed and classified by the ticker on the instrument's underlying asset.

An options brokerage trading platform will isolate calls and puts on underlying securities. Calls and [puts](/put) are generally the two broadest option classes available. Inside every one of these classes, investors will find a rundown of available strike prices and lapses.

The amount of data gave on every option class will typically be founded on a financial backer's subscription inclinations. A few options quotes incorporate advanced analytics, for example, [greeks](/greeks), while other platforms/subscriptions may just show the fundamental contract name, strike, [expiry](/expirationdate), bid, ask, last price, last trade time/date, percent change, volume, open interest, and frequently [implied volatility](/iv) is incorporated too.

## True Example of an Option Class

Some option classes are large, while others are moderately small relying upon how famous the options market is for a given underlying asset.

For instance, every one of the calls available for trade on the SPDR S&P 500 Trust (SPY) number in the hundreds.

Then again, the option class for Barnes Group Inc. (B) was somewhat small as of June 2019, with several options available for trade with two available expiry dates. At that point, the stock was trading at $54.46.

Every one of the calls above address the call option class for this stock, while the puts address the put option class for this stock at the hour of composing. Option classes can develop or shrink contingent upon whether more or less options become available due to increased or diminished interest.

## Features
- How large the option class is relies upon the volume of the underlying asset and the market conditions of both the underlying and the underlying's options market.
- An option class can be broken down into subsets called options series, which are the calls or puts for an underlying asset that lapse around the same time.
- An option class is involved all of a similar type of option (i.e., either calls or puts) listed on a similar underlying security.
- An option chain rather incorporates both every one of the calls and every one of the puts listed on some security.
