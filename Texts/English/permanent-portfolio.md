# Permanent Portfolio
## What Is a Permanent Portfolio?

The permanent portfolio is a [investment portfolio](/portfolio-investment) intended to perform well in every economic condition. It was contrived by [free-market](/freemarket) investment analyst, Harry Browne, during the 1980s.

The permanent portfolio is made out of an equivalent allocation of stocks, [bonds](/bond), gold, and cash, or Treasury bills.

## Figuring out a Permanent Portfolio

The permanent portfolio was built by Harry Browne to be what he trusted would be a safe and productive portfolio in any economic climate. Utilizing a variation on efficient market indexing, Browne stated that a portfolio similarly split between growth stocks, precious metals, government bonds, and Treasury bills would be an ideal investment mixture for investors seeking safety and growth.

## Advantages and Disadvantages of a Permanent Portfolio

Browne contended that the portfolio mix would be productive in a wide range of economic circumstances: growth stocks would thrive in expansionary markets, precious metals in [inflationary](/inflation) markets — significance rising costs — bonds in recessions, and Treasury bills in discouragements.

Browne in the long run made what was called the Permanent Portfolio Fund, with an asset mix like his hypothetical portfolio in 1982. From 1976 to 2016, a speculative permanent portfolio would have produced a 8.65% annual return, for a total return of 2,600%. A more standard 60/40 portfolio of stocks-to-bonds would have created a 10.13% annual return for a total return of 5,050%.

However, the permanent portfolio enjoyed a few benefits during this period. The 60/40 portfolio had a [standard deviation](/standarddeviation) of 9.6, compared with 7.2 for the permanent portfolio. During the October [1987 market crash](/securities exchange crash-1987), the 60/40 portfolio would have declined in value by 13.4%, while the permanent portfolio would have declined by just 4.5%. The permanent portfolio would have produced lower returns over the long term, yet it would have been a much smoother ride. That makes the permanent portfolio an engaging option to risk-loath investors.

## Illustration of a Permanent Portfolio

There are numerous manners by which one can build a permanent portfolio, given the huge number of investment opportunities accessible. Below is one idea on the most proficient method to accomplish this balanced mix:

- 25% in U.S. stocks, to give a strong return during times of thriving. For this portion of the portfolio, Browne suggests an essential [S&P 500 index](/sp500) fund, for example, the Vanguard 500 Index Fund Admiral Shares (VFIAX).
- 25% in long-term U.S. Treasury bonds, which in all actuality do well during times of flourishing and during times of collapse — or lower costs — however which do inadequately during other economic cycles.
- 25% in cash to hedge against periods of "tight cash" or [recession](/recession). In this case, "cash" means short-term U.S. Treasury bills.
- 25% in [precious metals](/preciousmetal) (gold) to give protection during periods of inflation. Browne suggests gold bullion coins.

Browne suggests [rebalancing](/rebalancing) the portfolio once per year to keep up with the 25% target loads.
