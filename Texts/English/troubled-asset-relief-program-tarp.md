# Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP)
## What Was the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP)?

The Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) was an initiative made and [run](/herbert-m-allison-jr) by the U.S. Treasury to balance out the country's financial system, reestablish economic growth, and moderate [foreclosures](/dispossession) in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis. TARP looked to accomplish these targets by purchasing troubled companies' assets and stock.

## How the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) Worked

Worldwide credit markets approached standstill in September 2008 as several major financial institutions, like Fannie Mae, [Freddie Mac](/freddiemac), and American International Group (AIG), experienced extreme financial issues. [Lehman Brothers ](/lehman-brothers)went bankrupt, and investment companies Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley changed their [charters](/corporatecharter) to become commercial banks trying to balance out their capital situations.

To prevent the situation from totally spiraling wild, Treasury Secretary [Henry Paulson](/henry-paulson) spearheaded the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP). It was endorsed into law by President George W. Bush on October 3, 2008, with the entry of the [Emergency Economic Stabilization Act](/emergency-economic-steadiness act).

TARP's original purpose was to increase the liquidity of the money markets and [secondary mortgage markets](/secondary_mortgage_market) by purchasing the mortgage-backed securities (MBS), and through that, reduce the expected losses of the institutions that owned them.

Afterward, TARP's aim was modified marginally to permit the government to buy equity in banks and other financial institutions. TARP initially gave the Treasury purchasing power of $700 billion; the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (essentially alluded to as [Dodd-Frank](/dodd-frank-financial-administrative reform-bill)) later reduced the $700 billion authorization to $475 billion.

The U.S. government bought [preferred stock](/preferredstock) in eight banks: Bank of America/Merrill Lynch, Bank of New York Mellon, Citigroup, Goldman Sachs, J.P. Morgan, Morgan Stanley, State Street, and Wells Fargo. The banks were required to give the government a 5% dividend that would increase to 9% in 2013, empowering banks to buy back the stock in five years or less.

From the program's commencement until October 3, 2010 (the cutoff time for expanding funds), $245 billion was utilized to balance out banks, $27 billion went to programs to increase credit availability, $80 billion went to the U.S. car industry (specifically, GM and Chrysler), $68 billion was utilized to settle AIG, and $46 billion went to dispossession prevention programs, for example, Making Home Affordable.

The provisions of TARP demanded that companies included lose certain tax benefits and, by and large, put limits on executive compensation and prohibited fund beneficiaries from granting bonuses to their main 25 most generously compensated executives. Even thus, by 2009, rescued firms paid a $20 billion to key work force — harshly alluded to as [TARP bonuses](/tarp-bonuses).

### The Legacy of TARP

In December 2013, the Treasury wrapped up TARP and the government presumed that its investments had earned more than $11 billion for taxpayers. More specifically, TARP recuperated funds adding up to $441.7 billion from $426.4 billion invested. The government additionally claimed that TARP prevented the American vehicle industry from fizzling and saved more than 1,000,000 positions, balanced out banks, and reestablished credit availability for people and organizations.

Even thus, business analysts, lawmakers, financial experts actually banter TARP's merits and keep thinking about whether it had been important. Pundits charge the program did barely anything to help the housing markets, which stayed depressed for a really long time. Some say it didn't go sufficiently far — that the government ought to have demanded an equity stake in the financial firms it was rescuing to control their future practices.

All things being equal, pundits think that TARP's no-strings loans basically acted as a reward for terrible behavior, communicating something specific of "act flippantly and we'll take care of you" — and laying out a dangerous precedent of dependency.

TARP additionally didn't charm the government to the American public, which saw Wall Street receive rewards — including those famous bonuses — and return to profitability, even as people battled with debt, unemployment, and dispossessions in the wake of the Great Recession.
