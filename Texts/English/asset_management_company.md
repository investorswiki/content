# Asset Management Company (AMC)
## What Is an Asset Management Company (AMC)?

An asset management company (AMC) is a firm that invests pooled funds from clients, putting the capital to deal with various investments including stocks, bonds, real estate, [master limited partnerships](/mlp), and the sky is the limit from there. Along with [high-net-worth individual](/hnwi) (HNWI) portfolios, AMCs oversee hedge funds and pension plans, and — to better serve more modest investors — make pooled designs, for example, mutual funds, index funds, or exchange-traded funds (ETFs), which they can oversee in a single centralized portfolio.

AMCs are casually alluded to as money managers or money management firms. Those that offer public [mutual funds](/mutualfund) or ETFs are otherwise called investment companies or mutual fund companies. Such businesses include Vanguard Group, Fidelity Investments, T. Rowe Price, and numerous others.

AMCs are generally distinguished by their [assets under management](/aum) (AUM) — the amount of assets that they make due.

## Understanding Asset Management Companies (AMCs)

Since they have a larger pool of resources than the individual investor could access all alone, AMCs furnish investors with more [diversification](/diversification) and investing options. Buying for such countless clients permits AMCs to practice [economies of scale](/economiesofscale), frequently getting a price discount on their purchases.

Pooling assets and paying out proportional returns likewise permits investors to keep away from the [minimum investment](/minimum_investment) requirements frequently required while purchasing securities all alone, as well as the ability to invest in a larger assortment of securities with a more modest amount of investment funds.

### AMC Fees

In many cases, AMCs charge a fee that is calculated as a percentage of the client's total AUM. This asset management fee is a defined annual percentage that is calculated and paid month to month. For instance, in the event that an AMC charges a 1% annual fee, it would charge $100,000 in annual fees to deal with a portfolio worth $10 million. Nonetheless, since portfolio values vary on a daily and month to month basis, the management fee calculated and paid consistently will vacillate month to month too.

Continuing with the above model, if the $10 million portfolio increases to $12 million in the next year, the AMC will remain to make an extra $20,000 in management fees. On the other hand, if the $10 million portfolio declines to $8 million due to a market correction, the AMC's fee would be diminished by $20,000. In this manner, charging fees as a percentage of AUM effectively adjusts the AMC's interests to that of the client; assuming the AMC's clients thrive, so does the AMC, yet assuming the clients' portfolios make losses, the AMC's incomes will decline too.

Most AMCs set a minimum annual fee, for example, $5,000 or $10,000 in order to zero in on clients that have a portfolio size of something like $500,000 or $1 million. Likewise, some specialized AMCs, for example, [hedge funds](/hedgefund) may charge performance fees for generating returns over a set level or that beat a benchmark. The "[two and twenty](/two_and_twenty)" fee model is standard in the hedge fund industry.

### Buy Side

Commonly, AMCs are considered [buy-side](/buyside) firms. This status means they assist their clients with making investment choices in light of proprietary in-house research and data analytics, while likewise using security suggestions from sell-side firms.

Sell-side firms, for example, [investment banks](/investmentbank) and stockbrokers, conversely, sell investment services to AMCs and different investors. They perform a great deal of market analysis, looking at trends and creating projections. Their objective is to produce trade orders on which they can charge transaction fees or [commissions](/commission).

## Asset Management Companies (AMCs) versus Brokerage Houses

[Brokerage](/brokerage-company) houses and AMCs overlap in numerous ways. Along with trading securities and doing analysis, many brokers exhort and oversee client portfolios, frequently through a special "private investment" or "wealth management" division or subsidiary. Many additionally offer proprietary mutual funds. Their brokers may likewise act as advisors to clients, discussing financial objectives, recommending products, and assisting clients in alternate ways.

As a rule, however, brokerage houses acknowledge almost any client, no matter what the amount they need to invest, and these companies have a legal standard to give "suitable" services. Suitable basically means that as long as they put forth their best attempt to deal with the funds admirably, and in line with their clients' stated objectives, they are not responsible in the event that their clients lose money.

Conversely, most asset management firms are [fiduciary](/fiduciary) firms, held to a higher legal standard. Basically, guardians must act in the best interest of their clients, avoiding irreconcilable circumstances consistently. On the off chance that they fail to do as such, they face criminal liability. They're held to this higher standard in large part since money managers ordinarily have discretionary trading powers over accounts. That is, they can buy, sell, and settle on investment choices on their authority, without consulting the client first. Conversely, brokers must ask permission before executing trades.

AMCs ordinarily execute their trades through a designated broker. That brokerage likewise acts as the designated [custodian](/custodian) that holds or houses an investor's account. AMCs likewise will quite often have higher minimum investment edges than brokerages do, and they charge fees instead of commissions.
