# Capacity Management
## What Is Capacity Management?

Capacity management alludes to the act of guaranteeing a business boosts its possible activities and production yield — consistently, under all conditions. The capacity of a business measures how much companies can accomplish, produce, or sell inside a given time span. Think about the following models:

- A call center can field 7,000 calls each week.
- A bistro can blend 800 cups of coffee each day.
- An automobile production line can gather 250 trucks each month.
- A vehicle service center can take care of 40 customers each hour.
- A restaurant has the seating capacity to oblige 100 cafes.

## Figuring out Capacity Management

Since capacity can change due to changing conditions or outer impacts — including [seasonal demand](/seasonality), industry changes, and startling macroeconomic occasions — companies must stay sufficiently deft to measure up to assumptions in a cost-compelling way continually. For instance, [raw material resources](/rawmaterials) may should be adjusted, contingent upon demand and the business' current close by inventory.

Executing capacity management might involve working extra time, [outsourcing](/outsourcing) business operations, purchasing extra equipment, and leasing or selling commercial property.

Companies that ineffectively execute capacity management might experience lessened incomes due to unfulfilled orders, customer attrition, and diminished market share. Thusly, a company that carries out an imaginative new product with an aggressive marketing campaign must equivalently plan for a sudden spike in demand. The powerlessness to recharge a retail accomplice's inventory as soon a possible is terrible for business.

Businesses hence face inherent moves in their endeavors to deliver at capacity while limiting production costs. For example, a company might lack the imperative time and staff expected to conduct adequate [quality control](/quality-control) reviews on its products or services. Besides, machinery could break down due to abuse and employees might endure stress, fatigue, and reduced spirit whenever pushed too hard.

> Capacity management is of specific concern to large companies since it's somewhat simple to purchase extra equipment for more modest organizations for a minimal price; in any case, when a business develops, adding new programming turns out to be dramatically more costly. In this way capacity management must consider several different viewpoints connected with growth and production costs.

## Space Management

Capacity management likewise means computing the extent of spacial capacity that is actually being utilized throughout a certain time span. Consider a company operating at a maximum capacity that houses 500 employees across three floors of an office building. If that company [downsizes](/scale back) by diminishing the number of employees to 300, it will then, at that point, be operating at 60% capacity (300/500 = 60%). In any case, given that 40% of its office space is left unused, the firm is spending more on per-unit cost than before.

Subsequently, the company could choose to distribute its labor resources to just two floors and cease leasing the unused floor in a proactive work to reduce expenditures on [rent](/commercial-property), insurance, and utility costs associated with the vacant space.
