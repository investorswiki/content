# Personal Property
## What is personal property?
Personal property is basically any property with the exception of real estate. The primary thing that separates personal property from real estate is that you can move personal property, which you can't do with land or structures, which are permanent fixtures.
## More profound definition
Personal property incorporates everything from jewelry to apparel to home goods, and almost all the other things you own, and it is otherwise called chattel and portable property.
For a business, personal property could incorporate office machines and furniture, for example, computers, work areas, company vehicles and other property and equipment utilized in the course of carrying on with work.
There are three types of personal property: unmistakable, theoretical and listed. Unmistakable personal property incorporates physical articles like vehicles, furniture and household goods, while elusive personal property incorporates things like stocks and bonds, as well as intellectual property like licenses and copyrights.
Listed personal property will be property that can be utilized for one or the other business or personal purposes, for example, a vehicle or computer that you use for business related matters as well as personal matters.
Another thing that recognizes personal property from real estate is that personal property includes more hazardous collateral. In the event that you owe a creditor and don't pay, the creditor can hold onto your home to get the money owed to that person, however on the off chance that the creditor attempts to place a lien on personal property, it's simpler for you to take the property with you or discard it before the individual in question can claim it for payment of the debt.

## Personal property model
All that you own, beside real property, is viewed as personal property. This incorporates material goods like the entirety of your dress, any jewelry, all of your household goods and decorations, and whatever else that is portable and not permanently joined to a fixed location like your home.
Your bank accounts and some other financial assets, for example, investment accounts likewise count as personal property. While applying for a loan or credit, you can list your personal property as assets to increase your worth, since creditors frequently think about this while deciding how likely a borrower will repay the debt.
