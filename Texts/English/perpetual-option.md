# Perpetual Option (XPO)
## What Is a Perpetual Option (XPO)?

A perpetual option is a non-standard, or [exotic](/exoticoption), financial option that has no fixed maturity and no exercise limitation. While the life of a standard option can go from a couple of days to several years, a perpetual option (XPO) can be exercised whenever and with next to no expiration. Perpetual options are subsequently a form of a [American](/americanoption) option, though [European](/europeanoption) options can be exercised exclusively on the option's maturity date.

XPO contracts are additionally alluded to as "non-lapsing options" or "expirationless options."

## Figuring out Perpetual Options (XPOs)

An option contract gives its holder the right, however not the obligation, to purchase (for a [call option](/calloption)) or sell (for a [put option](/putoption)) a specific amount of the underlying security for a foreordained ([strike](/strikeprice)) price at or before the option's [expiration](/expirationdate). A perpetual option gives similar kind of rights without expiration.

Perpetual options are technically classified as exotic options since they are non-standard, despite the fact that they might be seen as [plain vanilla](/plainvanilla) options since the main modification is the lack of a decided expiration date. For certain investors, these address an advantage over other instruments (particularly when [dividends](/profit) as well as voting rights are not a high priority) in light of the fact that the strike price on a perpetual option empowers the holder to pick the buy or sell price point and their capability to buy/sell at that price doesn't terminate. Likewise, XPOs can be desirable over standard options since they wipe out the expiration risk.

While perpetual options have a few ideal features and have been the focal point of some intriguing scholarly work with regards to financial economics, the viable utilization of XPOs by traders is limited. No registered options exchanges list perpetual options in the U.S. or on the other hand abroad, so if and when they really do trade they will happen in the [over-the-counter](/otc) (OTC) market. Therefore, the common trader won't ever have contact with one of these options. Finding a legitimate value would be troublesome while buying, and [writing](/composing an-option) a perpetual option exposes the trader to risk however long that option stays open.

One illustration of an exotic OTC option that consolidates a perpetual option with a [lookback](/lookbackoption) feature is the [Russian option](/russianoption). This doesn't have anything to do with where the option is traded. This option is likewise a theoretical thought and isn't actively traded anyplace. Various types of options are much of the time given names of countries to rapidly separate one style from another.

## Pricing a Perpetual Option

European options are priced utilizing the [Black-Scholes-Merton](/blackscholes) model, and American options that have an early exercise feature are priced typically with a [binomial](/binomialoptionpricing) or [trinomial](/trinomialoptionpricingmodel) tree model. Having no expiration date, perpetual options are fairly unique to price, frequently utilizing a Martingale model, albeit different methodologies have been put forward in scholastic papers.

To price these options, the conditions for when to optimally exercise must be laid out, which could be defined as when the underlying asset arrives at the optimal exercise barrier. This barrier price is the optimal exercise point and is defined mathematically as where the current values of the option's price and the payoff meet.

## Illustration of a Perpetual Option

Since perpetual options are not actively traded, to comprehend them we can take a gander at a normal option and afterward take out the expiration date.

Expect a trader is keen on a perpetual call option on the price of gold, in view of the nearest [futures contract](/futures) price. Since the contracts are non-standard, they can be founded on any instrument wanted and for any amount, like one ounce of gold or 10,000 ounces.

Expect that gold right now trades at $1,300. The trader chooses a strike price of $1,500. Therefore, if the price of gold rises above $1,500, the contract will be [in the money](/inthemoney). However, that doesn't mean the trader will bring in money. The price of the option, or [premium](/premium), will decide at which point it becomes productive to exercise the option.

Since the option has no expiry, the option writer is on the hook endlessly if the price of gold rises to $2,000, $5,000, or even $10,000 or higher in the years or a long time to come. Such an option, therefore, wouldn't be cheap. A standard option stretching out 1.5 years can cost 10% of the value of the underlying (fluctuating dramatically, up or down, in view of volatility). Therefore, a perpetual option could without much of a stretch cost half or a greater amount of the underlying.

Expect somebody will sell a perpetual option of this sort of $550 on one ounce of gold. For the buyer to bring in money, the price of gold (in view of the nearest futures contract) would have to rise above $2,050 ($1,500 + $550). However long the price of gold is below that, the trader has hope and time yet not profits. Assuming the price of gold is at $1,700, the option is worth $200 however the trader paid $550, so it isn't worth more than whatever they paid yet. With a perpetual option, when it is bringing in money, there is likewise the problem of choosing when to exercise it.
