# Zero Capital Gains Rate
## What Is a Zero Capital Gains Rate?

A zero capital gains rate suggests a tax rate of 0% on capital gains. This 0% rate might be charged to people who sell property inside a purported "[enterprise zone](/enterprise-zone)." Such a zone is a geographic area that has been conceded special tax breaks, regulatory exemptions, or other public assistance to energize private economic development and job creation. They are utilized most frequently to advance the renewal of a city area.

The zero [capital gains](/capitalgain) rate can be applied by a given level of government to provoke investment in a given area.

## Understanding a Zero Capital Gains Rate

In 2004, the U.S. Congress passed, and the president approved, the Working Families Tax Relief Act. The act contains provisions that expand the 0% capital gains tax to certain properties being sold inside certain enterprise zones. Enterprise zones were presented in the U.S. during the 1970s with an end goal to reverse the flight of individuals and businesses from urban centers to suburbia. The programs might be utilized to urge a private company to remain in an area, extend in it, or migrate to it.

The logic behind this act is to give an incentive to people to invest around here. The rate isn't exclusive to any one region, state, or district. Officials hoping to make jobs and draw investment into a community habitually enact a zero capital gains tax rate, or institute other tax-related incentives around there.

A 2012 tax bill made the 0% capital gains rate permanent for most filers, furnished that are either single with a taxable income under $37,950, or couples with taxable income under $75,900. Even still, a portion of these filers face unassuming tax rates of 25% to 30%, on the off chance that they earn extra income that is taxed at ordinary rates, thus pushing their long-term gains or qualified [dividend](/dividend) income from the 0% bracket into the 15% bracket for investment income.

Then again, itemized deductions might reduce ordinary income, putting people underneath the 15% bracket and consequently expanding the capital gains or dividends that are taxed at 0%. This makes sense of why taxpayers can have high adjusted gross incomes yet at the same time face 0% taxes on their long-term capital gains.

## Model: The D.C. Enterprise Zone

Under this program, every enterprise zone has its own specific set of rules, which might change as the legislation is extended or amended. For instance, with the D.C. enterprise zone, the accompanying orders must be fulfilled:

- The property must have been substantially improved during that time span of ownership.
- The property must be been for at least a long time from the date of securing
- Something like 80% of the total gross income coming about because of the property ownership must be derived from business actively directed inside the D.C. Enterprise Zone.
- In the event that the property being referred to is for commercial rental purposes, somewhere around half of the rental income must come from businesses situated inside the D.C. enterprise zone.
- The original utilization of the property must initiate with the taxpayer; this necessity is considered to be met assuming substantial improvements have been made to the property.

## Highlights
- A 0% rate on the sale of property is most frequently associated with enterprise zones, which are special areas conceded special status by a government to support development and economic growth.
- To keep a zero capital gains rate, property owners must meet certain capabilities and requirements, which might fluctuate among various enterprise zones.
- A zero capital gains rate causes no taxation on the sales of assets or property that would somehow have a capital gain.
