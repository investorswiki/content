# S&P GSCI
## What Is the S&P GSCI?

The S&P GSCI is a composite [index of commodities](/commodityindices) that measures the performance of the commodities market. The index frequently fills in as a [benchmark](/benchmark) for commodities investments. Investing in a GSCI fund gives a comprehensively diversified, unleveraged [long-only](/long) position in commodity futures.

The S&P GSCI was just called the Goldman Sachs Commodity Index (GSCI) before it was purchased by [Standard and Poor's](/sp) in 2007. Albeit owned by S&P Dow Jones Indices, the GSCI ought not be mistaken for the comparative [Dow Jones Commodity Index](/dj-aigci) (DJCI).

## How the S&P GSCI Works

The S&P GSCI is weighted by world production and involves the physical commodities that have active, liquid futures markets. There is no restriction on the number of commodities that might be remembered for the S&P GSCI; any commodity whose contract fulfills the qualification criteria and different conditions determined in this methodology are incorporated. The S&P GSCI is intended to mirror the relative significance of every one of the constituent commodities to the world economy, while protecting the tradability of the index by limiting eligible contracts to those with adequate liquidity. The calculation of the relative loads of commodities in the index includes a four-step process in light of world production levels.

The methodology of the S&P GSCI was left unchanged when Standard and Poor's assumed control over the index. The S&P GSCI is comprised of 24 [exchange-traded futures](/etf-futures-and-choices) contracts that cover physical commodities traversing five sectors. The sectors as of now incorporate energy, industrial metals, precious metals, agriculture, and livestock. This sector mix has been predictable throughout the long term, however the weighting shifts year to year.

### Trading the S&P GSCI

The S&P GSCI is intended to be investable, and there are ETF products intended to follow its performance. The S&P GSCI catches global inflation of core commodities. Accordingly, it is helpful for making funds that have low connections with traditional [asset classes](/assetclasses).

The iShares S&P GSCI Commodity Index ETF (GSG) is an ETF product that tracks the index.

## Parts of the S&P GSCI

The index's parts meet all requirements for inclusion in the index in view of liquidity measures and are weighted according to their global production levels. That makes the GSCI important as both a [economic indicator](/economic_indicator) and a commodities market benchmark.

## Downsides of the S&P GSCI Index

The S&P GSCI automatically moves futures contracts, which may not be an optimal investment strategy. Futures contracts are impacted by [contango](/contango) and [backwardation](/backwardation), and they can make commodity futures perform uniquely in contrast to genuine commodities.

In theory, professional commodities traders can likewise utilize contango and backwardation to profit to the detriment of simple automatic rolling strategies. This might be a critical flaw in the S&P GSCI. It could likewise be more hypothetical than real, in the same way as other early reactions of stock market index funds.
