# World Equity Benchmark Series (WEBS)
## What Was the World Equity Benchmark Series (WEBS)?

The World Equity Benchmark Series (WEBS) was an international fund traded on the [American Stock Exchange](/amex). It was presented in 1996 by Morgan Stanley and was a type of hybrid security that has characteristics of both open-end and closed-end funds.

In 2000, WEBS was renamed to iShares MSCI Emerging Markets Exchange Traded Fund (ETF). The iShares MSCI Emerging Markets ETF looks to follow the investment aftereffects of the MSCI Emerging Markets Index, an index made out of enormous and mid-capitalization emerging market equities.

## Figuring out the World Equity Benchmark Series (WEBS)

A [closed-end fund](/closed-endinvestment) is a fund framed as a publicly traded investment. These funds can raise a designated amount of capital with an initial public offering. The money collected goes into a fund that is then listed as a stock and traded on a public exchange. It is a particular stock portfolio with a one-time fixed number of shares. A [open-end fund](/open-endfund) is a conventional mutual fund, comprised of a pool of money from numerous investors for investing in stocks and bonds. Investors share gains and losses in relation to their investment in the fund.

An organization that utilized a WEBS owned every one of the securities traded on the MSCI country indexes. Ownership was in a rough ratio to the initial capitalization or investment. A WEBS could be bought, sold, and traded like stocks.

Investors could utilize the WEBS to accomplish international diversification. The World Equity Benchmark Series was accessible for the majority various countries, including Australia, Austria, Belgium, Canada, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Italy, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, the Netherlands, Singapore, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom.

The name change of the World Equity Benchmark Series (WEBS) to iShares MSCI Emerging Markets ETF was intended to mirror the steady brand name for all exchange-traded funds managed by Barclays Global Investors (presently BlackRock).

At that point, the indexes included iShares MSCI Australia, iShares MSCI Austria, iShares MSCI Belgium, iShares MSCI Canada, iShares MSCI France, iShares MSCI Germany, iShares MSCI Hong Kong, iShares MSCI Italy, iShares MSCI Japan, iShares MSCI Malaysia, iShares MSCI Mexico, iShares MSCI Netherlands, iShares MSCI Singapore, iShares MSCI South Korea, iShares MSCI Spain, iShares MSCI Sweden, iShares MSCI Switzerland, and iShares MSCI United Kingdom.

## iShares MSCI Emerging Markets ETF and the SPDR S&P 500 Trust

The iShares MSCI Emerging Markets ETF is like the SPDR S&P 500 Trust, a [exchange-traded fund](/etf) (ETF) managed by State Street Global Advisors that tracks the Standard and Poor's 500 Index (S&P 500). Formerly, the SPDR S&P 500 Trust was just called the Standard and Poor's depository receipt. More regularly, it was abbreviated to SPDR and alluded to as a "bug."

Each share of a SPDR S&P 500 Trust contains one-10th of the S&P 500 index and trades at about one-10th the dollar-value level of the S&P 500. Investors can utilize the SPDR S&P 500 Trust to acknowledge broad diversification to specific segments of the market.

For instance, the SPDR S&P Dividend ETF is an investment vehicle that looks to give investment results that track the total return performance of the S&P High Yield Dividend Aristocrats Index. This means that the SPDR S&P Dividend ETF indexes dividend-paying stocks that are a part of the S&P 500. The ETF is comprised of a total of 112 companies and tracks performance through its net asset value, which is conveyed as a price for every share.
