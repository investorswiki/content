# Relative Return
## What Is Relative Return?

Relative return is the return an asset accomplishes throughout some undefined time frame compared to a [benchmark](/benchmark). The relative return is the difference between the asset's return and the return of the benchmark. Relative return can likewise be known as [alpha](/alpha) with regards to active portfolio management.

This can be diverged from an absolute return, which is a standalone figure that isn't compared to anything more.

## How Relative Return Works

Relative return is important on the grounds that it is a method for estimating the performance of actively managed funds, which ought to earn a return greater than the market. Specifically, the relative return is a method for measuring a fund manager's performance. For instance, an investor can constantly buy an index fund that has a low management expense ratio (MER) and will guarantee the market return.

Relative return is most frequently utilized while surveying the performance of a mutual fund manager. Investors can utilize the relative return to comprehend how their investments are performing relative to different market benchmarks.

Like alpha, relative return is the difference between investment return and the return of a benchmark. There are a few factors an investor must consider while utilizing relative return. Many fund managers who measure their performance by relative returns regularly lean on proven market trends to accomplish their returns. They'll perform a global and itemized economic analysis on specific companies to decide the bearing of a specific stock or commodity for a course of events that commonly loosens up for a year or longer.

## Relative Return Considerations

[Transaction costs](/transactioncosts) and standard versus total return estimations can influence relative return perceptions. Transaction fees can be a huge factor for investors dealing with significant expense delegates. Transaction fees frequently detract from a fund's performance. Utilizing standard versus total return can likewise be a factor since standard return may exclude distributions and total return does.

### Transaction Costs

Transaction costs can essentially impact a fund's relative return. For instance, the Invesco Global Opportunities Fund is a top-performing actively managed fund. As of Sept. 30, 2017, its one-year return altogether outperformed the [MSCI All Country World Index](/msci-acwi). The Fund furnishes performance returns with and without sales charges which embody the effects transaction costs can have on relative return. For the one year through Sept. 30, 2017, the Fund's Class A shares had a return of 30.48% without sales charges.

With sales charges, the one-year return was 22.97%. With and without sales charges the Fund outperformed the benchmark's one-year return of 18.65%. To relieve transaction costs and increase relative return an investor might actually buy shares of the Fund through a discount brokerage platform.

### Total Return

To assist with expanding the relative return comparison, an investor can likewise utilize [total return](/totalreturn) which thinks about distributions from the fund in its return computations. Some standard return computations do exclude distributions and can subsequently diminish the relative return.

### Fund Fees

Fund fees are another factor that can influence relative return. Fund fees are unavoidable and must be paid altogether by fund shareholders every year. Investment companies account for these fees as liabilities in their net asset value computations. Thusly, they impact the fund's [net asset value](/nav) (NAV) for which return is calculated.

Passive mutual funds epitomize this in their returns. Investors can expect the relative return of a passive mutual fund to be somewhat lower than the benchmark return due to operational expenses.

## Absolute Return versus Relative Return

Knowing whether a fund manager or broker is working really hard can be difficult for certain investors. It's challenging to characterize what benefit is on the grounds that it really relies on how the remainder of the market has been performing.

[Absolute return](/absolutereturn) is basically anything that an asset or portfolio returned over a certain period. Relative return, then again, is the difference between the absolute return and the performance of the market (or other comparable investments), which is measured by a benchmark, or index, like the S&P 500. Relative return is likewise called alpha.

Absolute return doesn't express much all alone. You want to take a gander at the relative return to perceive how an investment's return compares to other comparative investments. When you have a comparable benchmark where to measure your investment's return, you can then go with a choice on whether your investment is getting along nicely or ineffectively and act in like manner.

## Relative Return Example

One method for seeing absolute return versus relative return is with regards to a market cycle, like bull versus bear. in a [bull market](/bullmarket), 2% would be viewed as a terrible return. Be that as it may, in a [bear market](/bearmarket), when numerous investors could be down as much as 20%, just saving your capital would be viewed as a victory. In that case, a 2% return doesn't look so terrible. The value of the return changes in view of the unique circumstance.

In this scenario, the 2% we mentioned would be the absolute return. In the event that a mutual fund returned 8% last year, that 8% would be its absolute return. Simple stuff.

Relative return is the justification for why a 2% return is terrible in a bull market and great in a bear market. What makes a difference in this setting isn't the amount of the return itself, yet rather what the return is relative to a benchmark or the more extensive market.
