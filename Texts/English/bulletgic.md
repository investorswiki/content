## What Is a Bullet GIC?

A Bullet GIC is a type of [guaranteed investment contract](/guaranteedinvestmentcontract) in which the principal and interest owed is paid in one lump sum. A bullet GIC, or bullet guaranteed investment contract (BGIC), gives investors a normally generally safe means of achieving a guaranteed [principal](/principal) repayment, plus interest. These contracts are frequently offered by insurance companies.

## How Bullet GICs Work

A guaranteed investment contract (GIC) is an insurance company provision that guarantees a rate of return in exchange for keeping a deposit for a certain period. A GIC requests to investors as a replacement for a savings account or U.S. Treasury securities. GICs are otherwise called funding agreements. In a GIC, the insurance company acknowledges the money and consents to return it, alongside [interest](/interest), at a settled upon date from here on out, ordinarily running somewhere in the range of one and 15 years.

A Bullet GIC contrasts in that the payment received is in a lump sum as opposed to as a flood of cash flows. The interest can be paid at standard spans or held to the contract's maturity. Bullet GICs are commonly intended to acknowledge a single deposit, typically $100,000 or more, for a specific time frame period, generally somewhere in the range of three and seven years.

Bullet GICs are in many cases used to fund [defined-benefit retirement plans](/definedbenefitpensionplan) on the grounds that they are viable with the timing of plan contributions. A bullet guaranteed investment contract acts similar as a zero-coupon bond for accounting, however bonds are ordinarily issued by companies to fund operations, while guaranteed investment contracts are issued by insurance companies to fund their obligations.

Regulation Section 1.148-6(c) directs that guaranteed investment contracts must be purchased at fair value assuming the proceeds are to be earned tax free. Investors in municipal guaranteed investment contracts, consequently, ought to keep careful records of the bidding system to demonstrate they have bought the instruments at fair value. Such careful records incorporate the bid sheet and any material terms of the purchase agreement.
