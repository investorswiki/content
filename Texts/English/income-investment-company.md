## Understanding Income Investment Companies

Basically, an income investment company is a management firm whose aim is to build wealth for its clients. Their portfolios are, regularly, structured to feature bonds, [preferred shares](/inclination shares), fixed-rate capital designs, and [dividends](/dividend).

That compromise might be worth it, contingent upon the investor's specific financial requirements.
