## What Is a Total Stock Fund?

A total stock fund is a [mutual fund](/mutualfund) or a [exchange traded fund](/mutualfund) that holds each stock in a chose market. A total stock fund looks to duplicate the broad market by holding the stock of each and every security that trades on a certain exchange, invests in a certain country, or passes essential thresholds of size, or trading volume. Total stock funds are great for investors who need exposure to the overall equity market for a minimal price.

## How Total Stock Funds Work

Total stock funds are additionally called total stock market index funds or total market funds. These funds are intended to follow a broad index, for example, the [Wilshire 5000](/wilshire5000equityindex) or [Russell 3000](/russell_3000). Investors can't buy shares of an index straightforwardly since the index is just a representation or measure of the market. All things considered, a few mutual funds and exchange traded funds (ETFs) are intended to mirror the investments inside a particular index.

### Broadening

A total stock fund that is linked to an index — called a [benchmark](/benchmark) — is intended to mirror the [equities](/equity) inside the underlying index. A total market fund's portfolio is regularly diversified since it incorporates the stocks of many types of companies from large, laid out corporations, mid-sized, and smaller companies.

### Passively Managed

Total market funds are [passive](/passiveinvesting) investments, significance there is little buying and selling of stocks inside a fund's portfolio. On the other hand, a [actively](/activeinvesting) managed fund would commonly include a portfolio manager or a [investment manager](/investment-manager) buying and selling stocks to produce an investment return that beats the overall equity market.

### Investment Strategy

Total stock funds allow access to the overall equity market, which incorporates several [sectors](/area) or industries. Total stock funds are frequently utilized as part of a [buy-and-hold](/buyandhold) investment strategy, which typically lines up with investors searching for long-term gains.

Total stock funds can likewise be utilized in tandem with buying individual stocks. For instance, an investor can buy into a total market fund acquiring broad exposure to the equity market while at the same time investing in individual stocks of best-of-breed companies inside specific sectors.

## Benefits of Total Stock Funds

These super-broad index funds will generally have less [volatility](/volatility) — or price vacillations — than even large indices like the [S&P 500](/sp500) in light of the fact that they hold so many companies' stock. Subsequently, total stock market funds can assist with decreasing an investor's risk of losing the entirety of their money.

For instance, on the off chance that an investor bought an equivalent amount in the stock of two companies and one of the companies failed, half of the investment principal would be lost. On the other hand, the investment dollars inside a total market fund are spread out across hundreds or thousands of stocks, meaning on the off chance that one company fizzles, a large portion of the principal invested wouldn't be lost.

Since total stock funds are passively managed, they will more often than not have lower fees or expense ratios. Passive funds for the most part mirror the underlying index and without a portfolio manager actively buying and selling equity shares, there are lower fees associated with total stock funds.

Total stock funds additionally offer transparency, meaning investors realize which stocks they own since the fund mirrors the underlying index.

## Market-Cap Weightings

Mutual funds and index funds can be organized in various ways. Maybe the most common way is by market cap, which is short for [market capitalization](/marketcapitalization). Market capitalization alludes to the worth of a company's outstanding [shares](/shares) of stock. Market cap is calculated by increasing the total number of a company's outstanding shares by the current market price of one share.

A company with many shares outstanding and a high stock price would have a large market cap while a smaller company with less shares outstanding and a lower stock price would have a smaller market cap. Regularly, large, deep rooted companies have a higher market cap than [mid-cap](/midcapstock) or [small-cap](/small-cap) companies.

Large-cap funds regularly invest in companies with a total market capitalization of $10 at least billion. Investments in individual companies are not even, with larger companies getting greater investment dollars. Mid-cap funds regularly invest in companies with a total market capitalization between $2 billion and $10 billion.

Total stock funds might have portfolio weightings situated here and there on market cap, yet they are not be guaranteed to exclusively market-cap weighted. Small-cap funds ordinarily invest in companies with a total market capitalization of under $2 billion. Some mutual fund companies even offer [micro-cap](/microcapstock) funds, which invest in companies with a total market capitalization of under $50 million.
