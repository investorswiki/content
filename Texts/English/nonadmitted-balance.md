# Non-Admitted Balance
## What Is a Non-Admitted Balance?

A non-admitted balance is a thing on an insurer's [balance sheet](/balancesheet) that addresses reinsured [liabilities](/liability) for which the reinsurer has not given collateral. Nonadmitted balance sections reduce the policyholders' surplus since they address a liability.

## Grasping Non-Admitted Balances

Insurance companies surrender risk to reinsurers to reduce their exposure to the risks associated with the policies that they endorse. In exchange for taking on a portion of the insurer's risk, the reinsurer is given a fee, frequently a portion of the premium. The reinsurer is consequently responsible for claims made up to a certain level and is required to exhibit that it will actually want to handle those claims in the event that losses do arise.

Insurers might require a reinsurance company to give assets as collateral as proof that the reinsurer will actually want to cover a risk assuming a claim is made against the policy. On the off chance that the reinsurer is required to give collateral, this will reduce the non-admitted balance, and subsequently increase the insurer's surplus.

Reinsurers and other [captive insurance companies](/captive-insurance-company) normally utilize a [letter of credit (LOC)](/letterofcredit) as the source of collateral. The letter of credit is issued by a bank. On the off chance that the ceding insurance company doesn't need the reinsurer to give collateral to cover the non-admitted balance and the reinsurer becomes bankrupt, the insurance company will regard the non-admitted balance as the loss reserve and discount the balance.

The non-admitted balance addresses the portion of [unearned premiums](/unearned-premium) and loss reserves that don't count on the insurer's statutory statements, which is where the insurer accounts for any capital and surplus required to keep up with its license to conduct insurance business.

Since the balance is non-admitted, the insurer can't count the balance toward its [solvency ratio](/solvencyratio) or any regulatory required reserve level, implying that the loss reserve associated with the non-admitted balance can't count toward the overall loss reserve. Thus, insurance companies have an incentive to expect reinsurers to give collateral.

## Instances of Non-Admitted Assets

A few instances of non-admitted assets incorporate assets comprising of goodwill, furniture and fixtures, cars, agent debt balances, accrued income on investments in default, and different things. They are excluded to introduce a balance sheet that is essentially as conservative as could really be expected.

In any case, a rise in the proportion of non-admitted assets to admitted assets is an indication that a company might be investing in nonproductive or risky assets. Notwithstanding, this isn't generally this case.

To decide somehow, an insurance company's monetary's must be closely investigated to decide whether the proportion of non-admitted assets on the balance sheet is genuinely an indicator of nonproductive or risky assets.
