# Cboe Volatility Index (VIX)
## What Is the VIX and How Does It Measure Volatility?
In finance, the term VIX is short for the Chicago Board of Exchange's Volatility Index. This index measures S&P 500 index options and is used as an overall benchmark for[ volatility](/volatility) in the stock market. The higher the index level, the choppier the trading environment, which makes its other nickname pretty apt: the fear index.
It's important to point out that the VIX measures implied, or theoretical, volatility. It measures the **expectation** of future volatility based on a snapshot of the previous 30 days' worth of trading activity.
## What Do the VIX Numbers Mean?
- A VIX level above 20 is typically considered "high."
- A VIX below 12 is typically considered "low."
- In the middle of between 12 and 20 is considered "normal."

When there is increased activity on[ put options](/putoption), and that means that investors are selling more puts, the VIX registers a high number. Investing in a put option is like betting that the price of a stock will go down before the put contract expires because puts give investors the right to sell shares of a stock on a specific date at a specific price.
These are[ bearish](/bearmarket) investments, ones that can take advantage of emotions like fear. There is a colloquialism on Wall Street that does "When the VIX is high, now is the ideal time to buy" because the general belief is that volatility might have reached a peak, or a defining moment.
When the VIX falls, that means that investors are buying more [call options](/calloption). Investing in a call is like betting that the price of a stock will go up before the call contract expires. In other words, a falling reading on the VIX indicates that the overall sentiment in the stock market is more optimistic, or [bullish](/bullmarket).Although the VIX isn't expressed as a percentage, it ought to be understood as one. A VIX of 22 translates to implied volatility of 22% on the SPX. This means that the index has a 66.7% probability (that being one standard deviation, statistically speaking) of trading inside a range 22% higher than — or lower than — its current level inside the next 12 months.
## How Is the VIX Calculated? What Is the VIX Formula?
In a nutshell, the VIX is calculated by the Chicago Board of Options Exchange utilizing market prices of S&P 500 put and call options with an average expiration of 30 days. It uses standard weekly SPX options and those with Friday expirations, however unlike the[ S&P 500 index](/sp500), which contains specific stocks, the VIX is made up of a continually changing portfolio of SPX options. The Chicago Board of Options website goes into more detail about its methodology and selection criteria.
## How Do I Interpret the VIX?
There are numerous ways of interpretting the VIX, however it's important to note that it's a theoretical measure and not a precious stone ball. Even the sentiment it tracks, fear, isn't itself measured by hard data, for example, the latest Consumer Price Index. Rather, the VIX uses options prices to estimate how the market will act over a future timeframe.
It's additionally important to understand how much emotion can drive the stock market. For example, during earnings season, a company's stock might report strong growth yet see shares plummet, because the company didn't meet analyst **expectations**. Such a large amount what goes on in the market can be summed up by feelings, like greed, as investors spot appreciation potential and place buy orders, which drive prices higher overall. Fear is evidenced when investors try to protect their investments by selling their shares, driving prices lower.
Best case scenario, fear-driven selling can send the market into a tailspin and lead to emotions like panic, which can result in [capitulation](/capitulation).
However, the VIX isn't designed to cause panic. It is simply a gauge of volatility. In fact, some investors, especially traders, view the increased turbulence as a signal to buy, so they make a profit either through speculation or hedging and hence capitalize on the situation.
## Might the VIX at any point Go Above 100?

1. On March 16, 2020, during the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, the VIX recorded a high of 82.69.
