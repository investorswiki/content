# Super-Hedging
## What Is Super-Hedging?

Super-hedging is a strategy that [hedges positions](/hedge) with a self-supporting trading plan. It uses the most minimal price that can be paid for a hedged portfolio to such an extent that its worth will be greater or equivalent to the initial portfolio at a set future time.

Super-hedging requires the investor to make an offsetting repeating portfolio for a given asset or series of cash flows. Super-hedging is a risk management strategy that in theory will assist investors with building a portfolio that stays profitable no matter what the market's promising and less promising times.

## How Super-Hedging Works

Traders can utilize a [hedging transaction](/hedging-transaction) to limit the investment risk of an underlying asset. To achieve this, they can purchase options or [futures](/futuresmarket). These are bought in restricting situations to the underlying asset to lock in a certain amount of gain. The super-hedging price of Portfolio An is equivalent to the littlest amount important to be paid for a permissible Portfolio B at the current time so that at some predefined point later on the value of Portfolio B is to some degree as great as Portfolio A.

In a complete market, the super-hedging price is equivalent to the price for hedging the initial portfolio. In an incomplete market, for example, [options](/choice), the cost of such a strategy might demonstrate too high. The possibility of super-hedging has been concentrated by scholastics. Nonetheless, it is a hypothetical ideal and is hard to execute in reality.

## Super-Hedging versus Sub-Hedging

The sub-hedging price is the greatest value that can be paid so in any conceivable situation at a predetermined point from now on, you have a second portfolio worth not exactly or equivalent to the initial one. The upper and lower limits made by the sub-hedging and super-hedging prices are the no-exchange limits, which determine the limits of the portfolio's price.

The no-exchange price limits are an illustration of what traders call great deal limits, which address the price range that a trader considers they will get a decent deal in light of their individual inclinations.

> A few traders endeavor to lay out optimal super-hedging and sub-hedging limits as part of a strategy in trading [exotic options](/exoticoption, for example, quanto options, basket options, and [knock-out options](/knock-outoption).

## Super-Hedging and Self-Financing Portfolios

A self-supporting portfolio is an important concept in financial science. A portfolio is self-supporting in the event that there is no outside mixture or withdrawal of money. All in all, the purchase of another asset must be financed by the sale of an old one.

A self-supporting portfolio is an imitating portfolio. In mathematical finance, an imitating portfolio for a given asset or series of [cash flows](/cashflow) is a portfolio of assets with similar properties.

## Hedging and Replicating Portfolios

Given an asset or liability, a [offsetting](/offset) repeating portfolio is called a hedge. It tends to be static or dynamic. Generally, a static hedge doesn't need the trader to rebalance the portfolio as the price or [volatility](/volatility) of the securities it hedges changes. This is on the grounds that the static hedge comprises of assets that mirror the cash flows of the underlying asset and don't need the trader to make changes in accordance with keep up with the hedge.

This differentiations with a dynamic hedge, which requires the trader to regularly change the hedge as the price of the underlying asset moves. Dynamic hedges are worked by purchasing options that have "Greeks" that are like those of the underlying asset.

Making the optimal recreating portfolio might require the trader to take part in a more active approach to portfolio management. At times, this can turn into a tedious and complex activity that is best appropriate for further developed traders.

In practice, recreating portfolios are only sometimes, if at any point, careful replications. Dynamic replication is imperfect since genuine price developments are not minuscule. Since transaction costs to change the hedge are not zero, the trader ought to consider these potential costs while choosing to seek after a super-hedging strategy.

## Highlights
- Super-hedging is a risk management strategy traders use to hedge their positions.
- Setting up an optimal super-hedge can be testing on the grounds that recreating portfolios are rarely a precise replication of the original.
- Super-hedging requires the trader to build an offsetting reproducing portfolio for the asset or the series of cash flows they are attempting to hedge.
- Super-hedging strategies are self-supporting, and that means the trader finances the purchase of another asset with the sale of an old one.
- Transaction costs to build and keep up with the hedge can likewise add up, decreasing the overall profit potential.
