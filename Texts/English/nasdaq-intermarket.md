# Nasdaq Intermarket
## What Was Nasdaq Intermarket?

Nasdaq Intermarket was a system that was executed and managed by [Nasdaq](/nasdaq) to consider networking, communication, and trading activity among those participating in several markets through electronic means.

This network used the [Intermarket Trading System](/intermarket-trading-system) (ITS), which was an electronic network connecting the trading floors of several markets, permitting real-time communication and trading between them. This ITS platform permitted any broker on the floor of one of the participating exchanges to organize an execution, responding promptly to price changes. The ITS was managed by the Securities Industry Automation Corporation (SIAC).

## Figuring out Nasdaq Intermarket

Nasdaq Intermarket was an electronic marketplace where the National Association of Securities Dealer individuals could execute trades, impart, and receive citations on stocks listed on the [New York Stock Exchange](/nyse) (NYSE) and the [American Stock Exchange](/amex) (ASE). Formerly known as Nasdaq's third market, Nasdaq Intermarket utilized Nasdaq's Computer Assisted Execution System to interface buy and sell orders.

Nasdaq Intermarket went after retail stock orders with regional exchanges, for example, the Chicago Stock Exchange (CHX) and the Boston Stock Exchange (BSE). By associating several stock exchanges, the Intermarket System gave traders access to extra buyers and sellers, expanding liquidity and competition, and expanding accessible investing capital.

## Nasdaq Leaves Intermarket

Nasdaq had been a part of the ITS since its creation during the 1980s, however in 2005, Nasdaq announced its expectations to pull out from the ITS the next year. The ITS was initially made while most trading was done through a manual interaction by floor-based traders. Mechanical advances since that time have presented new and more creative systems for directing trade activity in a fast, associated environment.

In declaring its withdrawal from the ITS, Nasdaq refered to the obsolete setup of the system and said a private, more efficient and cutting edge connecting system would be a better option. That position adjusted flawlessly with Nasdaq's recent acquisition at that time of Brut, LLC, which kept an electronic communications network.

A key part of Nasdaq's withdrawal from ITS was the way that it would now depend on its own system, permitting it to capture more market share from the NYSE, as the world was moving away from traditional [floor brokers](/floorbroker) to electronic exchanges. It showed that Nasdaq was shifting with the times and adjusting to the better approaches for leading trading.

## Nasdaq Market Center Execution System

This ECN can empower automated, electronic communication and activity. Brut systems are linked to other market centers trading Nasdaq securities, alongside national securities exchanges like the NYSE.

Since its acquisition of Brut, Nasdaq has integrated that system with different devices including SuperMontage and [INET](/interbank-network-for-electronic-move inet) to form a thorough system that was at one point known as Single Book, later to be alluded to as the Nasdaq Market Center Execution System.

Nasdaq was the main electronic exchange and was a small, juvenile exchange when it started. Presently, it is perhaps of the largest exchange in the world, where a considerable lot of the greatest companies are listed, like Apple, Facebook, Tesla, Microsoft, and Amazon. Altogether, more than 3,300 companies are listed on the exchange and it completes 1.8 billion trades each day.
