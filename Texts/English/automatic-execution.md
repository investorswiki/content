# Automatic Execution
## What Is Automatic Execution?

Automatic execution is a method for setting and executing trades without the requirement for manual information. Automated systems and trading calculations permit traders to exploit [signals](/trade-signal) to buy or sell an asset at whatever point that signal is recognized, without the requirement for human connection.

Automatic orders can be made in light of a wide assortment of [technical indicators](/technicalindicator) utilizing several economically available trading systems.

## Figuring out Automatic Execution

       Automatic execution has become commonplace as trading systems keep on developing more sophisticated and complex related to advances in softwre technology and IT infrastructure. Automatic execution permits trades to be placed and filled even when the trader who is running the automated trading program is absent. In the event that a trade signal happens, an order will be conveyed and automatically executed assuming there is [liquidity](/liquidity) available at the order price.

Automated trading strategies are much of the time utilized by professional traders, for example, high-frequency trading ([HFT](/high-frequency-trading)) and [market makers](/marketmaker), however is progressively available to some retail traders. In the [foreign exchange](/forex) (forex) markets, most retail traders as of now have full access to some automated trading strategies and programs. Since the forex market trades 24 hours every day, five days per week, these automated [algorithms](/algorithmictrading) may assist with guaranteeing a trader doesn't pass up profitable opportunities. The triggering of specific signals from different technical indicators, like those in light of price, [volume](/volume), and different criteria can assist the trader with exploiting opportunities even when they are not sitting in front of their trading terminal.

Automatic execution takes into account orders to be filled automatically once placed, without extra confirmation from the trader running the automated trading software. This makes order placements must quicker, which may aid in getting better prices when prices are moving quickly; a manual order may require a couple of moments or more to enter, while an automated order is conveyed in milliseconds. Essentially, automatic execution greatly cuts down on client input errors, clerical mix-ups, thus called "[fat fingers](/fat-finger-mistake)".

## Setting Up Automatic Trading

Automated systems take into consideration a wide assortment of strategies and methods. Most traders utilize a combination of several indicators, as well as different forms of technical or potentially [fundamental analysis](/fundamentalanalysis). Different chart examples, price and volume, and different indicators or examples can be set up and conveyed to trigger the opening and closing of positions.

Traders must be careful while utilizing these systems. Technical indicators may not be legitimate assuming that fundamental conditions unexpectedly change. At the point when events happen which may warrant trying not to trade in a specific market, automated orders will in any case be handled without human intervention,

A couple of the conceivable automatic execution settings include:

- [Limit order](/limitorder) is an order a buy or sell transaction at a predetermined limit price or better.
- [Stop loss order](/stop-lossorder) is intended to limit a financial backer's loss on a position in a security and can work with short and long positions or holdings.
- [Fibonacci ratios](/fibonaccilines) incorporate retracements, circular segments, and fans which traders may use to search for confirmation of other technical analysis.
- [Stochastic oscillators](/stochasticoscillator) are momentum indicators which compare the closing price to the scope of prices over a period.

### Automatic Execution Criteria

Automating a strategy can be difficult work. Besides the fact that automated trading requires a sound strategy, that strategy must likewise be convertible into software code as rules that a computer can comprehend without mistake. Such rules don't loan themselves to [qualitative analysis](/qualitativeanalysis) or subjectivity, and for sure many trading strategies are to some extent in-part subjective. Automated trades are just permitted utilizing objective criteria. Except if those conditions are expressly defined in the programming code, the strategy won't trade in the way planned.

Interesting points while setting up automated executions include:

- **Risk caps.** These may remember stop loss orders for all trades. For instance, a stop loss could be placed a fixed dollar or [pip](/pip) amount away from the entry point, or a certain percentage away.
- **Entry criteria.** Define precisely very thing conditions should be available to start a long trade or short trade. A simple model could be a when a short-term [moving average](/movingaverage) (MA) crosses over a longer-term MA.
- **Profit taking**. A stop loss controls downside risk, however profits must likewise be taken. Characterize how a trade will be left in the event that the stop loss isn't reached. This could be a fixed dollar or pip amount, a percentage, or a defined [reward:risk](/riskrewardratio) in view of the risk. For instance, in the event that the risk of the trade is 5%, take profit at 15% (3:1 reward:risk).
- **Limitations on conditions.** Define when the program will trade and when it will not. For instance, could a stock strategy at any point trade in the pre-or post-market, or just during customary hours? Might it at any point place trades right before major news events? Choose, and afterward characterize the imperatives.

Among these essential contemplations are endless conceivable outcomes with regards to how they are really programmed. This manages the cost of great flexibility with regards to automated trading; and yet, the more complex a system turns into the harder it is to figure out which part of it isn't working when things turn out badly.

## Disruption from Automatic Execution

While automated execution can assist traders with profitting when quick orders are required or the trader can't monitor the market, automation may likewise be disruptive now and again. Since automated trades can execute so quickly, markets can be subject to serious disruptions and anomalies.

For instance, on May 6, 2010, the Dow Jones Industrial Average ([DJIA](/djia)) declined approximately 9 percent in just ten minutes. Yet, the market eradicated a large part of that decline before it closed. This disruption became known as the 2010 [Flash Crash](/flash-crash) and is accepted to have been caused, to a great degree, via automatic trading programs which started to sell as different programs sold, making a cascading type of influence.

## Highlights
- Automatic execution alludes to orders that needn't bother with to be manually inputted; the order is made and executed by an automated trading program.
- Automatic executions can be made in light of a wide exhibit of strategies, consolidating both fundamental and technical criteria.
- Automatic executions happen without confirmation from the trader, albeit the trader is many times still in control of the program executing the trades.
