# Saver's Tax Credit
## What Is the Saver's Tax Credit?

The saver's tax credit is a non-refundable tax credit that can be claimed by taxpayers who make [salary-deferral contributions](/salaryreductioncontribution) to their employer-sponsored 401(k), 403(b), SIMPLE, SEP, or legislative 457 plan, or make contributions to their customary or Roth IRAs. The amount of the credit differs and relies upon the adjusted gross income (AGI) of the taxpayer and the amount of the contribution or contributions.

## How the Saver's Tax Credit Works

The saver's tax credit was administered into effect for tax years 2002-2006 by the [Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001](/egtrra) (EGTRRA), and was made permanent by the [Pension Protection Act of 2006](/pensionprotectionact2006) (PPA).

The saver's tax credit is a non-refundable tax credit somewhere in the range of 10% and half of the individual taxpayer's eligible contribution of up to a total of $2,000, which provides it with a maximum value of $1,000. Furthermore, the maximum credit amount is the lesser of either $1,000 or the tax liability the taxpayer would have had without the credit.

This means just that the tax credit is non-refundable so the credit can bring the taxpayer down to zero tax liability, not into a refund. The saver's tax credit can be utilized to balance income-tax liability yet not as a refund. To decide the amount of the saver's tax credit, the taxpayer can't take refundable credits or the [adoption credit](/qae) into consideration.

To be eligible to claim the saver's tax credit, the taxpayer must be 18 years of age toward the finish of the tax year, not be a full-time student, and not be claimed as a dependent on another taxpayer's return.

## Limitations on Saver's Tax Credit

The saver's tax credit depends on several distinct levels of adjusted gross income (AGI). Starting around 2021, the saver's tax credit rate is half for families with a total AGI of $39,500 ($41,000 for 2022) and under or individuals with an AGI of $19,750 or under ($20,500 or under for 2022).

The saver's tax credit is 20% for families with a total AGI of $39,501 to $43,000 ($41,001 to $44,000 for 2022) or individuals with an AGI of $19,751 to $21,500 ($20,501 to $22,000 for 2022). The saver's tax credit is 10% for families with an AGI of $43,001 to $66,000 ($44,001 to $68,000 for 2022) or individuals with an AGI of $21,501 to $33,000 ($22,001 to $34,000 for 2022).

> Note that a taxpayer who offers more than the suitable limit in a given year to their qualified retirement account is required to address the excess contribution by eliminating the amount from the fund inside a certain time limit. Eliminating this excess amount is alluded to as a return of excess contribution.

## Model

For instance, a family procuring $43,900 in 2021 that contributes $2,000 to a retirement plan will receive a tax credit of $200, calculated by duplicating 10% by $2,000. Any amount contributed over that 10% isn't eligible for the saver's tax credit.
