# Settlement Period
## What Is the Settlement Period?

In the securities industry, the trade settlement period alludes to the time between the [trade date](/tradedate) — month, day, and year that an order is executed in the market — and the [settlement date](/settlementdate) — when a trade is viewed as last.

## Understanding Settlement Periods

In 1975, Congress enacted Section 17A of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, which directed the [Securities and Exchange Commission](/sec) (SEC) to establish a national clearance and settlement system to facilitate securities transactions. Thus, the SEC created rules to oversee the most common way of trading securities, which incorporated the concept of a trade settlement cycle.

Under the T+3 regulation, on the off chance that you sold shares of stock Monday, the transaction would settle Thursday.

In the digital age, in any case, that three-day period appears to be superfluously long. In March 2017, the SEC shortened the settlement period from T+3 to T+2 days. The SEC's new rule amendment reflects improvements in technology, increased trading volumes and changes in investment products and the trading scene. Presently, most securities transactions settle within two business days of their trade date. Thus, assuming you sell shares of stock Monday, the transaction would settle Wednesday.
