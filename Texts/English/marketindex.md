# Market Index
## What Is a Stock Index?
A stock index is an assortment of stocks expected to be intelligent of the stock market as a whole or, at times, a specific industry or segment of the market. In other words, a stock index can be considered a representative sample of the whole stock market or a specific segment or industry therein. Think of a stock index like a hypothetical portfolio put together for the public to follow.

Stock indexes like the [S&P 500](/sp500) and the [Nasdaq Composite](/nasdaqcompositeindex) go all over in value as per the weighted average price movements of their part companies. Investors hope to stock indexes like these to see what's the deal with the market and to assess the performance of their own portfolios by involving indexes as performance benchmarks.
## How Are Stock Indexes Put Together?
Similarly that specialists pull a sample from the population they wish to study, stock indexes pull a sample from the group of stocks they wish to study. A few indexes aim to sample the market at large, while others aim to sample a specific section of the market (e.g., stocks with high market capitalization, the energy industry, [dividend](/dividend)- paying stocks, and so on.)
Different stock indexes are put together in various ways relying upon their separate purposes. Since it aims to be an accurate benchmark for the American equity market as a whole, the [Wilshire 5,000](/wilshire5000equityindex) comprises of each and every stock traded on a major U.S. stock exchange (excluding penny stocks that trade on the over-the-counter market). The Dow Jones U.S. Semiconductors Index, then again, incorporates far less stocks, as it just aims to sample and track the semiconductor subsector of the market.
## What Are Stock Indexes Used For?
Investors, institutions, fund managers, and analysts monitor the performance of stock indexes to figure out how the market — or a specific segment of it, similar to the automobile industry — is doing at some random time. Frequently, investors and fund managers use indexes as benchmarks against which to compare the performance of their own portfolios. An effective fund manager could utilize their fund's outperformance of a specific index over a period of time as a selling point to draw in new investor dollars.

The news media frequently regards stock indexes as checks of market wellbeing. At the point when major, "bellwether" stock indexes like the S&P 500 or the Nasdaq Composite drop in value reliably, correspondents might reference a "[bear market](/bearmarket)" and caution of economic decline. At the point when these equivalent indexes go up in value reliably, the media might reference a "[bull market](/bullmarket)" and celebrate economic growth.
In the event that you hear a financial journalist say that "the Dow is up three percent today," that means that the weighted assortment of stocks that make up the [Dow Jones Industrial Average](/djia) (a well known stock index) went up in value by three percent over the course of the day. This doesn't mean that each stock in the index went up by three percent, in any case. Three percent is basically the overall change in value of the index as a whole.
## How Are Stock Indexes Weighted?
Stock indexes incorporate many stocks, yet these stocks are not generally remembered for equivalent sums. Most indexes are weighted somehow or another, meaning that not all part stocks receive a similar representation. A given index may be weighted with the end goal that one stock has 6% representation while another has just 1.5%.
There are many factors that indexes can be weighted by, the most common of which are [market capitalization ](/capitalization)and share price. The S&P 500, for instance, is weighted by [float](/floating-stock-the-float)- adjusted market capitalization, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average is weighted essentially by share price.
### Price-Weighted Indexes
In price-weighted indexes, stocks with higher share prices have more influence on index value than stocks with lower share prices. This happens normally in the event that an index isn't weighted by some other factor.
For example, in the event that there was an index made out of Stock A, which has a share price of $30, Stock B, which has a share price of $50, and Stock C, which has a share price of $200, the price of the index would be $93.33 — the average — on the off chance that the index was not weighted by something besides price.
Subsequently, price vacillations in Stock C would influence the index price more than price variances in Stocks An or B. In the event that Stock A went up in value by 10% (or $3 per share), the index would go up by around 1% to $94.33. Assuming stock C increased by 10% (or $20 per share), be that as it may, the index would go up by around 7% to $100.
Some of the time, the number of shares a company has in circulation can change. This happens most frequently due to [stock splits](/turn around forward-split) (which increase the number of shares in circulation) and [stock buybacks](/buyback) (which decline the number of shares in circulation). At the point when the number of shares in circulation changes, share price changes appropriately. On the off chance that stocks are split, share price goes down, while assuming stocks are bought back, share price goes up.
To account for such changes in share price, the calculation at a cost weighted index's value normally incorporates a divisor that is changed each time one of the part stocks goes through a split or a buyback. In the event that this divisor was excluded, the index's value could change essentially without the value of its part companies changing by any means. The Dow Jones Industrial Average, the second-most established American stock index, is a price-weighted index that utilizes a divisor of this sort.
### Capitalization-Weighted Indexes
In capitalization-weighted indexes (otherwise called market value-weighted indexes) part companies are weighted by their market capitalization (total market value, or number of [shares outstanding](/outstandingshares) duplicated by share price) rather than their share price. This kind of weighting generally appears to be legit than price weighting since share price isn't generally intelligent of total market value.
For example, Company A could have a share price of just $30 however have 10 million shares outstanding for a total market value of $300 million. Company B could have a share price of $50 however have just 3 million shares outstanding for a total market value of just $150 million. On the off chance that Companies An and B were remembered for a price-weighted index, Company B would have more influence on the index's price in spite of being smaller. In a capitalization-weighted index, then again, company A would have two times the influence of Company B since it is two times as large in terms of market value.
## How Are Index Values Calculated?
Different stock indexes' values are calculated diversely relying upon how they are weighted. The calculations for price-weighted indexes are simpler than the calculations for capitalization-weighted indexes, however both include the utilization of a divisor that is inclined to change over time.
Initially, most price-weighted indexes are calculated by adding up the current share prices of the index's part companies then isolating the total by the number of companies included to get an average. On the off chance that companies were never added to or taken out from an index in view of how well they meet the criteria for inclusion, and in the event that the part companies never had stock buybacks or splits, the calculation would stay this simple. In reality, notwithstanding, things like this happen oftentimes, and each time they do, the divisor in the calculation is modified to suit the new conditions.
The equivalent goes for capitalization-weighted indexes, albeit these are even more confounded, as part companies are remembered for various sums that relate to their market capitalizations. Assuming one company's market capitalization addressed 19% of the market cap of the whole index, that company would receive 19% representation in the calculation of the index's value.
