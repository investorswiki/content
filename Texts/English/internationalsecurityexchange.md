# International Securities Exchange (ISE)
## What Is the International Securities Exchange (ISE)?

The International Securities Exchange (ISE) is an electronic options [exchange](/exchange) that was sent off in 2000. The exchange gives investors greater liquidity and the ability to execute transactions at a lot quicker rate than the open outcry trading floor that had generally been the basis for options trading. In 2008, the ISE turned into a wholly owned subsidiary of the communications company Direct Edge Holdings. In 2016, the ISE turned into a wholly owned subsidiary of Nasdaq.

## Understanding the International Securities Exchange (ISE)

The approach of the International Securities Exchange (ISE) was viewed as progressive. Electronic trading has proven to be very efficient and has added to the [liquidity](/liquidity) in the options markets. This additional liquidity has assisted with lessening pricing volatility. Prior to electronic trading, investors hoping to purchase or sell options depended entirely on floor brokers to execute their trades.

The ISE offers index and equity offerings â€” among them, proprietary index products and foreign currency exchange options. The ISE's market data instruments give information on risk management, investor sentiment, and other important data.

## Milestones of the International Securities Exchange (ISE)

The ISE was established in 1997 and turned into the main electronic options exchange in the United States when the ISE started trading on May 26, 2000. In 2001, the ISE traded an average daily volume of 264,000 [options contracts](/optionscontract).

By 2004, the ISE's average daily trading volume developed to around 1.4 million options contracts, earning the exchange a 33.3% market share for U.S. equity options. In 2004, the ISE generated $125.4 million in total revenue and net income of $26.2 million. ISE sold shares in a [initial public offering](/ipo) (IPO) in March 2005.

By 2007, the ISE was trading a [average daily volume](/averagedailytradingvolume) of around 3.1 million options contracts, making it the world's biggest equity options exchange. In 2007, the U.S. options industry encountered an annual growth rate of 41.3%.

In 2007, the Deutsche B\u00f6rse purchased the ISE. By September 2008, the ISE had set another record for daily trading volume, selling more than 7.9 million options contracts each day. In 2008, ISE turned into a wholly owned subsidiary of Direct Edge Holdings. ISE was purchased by Nasdaq in 2016.

## Purchase by Nasdaq

In March 2016, [Nasdaq](/nasdaq) bought the ISE for $1.1 billion, purchasing it from Deutsche B\u00f6rse of Germany. At that point, ISE exchanges addressed more than 15% of U.S. trading in stock and index options.

## Special Considerations

Nasdaq's ISE offers their clients options trading for in excess of 3,000 underlying equities, indexes, and [exchange traded funds](/etf) (ETFs). Nasdaq membership is required to take an interest on the ISE exchange. Candidates must meet several requirements to be eligible for membership.

They must complete a Nasdaq broker-dealer membership form and be a registered U.S. broker-dealer. Candidates must be either a [National Securities Clearing Corporation](/nscc) (NSCC) or [Options Clearing Corporation](/occ) (OCC) direct clearing member, or demonstrate a clearing relationship with an approved exchange clearing firm. Contingent upon the type of membership being looked for, the candidate might have different requirements they must meet.

Members pay fees to the exchange for putting orders and different services. Fees can fluctuate contingent upon the type of market participant. The Nasdaq options pricing schedule records order fees for [market makers](/marketmaker), non-Nasdaq ISE market creators, firm proprietary/broker-dealers, professional customers, and priority customers.
