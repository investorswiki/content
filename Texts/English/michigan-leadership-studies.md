# Michigan Leadership Studies
## What Are the Michigan Leadership Studies?

The Michigan Leadership Studies was a notable series of [leadership](/leadership) studies that started at the University of Michigan during the 1950s, proposing to distinguish the principles and types of leadership styles that prompted greater productivity and enhanced job satisfaction among workers. The studies distinguished two broad leadership styles: an employee orientation and a production orientation. They likewise recognized three critical attributes of effective leaders: task-arranged behavior, relationship-situated behavior, and participative leadership.

## Understanding Michigan Leadership Studies

The studies inferred that an employee orientation combined with general, as opposed to close or direct, supervision prompted better outcomes. Employee orientation centers around the human element of employment, focusing on that employees have needs that employers ought to address and care for.

Conversely, production orientation centers around the technical elements of employment and employees are a means to complete production. The Michigan leadership studies, alongside the Ohio State University studies that occurred during the 1940s, are two of the most popular behavioral leadership studies and keep on being refered to right up to the present day.

## Reactions of the Michigan Leadership Studies

The overall statement of the studies was that less direct pressure and control permits employees to be more [productive](/productivity) and drew in with their tasks. Be that as it may, there have been critiques and inquiries concerning the methodology and consequences of the studies. One such critique is that the setting of the employees, leadership, and task was not thought about, which raises the possibility that the situation at the organization could warrant one leadership style over another.

Moreover, the disposition of the workers can be a factor in the leadership approach. The manner in which employees perform may influence a leader to be more involved in the event that more direction is required due to the intricacies of the task. Similarly, in the event that employees demonstrate how them can be competent and handle their tasks smoothly all alone, there is little requirement for more obvious control. A team of veteran workers who have contemplated and dealt with a task for a long time probably won't need a direct manager to issue directives; subsequently, in that unique circumstance, it is more probable for the leader to bear the cost of them more independence.

The narrow options of the studies additionally don't consider that one size doesn't fit all organizations or conditions. Utilizing similar leadership at two unique companies can in any case bring about disappointment or accomplishment due to different elements at play. It is common for leaders to adjust their styles over the long haul and on a case by case basis, instead of stay committed to a fixed pattern.

Albeit the Michigan Leadership Studies stay outstanding, different hypotheses and studies on leadership approaches have developed in later years that consider various dynamics, for example, the [servant leadership](/servant-leadership) philosophy.
