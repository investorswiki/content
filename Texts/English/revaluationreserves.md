The standard method for distinguishing the carrying value of assets on the balance sheet includes checking assets down overtime on a scheduled basis, normally based on a [depreciation](/depreciation) schedule.

As a rule, revaluation reserves increase or diminishing the carrying value of the asset-based on evaluations of its [fair value](/fairvalue).

In the event that the asset increases in value, the offsetting reserve expense would be diminished through credit, and the revaluation reserve on the balance sheet would be increased through a debit.
