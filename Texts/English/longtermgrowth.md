# Long-Term Growth (LTG)
## What Is Long-Term Growth (LTG)?

Long-term growth (LTG) is an investment strategy that plans to increase the value of a [portfolio](/portfolio) over a long term time span.

## Seeing Long-Term Growth (LTG)

Albeit long-term is relative to an investors' [time horizons](/timehorizon) and individual style, generally LTG is intended to make above-market [returns](/return) over a period of a decade or more.

Due to the longer time span, LTG portfolios can be more aggressive, holding a bigger percentage of stocks versus [fixed-income](/fixedincome) products like bonds. Though an intermediate-term [balanced fund](/balancedfund) could have 60% stocks to 40% bonds, a LTG fund could have 80% stocks and 20% bonds.

LTG is intended to do precisely very thing it says — convey portfolio growth over the long run. The catch is that the growth can be uneven. A LTG portfolio might underperform the market in the main years and afterward outperform later, or vice versa.

This is a problem for investors in a LTG fund. Even on the off chance that a fund conveys great average growth more than a decade, for instance, the performance year to year will change. In this manner, investors can have totally different results relying upon when they buy into the fund and how long they hold. Timing investments is, of course, a problem facing each market participant and not just LTG fund investors.

## Long-Term Growth (LTG) and Value Investing

The core advantage to LTG is that short-term price variances are not of major concern. Also, numerous [value investors](/valueinvesting) center around stocks with LTG potential, looking for companies that are relatively economical with strong [fundamentals](/fundamentals). Then they just hold on until they increase in value as the market gets on to their fundamental strength before selling.

Individual investors frequently benefit from a LTG concentration, and that might lead them toward value investing as a strategy. Be that as it may, LTG basically alludes to the longer period over which returns are looked for, not a specific investment style, for example, value investing.

Long-term funds are just as liable to buy the market through different [indexing](/file) products as they are to search out undervalued stocks. Value investing, specifically, can be hard for [fund managers](/fundmanager) to stick to as long as possible.

Despite the fact that investors in LTG funds are told to expect a respectable average return over numerous years, less quiet investors are free to pull out except if the fund has a [lock-up period](/lockup-period) — something typically found in [hedge](/hedgefund) or private funds. In the event that a run of the mill LTG fund has too numerous unremarkable years, capital will begin to leave as investors look for better market returns. This can force a fund to rashly manage holdings before the market value finds the [intrinsic value](/intrinsicvalue) of the stocks.
