# Rate on Line
## What Is Rate on Line?

Rate on line (ROL) is the ratio of [premium](/premium) paid to loss recoverable in a [reinsurance](/reinsurance) contract. Basically, ROL addresses how much money an insurer must commit to acquire reinsurance coverage. A high ROL signals that the insurer must pay something else for coverage, while a lower ROL means an insurer must pay less for that equivalent level of coverage.

## Figuring out Rate on Line

Reinsurance lets insurance companies increase their capacity to guarantee new policies by transferring a portion of their [liabilities](/obligation) to reinsurers. In exchange for doing this, the reinsurers receive a portion of the premiums insurers collect on those extra policies.

To price a reinsurance contract, a reinsurer must think about several factors, including the insurer's exposures, as well as recent losses experienced by the industry at large. To achieve this, reinsurers study market [benchmarks](/benchmark), including the frequency and seriousness of claims made. Assuming that the number of reinsurers is limited and in the event that recent historical losses have been substantial, insurers ought to hope to pay something else for reinsurance coverage.

In such cases, insurers might change their underwriting activities by charging higher premiums or by adjusting the manner in which they invest in premiums to keep up with [excess capacity](/excesscapacity).

> The rate on line (ROL) is the inverse of the payback or amortization period.

Consider a [property insurance](/property-insurance) company that tries to shift a portion of its risk to a reinsurance company, in a purposeful work to moderate its exposure to losses from possibly catastrophic flood activity. In this speculative scenario, both the reinsurer and insurer look at the seriousness and frequency of past claims and collectively settle on a contract in which the reinsurer will expect up to $20 million in liabilities.

In exchange, the insurer consents to pay the reinsurer $4 million in premiums. Thusly, the rate on line for this contract is calculated by partitioning the premium by the coverage, which comes to 20%. The [payback period](/paybackperiod) would be five years.

## Rate on Line in Projecting Reinsurance Profitability

Rate on line assists reinsurers with measuring the possible profitability of a proposed contract. In any case, this examination becomes convoluted when reinstatement provisions, expenses, and convey forward provisions from prior years are considered.

Computations become even more troublesome when extra premium and profit commission percents change for every year or then again assuming coverage is canceled. Luckily, utilizing a [frequency distribution](/frequencydistribution) can assist insurers and reinsurers with imagining this data in light of the fact that the mean of the distribution connects with the payback period for traditional risk covers. This payback period can measure up to the aftereffects of catastrophe models or other pricing examinations.
