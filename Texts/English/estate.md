So is life insurance, retirement accounts, bank accounts, financial investments and pensions. The value of the gross estate is laid out before debt and taxes are deducted. One of the primary reasons a value is put on the gross estate is for federal personal duty purposes.
- **Residue estate:** The residue estate comprises of personal property, for example, a vehicle, garments, jewelry, devices, collectibles, garden equipment, furniture and whatever else found in the home. It likewise incorporates any investments or outstanding payments not explicitly remembered for the will.

For instance, assuming somebody claims a lawn care business and sends out quarterly solicitations in no time before he bites the dust, the money that roll in from those solicitations turns out to be part of the residue estate.
