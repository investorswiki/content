## What Is a Surplus Share Treaty?

A surplus share treaty is a [reinsurance](/reinsurance) treaty in which the ceding insurer holds a fixed amount of policy liability and the [reinsurer](/reinsurer) gets a sense of ownership with what remains. Surplus share deals are viewed as pro-rata arrangements and are generally normally utilized with property insurance.

## Figuring out a Surplus Share Treaty

An insurance company ordinarily considers a surplus share treaty when it guarantees another policy. Recorded as a hard copy new policies, the insurance company consents to reimburse the policyholder up to a specific coverage limit, and in exchange, it gets a premium. To reduce its overall [liabilities](/liability) and free up capacity to guarantee new policies, an insurer might surrender a portion of its risks (and premiums) to a reinsurer. How much risk the reinsurer acknowledges, and under what conditions, is illustrated in the reinsurance treaty.

In a surplus share treaty, the ceding insurer holds liabilities up to a specific amount, called a line, with any leftover liability being ceded to the reinsurer. The reinsurer, consequently, doesn't partake in [all risks](/all-risks) and on second thought takes part in just the risks above what the insurer has retained, making this type of reinsurance not the same as [quota-share](/portion share-treaty) reinsurance. The total amount of risk that a reinsurance treaty covers, called the capacity, is normally communicated in terms of a different of the insurer's lines.

Surplus settlements normally have sufficient capacity to cover different lines, however at times, the whole amount to be insured can't be covered under a single reinsurance agreement. In the event that this happens, the ceding insurer either needs to cover the excess amount itself or go into a second reinsurance treaty. This can be achieved by requiring out a second (or third) surplus treaty.

For instance, consider a [property insurance](/property-insurance) company that endorses policies with a coverage of $500,000 and wishes to hold $100,000 of liabilities as its line. The leftover $400,000 in liabilities are ceded to the reinsurer. The $400,000 addresses the amount covered under the surplus share treaty.

## Benefits of Reinsurance Under a Surplus Share Treaty

By covering itself against extreme losses, surplus share treaty reinsurance gives the ceding insurer greater security for its equity and [solvency](/solvency) and greater stability when uncommon or significant occasions happen. Reinsurance likewise permits an insurer to endorse policies that cover a bigger volume of risks without unreasonably raising the expenses of covering their solvency edges â€” the amount by which the assets of the insurance company are greater than its liabilities and other comparable commitments. As a matter of fact, reinsurance makes a substantial amount of [liquid assets](/liquidasset) accessible for insurers in case of extraordinary losses.
