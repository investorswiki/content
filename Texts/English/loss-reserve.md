Be that as it may, regulators expect claims to be recorded at the genuine value of the loss â€” its [nominal value](/nominalvalue). The undiscounted loss reserve will be greater than the discounted loss reserve. This regulatory requirement brings about higher reported liabilities.

## Different Impacts of Loss Reserves

On the off chance that Bank ABC chooses to write all or a portion of a loan off, it will eliminate the loan from its asset balance and furthermore eliminate the amount of the write-off from the loan loss reserve. The amount deducted from the loan loss reserve might be tax-deductible for Bank ABC.
