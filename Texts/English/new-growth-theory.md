# New Growth Theory
## What's happening Growth Theory?

The new growth theory is an economic concept, placing that humans' longings and unlimited needs foster steadily expanding [productivity](/productivity) and economic growth. It contends that [real gross domestic product](/realgdp) (GDP) per person will unendingly increase in view of individuals' quest for profits.

## Seeing New Growth Theory

The new growth theory offered a new interpretation of what engineers economic flourishing. It stresses the significance of business venture, information, innovation, and technology, testing the perspective on [exogenous growth](/exogenous-growth) in [neoclassical economics](/neoclassical) that economic still up in the air by outside, uncontrollable powers.

Competition crushes profit, so individuals need to continually look for better ways of getting things done or develop new products to amplify profitability. This concept is one of the central precepts of the new growth theory.

The theory contends that innovation and new advances don't happen essentially by random chance. Rather, it relies upon the number of individuals seeking out new innovations or advances and how hard they are searching for them. Individuals additionally have control over their [knowledge capital](/information capital) â€” what to study, how hard to study, and so on. Assuming that the profit incentive is sufficiently great, individuals will decide to develop [human capital](/humancapital) and look harder for new innovations.

A huge part of the new growth theory is the possibility that information is treated as a [asset](/asset) for growth that isn't subject to finite limitations or diminishing returns like different assets, for example, [capital](/capital) or real estate. Information is an elusive quality, instead of physical, and can be a resource developed inside an organization or industry.

## New Growth Theory Example

Under the new growth theory, supporting innovation internally is one reason for organizations to invest in human capital. By setting out open doors and making resources accessible inside an organization, the expectation is that people will be urged to foster new concepts and technology for the shopper market.

For instance, a large enterprise could permit part of its staff to chip away at independent, internal ventures that might form into new innovations or companies. Somehow or another, the enterprise allows them to function like [startups](/startup) being incubated inside the organization.

The longing of the employees to send off another innovation is prodded by the possibility of generating more profits for them and the enterprise. This can be especially true in the United States, as commerce is progressively driven by administration type companies. Software and app development might happen inside companies, following the new growth theory.

Achieving such information driven growth requires a supported investment in human capital. This can establish an environment for skilled experts to have an opportunity to satisfy their primary positions as well as investigate the creation of new services that can be of benefit and use to the more extensive public.

## Special Considerations

New growth scholars accept that companies generally underestimate the helpfulness of information and, subsequently, contend that it is primarily dependent upon legislatures to invest in human capital. Legislatures are urged to work with access to better education, as well as offer help and incentives for private-area [research and development](/randd) (R&D).
