## What Is a Swing High?

The term swing high is utilized in [technical analysis](/technicalanalysis). It alludes to a pinnacle arrived at by an indicator or a security's price before a decline. A swing high forms when the high reached is greater than a given number of highs positioned around it. A series of sequentially higher swing highs demonstrates that the given security is in a [uptrend](/uptrend). A swing high can happen in a rangebound or trending market.

Swing highs are helpful to recognize and utilize while trend trading, trading in [ranges](/tradingrange), or while using technical indicators. Breaking down swing highs assists the trader with determining trend heading and trend strength.

Something contrary to a swing high is a [swing low](/swinglow).

## How a Swing High Works

When the price moves over a recent high, another swing high is in progress. The specific high point of that swing high isn't known until the price begins dropping. When the price begins dropping, the swing high is in place and the trader can note the swing high price.

This is called a higher swing high in light of the fact that the swing high happens over the prior swing high price. Higher swing highs are associated with uptrends since the price continues to move to increasingly high prices.

How far swing highs are separated is an indication of [trend](/trend) strength. On the off chance that the latest swing high was far over the prior swing high, that shows the asset has a ton of buying interest and strength. Assuming that a swing high forms just barely over the prior swing high, the price might in any case be in an uptrend, however it isn't moving as strongly as the asset that made a lot higher swing high. Assuming the swings cease to arrive at new highs, it could signal a [downtrend](/downtrend) or an uptrend that has lost momentum.

## Trading Swing Highs

Swing highs can be utilized for different scientific purposes in trading. The following are a couple of thoughts on the most proficient method to utilize them.

**At the point when Trend Trading:** Swing highs in an overall downtrend form toward the finish of [retracements](/retracement). Traders could take a [short position](/short) when a swing high is in place and momentum switches back to the downside. Indicators and Japanese candlestick patterns could be utilized related to the swing high to increase the chance of a fruitful trade.

For instance, a trader could require that the [relative strength index](/rsi) (RSI) is over 70 when the price makes a swing high, and that a [three black crows](/three_black_crows) candlestick pattern (or another bearish pattern) hence seems to affirm a return to the overall downtrend. A [stop-loss order](/stop-lossorder) could be placed over the swing high to limit losses in the event that the trade doesn't move in its planned course.

If going [long](/long) in an uptrend, a few traders use new highs to exit positions once the price begins to fall from the swing high.

The [Fibonacci extension](/fibonacciextensions) tool can likewise be applied to the chart to show probable [resistance](/resistance) areas between the swing high and swing low. For instance, on the off chance that a trader went long close to the swing low, they could set a profit target at the 61.8%, 100%, or 161.8% Fibonacci levels.

**Trading in Rangebound Markets:** When the price is [ranging](/rangeboundtrading) — moving sideways among support and resistance — traders could start a long position close to the prior swing lows at [support](/support). Hold on until the price draws near to support, forms a swing low, and afterward begins to move higher once more.

The prior swing highs, or resistance, can be utilized as an exit area for the long trade. On the other hand, the trader might opt to exit before the price arrives at resistance and the prior swing highs, or keep a watch out on the off chance that the price can break through resistance and make another swing high.

A trader could likewise start a short position close to the prior swing highs once the price begins to decline off of them. They could then hope to exit close to the prior swing lows (support), somewhat above them, or hang tight for a breakout through support.

**Indicator Divergence:** If the price of an asset is rising, and making higher swing highs, momentum oscillators, for example, the RSI and [moving average convergence divergence](/macd) (MACD) ordinarily ought to be too. Assuming that the price is making higher swing highs, however these indicators are making lower swing highs, this is called [divergence](/divergence). The indicator isn't affirming the price movement, which cautions of an expected reversal in the price.

Divergence isn't a solid signal all of the time. It sometimes happens too early; the price continues to move in its current heading and the divergence endures a long time. Different times, it doesn't caution of a price [reversal](/reversal). Notwithstanding these disadvantages, a few traders actually opt to look for divergence corresponding to swing highs and lows.
