# Global Financial Stability Report (GFSR)
## What Is the Global Financial Stability Report (GFSR)?

The Global Financial Stability Report (GFSR) is a semiannual report by the [International Monetary Fund](/imf) (IMF) that surveys the stability of global financial markets and emerging-market financing. It is delivered two times every year, in April and October.

## Understanding the Global Financial Stability Report (GFSR)

The GFSR centers around current conditions, particularly financial and structural irregular characteristics, that could risk an agitated in global financial stability and access to financing by emerging-market countries. It underlines the repercussions of financial and economic awkward nature that are featured in one of the IMF's different distributions, the [World Economic Outlook](/world-economic-outlook). Subjects covered in the GFSR generally remember systemic risk assessments for worldwide financial markets, worldwide debt management, emerging economic markets, and current economic emergencies that could influence finances worldwide.

The Global Financial Stability Report (GFSR) supplanted two previous reports by the IMF, the annual International [Capital Markets](/capitalmarkets) Report and the quarterly Emerging Market Financing Report. The purpose of supplanting them was to give a more regular assessment of the worldwide financial markets and to zero in on emerging market financing in a global setting. As well as evaluating the condition of worldwide markets, the GSFR likewise issues proposals for central banks, policymakers, and other people who administer global financial markets.

The latest GSFR, delivered in April 2021, cautions that "there is a squeezing need to act to stay away from a legacy of weaknesses while keeping away from a broad tightening of financial conditions." It proceeds to state that the "actions taken during the pandemic might have potentially negative results like extended valuations and rising financial weaknesses" and that the "recuperation is likewise expected to be asynchronous and different among advanced and emerging market economies."

## GFSR Example â€” April 2019

The April 2019 GFSR comprised of a front matter and two chapters. The main chapter talked about the growth of short-term and medium-term risks to global financial stability since the October 2018 GFSR. The weaknesses listed in the GSFR went from the financial sector nexus in the euro area to issues in the Chinese economy to the risks predominant in the housing market.

The interconnected idea of the global economy implied that these weaknesses could introduce huge risks from now on. For instance, China's economy stayed a tightrope between supporting close term growth and forestalling over the top leverage inside the economy through regulatory tightening. Given China's manufacturing ability and the inclusion of its currency in IMF's global benchmark indices, these issues could resonate all through the world economy.

The second chapter of the GSFR report managed the risks pervasive in the housing market. As per the GSFR, the downside risks in the housing market around then incorporated the growth of extreme credit and more tight financial conditions in the years ahead.
