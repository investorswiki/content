## What Is Delivery?

In the financial markets, the term "delivery" alludes to the act of transferring a commodity, currency, security, cash or another instrument that is the subject of a contract. It is much of the time utilized corresponding to [derivative contracts](/derivative) like futures and options.

At times, the buyer of a contract might receive physical delivery of the [underlying commodity](/underlying, for example, barrels of oil on account of a crude oil futures contract. Regularly, notwithstanding, the contract is settled financially implying that cash is moved rather than the underlying physical commodity.

## How Delivery Works

At the point when two gatherings meet up to go into a contract, they must consent to several key statements, two of which being the price of the contract and the date on which the contract [matures](/maturitydate). When the maturity date is reached, the seller is required to either deliver the underlying commodity to the buyer, or probably settle the contract for either a gain or a loss.

Contingent upon the type of commodity being referred to, there might be various ways that traders regularly explore delivery. For instance, in the foreign exchange market, it is common for holders of currency futures contracts to physically settle their contract by delivering the underlying currency. On account of a stock [options contract](/option), then again, it is more normal for holders to settle their contracts in cash as opposed to delivering the specific shares of stock that were the underlying asset for the option.

The decision of how to handle delivery additionally relies upon the type of trader being referred to. Certain organizations, for example, oil treatment facilities that depend on oil for their production, could take physical delivery when their contracts mature. These buyers would as of now have the infrastructure in place to take physical delivery, for example, trucks and storage tanks on account of [crude oil](/crude-oil). Speculative buyers, then again, won't take physical delivery. All things being equal, they will essentially hope to profit from a rise in the price of the underlying commodity, and will hope to settle their contract in cash by selling their contract to an outsider before it terminates.

## Real World Example of Delivery

ABC Foods is a food products manufacturer that depends on corn for its production cycle. To help try not to be surprised by a sudden leap in the price of corn, ABC Foods chooses to purchase one year's supply of corn ahead of time, by utilizing the [commodity futures markets](/commodityfuturescontract). Keeping that in mind, ABC Foods purchases futures contracts on corn that lapse once each month for the next year. Every month, it plans to take physical delivery of the underlying corn.

In making these transactions, ABC Foods' [counterparties](/counterparty) comprise fundamentally of speculative traders. These traders think that the price of corn will probably decline during the next year, so they are glad to sell corn futures contracts at the present market price. In this situation, the corn futures contracts that ABC Foods is a party to will be settled through physical delivery. Nonetheless, in the event that ABC Foods was not proposing to take delivery themselves, the contracts could be settled in cash all things being equal.
