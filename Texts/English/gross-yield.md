# Gross Yield
## What Is Gross Yield?

The gross yield of an investment is its profit before taxes and expenses are deducted. Gross yield is communicated in percentage terms. It is calculated as the [annual return ](/annual-return)on an investment (before taxes and expenses) separated by the current price of the investment.

## How Gross Yield Works

Gross yield is a measurement utilized for some investments including real estate, [fixed-income,](/fixedincome) and mutual funds. Be that as it may, estimating the return on an investment is just a single way. On account of certain investments, for example, rental property, the difference among gross and net yields can be huge since the income can be substantially disintegrated by operating expenses, like maintenance expenditures, insurance, and property taxes.

Mutual fund investors need to carefully watch the difference between the gross and net yields on their investments to be certain that fund management fees and brokerage fees, or both, are not whittling down their real returns.

## Types of Yields

Normal types of yields incorporate nominal yield, current yield, and [yield-to-maturity](/yieldtomaturity) (YTM).

### Nominal Yield

[Nominal yield](/nominalyield) is the coupon rate on a bond separated by its par value. It is the interest rate that a bond issuer vows to pay bond buyers. The nominal rate is fixed and applies for the whole life of the bond. It might likewise be called the nominal rate, coupon yield, or coupon rate.

### Current Yield

The [current yield ](/currentyield)of a bond equals its annual earnings (or dividends) separated by its current market price. The current yield addresses the return an investor would expect if the owner purchased the bond and held it for one full year.

### Yield-to-Maturity (YTM)

Yield-to-maturity (YTM) is somewhat more complex. This is the total return that a bond is anticipated to earn assuming it is held until it develops. YTM is a long-term bond's yield communicated as an annual rate. It very well may be considered the [internal rate of return](/irr) (IRR) of a bond on the off chance that the investor holds the bond until maturity and gets all payments as scheduled. Yield to maturity is likewise called the book yield or redemption yield.

## Mutual Fund Yields

Mutual fund yields are reported in two ways â€” dividend yield and [SEC yield](/secyield). Dividend yields are communicated as an annual percentage of a fund's portfolio income, likewise founded on the net income received after the fund's associated expenses have been paid.

The SEC yield depends on the yields reported by particular companies as required by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). This depends on an assumption that the associated securities are all held until maturity.
