## Why CINS Numbers Are Important

CINS is comparable in intent to the [International Securities Identification Number](/isin) (ISIN), which was adopted by countries outside of North America for generally a similar purpose.

The utilization of CINS, alongside the CUSIP, rather than ISINs are part of which isolates the North American-based system from how the remainder of the world works.

The European Commission declared that while different providers of such recognizing numbers did so free of charge or simply charged to the point of covering the costs of offering them, the fees Standard and Poor's required seemed to be a monopolistic abuse of its job as the sole provider of U.S. ISINs.
