Respectable insurance companies originally presented the incontestability clause in the late 1800s to build consumer trust. By promising to pay full benefits after the policy has been in place for quite a long time (even on the off chance that there were errors in the original application), these insurance companies attempted to clean up the industry's image. The work was effective, and right off the bat in the twentieth century, state legislatures started to pass laws requiring the incontestability clause.

Today, the clock promptly starts to run on the contestability period when a life insurance policy is purchased. If, following two years, the insurance company hasn't found a blunder in the original application, benefits are guaranteed.

Even inside that period, it's difficult for the company to revoke a policy. Under most state laws, the insurance company must file suit in court to invalidate a contract. Sending a notice to the policyholder isn't sufficient.
