# Risk Parity
## What Is Risk Parity?

Risk parity is a portfolio allocation strategy that utilizations risk to decide allocations across different parts of an investment portfolio. The risk parity strategy adjusts the [modern portfolio theory](/modernportfoliotheory) (MPT) approach to investing using [leverage](/leverage).

MPT tries to broaden an investment portfolio among determined assets to enhance returns while sticking to [market risk](/marketrisk) boundaries by survey the risk and returns for the whole portfolio, yet just using long and unmargined positions. With risk parity strategies, portfolio managers can determine careful capital contribution extents of [asset classes](/assetclasses) in a portfolio to accomplish optimized diversification for a scope of objectives and investor inclinations.

## Grasping Risk Parity

Risk parity is an advanced portfolio technique frequently utilized by [hedge funds](/hedgefund) and sophisticated investors. It requires a complex [quantitative methodology](/quantitativeanalysis), which makes its allocations further developed than simplified allocation strategies. The goal of risk parity investing is to earn the optimal level of return at the targeted risk level.

Simplified allocation strategies, for example, the 60%/40% stocks-bonds portfolio utilize MPT. MPT gives a standard to diversification inside one's investment portfolio that boosts expected return for a given level of risk. In simplified MPT strategies utilizing just stocks and bonds, [allocations](/assetallocation) are typically more vigorously weighted toward equities for investors who wish to face more risk. Risk-unwilling investors will rather have a higher weight in bonds for capital preservation.

Risk parity strategies consider both leverage and alternative diversification, along with [short selling](/shortselling) in portfolios and funds. Following this approach, portfolio managers can utilize any mix of assets they pick. Be that as it may, rather than generating allocations to various asset classes to show up at an optimal risk target, risk parity strategies utilize the optimal risk target level as their basis for investing. This goal is frequently accomplished by utilizing leverage to weight risk similarly among various asset classes utilizing the optimal risk target level.

## Risk Parity Methods

With a risk parity strategy, an investment portfolio will frequently incorporate stocks and bonds. In any case, rather than utilizing a foreordained extent of asset [diversification](/diversification) like 60/40, the investment class not set in stone by a targeted [risk](/risk) and return level. Risk parity strategies have generally advanced and developed from MPT investing. They permit investors to target specific levels of risk and to separate risk across the whole investment portfolio to accomplish optimized portfolio diversification.

The [security market line](/sml) (SML) is one more part of the risk parity approach. The SML is a graphical representation of the relationship between the risk and return of an asset and is utilized in the [capital asset pricing model](/capm) (CAPM). The incline of the not set in stone by the beta of the market. The line inclines up. The greater the possibility for the return of an asset, the higher the risk associated with that asset.

There is an underlying assumption that the incline of the SML is consistent. The steady incline assumption, nonetheless, may not really be realistic. For the traditional 60/40 allocation, investors must face greater challenge to accomplish acceptable returns and the diversification benefits are limited as more and riskier [equities](/value) are added to the portfolio. Risk parity tackles this issue by utilizing leverage to adjust the amount of [volatility](/volatility) and risk across the various assets in the portfolio.

## Real World Examples of Risk Parity

The AQR Risk Parity Fund contributes globally across stocks, bonds, currencies, and commodities and tries to accomplish optimal [return](/return) through balanced risk parity investing.

[Skyline's Global Risk Parity ETF](/hra) likewise involves a risk parity strategy in its investments. The [exchange traded fund](/etf) (ETF) utilizes an equivalent risk-weighted volatility distribution to decide the amount of capital participation.
