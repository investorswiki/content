## Grasping MSCI

Capital International presented a number of stock indexes in 1965 to mirror the international markets — the main global stock market indexes for markets outside the United States. At the point when Morgan Stanley bought the licensing rights to Capital's data in 1998, it started utilizing the abbreviation MSCI, with Morgan Stanley turning into its biggest shareholder. In 2004, MSCI acquired Barra, a [risk management](/riskmanagement) and portfolio analytics firm, for roughly $816.4 million. The merger of the two substances brought about another firm, MSCI Barra, which was [spun off](/side project) in a [initial public offering](/ipo) (IPO) in 2007, and started trading on the [New York Stock Exchange](/nyse) (NYSE) under the stock ticker MSCI. The firm turned into a completely independent, independent public company in 2009.

The firm gives its clients investment instruments including those from Barra, RiskMetrics, and Measurisk. It likewise distributes indexes that are widely accessible to the investing public.

MSCI is maybe best known for its stock indexes — more than 160,000, which center around various geographic areas and stock types like small-caps, mid-caps, and enormous caps. They track the performance of the stocks that are remembered for them and act as a base for [exchange-traded funds](/etf) (ETFs).

## Special Considerations

The MSCI indexes are [market cap-weighted indexes](/capitalizationweightedindex), and that means stocks are weighted by their market capitalization — determined as stock price increased by the total number of [shares outstanding](/outstandingshares). The stock with the biggest market capitalization gets the highest weighting on the index. This mirrors the fact that enormous cap companies biggerly affect an economy than mid-or small-cap companies. A percent change in the price of the enormous cap stocks in a MSCI index will lead to a greater movement in the index than a change in the price of a small-cap company.
