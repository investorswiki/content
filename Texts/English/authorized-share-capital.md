# Authorized Share Capital
## What Is Authorized Share Capital?

Authorized share capital is the number of stock units (shares) that a company can issue as stated in its memorandum of association or its [articles of incorporation](/articlesofincorporation). Authorized [share capital](/sharecapital) is frequently not completely involved by management to leave room for future issuance of extra stock in case the company needs to rapidly raise capital. One more motivation to keep shares in the company treasury is to hold a controlling interest in the business.

## Figuring out Authorized Share Capital

Contingent upon the jurisdiction, authorized share capital is at times likewise called "[authorized stock](/authorizedstock)," "authorized shares," or "authorized capital stock." In order to be completely perceived, authorized share capital must be seen in a setting where it connects with paid-up capital, subscribed capital, and issued capital.

Albeit this multitude of terms are interrelated, they are not equivalents. Authorized share capital is the broadest term used to depict a company's [capital](/capital). It includes each and every share of each and every category that the company could issue assuming it required or wanted to.

### Subscribed Capital

Subscribed capital addresses a portion of the authorized capital that potential shareholders have agreed to purchase from the company's treasury. These shares are many times a part of a company's [initial public offering](/ipo) (IPO). Large institutional investors and banks are oftentimes the endorsers who will purchase shares during the IPO.

### Paid-Up Capital

[Paid-up capital](/paidupcapital) is the portion of the subscribed capital for which the company has received payment from the endorsers. A company makes paid-up capital by selling its shares straightforwardly to investors in the primary market. These investors might hold the shares or they might sell them to different investors on the secondary market. The subsequent selling of the shares to different investors doesn't make extra paid-up capital. Consequently, investors who sell their shares will receive the proceeds and not the responsible company.

### Issued Capital

These shareholders can incorporate the overall population, institutional investors, and [insiders](/insider) who receive stock as part of their compensation bundles. Issued shares are likewise alluded to as outstanding shares.

## Special Considerations

A company's shares outstanding will change as it repurchases or issues more shares, yet its authorized share capital won't increase without a [stock split](/stocksplit) or some other [dilutive measure](/weakening). Authorized share capital is set by the shareholders and must be increased with their endorsement.

## Illustration of Authorized Share Capital

Envision a company with an authorized share capital of 1,000,000 common shares at a [par value](/parvalue) of $1 each, for a total of $1 million. In any case, the real issued capital of the company is just 100,000 shares, leaving 900,000 in the company's treasury accessible for future issuance. This sounds limited, as the company is swearing off $900,000 in capital, however it seems OK when you take a gander at the business phases.

Envision our company is a [startup](/startup). In this case, it is keeping authorized share capital high while genuine issued capital is low to allow for extra financing adjusts from investors. Assuming the startup attempts to split the stock, it may not get shareholder endorsement. On the off chance that it has a large amount of stock held back, it doesn't have to get shareholder endorsement to bring more capital up later on.

Interestingly, mature companies frequently see their shares outstanding shrink in comparison to authorized share capital. At the point when a company is laid out and done developing forcefully, then the best return for extra capital is as often as possible [buying back shares outstanding](/buyback).

> A share buyback ordinarily increases the value of the leftover shares on the market by lowering the true supply.

Authorized share capital might be greater than the shares accessible for trading. In this case, the shares that have really been issued to the public and to the company's employees are known as "outstanding shares."
