## What Is Opaque Pricing?

Opaque pricing is a way that companies can sell their merchandise at hidden, lower prices.

## Benefits of Opaque Pricing

While a seller might preferably want to charge the maximum price a buyer will pay, the seller doesn't really have any idea what that maximum is. Furthermore, the buyer has no incentive to tell, as any individual who has wrangled with a vehicle sales rep surely understands.

For this reason sellers make segmented offerings as a method for getting at any rate a few customers to pay more. For instance, airlines offer top of the line seats at a decisively higher price for every unit of room consumed — the buyer gets more space and the esteem of flying in top notch and the airline gets an order of extent higher revenue per customer for a similar flight — frequently 10x more.

## Special Considerations

The market clearing price for products generally still leaves a seller with excess inventory — open seats on a flight, for instance. In any case, the marginal cost of that inventory is frequently low to such an extent that it is generally conceivable to sell it for a profit, however doing so means that individuals who might have bought the product at a higher price will presently pay less and aggregate revenue will diminish. By selling a lodging through a packaged vacation package, a seller decisively diminishes the probability of [cannibalizing their own revenue](/marketcannibilization).
