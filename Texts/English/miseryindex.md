# Misery Index
## What Is the Misery Index?

The misery index is meant to measure the degree of economic distress felt by regular individuals, due to the risk of (or genuine) joblessness combined with a rising cost of living. The misery index is calculated by adding the [unemployment rate](/unemploymentrate) to the [inflation](/inflation) rate.

Since unemployment and inflation are both thought of as inconvenient to one's economic prosperity, their combined value is helpful as an indicator of overall economic wellbeing. The original misery index was advocated during the 1970s with the development of [stagflation](/stagflation), or at the same time high inflation and unemployment.

## Understanding the Misery Index

The misery index has two parts: inflation and unemployment. Inflation alludes to the rate at which money loses buying power, due to the rise of consumer prices. Unemployment, as measured in the U.S., is the number of capable grown-ups who are actively searching for work, as a small part of the total labor force. Much of the time, these numbers are contrarily corresponded: when more individuals are employed, prices will generally rise, and vice versa.

Economists generally consider "[full employment](/fullemployment)" to mean an unemployment [rate of 4%-5%](/naturalunemployment), and the Federal Reserve (Fed) targets an inflation rate of 2%. In this manner, a good misery index rating would be in the scope of 6%-7%.

## History of the Misery Index

The primary misery index was made by economist [Arthur Okun](/okunslaw), utilizing the simple sum of the country's annual inflation and unemployment rates to give an effectively figured out snapshot of the economy's relative wellbeing. The higher the index, the greater the misery felt by the average citizen.

During the 1970s, after [President Nixon restricted and afterward severed](/nixon-shock) the last connections between the U.S. dollar and gold, the U.S. encountered several years of all the while raised price inflation and unemployment, known as stagflation. The American public were trapped in a squeeze between the difficulties of joblessness as the economy hit a series of recessions and a rising [cost of living](/cost-of-living) as the dollar quickly lost value.

This phenomenon didn't fit with prevailing macroeconomic speculations at that point, in light of the [Phillips curve](/phillipscurve), which drove economists to investigate alternative plans to portray and make sense of what was happening, including Okun's misery index. At the time the misery index was novel since mainstream economists had recently accepted that inflation and unemployment would will more often than not offset each other and shouldn't both rise simultaneously.

During the 1976 campaign for U.S. president, candidate Jimmy Carter promoted Okun's misery index for the purpose of censuring his adversary, incumbent Gerald Ford. Toward the finish of Ford's administration, the misery index was a relatively high 12.7%, making an enticing target for Carter. During the 1980 presidential campaign, Ronald Reagan thus brought up that the misery index had increased under Carter.

## Limitations of the Misery Index

While it is a helpful shorthand for economic hardship, there are several justifications for why the misery index ought not be viewed as an exact measurement for economic wellbeing.

For a certain something, the two parts of the misery index have inherent blind spots. The unemployment rate just counts the unemployed who are actively searching for work; it incorporates the people who have given up searching for work, as may be the case for long-term stretches of unemployment.

Moreover, low inflation can likewise be joined by surprising misery. No inflation, or even [deflation](/deflation), can be indications of a stale economy, yet would create an exceptionally low misery index.

Also, the misery index treats unemployment and inflation similarly. Be that as it may, a 1% increase in unemployment probably causes more misery than a 1% increase in inflation would.

> The Okun misery index is thought of as a helpful however highly uncertain measurement, due to the inherent blindspots of both inflation and unemployment as measurements of economic wellbeing.

## Reactions of the Misery Index

The Okun misery index has confronted some analysis from economists. Some accept it's anything but a decent indicator of economic performance since it does exclude [economic growth](/economicgrowth) data. This missteps the intent of the misery index for a measure of general economic performance as opposed to as a measure of the pain felt by the average citizen. Notwithstanding, it is smart for investors to build an emergency fund in case of an economic downturn or job loss.

As a measure of personal economic distress, the misery index may underweight the job of expectations and vulnerability by taking a gander at current unemployment and inflation rates â€” when a significant part of the stress and worry that individuals really feel is for their future economic possibilities (notwithstanding current conditions). Specifically, the unemployment rate is generally viewed as a [lagging indicator](/laggingindicator) that probably downplays perceived misery right off the bat in a recession and exaggerates it even after the recession is finished.

During the [Great Moderation](/great-moderation), the pervasiveness of low unemployment and low inflation figures across a significant part of the world likewise meant that the misery index was rarely utilized besides during brief recessions and crises occasionally. Awful news sells, so periods of all the while low inflation and unemployment basically don't generate a similar catalyst to measure and track economic misery.

## More up to date Versions of the Misery Index

The misery index has been modified several times, first by Harvard economist Robert Barro. In 1999, Barro made the Barro misery index, which includes consumer lending [interest rates](/interestrate) and the gap among genuine and potential [gross domestic product](/gdp) (GDP) growth to assess post-WWII presidents.

In 2011, Johns Hopkins economist Steve Hanke modified Barro's misery index and expanded its application to be a crosscountry index. Hanke's annual misery index is the sum of unemployment, inflation, and bank lending rates, minus the change in real GDP per capita.

Hanke distributes his global rundown of misery index rankings annually for the countries that report important data on a convenient basis. In 2020, his rundown included 156 nations, with Guyana being distinguished as the world's most joyful country and Venezuela as the world's most hopeless country.

The concept of a misery index has likewise been expanded to [asset classes](/assetclasses). For instance, Tom Lee, prime supporter of Fundstrat Advisors, made the [Bitcoin Misery Index](/bitcoin-misery-index) (BMI) to measure the average bitcoin financial backer's misery. The index ascertains the percentage of winning trades against total trades and adds it to the digital currency's overall volatility. The index is thought of "at misery" when its total value is under 27.

A variation of the original misery index is the Bloomberg misery index. Argentina, South Africa, and Venezuela, countries assailed by broad inflation and unemployment, beat the index in 2020.

On the opposite end, Thailand, Singapore, and Japan were viewed as the most joyful countries as per economist gauges. In any case, low inflation and low unemployment rates can likewise veil low demand, as the publication itself called attention to. Japan is a common example of relentlessly low demand due to an economy that has been in stagflation throughout the previous twenty years.

## Misery Index Under Different Presidents

Albeit the misery index was first promoted during the 1970s, it is feasible to assess the economic mishaps under various presidents by contrasting their inflation and unemployment figures. Unsurprisingly, the most hopeless year on record was during the [Great Depression](/great_depression); the misery index arrived at 25.7% in the principal year of Franklin Roosevelt's administration. The index tumbled to 3.5% by 1944, reasonable due to the full employment during the Second World War.

Richard Nixon (1969-1974) and Jimmy Carter (1977-1981) have the unenviable differentiation of managing the most hopeless economies of the post-war period, with the misery index arriving at 20% under Nixon and 22% under Carter. Misery fell strongly under Ronald Reagan, and kept on trending downwards during the Bush and Clinton administrations.

During the administration of George W. Bush, the misery index again trended upwards, arriving at a pinnacle of 12.7% under President Obama due to the continuous [Great Recession](/great-recession). The index tumbled to a low of 5.06% by 2015 and stayed low through the greater part of the Trump administration (2016-2020). Notwithstanding, the COVID-19 Pandemic caused a sharp increase in unemployment, causing the misery index to reach 15%.
