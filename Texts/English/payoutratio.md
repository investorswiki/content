## What Is Payout Ratio?

The payout ratio is a financial measurement showing the proportion of earnings a company pays its shareholders as dividends, expressed as a percentage of the company's total earnings. On certain events, the payout ratio alludes to the dividends paid out as a percentage of a company's cash flow. The payout ratio is otherwise called the dividend payout ratio.

## Figuring out the Payout Ratio

The payout ratio is a key financial measurement used to determine the sustainability of a company's dividend payment program. It is the amount of dividends paid to shareholders relative to the total net income of a company.

For instance, we should expect Company ABC has earnings per share of $1 and pays dividends per share of $0.60. In this scenario, the payout ratio would be 60% (0.6/1). We should additionally accept that Company XYZ has earnings per share of $2 and dividends per share of $1.50. In this scenario, the payout ratio is 75% (1.5/2). Relatively speaking, Company ABC pays out a more modest percentage of its earnings to shareholders as dividends, giving it a more sustainable payout ratio than Company XYZ.

While the payout ratio is an important measurement for determining the sustainability of a company's dividend payment program, different considerations ought to similarly be noticed. Case in point: in the previously mentioned analysis, on the off chance that Company ABC is a commodity producer and Company XYZ is a regulated utility, the last option might flaunt greater dividend sustainability, even however the former exhibits a lower absolute payout ratio.

Basically, there is no single number that characterizes an ideal payout ratio in light of the fact that the adequacy to a great extent relies upon the sector in which a given company works. Companies in [defensive industries](/defensivecompany), like utilities, pipelines, and telecommunications, will quite often flaunt stable earnings and cash flows that are able to support high payouts over an extended time.

Then again, companies in cyclical industries commonly make less reliable payouts, on the grounds that their profits are vulnerable to macroeconomic changes. In times of economic hardship, individuals spend less of their incomes on new cars, amusement, and luxury goods. Subsequently, companies in these sectors will quite often experience earnings pinnacles and valleys that fall in accordance with economic cycles.

A companies pay out the entirety of their earnings to shareholders, while others give out just a portion and funnel the excess assets back into their organizations. The measure of retained earnings is known as the retention ratio. The higher the retention ratio is, the lower the payout ratio is. For instance, in the event that a company reports a net income of $100,000 and issues $25,000 in dividends, the payout ratio would be $25,000/$100,000 = 25%. This suggests that the company flaunts a 75% retention ratio, meaning it records the leftover $75,000 of its income for the period in its financial statements as retained earnings, which shows up in the equity section of the company's balance sheet the following year.
