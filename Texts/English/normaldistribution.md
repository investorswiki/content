# Normal Distribution
## What Is Normal Distribution?

Normal distribution, otherwise called the Gaussian distribution, is a [probability distribution](/probabilitydistribution) that is symmetric about the mean, showing that data close to the mean are more successive in occurrence than data nowhere near the mean. In graph form, normal distribution will show up as a [bell curve](/bell-curve).

## Figuring out Normal Distribution

The normal distribution is the most common type of distribution assumed in technical stock market analysis and in different types of statistical examinations. The standard normal distribution has two boundaries: the mean and the [standard deviation](/standarddeviation). For a normal distribution, 68% of the perceptions are within +/ - one standard deviation of the mean, 95% are within +/ - two standard deviations, and 99.7% are within +-three standard deviations.

The normal distribution model is persuaded by the [Central Limit Theorem.](/central_limit_theorem) This theory states that midpoints calculated from independent, indistinguishably distributed random factors have roughly normal distributions, no matter what the type of distribution from which the factors are tested (gave it has finite variance). Normal distribution is here and there mistook for [symmetrical distribution](/symmetrical-distribution). Symmetrical distribution is one where a separating line produces two mirror pictures, yet the real data could be two mounds or a series of slopes notwithstanding the bell curve that shows a normal distribution.

## Skewness and Kurtosis

Genuine data rarely, if at any point, follow a perfect normal distribution. The [skewness](/skewness) and [kurtosis](/kurtosis) coefficients measure how different a given distribution is from a normal distribution. The skewness measures the balance of a distribution. The normal distribution is symmetric and has a skewness of zero. Assuming the distribution of a data set has a skewness under zero, or negative skewness, then, at that point, the left tail of the distribution is longer than the right tail; positive skewness suggests that the right tail of the distribution is longer than the left.

The kurtosis statistic measures the thickness of the tail closures of a distribution comparable to the tails of the normal distribution. Distributions with large kurtosis show tail data surpassing the tails of the normal distribution (e.g., at least five standard deviations from the mean). Distributions with low kurtosis show tail data that is generally less extreme than the tails of the normal distribution. The normal distribution has a kurtosis of three, which shows the distribution has neither fat nor thin tails. In this manner, on the off chance that a noticed distribution has a kurtosis greater than three, the distribution is said to have heavy tails when compared to the normal distribution. In the event that the distribution has a kurtosis of under three, it is said to have thin tails when compared to the normal distribution.

## How Normal Distribution Is Used in Finance

The assumption of a normal distribution is applied to asset prices as well as [price action](/price-action). Traders might plot price points after some time to squeeze recent price action into a normal distribution. The further price action moves from the mean, in this case, the greater probability that an asset is being finished or undervalued. Traders can utilize the standard deviations to propose likely trades. This type of trading is generally finished on exceptionally short time periods as larger timescales make it a lot harder to pick entry and exit points.

Essentially, numerous statistical hypotheses endeavor to [model asset prices](/capm) under the assumption that they follow a normal distribution. In reality, price distributions will generally have fat tails and, consequently, have kurtosis greater than three. Such assets have had price developments greater than three standard deviations past the mean more frequently than would be expected under the assumption of a normal distribution. Even in the event that an asset has went through a long period where it fits a normal distribution, there is no guarantee that the past performance genuinely informs what's to come possibilities.

## Features
- Normal distributions are symmetrical, however not all symmetrical distributions are normal.
- A normal distribution is the legitimate term for a likelihood bell curve.
- In reality, most pricing distributions are not perfectly normal.
- In a normal distribution the mean is zero and the standard deviation is 1. It has zero skew and a kurtosis of 3.
