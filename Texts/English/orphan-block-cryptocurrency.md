# Orphan Block
An orphan block is a block whose parent block is obscure or inexistent. These types of blocks were framed in more established forms of the Bitcoin Core software, where network hubs could receive blocks regardless of the lack of data about their ancestry. Since the release of Bitcoin Core v.0.10, in mid 2015, [Bitcoin](/bitcoin) orphan blocks (in the exacting sense) are as of now not conceivable.
Notwithstanding, the term orphan block is still widely utilized in the cryptocurrency space while alluding to legitimate mined blocks that have been disposed of. Technically, these blocks ought to be called "lifeless blocks" or "wiped out blocks," but since the client denotes their block rewards as "orphaned," a great many people call them orphan blocks. So in spite of having a realized parent block, a great many people allude to those blocks as orphan blocks as opposed to flat blocks.
Lifeless blocks are produced when two unique excavators hand-off their substantial blocks nearly simultaneously. This makes the network split into two contending forms of the blockchain until one of the blocks is disposed of (the longest chain wins while the other is abandoned). Note that the two blocks are confirmed and substantial, yet only one is connected to the primary chain.
Since excavators are continually generating new blocks, a portion of these might be communicated to the network at the same time. Also, since the network is distributed, the transmission of data between hubs takes some time. Hence, there is a possibility that a group of hubs will decide to approve one block, while another group will decide to approve the other. At last, this would make one of the blocks be "orphaned".
The generation of lifeless blocks is totally natural and, generally speaking, happens by chance. In any case, they may likewise be delivered when malicious entertainers try to make an alternate substantial chain (see 51% assaults).

## Features
- An orphan block is a block that has been tackled inside the blockchain network however was not accepted by the network.
- There can be two diggers who address substantial blocks all the while. The network utilizes the two blocks until one chain has more checked blocks than the other. Then, the blocks in the more limited chain are orphaned.
- Orphan blocks are a normal occurrence in a distributed blockchain like Bitcoin and Ethereum.
## FAQ
### Is There a Reward for Mining Stale Blocks?
Generally, there is no reward for mining an old block. Notwithstanding, some blockchains could consider flat block rewards. Ethereum awards excavators who made ommer blocks (its lifeless block equivalent) with more modest rewards and transaction charges — basically until it changes to a proof-of-stake consensus mechanism.
### What Happens to Orphaned Bitcoin?
Bitcoin is the cryptocurrency granted for opening another block in the blockchain. Blocks can become orphaned, however a bitcoin can't. Orphaned (lifeless) blocks are disposed of.
### Is a Bitcoin a Block?
A block is a scrambled record of all transactions inside that block. Bitcoin is the cryptocurrency rewarded for settling the hash — the encoded hexadecimal number that stores the previous block's data.
