# Long Straddle
## What Is Long Straddle?

A long straddle is an options strategy where the trader purchases both a [long call and a long put](/long) on a similar underlying asset with a similar [expiration date](/expirationdate) and [strike price](/strikeprice).

## Seeing Long Straddle

The long straddle option strategy is a wagered that the [underlying asset](/underlying-asset) will move fundamentally in price, either higher or lower. The profit profile is a similar regardless of what direction the asset moves. Typically, the trader figures the underlying asset will move from a low [volatility](/volatility) state to a high volatility state in light of the up and coming release of new data.

The strike price is [at-the-money](/atthemoney) or as close to it as could be expected. Since calls benefit from an upward move, and puts benefit from a downward move in the underlying security, both of these parts cancel out small moves in one or the other heading. Consequently, the goal of a long straddle is to profit from an extremely strong move, ordinarily set off by a newsworthy event, in one or the other course by the underlying asset.

Traders might utilize a long straddle ahead of a news report, for example, an earnings release, Fed action, the entry of a law, or the consequence of an election. They expect that the market is waiting for such an event, so trading is unsure and in small ranges. At the point when the event happens, all that pent-up bullishness or bearishness is released, sending the underlying asset moving rapidly. Of course, since the genuine event's outcome is obscure, the trader doesn't realize that whether generally will be [bullish](/bull) or [bearish](/bear). Subsequently, a long straddle is a legitimate strategy to profit from one or the other outcome. Yet, similar to any investment strategy, a long straddle likewise has its difficulties.

The risk inherent in the long straddle strategy is that the market may not respond to the event or the news it creates. This is intensified by the way that option dealers realize the event is unavoidable which increases the prices of put and call options in anticipation of the event. This means that the cost of endeavoring the strategy is a lot higher than essentially betting on a solitary course, and furthermore more costly than betting on the two headings in the event that no newsworthy event were drawing closer.

Since option venders perceive that there is increased risk incorporated into a scheduled, news-production event, they raise prices adequate to cover what they hope to be roughly 70% of the anticipated event. This makes it substantially more challenging for traders to profit from the move in light of the fact that the price of the straddle will as of now remember gentle moves for one or the other bearing. On the off chance that the anticipated event doesn't produce a strong move in that frame of mind for the underlying security, then [options](/option) purchased likely will lapse worthless, making a loss for the trader.

## Long Straddle Construction

Long straddle positions have unlimited profit and limited risk. Assuming the price of the underlying asset keeps on expanding, the potential advantage is unlimited. On the off chance that the price of the underlying asset goes to zero, the profit would be the strike price less the [premiums](/option-premium) paid for the options. Regardless, the maximum risk is the total cost to enter the position, which is the price of the call option plus the price of the put option.

The profit when the price of the underlying asset is expanding is given by:

- Profit (up) = Price of the underlying asset - the strike price of the call option - net premium paid

The profit when the price of the underlying asset is decreasing is given by:

- Profit (down) = Strike price of put option - the price of the underlying asset - net premium paid

The maximum loss is the total [net premium](/net-premium) paid plus any trade commissions. This loss happens when the price of the underlying asset equals the strike price of the options at expiration.

For instance, a stock has a $50 per share price. A [call option](/calloption) with a strike price of $50 is at $3, and the cost of a [put option](/putoption) with a similar strike is likewise $3. An investor goes into a straddle by purchasing one of every option. This suggests that the option dealers expect a 70% likelihood that the move in the stock will be $6 or less in one or the other heading. Nonetheless, the position will profit at expiration assuming the stock is priced above $56 or below $44, paying little heed to the way things were initially priced.

The maximum loss of $6 per share ($600 for one call and one put contract) happens provided that the stock is priced exactly at $50 on the close of the expiration day. The trader will experience a smaller loss than this on the off chance that the price is anyplace somewhere in the range of $56 and $44 per share. The trader will experience gain on the off chance that the stock is higher than $56 or lower than $44. For instance, If the stock moves to $65 at expiration, the position profit will be (Profit = $65 - $50 - $6 = $9).

## Alternate Use of Long Straddle

Numerous traders recommend an alternative method for utilizing the long straddle may be to capture the anticipated rise in implied volatility. They would do as such by starting this strategy in the time span leading up to the event — say three weeks or more — yet closing it (if profitable) just prior to the occurrence of the event. This method endeavors to profit from the rising demand for the actual options, which increases the [implied volatility](/iv) part of the actual options.

Since implied volatility is the most powerful variable in the price of an option over the long haul, expanding implied volatility increases the price of all options (puts and calls) at all strike prices. Claiming both the put and the call eliminates the directional risk from the strategy, leaving just the implied volatility part. So in the event that the trade is initiated before implied volatility increases, and is eliminated while implied volatility is at its pinnacle, then the trade ought to be profitable.

Of course, the limitation of this subsequent method is the natural propensity for options to lose value due to [time decay](/timedecay). Conquering this natural diminishing in prices must be finished by choosing options with expiration dates that are probably not going to be essentially impacted by time decay (additionally referred to option traders as [theta](/theta)).
