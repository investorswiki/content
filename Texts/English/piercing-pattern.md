# Piercing Pattern
## What Is a Piercing Pattern?

A piercing pattern is a two-day, candlestick price pattern that denotes a likely short-term reversal from a downward trend to a vertical trend. The pattern incorporates the primary day opening close to the high and closing close to the low with an average or bigger estimated trading range. It likewise incorporates a gap down after the primary day where the subsequent day starts trading, opening close to the low and closing close to the high. The close ought to likewise be a candlestick that covers to some degree half of the vertical length of the previous day's red candlestick body.

## How a Piercing Pattern Works

This is possibly an indication that the supply of shares that market participants need to sell has been exhausted fairly, and price has been driven down to a level where demand for buying shares has increased and been demonstrated to be clear.

## Piercing Pattern Formation

A piercing pattern is a rare example of important candlestick patterns that technical analysts typically spot on a price series chart. This pattern is formed by the two back to back [candlesticks](/candlestick) previously referenced and furthermore has three extra important qualities (as verified in the illustration above).

1. The pattern is gone before by a downward trend in price. (This might be just a short down trend, however on the off chance that the candles show up after a vertical trend in price it's anything but an important reversal indicator).
1. The price gaps lower to start the subsequent day. (This pattern is generally found in stocks due to their ability to have overnight gaps not at all like currencies or other 24-hour trading assets. This pattern might happen in any asset class on a week by week chart be that as it may).
1. The subsequent candle must close over the mid point of the main candle. (This connotes that buyers overpowered sellers on this day.)

The main candlestick is generally dark colored or red, connoting a down day and the second is green or lighter colored meaning a day that closes higher than it opened. At the point when a trader is looking for a bullish reversal, any red candlestick followed by a white candlestick could be an alert, yet the piercing pattern is a special indication in light of the fact that the reversal is logical unexpected for most market participants.

A piercing pattern is known in technical analysis to be a likely signal for a bullish [reversal](/reversal). The formation in its strictest form is somewhat rare, however will in general perform better the more extended the downtrend in front of it. At the point when technical studies like RSI, Stochastic or MACD are showing a bullish divergence simultaneously a piercing pattern shows up, it reinforces the probability that this two-day pattern is significant.

The subsequent day's white candlestick rebound from a down gap to a midpoint closing high is expected to be an indication that a support level has been reached. This might happen on the grounds that the market specialist or market creators set the opening price lower than the previous day's close. At the point when this occurs at the market open, energetic buyers might step in and reverse the price action right from the start of the trading day.

A piercing pattern is typically just a likely signal for reversal so following a piercing pattern a trader would need to look for a breakaway gap.

It is distinguished by two sequential white candlesticks with a subsequent day white candlestick that shows a substantial gap higher from the main day's closing price to the subsequent day's opening price. A piercing pattern followed by a [breakaway gap](/breakawaygap) can be a strong certification that a reversal is happening.

In a bullish reversal, traders generally have two well known options. They can buy the stock to benefit from the uptrend. They may likewise decide to buy an in the money call option with a strike price below the current market price.
