# Risk-Based Capital Requirement
## What Is a Risk-Based Capital Requirement?

Risk-based capital requirement alludes to a rule that lays out least regulatory capital for financial institutions. Risk-based [capital requirements](/capitalrequirement) exist to safeguard financial firms, their investors, their clients, and the economy as a whole. These requirements guarantee that each financial institution has sufficient capital close by to support [operating losses](/operating-misfortune) while keeping a safe and efficient market.

## Understanding Risk-Based Capital Requirement

Risk-based capital requirements are presently subject to a permanent floor, according to a rule adopted in June 2011 by the [Office of the Comptroller of the Currency](/office-comptroller-currency-occ) (OCC), the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, and the [Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation](/fdic) (FDIC). As well as requiring a permanent floor, the rule likewise gives some flexibility in risk calculation for certain generally safe assets.

The Collins Amendment of the [Dodd-Frank](/dodd-frank-financial-regulatory-reform-charge) Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act forces least risk-based capital requirements for insured [depository](/depository) institutions, depository institutions, holding firms, and non-bank financial companies that are managed by the Federal Reserve.

Under the Dodd-Frank rules, each bank is required to have a total risk-based capital ratio of 8% and a tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 4.5%. A bank is thought of "very much capitalized" on the off chance that it has a tier 1 ratio of 8% or greater and a total risk-based capital ratio of something like 10%, and a tier 1 leverage ratio of no less than 5%.

## Special Considerations

Ordinarily, tier 1 capital incorporates a financial institution's common stock, revealed reserves, retained earnings, and certain types of preferred stock. Total capital incorporates tier 1 and tier 2 capital and is the difference between a bank's assets and liabilities. Notwithstanding, there are subtleties inside both of these categories.

To set rules on how banks ought to calculate their capital, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, which works through the [Bank for International Settlements](/bis), distributes the [Basel Accords](/basel_accord). Basel I was presented in 1988, trailed by Basel II in 2004. Basel III was developed in response to deficits in financial regulation that appeared in the late 2000s financial crisis. These rules are intended to assist with evaluating a bank's credit risk related to its balance sheet assets and off-balance sheet exposure.

## Risk-Based Capital versus Fixed-Capital Standards

Both risk-based capital and [fixed-capital](/fixed-capital) standards act as a cushion to safeguard a company from insolvency. Be that as it may, fixed-capital standards require all companies to have similar amount of money in their reserves, and conversely, risk-based capital differs the amount of capital a company must hold based on its level of risk.

The insurance industry started utilizing risk-based capital rather than fixed-capital standards during the 1990s after a string of insurance companies became ruined during the 1980s and 1990s. For instance, during the 1980s, under the fixed-capital standards, two insurers of a similar size in a similar state were generally required to hold a similar amount of capital in reserve, yet after the 1990s, those insurers confronted various requirements based on their insurance niche and their unique level of risk.
