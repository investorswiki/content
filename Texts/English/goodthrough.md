Great through time spans are set by investors, for example, "[Good This Week](/good_this_week)" (GTW), "[Good This Month](/goodthismonth)" (GTM), or for some other determined period of time. A day order is one more illustration of an order specification where the order stays active, great through the finish of the trading day.
