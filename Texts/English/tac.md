# Targeted Amortization Class (TAC)
## What Is Targeted Amortization Class?

Targeted amortization class (TAC) is a type of [asset-backed security](/asset-backedsecurity) that is intended to safeguard investors from prepayment risk. A targeted amortization class tranche is intended to pay as indicated by a defined principal balance schedule that is made utilizing a [prepayment speed assumption](/prepayment-model) (PSA). A TAC tranche is like a [planned amortization class](/pactranche) (PAC) tranche in that it safeguards investors from prepayment, giving consistent, stable cash flow and a fixed principal payment schedule. Notwithstanding, targeted amortization class tranches are structured uniquely in contrast to PAC tranches in that they just utilize one PSA as opposed to a reach, as PAC tranches do.

## Understanding Targeted Amortization Class (TAC)

Targeted amortization class tranches are structured products that increment cash flow certainty. TAC tranches can be made with any asset-backed security with a payment schedule, however they are generally firmly associated with [collateralized mortgage obligations](/cmo) (CMO) and [mortgage-backed securities](/mbs) (MBS). The targeted amortization class tranche is basically a bond under a CMO or MBS. For the TAC tranches, the principal is paid on a foreordained schedule. Any prepayment that happens is amortized to keep up with the schedule, extending the cash flow typically as opposed to returning capital in what is probably going to be a lower interest environment than when the product was made.

## The Relationship among TAC and PAC

As referenced, an arranged amortization class tranche utilizes a scope of prepayment rates, while a targeted amortization class tranche utilizes one. For a PAC, changes in the prepayment rates — either a rise in prepayment or burnout — are baked into the model somewhat. Dissimilar to a PAC holder, a TAC investor will see pretty much principal than is scheduled relying on whether the prepayment rate is higher or lower than the defined rate. For instance, assuming prepayment rates are below the rate utilized for the TAC, the principal sums won't be accessible for scheduled payment, so the life of the TAC should be extended. On the other hand, the prepayment protection is likewise limited on the off chance that the prepayment rate surpasses the PSA utilized for the TAC. Investors will see their investment returned in what will undoubtedly be a more terrible interest rate environment.

The presence of PAC tranches negatively impacts TAC tranches, truth be told. The PAC tranches are senior to TAC tranches. In this way, in the hierarchy, PAC tranches yield less and have the least risk, TAC tranches yield more than PACs yet carry limited protection, and different tranches yield all the more however carry no protection against prepayment.
