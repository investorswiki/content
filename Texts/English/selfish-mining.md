# Selfish Mining
Selfish mining is a concept that was elaborated on exhaustively by Cornell scientists in a 2013 paper named Majority isn't Enough: Bitcoin Mining is Vulnerable. The creators recommend that the mining incentives, intended to keep Bitcoin miners legit, can be gamed and are consequently broken.
By selfish mining, a miner (or group of miners) increases their revenue by strategically withholding and delivering [blocks](/block) to the network. Ordinarily, we anticipate that a miner should report a block when they track down it. Assuming the block is confirmed, they will get the [block reward](/block-reward).
By not communicating their block right away, however, these miners actually make their own private branch of the blockchain. The remainder of the network keeps on building on the previous block, while the selfish miner builds on top of this new chain. Starting there, the two chains will look totally changed.
The goal of the selfish miner is to constantly stay somewhere around one block ahead of the remainder of the network. Hubs acknowledge the chain with the most accumulated proof of work as the substantial blockchain. Whenever, the selfish miner can uncover their chain. Assuming it is longer than the one followed by the remainder of the network, the existing blocks will be [discarded](/vagrant block-cryptocurrency), and transactions turned around. The miner gathers each of the rewards from these blocks and makes different gatherings squander resources.
The outcome of selfish mining is dependent fairly on karma, yet chiefly on hashing power accessible to the miner (otherwise called [hash rate](/hash-rate)). The creators of the paper note that, as miners on the public chain would rather not squander resources, they will join selfish miners on the alternative chain. Over the long haul, selfish mining could subvert the decentralization of Bitcoin, as it concentrates hashing power into more modest pools.
On the surface, selfish mining appears to be lucrative. In any case, many have doubts of its ability to impact Bitcoin harshly. By concentrating the network thusly, participants would be fundamentally eliminating the value proposition of the cryptocurrency. For them to be profitable, it is to the greatest advantage of miners to sincerely act. All things considered, their profit is designated totally in Bitcoin.

## Features
- In this strategy, miners "stow away" their generated blocks from the primary blockchain.
- Selfish mining is a tricky cryptocurrency mining strategy in which an independent miner or group work to change the blockchain to their benefit.
- Examples of selfish mining have not been seen in reality, yet the lack of recognition doesn't mean it hasn't or will not work out.
## FAQ
### What Is a Selfish Mining Attack?
A selfish mining attack is a deliberate modification of a blockchain to increase rewards to one miner or a group of miners.
### What Is Self Mining Bitcoin?
The people group acknowledged term for mining all alone is solo mining. To solo mine, you utilize an application specific integrated circuit (ASIC) miner or one of your gadgets that is equipped for mining cryptocurrency to endeavor to mine. Tragically, the computational power expected to mine Bitcoin is well outside the scope of an independent miner â€” except if that miner claims a large Bitcoin mining operation.
### Is Bitcoin Dependant on Miners?
The Bitcoin network utilizes miners to approve block and transaction data. Without miners, verification and validation couldn't occur, and the network wouldn't function.
