# Traded Average Price Option (TAPO)
## What Is a Traded Average Price Option (TAPO)?

A traded average price option (TAPO) is an option contract in which the financial backer's profit or loss depends on the difference between the strike price and the average price, and not exclusively on the price of the underlying asset at expiration.

First offered in 1987 by the Banker's Trust in Tokyo, TAPOs are otherwise called [Asian options](/asianoption). While the principal TAPOs were for oil, the instrument currently predominantly trades in metals.

## How a Traded Average Price Option (TAPO) Works

A traded average price option is a [over-the-counter](/otc) (OTC) product. Its payoff has a basis on the average price of the underlying asset over a predetermined time span. The determination of the average price is at contract creation. For instance, settlement values begin from the difference between the strike price and the average price of the underlying asset on dates picked over the life of the options contract.

Compared to standard [options contracts,](/optionscontract) TAPOs have a lower premium due to their as often as possible short lifespan. The premium is likewise not as much as exchange-traded contracts due to the manner in which these specific contracts determine their value. Rather than a contract having a daily price, you are getting an average price all through a predetermined amount of days. Asian options have a higher risk, which reflects in their lower premiums.
