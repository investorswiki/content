# Risk-Weighted Assets
## What Are Risk-Weighted Assets?

Risk-weighted assets are utilized to decide the base amount of capital that must be held by banks and other financial institutions to reduce the risk of [insolvency](/insolvency). The [capital requirement](/capitalrequirement) depends on a [risk assessment](/risk-assessment) for each type of bank asset.

For instance, a loan that is secured by a [letter of credit](/letterofcredit) is viewed as riskier and in this way requires more capital than a mortgage loan that is secured with [collateral](/collateral).

## Understanding Risk-Weighted Assets

The financial crisis of 2007 and 2008 was driven by financial institutions investing in [subprime](/subprime) home mortgage loans that had a far higher risk of [default](/default2) than bank managers and regulators accepted to be conceivable. At the point when consumers began to default on their mortgages, numerous financial institutions lost large amounts of capital, and some became indebted.

Basel III, a set of international banking regulations, set forward certain rules to stay away from this problem moving forward. Regulators presently demand that each bank must group its assets together by risk category so the amount of required capital is matched with the risk level of every asset type. Basel III purposes credit ratings of certain assets to lay out their risk coefficients. The goal is to keep banks from losing large amounts of capital when a specific [asset class](/assetclasses) declines pointedly in value.

There are numerous ways risk-weighted assets are utilized to ascertain the solvency ratio of banks.

> Bankers need to balance the likely rate of return on an asset category with the amount of capital they must keep up with for the asset class.

## Step by step instructions to Assess Asset Risk

Regulators consider several devices to evaluate the risk of a specific asset category. Since a large percentage of bank assets are loans, regulators consider both the source of loan [repayment](/repayment) and the underlying value of the collateral.

A loan for a commercial building, for instance, generates interest and principal payments in light of [lease](/lease) income from tenants. On the off chance that the building isn't completely leased, the property may not generate adequate income to repay the loan. Since the building fills in as collateral for the loan, bank regulators likewise consider the market value of the building itself.

A U.S. [Treasury bond](/treasurybond), then again, is secured by the ability of the federal government to generate taxes. These securities carry a higher [credit rating](/creditrating), and holding these assets requires the bank to carry definitely less capital than a [commercial loan](/commercial-loan). Under Basel III, U.S. government debt and securities are given a risk weight of 0%, while residential mortgages not guaranteed by the U.S. government are weighted somewhere in the range of 35% to 200% relying upon a risk assessment sliding scale.

## Special Considerations

Bank managers are likewise responsible for utilizing assets to generate a reasonable [rate of return](/rateofreturn). At times, assets that carry more risk can likewise generate a higher return for the bank, since those assets generate a higher level of interest income to the [lender](/lender). In the event that the management makes a different portfolio of assets, the institution can generate a reasonable return on the assets and furthermore meet the controller's capital requirements.
