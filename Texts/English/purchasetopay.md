## What Is Purchase-to-Pay?

Purchase-to-pay is an integrated system that completely automates the goods and services purchasing process for a business. The system earned its name since it handles all parts of acquisition from the purchase of goods to the payment of the vendor. The key benefits to purchase-to-pay are productivity, cost savings, and increased financial and [procurement](/procurement) visibility.

## Understanding Purchase-to-Pay

The purchase-to-pay system starts with requisitioning, proceeds to procurement, and finishes with payment. [Requisitioning](/requisition) is the course of formally requesting a service, thing, or product with a purchase request form. Procurement happens when the goods or services are received. The system closes when payment is made.

Purchase-to-pay looks to advance the purchasing system, in this manner helping the organization through better financial controls and [efficiency](/proficiency). This streamlined, integrated system saves costs and reduces risk. A normal purchase-to-pay system incorporates five stages and requirements for completion:

- **Catalogs**: Catalogs from preferred providers are the main requirement in a purchase-to-pay system.
- **Purchase requisitions**: Once a product has been chosen from a catalog, the buyer sends a purchase requisition to the suitable manager.
- **Purchase order workflow**: A purchase order is created once the purchase requisition is approved by the manager.
- **Invoicing**: This is a critical part of a purchase-to-pay system since manual processing of invoices is a gigantically laborious and tedious interaction. Automated invoice processing sets aside time and cash and incorporates a reconciliation feature that matches purchase orders to invoices.
- **Payment**: Once an invoice is approved for payment, a file is created in the organization's [accounts payable](/accountspayable) system. The approved invoice brings about payment to the provider toward the finish of the period for which the provider has extended credit.

Purchase-to-pay systems are not expected to speed up the payment cycle. While this would be an excellent objective, the reality is that it wouldn't be a priority for most companies on the grounds that paying bills faster would influence the timing of their own [cash flows](/cashflow). Rather, the goal of a purchase-to-pay system is to further develop productivity and financial controls since finance divisions have ideal purchasing data readily available.
