# Delinquency Rate
## What Is a Delinquency Rate?

Delinquency rate alludes to the percentage of [loans](/loan) inside a financial institution's loan portfolio whose payments are delinquent. While dissecting and investing in loans, the delinquency rate is an important measurement to follow; finding exhaustive statistics on the delinquencies of a wide range of loans is simple.

## How Delinquency Rates Work
### Tracking Delinquency Rates

Commonly, a lender won't report a loan as being delinquent until the borrower has missed two continuous payments, after which a lender will report to the credit reporting agencies, or "credit bureaus," that the borrower is 60 days late in their payment. On the off chance that late payments endure, every month that the borrower is late, the lender might keep reporting the delinquency to the credit agencies for up to 270 days.

Following 270 days of late payments, the code of federal regulations believes any type of federal loan to be in default. Loans among borrowers and private-area lenders follow individual U.S. state codes that characterize when a loan is in default. To start the most common way of recovering delinquent payments, lenders generally work with third-party assortment agents.

### Reporting Delinquency Rates

The credit bureaus might give borrowers different delinquency rate blemishes on the individual tradelines included with their credit reports. On the off chance that a borrower is reliably delinquent, they will receive marks for 60 days late, 90 days late, etc. On the off chance that a borrower makes a payment and defaults again, another cycle of delinquency shows up on the tradeline. While considering a borrower for credit endorsement, credit agencies and lenders think about a borrower's all's delinquent imprints.

Frequently, especially with corporate debt, lenders will report total delinquency rates on loans as per the borrower's credit quality; this can assist investors with gaining bits of knowledge into the risks implied with specific loans.

### Computing Delinquency Rates

To calculate a delinquency rate, partition the number of loans that are delinquent by the total number of loans that an institution holds. For instance, on the off chance that there are 1,000 loans in a bank's loan portfolio, and 100 of those loans have delinquent payments of 60 days or more, then, at that point, the delinquency rate would be 10% (100 **divided by** 1,000 **equals** 10%).

## Special Considerations: Publicly Reported Delinquency Rates

The [Federal Reserve System (FRS)](/federalreservesystem) gives public data on delinquency rates quarterly across the U.S. financial market. As of the fourth quarter of 2018, the total delinquency rate from loans and rents at commercial banks was 1.79%. Residential real estate loans reported the highest delinquency rate at 2.83%. Consumer credit cards reported the second-highest delinquency rate at 2.54%.
