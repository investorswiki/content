## What Was a Net-Worth Certificate?

A net-worth certificate was an instrument utilized by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation ([FDIC](/fdic)), starting with the entry of the [Garn-St. Germain Act](/garn-st-germain-depository-organizations act) in 1982 as part of a work to save failing banks and thrifts by giving emergency capital.

During the 1980's [savings and loan crisis](/sl-crisis), the net-worth certificate was utilized as a type of [forbearance](/forbearance) in which failing banks and thrifts were permitted to apply for financial assistance as the net-worth certificate. The amount of the certificate depended on the bank's net worth, and it was issued for a transitory period.

## How Net-Worth Certificates Worked

At the point when deposit-rate limitations that had existed for a really long time were lifted, banks and thrifts found themselves paying out more in interest on deposits than they were earning from their long-term investments, for example, 30-year fixed-rate mortgages and government bonds. This brought about the savings and loan crisis, which saw 1,043 savings and loan associations fail in the United States somewhere in the range of 1986 and 1995.

The FDIC lost an average of 15% of the assets of the banks that were not saved utilizing the Net-worth Certificate Program, and an average of 20% of the assets of banks that failed during the 2008 financial crisis.
