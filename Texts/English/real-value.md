# Real Value
## What Is Real Value?

The real value of a thing, additionally called its relative price, is its [nominal](/nominal) value adjusted for [inflation](/inflation) and measures that value in terms of another thing.

## Seeing Real Values

Real values are a higher priority than nominal values for economic measures, for example, [gross domestic product](/gdp) (GDP) and [personal incomes](/personalincome), in light of the fact that they assist with discovering the degree to which increments over the long haul are driven by inflation instead of what is driven by genuine growth. For instance, in the event that personal income is $50,000 in year one and $52,000 in year two, and the rate of inflation is 3%, then the nominal growth rate of income is 4% [($52,000 - $50,000) \u00f7 $50,000], while the real growth rate is just 1% (4% - 3%).

Real value is gotten by eliminating the effect of [price level](/price_level) changes from the [nominal value](/nominalvalue) of a decent, service, or time-series data, to get a more genuine image of economic trends. The nominal value of time-series data, like GDP and incomes, is adjusted by a deflator to infer real values.

In the U.S., the [Bureau of Economic Analysis](/bea) (BEA) keeps up with the [GDP deflator](/gdppricedeflator) that is utilized to process the real rate of economic growth. The deflator right now utilizes 2012 as the base year, and that means that it is set to 100 for 2012, with different years reported relative to the 2012 dollar's [purchasing power](/purchasingpower).

## Real Value versus Perceived Value

Real value is genuinely simple to measure. A business must account for the costs of labor, raw materials, delivery, marketing, and product development, which permits it to compute the product's real value. [Perceived value](/perceived-value) isn't as simple, since many factors that play into it aren't substantial or exactly quantifiable. Factors like scarcity (counting artificial scarcity), marketing efforts, curiosity, and brand affiliations all play into perceived value.

For instance, two businesses might sell comparable cars that cost a similar amount to create, giving them indistinguishable real values. Nonetheless, one vehicle will probably have a higher perceived value assuming its maker has gained notoriety for dependability and in the event that the vehicle is the focal point of a national marketing campaign that effectively fabricates buzz.

The impact of real and perceived values, and the differences between them, become real in sales numbers and in the pricing of products. A higher perceived value will lead consumers to think that a product is better than different things with a similar real value selling at a comparable cost.

Simultaneously, the price can impact the perceptions of value. For instance, businesses that release special limited versions of existing products can once in a while make a feeling of a higher perceived value, due to selectiveness and oddity, even assuming that the product has the very real value as an existing thing that sells for a lower price.
