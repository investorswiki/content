# Thin Market
## What Is a Thin Market?

A thin market on any financial exchange is a period of time that is described by a low number of buyers and sellers, whether it's for a single stock, a whole sector, or the whole market. A thin market, otherwise called a narrow market, can lead to price volatility.

## Seeing Thin Markets

A thin market has high price [volatility](/volatility) and low liquidity. The balance among supply and demand can tip unexpectedly, making a substantial impact on prices. Since few offers and asks are being quoted, likely buyers and sellers might even find it hard to make a transaction.

Albeit the overall volume is low, individual transactions will more often than not be large. That means price developments are greater. What's more, the spreads between the bid and ask prices for an asset will generally be more extensive, as traders endeavor to benefit from the low number of market participants.

A thin market is something contrary to a liquid market, which is described by a high number of buyers and sellers, strong [liquidity](/liquidity), and moderately low price volatility.

Liquidity, by definition, is a measure of the straightforwardness and speed at which an asset can be changed over into cash at a fair estimate of its value. Cash in the bank is a liquid asset. A house or an Old Master painting isn't.

Generally talking, stock shares may be considered liquid assets. They can be sold effectively whenever and the cash will be free with just a short postponement. They ought to have a value equivalent to or greater than their original cost except if the seller picked a loser.

In any case, a thin market by its temperament damages liquidity. Individual investors might track down it troublesome or difficult to get a fair price in a thin market.

The most unsurprising thin market on Wall Street happens consistently in the last half of August when most traders abandon their work areas and go to the ocean side.

## Effects on Trading

At the point when transaction-level data originally opened up in the mid 1990s, the impact of [institutional investors](/institutionalinvestor) on thin market prices, and on market prices as a rule, turned out to be clear interestingly. Transactions by a couple of large institutions account for over 70% of the daily trading volume on the [New York Stock Exchange](/nyse) (NYSE).

That means they need to consider the size of their own orders in their trading strategies. Large traders separate their orders into more modest [blocks](/block), which are then positioned in a series of transactions staggered after some time.

The greater part of the trades put by large institutions currently require something like four days to complete. Assuming they pushed through every one of the trades without a moment's delay, the prices they paid to buy stocks or received to sell stocks would be adversely impacted by their own trades.

## Highlights

- A thin market has not many active participants on the buy-side or the sell-side.
