## What Is a Proprietary Reverse Mortgage?

A proprietary reverse mortgage is a loan that permits senior homeowners to access the equity in their homes through a confidential lender. They are not quite as firmly regulated as [home equity conversion mortgages (HECMs)](/hecm) and are not federally insured.

Proprietary reverse mortgages make up just a small segment of the market for reverse mortgages, and the greater part of their customers are the owners of homes valued over the limit set by the [Federal Housing Administration (FHA)](/fhaloan). For 2022, that limit is set at $970,800.

## Figuring out the Proprietary Reverse Mortgage

Proprietary reverse mortgages are once in a while called jumbo reverse mortgages since they are looked for the most part by individuals who need access to more money than the federally insured reverse mortgage can supply and whose homes are valued at more than the limit the government sets.

Basically, they work the same way most HECM-insured reverse mortgages do. The homeowner gets a credit extension up to the assessed value of the home. They can accept it as a lump sum, set up a month to month annuity forever, or pick a series of regularly scheduled payments for a number of years. It's the homeowner's decision. The amount withdrawn is reimbursed just when the homeowner or the homeowner's heirs sell the home.

One more variation on the reverse mortgage is the [single-purpose reverse mortgage](/singlepurpose-reverse-mortgage), which confines the homeowner's withdrawals to payment of specific costs, regularly property taxes and home repairs. Proprietary reverse mortgages, as most HECM-insured reverse mortgages, have no such limitations.

Proprietary reverse mortgages evaporated after the housing bubble burst in 2008, then reappeared when home prices bounced back. They are still relatively rare in light of the fact that couple of lenders need to offer them. There is a sorry secondary market for proprietary reverse mortgages, in contrast to the market that exists for additional conventional mortgages. They are additionally more inclined to scams than traditional forward mortgages since they are complex products specifically intended for retired people needing cash with limited options of getting it.

## Upsides and downsides of a Proprietary Reverse Mortgage

These include:

- They might charge other or unexpected fees in comparison to FHA-insured loans.
- They don't need that their customers take out mortgage insurance.
- Their customers are not required to go to a counseling session to ensure they comprehend the reports they are signing.

Lack of regulation can be a situation with two sides. Lenders might charge higher mortgage interest rates, extra fees, or both. They may likewise loan less relative to the home's value to compensate for the lack of [mortgage insurance](/mortgage-insurance).

### Different elements

Proprietary reverse mortgages can have highlights that other reverse mortgages don't, for example, equity-sharing provisions, additionally called shared-appreciation provisions.

The proceeds of a proprietary reverse mortgage can go toward anything, including paying off the homeowner's existing mortgage to free up month to month cash flow. Not at all like HECMs, proprietary reverse mortgages don't limit the amount a borrower can withdraw in the principal year of the reverse mortgage term.

All around, the proprietary reverse mortgage is the less-prohibitive option.
