# Share Capital
## What Is Share Capital?

Share capital is the money a company raises by issuing common or preferred stock. The amount of share capital or equity financing a company has can change over the long run with extra [public offerings](/publicoffering).

The term share capital can mean marginally various things depending on the specific situation. Accountants have a much smaller definition and their definition rules on the balance sheets of public companies. It means the total amount brought by the company up in sales of shares.

## Understanding Share Capital

Share capital is reported by a company on its balance sheet in the shareholder's equity section. The information might be listed in separate line things depending on the source of the funds. These normally include a line for common stock, one more for preferred stock, and a third for [additional paid-in capital](/additionalpaidincapital).

Common stock and preferred stock shares are reported at their par value at the hour of sale. In modern business, the "par" or face value is a nominal figure. The genuine amount received by a company in excess of par value is reported as "extra paid-in capital."

> On a balance sheet, the proceeds of stock sales are listed at their nominal par value while the "extra paid-in capital" line mirrors the real price paid over par for the shares.

The amount of share capital reported by a company includes just payments for purchases made straightforwardly from the company. The later sales and purchases of those shares and the rise or fall of their prices on the open market meaningfully affect the company's share capital.

A company might opt to have more than one public offering after its [initial public offering (IPO)](/ipo). The proceeds of those later sales would increase the share capital on its balance sheet.

## Types of Share Capital

The term "share capital" is many times used to mean somewhat various things depending on the specific circumstance. While discussing the amount of money a company can legally raise through the sale of stock, there are several categories of share capital.

Accountants have a much smaller definition.

### Authorized Share Capital

Before a company can raise equity capital, it must obtain permission to execute the sale of stock. The company must determine the total amount of equity it needs to raise and the base value of its shares, called the par value.

The maximum amount of share capital a company is permitted to raise is called its authorized capital.

This doesn't limit the number of shares a company might issue yet it puts a ceiling on the total amount of money that can be raised by the sale of those shares. For instance, in the event that a company obtains authorization to raise $5 million and its stock has a par value of $1, it might issue and sell up to 5 million shares of stock.

### Issued Share Capital

The total value of the shares a company chooses for sell to investors is called its issued share capital. The par value of the issued share capital can't surpass the value of the authorized share capital.

### Share Capital on a Balance Sheet

The technical accounting definition of share capital is the par value of all equity securities, including common and preferred stock, sold to shareholders.

Be that as it may, individuals who are not accountants frequently include the price of the stock in excess of par value in the calculation of share capital. As noticed, the par value of stock is nominal, commonly $1 or less. In this way, the difference between the par value and the real sale price, called [paid-in capital](/paidincapital), is typically extensive. By and by, it isn't technically included in share capital or capped by authorized capital limits.

Here is a model, and how it shows up on a balance sheet: Assume company ABC issues 1,000 shares. Each share has a par value of $1 and sells for $25. The company's accountant will record $1,000 as share capital and the remaining $24,000 as extra paid-in capital.
