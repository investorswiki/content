# Primary Offering
## What Is a Primary Offering?

A primary offering is the principal issuance of stock from a private company for public sale. The main public sale of stock is called a [initial public offering ](/ipo)(IPO). It is a means for a private company to raise [equity](/equity) capital through monetary markets to extend its business operations. A primary offering can likewise incorporate [debt issuance.](/debt-issue)

## Figuring out a Primary Offering

Primary offerings are typically a way for a developing company to raise financing to grow its business operations, however they are likewise directed by mature private companies. After the offering has been submitted and the funds have been received, [securities](/security) are traded on the [secondary market](/secondarymarket). The company receives no money from the purchase and sale of the securities they recently issued.

A primary offering is a transitional experience for a developing fruitful company as it changes from private to public and is registered with the [Securities and Exchange Commission](/sec) (SEC). The SEC requires corporate issuers of primary offerings to file a [registration statement](/sec-structure s-1) and [preliminary prospectus](/preliminaryprospectus) that must contain the accompanying data:

- A description of the issuer's business
- The names and addresses of the key company officers with salary data and a five-year business history for each
- The amount of ownership of key officers
- The company's capitalization and description of how the proceeds from the offering will be utilized
- Any legal procedures that the company is engaged with

Large shareholders will in some cases make a secondary offering, however this doesn't make new stock and doesn't benefit the issuer.
