# Index Roll
## What Is an Index Roll?

The term index roll alludes to a passive [index investment](/index-investing) strategy that utilizes a combination of index funds and [long-term equity anticipation securities](/leaps) (LEAPS). An investor who utilizes this strategy must roll over a series of LEAP options to gain exposure to a [long-term](/longterm) move in an index. [Leverage](/leverage) from the options permits the investor to amplify gains and may bring about outperforming an index for a really long time.

## How Index Rolls Work

Investors have an extensive variety of investment strategies at their disposal — both active and passive investment approaches. Active investing utilizes an active approach by trying to outperform the market's average [returns](/return) by exploiting short-term changes in price. Passive investing, then again, utilizes an all the more long-term approach by taking a secondary lounge.

Basically, the people who invest passively take a [buy and hold](/buyandhold) approach and normally track an index to try to copy its returns. Index rolling is one of the passive investment strategies that investors will generally utilize.

Index rolling is a long-term passive investment strategy that investors have at their disposal. Individuals who exploit this approach might gain the equivalent [exposure](/monetary exposure) they would on the off chance that they invested in a standard [benchmark](/benchmark), however frequently with less [capital](/capital) as a result of the exposure from the long-term equity anticipation securities (LEAP) option.

An investor might execute a roll forward utilizing the equivalent [strike price](/strikeprice) for the upgraded one as the bygone one, or they might have the option to set another strike. Another contract with a higher strike price than the original option contract is called a roll up, while another contract with a lower strike price makes the strategy a roll down.

Over the long haul, the position has very much like payoff qualities to an ordinary indexing strategy. Be that as it may, returns will generally be somewhat higher. That is a result of the exposure from the option in the beginning phases of the setup. [Volatility](/volatility) determines option prices, with lower volatility leading to bring down costs for buying options.

## Special Considerations

Many buy and hold investors favor LEAPs. These are public [securities](/security) with expiration dates that reach out past one year. LEAPs permit the buyer to purchase or sell the underlying [asset](/asset) before the expiry date at a predetermined price.

LEAP [call options](/calloption) might be supplanted with call options that have later expiration dates, basically permitting the investor to endlessly roll their participation in the asset underlying the option forward. LEAP call options can advance greater capital proficiency since they require less capital than buying the asset itself — in this case, an equity [exchange traded fund](/etf) (ETF) — by utilizing a LEAP strategy called a roll forward option.

A [roll forward](/rollforward) includes expanding a contract past its original expiration date. This is typically done shortly before a contract lapses. Investors ought to consider the cost of rolling options forward before executing this strategy, as rolling requires the investor to close out one option position, possibly at a loss while purchasing another position.

An index roll strategy utilizes LEAP call options on a specific equity index ETF. Be that as it may, LEAPS are not available for all ETFs. This limits the scope of asset classes for the strategy. A rundown of LEAPS options can be found at the [Chicago Board Options Exchange](/cboe) (CBOE).
