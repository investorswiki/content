# Debt-to-Limit Ratio
## What Is the Debt-to-Limit Ratio?

The debt-to-limit ratio is a measurement used to evaluate the [creditworthiness](/credit-value) of a borrower. It is calculated by separating the borrower's total outstanding debts by the combined credit limits of their loans. For instance, a borrower with $5,000 of debt and a [credit limit](/credit_limit) of $10,000 would have a debt-to-limit ratio of half.

## How the Debt-to-Limit Ratio Works

The debt-to-limit ratio has numerous different names, including the balance-to-limit ratio, the credit utilization ratio, and the debt-to-credit ratio. In all cases, its purpose is something similar: assessing how close the borrower is to "maximizing" their credit-bearing capacity. Generally, a debt-to-limit ratio of 30% or less is viewed as acceptable by most lenders, while ratios rising over this level will begin to provoke concerns.

For consumers, keeping a solid debt-to-limit ratio is important on the grounds that it is one of the primary factors used to compute [FICO credit scores](/credit_score). These scores are thusly used to illuminate lending choices like the choice about whether to endorse a given customer's [mortgage](/mortgage) application. To expand their possibilities being approved, would-be borrowers ought to do whatever it takes to keep up with their debt-to-limit ratios at acceptable levels. Instances of such strategies incorporate paying off their outstanding balances consistently or getting a higher credit limit on their loans.

The debt-to-limit ratio is the second-most vigorously weighted factor used to decide FICO credit scores, accounting for 30% of the overall score. Different parts incorporate payment history, the type of debt owed by the customer, how as of late new debts were incurred, and the way that long the existing debts have been owed.

## Certifiable Example of the Debt-to-Limit Ratio

Emma is thinking about applying for a mortgage. To prepare for her application, she surveys her existing credit score and is astonished to observe that it is lower than she expected. While perusing her credit report, Emma finds that her score was negatively impacted by her debt-to-limit ratio, which measures the size of her total debts as compared to her combined credit limits.

At half, Emma's debt-to-limit ratio is over the 30% threshold that is generally viewed as acceptable by most lenders. To assist with further developing her credit score, she chooses to go to active lengths to bring down her debt-to-limit ratio. In particular, she begins by revising her budget with the goal that she can pay off a greater portion of her outstanding debts every month. She then applies for credit limit increments on her existing loans, so her outstanding debts will shrink relative to her increased credit limits.

Another option that Emma could seek after is secure another loan with a higher credit limit than her existing loans. She could then quickly pay off her existing debts utilizing the proceeds from that new loan. Eventually, she would be left with a similar amount of debt as before, however with a higher credit limit. This strategy, known as [debt consolidation](/debtconsolidation), would consequently reduce her debt-to-limit ratio.
