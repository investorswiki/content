# Principal Only Strips (PO Strips)
## What Are Principal Only Strips (PO Strips)?

Principal just strips (PO strips) are a fixed-income security where the holder receives the non-interest portion of the regularly scheduled payments on the underlying loan pool. Principal possibly strips are made when loans are pooled into securities and afterward split into two types. One type is the [interest just (IO) strip](/iostrips) that takes care of investors the interest from each underlying payment. The other type is the principal just strip where the investor gets the portion of the payment implied for real payment on the balance of the loan.

In spite of the fact that principal no one but strips can be made out of any obligation backed security, the term is generally unequivocally associated with [mortgage-backed securities (MBS)](/mbs). The mortgage-backed securities that are split into PO and IO strips are alluded to as a [stripped MBS](/stripped-mbs). Investors in PO strips benefit from quicker [repayment](/repayment) speeds while additionally being safeguarded from [contraction risk](/contractionrisk). This means that, dissimilar to a typical bond or traditional MBS, the PO investor will benefit from diminishes in the interest rate as the loans are probably going to get repaid quicker.

## Understanding Principal Only Strips (PO Strips)

Principal just strips were made to appeal to a particular investor in light of their perspective on the interest rate environment. Mortgages are sensitive to changes in the interest rate since borrowers have the option to refinance in the event that the current rate is below the rate they are paying on their mortgage. At the point when a borrower can set aside cash by [refinancing](/refinance) at a lower rate, the mortgage in the MBS is paid off as part of the refinancing.

This prepayment risk is important to consider while assessing a **traditional** MBS, as the holder needs to get however many payments and as much interest as could reasonably be expected out of each loan. A stripped MBS, in any case, is certainly not a traditional MBS. A stripped MBS allows investors to make various wagers inside a similar mortgage pool. The IO investor will need bunches of interest payments which means they like on the off chance that mortgage borrowers don't pay their loans off ahead of schedule. The PO investor is just getting the principle, so they need that loan paid off as fast as could be expected.

## Principal Only (PO) Strips Versus Interest Only (IO) Strips

At the point when interest rates are low and prepayment inside a MBS is high, principal just strips partake in a greater [yield](/yield). The investors holding PO strips will just at any point see the [face value](/facevalue) of their investment, so they benefit when the time spent in the investment is abbreviated. PO strips are sold at a discount to face value, so there is a yield inherent. The yield increases on the off chance that the principal is received in a more limited amount of time. For instance, on the off chance that you make 3% each year on a loan yet the person pays you the 3% in just six months, your yield has basically multiplied in light of the fact that you brought in your money in half the time expected.

Interest just strip holders need to see the contrary situation happen. They need to see interest rates at a similar level or higher so the mortgage holders in the pool keep making payments (counting interest) on their current loan as opposed to attempting to refinance into another one.

In practice, the IO and PO strip holders are not really in conflict, and numerous investors might hold some mix of both. A stripped MBS can be tweaked so an investor can get exposure to rising interest rates through IO strips, for instance, while likewise keeping a portion of the investment in the PO strips to [hedge](/hedge) against an unexpected reversal.

## Illustration of a Principle Only (PO) Strip

A mortgage backed security will commonly contain many mortgages packaged together. The MBS is then bought and sold between parties, or it tends to be stripped into a PO and IO, then, at that point, those individual securities can be bought and sold.

Expect briefly that a MBS has only one $1 mortgage. A similar concept applies in the event that it was 1,000 x $100,000 mortgages, 10,000 x $10,000 loans, or many million dollar mortgages. The main difference is that with additional loans, in the event that a couple of individuals default it doesn't to a great extent affect the whole security. On the off chance that there are a couple of mortgages in the pool, even one default could immensely affect the performance of the MBS.

Assuming the MBS has been separated into IO and PO parts, when the loan borrowers pay interest on the loan, the IO holders receive the cash inflow, and when the loan borrowers pay principle, the PO holder receives the cash inflow from that.

A mortgage or loan payment is a combination of both principal and interest. Expect that on the $1 million mortgage, the payment is $6,500 each month. In the initial several years the mortgage is paid, the greater part of the payment is probably going to be interest, and the other portion principle. Over the long haul, more principal is paid with every payment and less interest. In this way, IO holders will generally get bigger cash inflows in the prior long stretches of the mortgage and more modest inflows in later years. The PO holder gets more modest cash inflows in the early years, however they get dynamically larger over the long haul.

Assuming that interest rates rise or remain predictable, the mortgage borrower is less inclined to refinance and bound to keep paying their current mortgage rate. This favors the IO holders.

In the event that interest rates fall, the mortgage borrower has more incentive to refinance the mortgage at a lower rate. At the point when this occurs, the original loan is paid off by the bank and another loan is issued. This favors the PO holder since it enormously increases the speed at which they receive their capital/principal.

## Highlights
- An IO strip holder likes assuming interest rates hold consistent or rise, and that mortgage borrowers don't make additional payments since this will cut down on the interest the holder receives.
- PO strips holders like to have their principal paid back rapidly, similar to when the mortgage borrowers make additional payments, refinance, or interest rates drop (which will in general increase refinancing).
- A principal in particular (PO) strip is the part of a stripped MBS where the holder just receives principal payments. The other part of a stripped MBS is an interest in particular (IO) strip.
