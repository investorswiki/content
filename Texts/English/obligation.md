## Obligation Vs. Rights

Obligation means something specific in the world of derivatives, and particularly in options trading. A [call option](/calloption), for example, is a financial contract that gives the option buyer the **right**, yet **not** the obligation, to buy a stock, bond, [commodity](/commodity), or other asset or instrument at a predefined price inside a specific time span. This means that the option holder can choose whether or not to conjure that right, and isn't obliged to do as such.

Options trading can be convoluted and investors some of the time erroneously think that purchasing a call option expects you to buy a certain amount of stock at the [strike price](/strikeprice), yet this isn't the case. As a matter of fact, one of the most alluring parts of buying a call option versus essentially buying a stock is that it gives the trader exposure to a large amount of stock for a more modest amount of money, called the premium.

A [futures](/futures) or [forward](/forwardcontract) contract, then again, doles out both the right **and** the obligation to deliver or receive the underlying asset or instrument.

At the point when large companies fail and find themselves unfit to satisfy their outstanding debts, they can declare bankruptcy, which starts the relief of the total debt for the debtor while permitting the creditor to recover a portion of their losses as assets held by the debtor.

Obligations can be held by any individual or entity that is participated in any kind of contract with another party, and overall, be written or unwritten. A legislator, for instance, has the written obligation to serve every one of their constituents inside the limits of the law, yet they may likewise have an unwritten obligation to settle on choices that will influence their largest benefactors. The presence of these sorts of agreements is almost difficult to demonstrate and such obligations can't be actually regulated. Justice systems dating back to the Romans have offered rigid legal enforcement of [important contracts](/assignablecontract).
