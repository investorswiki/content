# Negatively Amortizing Loan
## What Is a Negatively Amortizing Loan?

A negatively amortizing loan, some of the time called a negative amortization loan or negative amortized loan, is unified with a payment structure that allows for a scheduled payment to be made by the borrower that is not exactly the interest charged on the loan. At the point when that occurs, [deferred interest](/deferredinterest) is made.

The amount of deferred interest made is added to the principal balance of the loan, leading to a situation where the principal owed increments over the long haul rather than diminishes.

## How a Negatively Amortizing Loan Works

Consider a loan with a 8% annual interest rate, a leftover principal balance of $100,000, and a provision that allows the borrower to make $500 payments at a certain number of scheduled payment dates. The interest due on the loan at the next scheduled payment would be: 0.08/12 x 100,000 = $666.67.

On the off chance that the borrower makes a $500 payment, $166.67 in deferred interest ($666.67 - $500) will be added to the principal balance of the loan, for a total excess principal balance of $100,166.67. The next month's interest charge would be founded on this new principal balance amount, and the calculation would proceed with every month, leading to expansions in the loan's principal balance.

> Negative amortizing on a loan can't continue endlessly; eventually, payments must be recalculated with the goal that the loan's balance and interest begin being paid down.

This is called "negative amortization," and it can't go on endlessly. Sooner or later the loan must beginning to [amortize](/amortized-bond) over its leftover term. Normally, negatively amortizing loans have scheduled dates when the payments are recalculated, so the loan will amortize over its excess term, or they will have a [negative amortization limit](/negativeamortizationlimit), which states that when the principal balance of the loan arrives at a certain contractual limit, the payments will be recalculated.
