# Rule of 78
## What Is the Rule of 78?

The Rule of 78 is a method utilized by certain lenders to work out interest charges on a loan. The Rule of 78 requires the borrower to pay a greater portion of interest in the previous part of a loan cycle, which diminishes the likely savings for the borrower in paying off their loan.

## Understanding the Rule of 78

The Rule of 78 gives greater weight to months in the previous part of a borrower's loan cycle while working out interest, which builds the profit for the lender. This type of interest calculation schedule is principally utilized on fixed-rate [non-spinning loans](/rotating account). The Rule of 78 is an important consideration for borrowers who possibly plan to early pay off their loans.

> The Rule of 78 holds that the borrower must pay a greater portion of the interest rate in the previous part of the loan cycle, and that means the borrower will pay more than they would with a normal loan.

## Working out Rule of 78 Loan Interest

The Rule of 78 loan interest methodology is more complex than a simple [annual percentage rate](/apy) (APR) loan. In the two types of loans, be that as it may, the borrower will pay a similar amount of interest on the loan assuming that they make payments for the full loan cycle with no pre-payment.

The Rule of 78 methodology gives added weight to months in the previous cycle of a loan. It is much of the time utilized by short-term installment lenders who give loans to [subprime borrowers](/subprime-borrower).

On account of a year loan, a lender would sum the number of digits through 12 months in the accompanying calculation:

- 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8 + 9 + 10 + 11 + 12 = 78

For a one year loan, the total number of digits is equivalent to 78, which makes sense of the term the Rule of 78. For a two year loan, the total sum of the digits would be 300.

With the sum of the months calculated, the lender then weights the interest payments in reverse order applying greater weight to the previous months. For a one-year [loan](/loan), the weighting factor would be 12/78 of the total interest in the principal month, 11/78 in the subsequent month, 10/78 in the third month, and so on. For a two-year loan, the weighting factor would be 24/300 in the primary month, 23/300 in the subsequent month, 22/300 in the third month, and so on.

## Rule of 78 versus Simple Interest

While paying off a loan, the repayments are made out of two parts: the principal and the interest charged. The Rule of 78 weights the prior payments with more interest than the later payments. On the off chance that the loan isn't terminated or prepaid early, the total interest paid between simple interest and the Rule of 78 will be equivalent.

Nonetheless, on the grounds that the Rule of 78 weights the previous payments with more interest than a simple interest method, paying off a loan early will bring about the borrower paying somewhat more interest overall.

In 1992, the legislation made this type of financing unlawful for loans in the United States with a duration of greater than 61 months. Certain states have adopted more rigid limitations for loans under 61 months in duration, while certain states have banned the practice totally for any loan duration. Check with your state's Attorney General's office prior to going into a loan agreement with a Rule of 78 provision in the event that you are uncertain.

The difference in savings from early prepayment on a Rule of 78 loan versus a simple interest loan isn't essentially substantial in that frame of mind of shorter-term loans. For instance, a borrower with a two-year $10,000 loan at a 5% fixed rate would pay total interest of $529.13 over the whole loan cycle for both a Rule of 78 and a simple interest loan.

In the principal month of the Rule of 78 loan, the borrower would pay $42.33. In the main month of a simple interest loan, the interest is calculated as a percent of the outstanding [principal](/principal), and the borrower would pay $41.67. A [borrower](/co_borrowers) who might want to pay the loan off following 12 months would be required to pay $5,124.71 for the simple interest loan and $5,126.98 for the Rule of 78 loan.
