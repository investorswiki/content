# Gossip Protocol
The term gossip protocol alludes to a specific type of P2P (peer-to-peer) communication that happens among computers and other digital gadgets. The coinage of the term was enlivened by the conventional form of gossip that is common inside social gatherings.
With regards to computer science, gossip protocol is connected with a sort of communication that happens when data is sent through various computer nodes, which are part of a distributed network. As the name recommends, a gossip protocol communication happens when information is communicated starting with one computer then onto the next until it is in the end spread all over the network. Presently, there are various variations of the Gossip protocol that can be applied to various situations relying upon the requirements of the client or organization.
As per teacher M\u00e1rk Jelasity from the University of Szeged, there are two principal types of Gossip manifestation: information spread and information aggregation. These two types are key components of large scale distributed systems.
From one perspective, gossip dispersal, otherwise called multicast, connects with the traditional method of data distribution (each network node in turn). Then again, the amassing gossip protocols are the ones that cycle data, i.e., that initially sum up information and afterward convey it (this type of gossip communication may likewise be alluded to as distributed data mining).
A fascinating illustration of a distributed system that utilizes a gossip protocol is the Hashgraph made by Leemon Baird in 2016. A distributed ledger technology utilizes an asynchronous Byzantine Fault Tolerance (aBFT) consensus algorithm. The nodes of a Hashgraph network gather and sum up information about transactions and different occasions and spread this data to other neighbor nodes that are picked haphazardly. So rather than building a chain of blocks, the Hashgraph network fabricates a tree of occasions where all information is recorded (no data is at any point disposed of).
