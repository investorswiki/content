# Credit Card Accountability, Responsibility, and Disclosure Act of 2009
## What is the CARD Act?
The Credit Card Accountability Responsibility and Disclosure (CARD) Act is a law that gives extra security and protection to credit card users. The law was enacted in response to the stunning level of [unsecured debt](/unsecureddebt) that consumers were carrying. President Barack Obama marked the CARD Act into law in 2009.
## More profound definition
The CARD Act made critical amendments to regulations relating to credit card billing statements, interest rate increases, payment due dates and punishments for surpassing a credit limit. Among the massive changes made by the CARD Act are:
- **Basic rates.** Card issuers are required to give better disclosure of starting rates, likewise called "secret rates." These below-market, impermanent rates must be great for no less than six months.
- **How payments are applied.** Payments that surpass the base amount due must be applied to the balance with the highest interest rate first.
- **Fee and rate hikes.** Credit card issuers are obliged to send cardholders a written notice something like 45 days prior to increases in interest rates and fees.
- **Payment schedule.** Card issuers must give customers no less than 21 calendar days from the day a bill is sent to make a payment.
- **No surprise fees.** Card companies must get the permission of the cardholder to deal with a transaction that would put the account over the spending limit and cause a fee.
- **Payoff calculations.** Card issuers are required to give customers an estimate of what amount of time it would require to pay off a balance with the base amount due every month.

## CARD Act models
Mary has two separate balances on her credit card. One is a balance transfer of $3,000 with a 1.99 percent interest rate for a considerable length of time. The other balance is $4,200 in standard purchases at a rate of 14.99 percent. At the point when Mary sends her payment, she generally sends more than the base due. Under the CARD Act, her credit card company is required to apply any payment over the base to her $4,200 balance since that balance is being paid at a higher interest rate.
Likewise, when Mary's card issuer raised its fee for surpassing the credit limit, the company sent Mary a letter 45 days before the increase came full circle, as required by the CARD Act.
