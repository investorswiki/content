# Block
In short, the term block alludes to computer files that store transaction data. These blocks are organized in a linear sequence that forms a perpetual chain of blocks - subsequently, the term [blockchain](/blockchain).
So all information about blockchain transactions is accumulated and recorded inside these blocks, and each recently created block is associated with the previous one using [cryptographic](/cryptography) methods.
The chain of linked blocks stores all the transaction data created since the send off of a specific blockchain. So the records go as far as possible back to the primary block, which is alluded to as the block zero or [genesis block](/genesis-block). The number of confirmed blocks since the genesis block is indicated as the [block height](/block-level).
Taking the Bitcoin blockchain for instance, blocks are comprised of various components. [Bitcoin](/bitcoin) blocks contain (in addition to other things) a rundown of recent transactions, a timestamp, and a reference to the block that came right before it. This reference is a cryptographic hash of the previous block's data.
The generation of another block generally incorporates the hash of the previous one, and this is the very thing makes the blocks cryptographically linked. Such a structure permits the creation of a secure database that is profoundly resistant to altering and assaults. The block hash acts like an identifier. It is unique to each block and is delivered through a cycle called [mining](/mining).
Essentially talking, the block hash is the solution to a complex mathematical problem, and the miner that finds a substantial solution for the next block is conceded the right to approve that block (and the transactions in that). Since mining requires a lot of computational resources, effectively mined blocks produce new Bitcoins as a method for rewarding miners for their work (see [block reward](/block-reward)).
Yet, some of the time, at least two miners might find a legitimate block hash simultaneously, with the goal that two unique blocks are communicated to the network. This prompts the creation of two contending chains. To address this problem, the participants of the network ([nodes](/hub)) will pick the chain that at last turns into the longest (with more "aggregated work"). The other chain is then disposed of, and its blocks become lifeless blocks (see [orphan blocks](/orphan-block-digital currency)).
Despite the fact that blocks are generally examined with regards to cryptographic money transactions, they may likewise be connected with different types of digital data that are stored on a blockchain system.

## Features
- A block alludes to a large volume trade that happens without a moment's delay.
- Block trades are some of the time done outside of the open markets to reduce the impact on the security's price.
- All together not to influence market prices, large block orders might be broken up into more modest orders and executed through various brokers to cover the true size.
- Exchanges normally characterize a block as in excess of 10,000 shares of stock or a trade that has a notional value in excess of $200,000.
