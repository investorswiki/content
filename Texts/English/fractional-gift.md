## What Is a Fractional Gift?

A fractional gift permits contributors to realize a substantial tax break over a number of years while as yet holding possession of a thing of beauty.

The fractional gift structure considers the chance of the tax break expanding in value as the value of a gave masterpiece appreciates. The way in to this calculation was the fact that the capital gains tax rate on valued artwork is higher than the rate for different assets.
