# Buy Quote
## What Is a Buy Quote?

A buy quote is a number that determines the next accessible purchase price for a security. It is one approach to depicting the best accessible price to buy a specific security at a given time all through a trading session. It is what the buyer will pay for when they obtain a security and it works related to the best-distributed [ask price](/bestask), which is the price the seller will offer the security for.

## How a Buy Quote Works

Securities are bought and sold consistently. In the transaction, there is generally a buyer seeking procure a security at the best cost and a seller seeking sell a security at the best cost. The buy quote is the number that addresses the price of the security for the people who need to purchase it.

Prices for stocks, options, or some other security are really made out of two numbers: a [bid price](/bidprice) and a [ask price](/ask). These prices come from limit orders that customers go into their broker systems, and which brokers distribute to the exchange. The exchanges and brokers thus are required to furnish customers with the best of these accessible prices out of the blue. Purchase prices distributed in this manner in the U.S. utilize the [National Best Bid and Offer](/nbbo) (NBBO) system. In Europe, the equivalent is the [European Best Bid and Offer](/european-best-bid-and-offer) (EBBO).

NBBO alludes to both the highest bid price that a buyer will pay for a given security and the best accessible [ask price](/ask) a seller might want to acknowledge for a security. The Securities and Exchange Commission's (Sec's) rules expect brokers to guarantee those prices. It's the best ask price, or offer, that is generally like the possibility of a buy quote.

The possibility of the NBBO is to ensure all investors get the best price conceivable while trading by means of a broker, disposing of the need to order various quotes from different exchanges to guarantee a trade is optimal. Accordingly, the buy quote changes in real-time as long as the market is open.

## Buy Quotes in Forex Markets

A buy quote, in forex explicitly, is shown on the right half of the price quote and addresses the price at which customers can purchase the base currency. For instance, in the GBP/USD forex [currency pair](/currencypair), a quote of 1.6253/55, a customer could buy the base currency (GBP) for $1.6255.

A currency pair addresses two distinct currencies, with the value of one being quoted against the other: The primary listed currency of a currency pair is called the[ base currency](/basecurrency), and the subsequent currency is called the[ quote currency](/quotecurrency).

## How a Buy Quote Factors Into the Spread

Something contrary to a buy quote, of course, is a sell quote. Also, the difference between those two numbers, which may sometimes be alluded to as the offer price and bid price, is the [spread](/spread). For instance, if an EUR/USD quote peruses 1.4100/02, the spread is the difference somewhere in the range of 1.4100 and 1.4102. For the trade to break even, the position must move toward the trade in a similar amount as the spread.

In the Forex market, currency trades commonly include large amounts of money. However spreads might be small, during large trades, small spreads can add up rapidly.

All of this data permits a trader to pursue the best purchasing choice.
