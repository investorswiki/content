## Impaired Capital Explained

Incorporation laws frequently restrict companies from paying dividends before they can dispense with any deficit in retained earnings.

Not at all like the impairment of an asset that never recuperates, impaired capital can normally reverse itself when a company's total capital transcends the par value of its capital stock.
