## From Shorting to a Short Bias

Preceding the long-term bull market for U.S. equities that took place during the 1980s and 1990s, many hedge funds utilized a dedicated short strategy, as opposed to a dedicated short bias strategy. The dedicated short strategy was one that solely took short positions. The dedicated short funds were for all intents and purposes obliterated during the bull market, so the dedicated short bias fund arose and took a more balanced approach. The long holdings are sufficient to keep losses manageable, in spite of the fact that funds can in any case run into issues with leverage and [capital flight](/capitalflight) assuming losses go on for a really long time.

## The Challenge of Maintaining a Dedicated Short Bias

Focusing on a bias, whether long or short, puts these hedge funds in a difficult situation functionally. Even when a bull market has kept on gutting a hedge fund for a long period of time, the fund manager must reposition over and over to lay out the net short as the long positions fill in value. Of course, when the market eventually inverts, these dedicated short bias funds race ahead.

There are other hedge fund strategies that permit the fund manager to go long or short without stressing over what direction the bias is shifted. These hedge funds are not [market neutral](/marketneutral), yet they permit positional shifting fully intent on augmenting profits no matter what the overall market bearing. Curiously, these long/short equity funds frequently have a dedicated long bias that arises normally over the long haul.

All things considered, these more flexible arrangements will experience issues matching the performance of a dedicated short bias fund when the market is in a prolonged decline since there will be a lag time in adjusting positions that short fund will not need to deal with.
