A lot of John Stuart Mill's convictions, considerations, and persuasive works can be credited to his childhood and the philosophy instructed to him by James Mill. His dad got to know the leading political scholar Jeremy Bentham in 1808, and together they began a political movement that embraced philosophical radicalism and utilitarianism, which advocates "the best amount of great for the best number of individuals." It was during this time that the youthful Mill was taught with the economic theory, political reasoning, and social convictions that would shape his later work.

It was really this definite childhood that gave him his foundation and furthermore brought about a mental breakdown — and later, a mental leap forward. Mill ascribed delayed periods of depression, trouble, and, surprisingly, self-destructive considerations to the tyrannical idea of his dad and the extreme system in which he was raised.

Through this self-reflection, he started to make changes to Bentham's utilitarian philosophy to make it more positive, embracing the amended theory as his own system of conviction.

Mill burned through the vast majority of his working life with the East India Company: He went along with it at age 16 and was employed there for quite a long time. During 1865-68, he filled in as a Member of Parliament (MP), addressing the City of Westminster.
