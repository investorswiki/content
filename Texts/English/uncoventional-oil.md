# Unconventional Oil
## What Is Unconventional Oil?

In the oil and gas industry, the term "unconventional oil" alludes to [crude oil](/crude-oil) that is gotten through methods other than traditional [vertical well extraction](/verticalwell).

Instances of such methods incorporate creating [oil sands](/oilsand), [directional drilling](/directional-drilling), and [hydraulic fracturing](/hydraulic-fracturing) (informally known as "[fracking](/fracking)"), among others. Today, unconventional oil is turning out to be progressively common, driven by new innovative developments as well as economic contemplations, making it more savvy and productive. Certain individuals, notwithstanding, have worries that unconventional oil extraction methods might be destructive for the environment.

## How Unconventional Oil Works

There are two primary motivations behind why unconventional oil has become progressively common in recent years. The first has to do with the economic climate encompassing the oil extraction industry. For example, in periods where the price of oil is somewhat low, companies face pressures to foster new mechanical means of removing oil all the more proficiently.

In practice, this means speeding up and unwavering quality of equipment, diminishing the dependence on work force through increased automation, growing new procedures that reduce the amount of equipment or staff by and large, or a mix of the abovementioned. These developments can make the methods utilized for oil extraction contrast substantially from the traditional vertical wells utilized in conventional oil extraction. Directional drilling methods, for instance, have allowed companies to access various underground reserves utilizing a single vertical well — something which would have required numerous vertical drill destinations in the past.

The equivalent is true when oil prices are perseveringly high. In those conditions, oil reserves that had recently been viewed as too challenging to be taken advantage of economically may abruptly observe themselves to be monetarily reasonable targets. For instance, increased oil costs empowered the development of the strategies currently known as hydraulic fracturing, which includes utilizing steam, gas, and compound infusions to break up rock formations and concentrate the hydrocarbons held inside them.

At last, it appears to be unavoidable that a developing percentage of oil extraction strategies will come to be viewed as "unconventional" by historical standards. As oil turns out to be progressively scant and tested by alternative energy sources, for example, sun oriented, wind, and nuclear power, almost certainly, the strategies for oil extraction will proceed to change, and the industry attempts to work on the productivity of its production methods consistently.

## Illustration of Unconventional Oil: Fracking

Maybe the most renowned illustration of unconventional oil extraction is hydraulic fracturing, which was first imagined in 1947 by engineers at the Stanolind Oil and Gas Corporation. The essential reason of hydraulic fracturing is that it is feasible to make recently accessible reserves of oil by delivering the hydrocarbons that are caught inside underground stone formations.

This is finished by infusing highly compressed fracking liquid into a well which then, at that point, makes gaps in an underground stone formation. The subsequent oil, which escapes from the crevices, then continuously flows up through the well toward the low-pressure surface. The movement of the oil toward the surface is additionally accelerated by misleadingly expanding the pressure inside the underground supply while likewise utilizing substance infusions to change the consistency of the oil.

## Illustration of Unconventional Oil: Oil Sands

Another model is [oil sands](/oilsand). Otherwise called "tar sands," these allude to soil and shake material which contains crude [bitumen](/bitumen), a thick, gooey form of crude oil. Bitumen is too thick to flow all alone, so particular extraction methods are essential. Thus, recuperating usable crude oil from oil sands is a complex and costly method of extraction. Nonetheless, mechanical advances have made it more affordable after some time, and when oil prices are costly in the market, this type of unconventional oil becomes beneficial.

Oil sands are found fundamentally in the Athabasca, Cold Lake, and Peace River districts of northern Alberta and Saskatchewan, Canada, and in areas of Venezuela, Kazakhstan, and Russia. Bitumen is extricated and handled utilizing two methods, mining and in situ.

## Highlights
- It is progressively the case, nonetheless, that the mechanical advances got through unconventional oil extraction have been executed all through mainstream oil production practices — like on account of directional drilling methods.
- Unconventional oil is crude oil that is extricated utilizing somewhat new or potentially complex methods.
- Historically, unconventional oil was associated with periods of generally high oil prices, in which costlier methods could be economically justified.
