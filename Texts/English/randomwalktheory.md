# Random Walk Theory
## What Is the Random Walk Theory?

Random walk theory recommends that changes in stock prices have a similar distribution and are independent of one another. In this manner, it expects the past movement or [trend](/trend) of a stock price or market can't be utilized to foresee its future movement. In short, random walk theory proclaims that stocks take a random and unpredictable path that makes all methods of foreseeing stock prices vain over the long haul.

## Figuring out Random Walk Theory

Random walk theory trusts beating the market without expecting extra risk is incomprehensible. It considers [technical analysis](/technicalanalysis) undependable on the grounds that chartists just buy or sell a security after a laid out trend has developed. Moreover, the theory finds [fundamental analysis](/fundamentalanalysis) undependable due to the frequently low quality of data collected and its ability to be confounded. Pundits of the theory fight that stocks really do keep up with price trends after some time - as such, that it is feasible to outperform the market via carefully choosing entry and exit points for equity investments.

## Efficient Markets are Random

The random walk theory caused a stir in 1973 when writer Burton Malkiel begat the term in his book "A Random Walk Down Wall Street." The book promoted the [efficient market hypothesis](/efficientmarkethypothesis) (EMH), a prior theory presented by University of Chicago teacher William Sharp. The efficient market hypothesis states that stock prices completely mirror all available data and expectations, so current prices are the best estimate of an organization's [intrinsic value](/intrinsicvalue). This would block anybody from taking advantage of mispriced stocks reliably in light of the fact that price movements are generally random and driven by unexpected occasions.

Sharp and that's what malkiel presumed, due to the short-term randomness of returns, investors would be better off investing in a passively managed, well-[diversified](/expansion) fund. A dubious part of Malkiel's book estimated that "a blindfolded monkey tossing darts at a paper's financial pages could choose a [portfolio](/portfolio) that would do just as well as one carefully chosen by specialists."

## Random Walk Theory in real life

The most notable commonsense illustration of random walk theory happened in 1988 when the Wall Street Journal tried to test Malkiel's theory by making the annual Wall Street Journal Dartboard Contest, setting professional investors in opposition to darts for [stock-picking](/valueinvesting) matchless quality. Wall Street Journal staff individuals assumed the part of the dart-tossing monkeys.

After in excess of 140 challenges, the Wall Street Journal introduced the outcomes, which showed the specialists won 87 of the challenges and the dart hurlers won 55. Notwithstanding, the specialists were simply able to beat the [Dow Jones Industrial Average](/djia) (DJIA) in 76 challenges. Malkiel remarked that the specialists' picks profited from the exposure hop in the price of a stock that will in general happen when stock specialists make a recommendation. [Passive management](/passivemanagement) that's what defenders battle, on the grounds that the specialists could beat the market half the time, investors would be better off investing in a passive fund that charges far lower management fees.
