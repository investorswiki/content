# Derivative Oscillator
## What Is the Derivative Oscillator?

The derivative oscillator is a technical indicator that applies a [moving average intermingling divergence ](/macd)(MACD ) histogram to a twofold smoothed [relative strength index](/rsi) (RSI) to make a further developed version of the RSI indicator.

## Grasping the Derivative Oscillator

The derivative oscillator was developed by Constance Brown and distributed in the book **Technical Analysis for the Trading Professional**. This technical indicator is a further developed version of the relative strength index (RSI) that applies moving average union divergence (MACD) principles to a twofold [smoothed](/information smoothing) RSI (DS RSI) indicator.

The indicator is derived by registering the difference between a twofold smoothed RSI and a [simple moving average](/sma) (SMA) of the DS RSI. The indicator's intent is to give more accurate buy and sell signals than the standard RSI calculation. The derivative oscillator can be utilized whenever outline.

The MACD is derived by deducting the 12-period [exponential moving average](/ema) (EMA) from the 26-period EMA. It is in this manner that the derivative oscillator utilizes MACD principles, since the derivative oscillator is likewise derived from deducting the SMA from the twofold smoothed RSI.

The derivative oscillator is utilized similarly as the MACD [histogram](/histogram). Positive readings are considered bullish, negative readings are considered bearish, and crossovers above and below the zero line signal demonstrate expected buying and selling opportunities. Traders may likewise search for [divergence](/divergence) with the security's price, which could be an indication of an impending reversal in the common trend. This happens when the indicator falls and the price rises or when the price falls and the indicator keeps on rising.

Traders ought to think about involving the derivative oscillator related to different forms of technical analysis, for example, [price action](/price-action) analysis and chart designs.

## Derivative Oscillator Example

The accompanying week after week chart of Apple Inc. (AAPL) has a derivative oscillator applied to it. Zero line crossovers are set apart with vertical lines and bolts. Buy and sell signals would happen at the [close](/closingprice) of the day when the signal happens or at the accompanying [open](/openingprice).

The indicator delivers a number of trades, a few just enduring half a month. The chart demonstrates the way that this trading strategy can create both beneficial and losing trades thus, indeed, [risk management](/riskmanagement) is key. The strategy is generally defenseless to a large number of losing trades when the price is moving sideways and the stock (or another asset) needs course.

A variation on the strategy is to buy when the indicator turns up and sell when the indicator turns down, rather than waiting for a zero-line crossover. In this model, the indicator is colored green when it is moving higher and red when it is moving lower. This gives prior entry points into assemblies and prior exits during declines. While this method functions admirably when the price is making large swings and [trending](/trend), the method is inclined to many false signals and losing trades, when the price action is [choppy](/choppymarket) or non-trending.

## Derivative Oscillator versus Stochastic Oscillator

The [stochastic oscillator](/stochasticoscillator) compares the current price to the price range over a defined period. This demonstrates whether the stock or other asset is strong or weak relative to its recent price range. The indicator is bound somewhere in the range of zero and 100.

Regardless of various calculations, the stochastic oscillator, RSI, and the derivative oscillator will commonly move in a similar heading, albeit not precisely simultaneously or with a similar greatness.

## Limitations of the Derivative Oscillator

The derivative oscillator can deliver a large number of trade signals, particularly during choppy trading conditions when the indicator is generally defenseless to giving [false](/false-signal) or losing signals. Signals can likewise happen once the price has previously taken a substantial action in a given heading. This could mean inadequately coordinated passages or exits. It is important to note that this indicator is following up on past price data. There isn't anything intrinsically predictive about the indicator in its calculation.

## Features
- The derivative oscillator is the difference between a twofold smoothed RSI and a SMA of the twofold smoothed RSI.
- The derivative oscillator is oftentimes displayed as a histogram.
- Zero line crossovers are one method for creating trade signals with the indicator. Divergence may likewise be utilized.
