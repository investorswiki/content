# Joint Endorsement
## What Is Joint Endorsement?

A joint endorsement can be required on a check introduced for deposit or cashing that has been made out to at least two individuals. The purpose of the joint endorsement is to prevent one individual from depositing or cashing a check without the information or permission of the other person to whom the check is made out.

## Figuring out Joint Endorsement

Rules on joint endorsements change by state, bank, and, surprisingly, the type of check introduced. For instance, when checks are made out to a married couple and deposited into their [joint account,](/jointaccount) many banks won't need the two mates to underwrite the check; all things considered, the money is going into an account to which they share access. Then again, most banks will require checks issued by the U.S. government, for example, tax refund checks, to be jointly supported, even for deposit into a joint account.

## The Details Make a Difference

The requirement for a joint endorsement not entirely set in stone by the manner the check is written. As per legal convention, in the event that the two payee names on the check are separated by "and" or any symbol or shortened form of "and," then, at that point, the bank can require joint endorsement. In this way a check made out to "Jane Doe and John Doe," "Jane Doe and John Doe," or "Jane Doe + John Doe" would call for a joint endorsement. Then again, in the event that the payee names on the check are separated by a simple comma, for example, "Jane Doe, John Doe," then either party could support the check. Regardless, note that all banks may not follow these conventions and might actually demand a joint endorsement.

In certain examples, the two players for a joint endorsement can't be available together simultaneously to support the check. For instance, an as of late separated from couple in which one of the partners has gotten a controlling order against the other could introduce a problem for the bank since it is hard to confirm or ask for signatures for a check. In such cases, a bank works with the two players freely or asks for a reissue of the joint check, made out separately to every individual.

## Joint Endorsements in Landlord-Tenant Transactions

The issue of joint endorsements frequently comes up in landlord-tenant relations on the grounds that many day to day environments include flat mates who share bills and obligations however who are not married or generally related. At the point when a landlord returns a security deposit to tenants, the check might be written out to both, or every one of, the tenants listed on the lease, utilizing some rendition of "and" between the names. Frequently the letters JT are attached to the names, signifying "joint tenants." A problem emerges when two unrelated flat mates have separate bank accounts, since the landlord's check must be deposited into one account. In this case the refund check must in any case be jointly supported by the two tenants before it tends to be deposited in one of the tenants' bank accounts. The depositor would then probably compose a separate check back to the next tenant.
