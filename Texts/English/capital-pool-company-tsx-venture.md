# Capital Pool Company (CPC)
## What Is a Capital Pool Company (CPC)?

A capital pool company (CPC) is an alternative way for private companies in Canada to raise capital and open up to the world. The capital pool company system was made and is right now regulated by the [TMX Group](/tmx-group), and the subsequent companies trade on the [TSX Venture Exchange](/tsxventureexchange) in Toronto, Canada.

## Understanding Capital Pool Companies (CPCs)

A capital pool company is a [listed](/listed) company with experienced directors and capital, yet no commercial operations at the hour of the [initial public offering](/ipo) (IPO). The directors of the CPC center around obtaining an emerging company and, upon the completion of the acquisition, that emerging company approaches the capital and the listing prepared by the CPC.

Canada doesn't have as powerful a [venture capital](/venturecapital) industry as the United States does, so companies will more often than not list on the TSX prior in their growth. The downside of this previous listing to access capital is that the companies can undoubtedly wind up abandoned by investors due to their freshness in operating as a public company and the dual requests of the public obligations at a point of critical operational expansion.

Capital pool companies were made and elevated as a method for infusing beginning phase companies with both the capital and expert chief level guidance that is given in the U.S. by venture capitalists. They likewise give an alternative growth path to Canadian businesses as well as businesses keen on opening up to the world on the TSX Venture Exchange. Capital pool companies are like [blind pools](/blind_pool) in the United States, yet the cycle is controlled and regulated by a single Canadian exchange.

## The CPC Process

The method involved with making a capital pool company has two phases:

- **Phase 1: Creation of the Capital Pool Company**

In phase one, no less than three experienced individuals pool capital to start the cycle â€” the total amount must surpass $100,000 or 5% of the funds being raised. The founders then, at that point, consolidate a shell company to raise seed capital with the goal to show it as a CPC. The prospectus is made and afterward the company applies to be listed. There are extra rules concerning the number of shareholders that are required and the amount they can claim of the offering. The CPC is listed toward the finish of this interaction with the symbol ".P" to assign it as a capital pool company.
- **Phase 2: Completing a Qualifying Transaction**

In the span of 24 months of listing on the TSX, the capital pool company must complete a qualifying transaction or face delisting. The qualifying transaction is an agreement to purchase a company and integrate its shares into the public company, like a reverse takeover. The end structure brings about the founders of both merged substances keeping a higher level of ownership in the company than what might have been the case with an IPO.

Basically, having an instant listing with experienced directors assists with bringing down costs for the company and decreases the risks of opening up to the world. For investors, choosing to purchase shares in a CPC requires more due diligence on the founders of the CPC itself, as they will be concluding what type of business to buy and how to direct it after the initial investment is made.

Even assuming a target has been suggested, just like with some CPCs, there is no guarantee that it will work out. So investors must be positive about the management of the CPC and their ability to make value for businesses overall instead of a specific business.
