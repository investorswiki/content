# At a Discount
## What Is At a Discount?

"At a discount" is a phrase used to portray the practice of selling stocks, or different securities, below their current market value, like a sale of goods at a retail foundation.

## Grasping At a Discount

In the field of investing, "at a discount" alludes unequivocally to [stock](/stock) that is sold for not exactly its nominal or par value. The [nominal](/nominal), or [par](/parvalue), value for a [security](/security), which is nitty gritty in the company charter, is the base price that a stock of a particular class can be sold for in a [initial public offering](/ipo) (IPO). Most states have laws preventing companies from giving stock at a price not as much as par.

The par value of a stock has no connection to its market price. Many stocks today are not even issued with a par value, and those that are, frequently have values that in no way connect with the responsible price. For instance, in 2012, Google's convertible preferred shares had a par value of $0.001 per share. Selling a stock below market value, then again, is undeniably more normal and is commonly finished for the purpose of tempting buyers or making buzz.

There are separate cases and settings where a stock may be depicted as "at a discount" compared to its target price or a previous close. In these cases, the market value might have dropped as part of the trading day cycle, however there is some expectation that it could rise once more.

Besides, it is feasible for employees with certain stock options to purchase shares at a discount, in the event that they were conceded the options sufficiently early. The market value of the shares might have increased during the time it took for the options to turn out to be completely vested, however the employee is permitted to purchase the dispensed shares at that lower price. In these models, there is no legal barrier to the purchase and sale of such shares for a profit.

## At a Discount Restrictions

Legal limitations on selling at a discount were put into effect, in part, to better shield the creditors of a company from any possibly negative effects that such discounts could have. By selling shares below market value, a company's capitalization could be compromised, passing on it with a shortage of assets to pay its obligations should the company lapse into default. Further, in the event that shares are sold at a discount, those shareholders who buy the stock might confront [contingent liability](/contingentliability) to the creditors for the difference in price.
