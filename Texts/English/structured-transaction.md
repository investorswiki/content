# Structured Transaction
## What Is a Structured Transaction?

A structured transaction is a series of [transactions](/transaction) broken up from a larger sum to try not to report requirements under the [Bank Secrecy Act](/bank_secrecy_act) (BSA), which requires financial institutions to report all transactions of $10,000 or more. In view of its usage, restructuring transactions (or layering) is a red flag for conceivable money laundering.

## How a Structured Transaction Works

To stay away from the reporting requirements, which the Bank Secrecy Act presents, people and businesses during the 1980s started making and organizing transactions, which came in below the reporting threshold of $10,000. A few people and businesses used structured transactions on the off chance that they didn't believe the government should be familiar with their financial activities or potentially the way in which they produced income. For instance, in instances of [money laundering](/moneylaundering) and tax evasion, regulators corresponded these cases with structured transactions.

Money laundering is the act of hiding the movement of large amounts of money, which crooks frequently create by means of criminal operations, for example, drug dealing or psychological oppressor activity. The course of money laundering makes such "grimy" activities look clean. Specific advances associated with money laundering incorporate placement, layering, and integration. Placement alludes to the act of introducing "grimy money" into the financial framework; layering is the act of disguising the source of these funds through complex transactions and bookkeeping stunts, and integration alludes to the act of re-getting that money in purportedly genuine means.

## Special Considerations

The [USA Patriot Act](/patriotact) gave law enforcement agencies more extensive powers to investigate, prosecute, and deal with psychological oppressors. The Act originated after Sept. 11, 2001, fear based oppressor assaults. Federal agencies use court orders to get business records and bank records. The Act's principal Title III powers numerous financial institutions to record aggregate transactions including countries where laundering is a known problem. Such institutions have introduced procedures to distinguish and follow beneficiaries of such accounts, alongside people authorized to route funds through [payable-through accounts](/payable-through-draft).

While the number of transactions surpassing $10,000 during the 1970s was somewhat low, the number of transactions surpassing that amount today is a lot greater. In the 2019 [fiscal year](/fiscalyear), in excess of 20 million [currency transaction reports](/ctr) (CTRs) were filed. In spite of greater capacity with the Patriot Act, the sheer amount of data can be challenging for law enforcement agencies and regulators to process and investigate as quickly as possibly.

Regulators ensure that all taxpayers and taxable substances report taxable income appropriately and legally. To guarantee compliance, the Bank Secrecy Act requires financial institutions to record and report data on their clients' transactions on the off chance that those transactions include a large amount of money. The CTR is the specific report which regulators require. Financial institutions must file these after deposits, withdrawals, or [exchanges of currency](/unfamiliar trade) surpass $10,000.
