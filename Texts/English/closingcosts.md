# Closing Costs
Closing costs are the fees you pay while settling a real estate transaction, whether you're refinancing a mortgage or buying another home. These costs can amount to 2 to 5 percent of the mortgage balance so it's important to be financially prepared for this expense.

## What are closing costs?
[Closing costs](/closingcosts) incorporate a scope of charges for services connected with applying for a mortgage. A portion of the costs are connected with the property — evaluating it to confirm its value and looking through property records to guarantee a reasonable title — and others are connected with the desk work included, including attorney fees and the expense of beginning and underwriting the loan.
Closing costs are separate from the down payment, and you generally need a clerk's check (not a personal check) to pay them.

## How much are closing costs?
The total tab for your closing costs relies upon three key factors:
- The price of the home
- Its area
- Whether you're buying or refinancing
