# Three Outside Up/Down
## What Is a Three Outside Up/Down?

The three outside up and three outside down are three-candle reversal patterns that show up on [candlestick](/candlestick) charts. The pattern requires three candles to form in a specific sequence, showing that the current trend has lost momentum and could signal a [reversal](/reversal) of an existing trend. Specifically, the pattern is formed when a dark candlestick is followed by two white-body ones, or vice versa.

The three outside up and three outside down might be compared with a [three inside up/down](/three-inside-updown) candle.

1. The market is in a [uptrend](/uptrend).
