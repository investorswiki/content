# Sample Selection Bias
## What Is Sample Selection Bias?

Sample selection bias is a type of bias brought about by picking non-random data for statistical analysis. The bias exists due to a flaw in the sample selection process, where a subset of the data is methodicallly excluded due to a specific attribute. The exclusion of the subset can influence the statistical significance of the test, and it can bias the assessments of boundaries of the [statistical model](/statistics).

## Understanding Sample Selection Bias

[Survivorship bias](/survivorshipbias) is a common type of sample selection bias. This type of bias overlooks those subjects that didn't make it past a certain point in the selection cycle and just spotlights on the subjects that "made due." This can lead to false ends.

For instance, when [backtesting](/backtesting) an investment strategy on a large group of stocks, it very well might be helpful to search for securities that have data for the whole sample period. Assuming we planned to test the strategy against 15 years worth of stock data, we may be leaned to search for stocks that have complete data for the whole 15-year period.

In any case, wiping out a stock that stopped trading, or in no time left the market, would enter a bias in our data sample. Since we just incorporate stocks that endured the 15-year period, our end-product would be flawed, as these performed all around ok to endure the market.

## Types of Sample Selection Bias

Notwithstanding survivorship bias, there are several different types of sample selection bias.

### Advertising or Pre-Screening Bias

This happens when how participants are pre-separated a study [introduces bias](/bias). For instance, the language researchers use to promote for participants could itself at any point bring bias into the study basically by discouraging or encouraging certain groups of individuals from electing to take an interest.

### Self-Selection Bias

Self-selection bias — otherwise called volunteer response bias — happens when the study coordinators permit participants to self-select or elect to partake. The study coordinators give up control over who takes part to the people who choose to chip in. This might lead individuals with specific qualities or suppositions to chip in for a study and consequently [skew the results](/skewness).

### Exclusion and Undercoverage Bias

Exclusion bias happens when specific individuals from a population are excluded from participating in a study. Undercoverage bias happens when study coordinators make a study that doesn't sufficiently address a few individuals from the population.

## Illustration of Sample Selection Bias

[Hedge fund](/hedgefund) performance indexes are one illustration of sample selection bias subject to survivorship bias. Since hedge funds that don't endure stop reporting their performance to index aggregators, coming about indices are normally shifted to funds and strategies that remain, subsequently "get by." This can be an issue with famous mutual fund reporting services also. Analysts can change in accordance with assess these biases yet may present new biases simultaneously.

> Spectator bias happens when researchers project their own convictions or expectations to participants of a study, subsequently skewing the consequences of the study. This occasionally happens related to [cherry-picking](/carefully selecting), which is when researchers center basically around statistics that support their hypothesis.

## Special Considerations

Researchers and study coordinators have the responsibility to guarantee the aftereffects of their studies are accurate, significant, and integrate no type of bias that could lead to flawed ends. One method for doing this is to structure the study in light of a method that supports a [random sample](/simple-random-sample) selection process.

While in theory, this might appear to be adequately simple, the reality is that the researcher should be cautious in their efforts to forestall sample selection bias. Furthermore, the study coordinator might be confronted with limitations outside of their reach that make it trying to understand a random sample. For instance, there might be a lack of participants or insufficient funding for the project.

To ensure the sample being examined is random, the researcher ought to distinguish the different [subgroups inside the population](/population). They ought to then break down the sample to decide whether these subgroups are satisfactorily addressed in the study.

Now and again, the researcher might observe that certain subgroups are either overrepresented or underrepresented in their study. Right now, the researcher can carry out bias correction methods. One method is to assign loads to the distorted subgroups to address the bias statistically. This [weighted average](/weightedaverage) considers the proportional importance of every subgroup and can lead to results that all the more accurately mirror the study population's genuine demographics.

## Features
- Due to a flaw in the sample selection process, a subset of the data is excluded from the study, consequently influencing or refuting the statistical significance of the test.
- Survivorship bias can lead to false ends since it centers just around those components, individuals, or things that have made it past a certain point in the selection cycle, overlooking those that didn't.
- There are several types of sample selection bias, including pre-screening bias, self-selection bias, exclusion bias, and spectator bias.
- One method for amending sample selection bias is to assign loads to distorted subgroups to address the bias statistically.
- Sample selection bias in a research study happens when non-random data is chosen for statistical analysis.
