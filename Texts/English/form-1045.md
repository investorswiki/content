## What Is Form 1045: Application for Tentative Refund?

Form 1045: Application for Tentative Refund is a [Internal Revenue Service](/irs) (IRS) form utilized by people, [estates](/estate), and trusts to apply for a quick tax refund.

As per the directions for Form 1045, the basis for the refund request must be for one of four reasons:

- The carryback of a [net operating loss](/netoperatingloss) (NOL)
- The carryback of an unused [general business credit](/general-business-tax-credit)
- The carryback of a net section 1256 contracts loss
- An excessive charge of tax due to a claim of right adjustment under [section 1341](/section-1341-credit)(b)(1)

The directions for Form 1045 illuminate what qualifies as a loss.

## Who Can File Form 1045: Application for Tentative Refund?

People, estates, and trusts can file Form 1045: Application for Tentative Refund as opposed to utilizing Form [1040-X](/form1040x) for people or utilizing Form 1041 for estates or trusts.

Form 1045 is utilized to file for a quick tax refund, while Forms 1040X and 1041 are not handled as quickly. Form 1045 is required to be handled by the IRS in the span of 90 days, and must be filed by the taxpayer or taxpaying entity in somewhere around one year of the NOL happening. Interestingly, both Form 1040X, for people, or Form 1041 for estates and trusts, can be filed as long as three years from the time the NOL happens. In any case, the IRS won't process either Form 1040X or Form 1041 in somewhere around 90 days and has as long as six months to finish up both of these refunds.

Form 1045 can be questioned by the IRS or the taxpaying entity after the refund is handled, which is the reason it is marked as a speculative refund. Conversely, the information and claims made on Forms 1040X and 1041 are assumed by all parties to be right and last. A party that needs a fast refund yet isn't worried about having the refund revised later will file Form 1045, while a party that needs exactness and can hang tight for the right refund will file either Form 1040X (people) or Form 1041 (estate or trust).
