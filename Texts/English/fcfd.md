## What Is a Foreign Currency Fixed Deposit (FCFD)?

A Foreign Currency Fixed Deposit (FCFD) is a fixed investment instrument in which a specific sum of money that is ready to earn interest is deposited into a bank.

Albeit fixed deposits have for all intents and purposes no risk, foreign currency fixed deposits present an element of exchange rate risk since investors must exchange their currency into the target currency and afterward convert it back again once the term is finished.

The money deposited in the FCFD account can't be removed until the agreed fixed term has expired.

At the point when foreign currency fixed deposits are bigger and longer in duration, they receive a lot higher interest rates. A FCFD can be an extremely helpful and safe method for investing your money. Nonetheless, depositors must ensure that they needn't bother with that money for the whole duration of the term. On the off chance that an investor pulls out the funds prior to maturity, a [early withdrawal](/earlywithdrawal) penalty would apply, which is many times steep and set at the prudence of the bank.

The early redemption of a foreign currency fixed deposit will probably bring about the partial loss of the principal sum due to the combined effects of the redemption charges and bid-ask spread charges.

A FCFD can be invested in two ways â€” opening a neighborhood account that offers deposits in the foreign currency that the investor might want to gain exposure to or opening an account in the foreign country itself. Interest rates, least deposits, tenure periods, and accessible currencies fluctuate from one bank to another.

## Illustration of a Foreign Currency Fixed Deposit

For instance, A Canadian investor who has CAD dollars however needs to hold U.S. dollars can deposit USD into a US dollar-named FCFD paying a higher interest rate than a nearby Canadian savings account. To do this, the investor should purchase US dollars from the responsible bank utilizing his Canadian dollars. After the US dollars are purchased, they are deposited into the FCFD.

[USD/CAD](/usd-cad-us-dollar-canadian-dollar-currency-pair) is quoted as 1.29 from a FCFD giving bank. An investor that needs to deposit $100,000 will buy USD at the rate of 1.29 from the bank by selling CAD 129,000. The $100,000 is deposited in the FCFD account for one year and earns an annual interest of 1.5%. After the tenure finishes, the USD is sold for CAD at the predominant foreign exchange rate offered by the responsible bank.

Following our model above, toward the finish of the term, the investor earns 1.5% x $100,000 = $1,500. In any case, the bank is simply able to purchase USD at a rate of 1.21. This means that the investor will receive Canadian dollars worth $101,500 x 1.21 = CAD 122,815. As may be obvious, this amount is below the investor's original investment amount of CAD 129,000.
