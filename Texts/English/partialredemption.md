# Partial Redemption
## What Is Partial Redemption?

A partial redemption is the retirement or payment of a portion of a [callable](/callablebond) (or redeemable) security before its maturity date. Call (or [prepayment](/prepayment)) provisions oversee how early redemptions, whether whole or partial, are taken care of. Issues might use a [redemption schedule](/mandatory-redemption-schedule) that explains the partial redemption after some time, which can be found in the prospectus.

## Partial Redemption Explained

Callable bonds are regular of corporate and municipal issuers who wish to have the option to pay off their debt on the off chance that interest rates drop below the rates on their outstanding bonds. Recovering the bonds and giving new bonds at lower rates will get a good deal on interest expenses. In exchange for the possibility that the bond could move called away, the bond investor will receive a somewhat higher interest rate compared to a comparative [non-callable](/noncallable) bond.

At the point when an issuer calls its bonds, investors receive the call price and any accrued interest to date. The bonds are frequently called at [par value](/parvalue), yet once in a while they are called at a premium to par. The call premium is one more form of compensation to the investor who presently must reinvest in a lower interest rate environment.

A few issues have mandatory redemption schedules, which are valuable for overseeing cash flows for investors of callable securities. A few types of mandatory redemptions happen either on a scheduled basis, or when a predefined amount of money is accessible in the [sinking fund](/sinkingfund). The sinking fund is the annual reserve wherein an issuer is required to set aside periodic installments that will be utilized to pay the costs of calling bonds as per the mandatory redemption schedule in the bond contract or to purchase bonds in the [open market](/open-market). A mandatory redemption schedule might require the issuer to recover 70% of bonds a decade from the issue date, for instance.

## Partial Redemption Process

As a general rule, bond investors need to keep their higher-yielding bonds when interest rates decline. At the point when their bonds are called, they hope to be dealt with fairly and not singled out to surrender them. As per [Financial Industry Regulatory Authority](/finra) (FINRA) Rule 4340, a financial institution that controls callable bonds for clients must lay out and make accessible on its website procedures by which it will dispense among its customers, on a fair and impartial basis, the securities to be reclaimed or chosen as called in the event of a partial redemption.

Moreover, in the event that the redemption is good (call price over the current price of the bond), no affiliated party of the financial institution can be remembered for the allocation pool until every one of clients' positions have been fulfilled. Assuming the redemption is unfavorable, no affiliated party can be excluded from the pool. However not ordered by FINRA, a lottery cycle is the preferred method for allocation, as it is viewed as fair and impartial.

## Features
- Dissimilar to a whole redemption, the partial redemption recovers just a certain proportion of the issue at a time.
- A partial redemption includes recovering (calling in) some amount of issue before it develops.
- Redemption schedules can inform investors the threshold or triggers that will make the issuer call in a portion of an issue.
