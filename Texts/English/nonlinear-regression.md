# Nonlinear Regression

Nonlinear regression is a form of regression analysis where data is fit to a model and afterward communicated as a mathematical function. Simple linear [regression](/regression) relates two variables (X and Y) with a straight line (y = mx + b), while nonlinear regression relates the two variables in a nonlinear (curved) relationship.

The goal of the model is to make the [sum of the squares](/sum-of-squares) as small as could be expected. The sum of squares is a measure that tracks how far the Y perceptions fluctuate from the nonlinear (curved) function that is utilized to foresee Y.

It is processed by first finding the difference between the fitted nonlinear function and each Y point of data in the set. Then, at that point, every one of those differences is squared. In conclusion, the squared figures are all additional together. The smaller the sum of these squared figures, the better the function fits the data points in the set. Nonlinear regression utilizes logarithmic functions, mathematical functions, exponential functions, power functions, Lorenz curves, Gaussian functions, and other fitting methods.

Nonlinear regression modeling is like linear regression modeling in that both look to graphically follow a specific response from a set of variables. Nonlinear models are more confounded than linear models to create on the grounds that the function is made through a series of approximations (cycles) that might stem from experimentation. Mathematicians utilize several laid out methods, like the Gauss-Newton method and the Levenberg-Marquardt method.

Frequently, regression models that seem nonlinear upon first look are really linear. The curve assessment method can be utilized to recognize the idea of the functional relationships at play in your data, so you can pick the right regression model, whether linear or nonlinear. Linear regression models, while they commonly form a straight line, can likewise form curves, contingent upon the form of the linear regression equation. In like manner, it's feasible to utilize algebra to transform a nonlinear equation so it impersonates a linear equation â€” such a nonlinear equation is alluded to as "naturally linear."

## Illustration of Nonlinear Regression

One illustration of how nonlinear regression can be utilized is to foresee population growth over the long run. A scatterplot of changing population data over the long haul shows that there is by all accounts a relationship among time and population growth, yet that it is a nonlinear relationship, requiring the utilization of a nonlinear regression model. A calculated population growth model can give evaluations of the population to periods that were not measured, and predictions of future population growth.

Independent and dependent variables utilized in nonlinear regression ought to be quantitative. Unmitigated variables, similar to region of residence or religion, ought to be coded as binary variables or different types of quantitative variables.

To acquire accurate outcomes from the nonlinear regression model, you ought to ensure the function you indicate depicts the relationship between the independent and dependent variables accurately. Great starting values are additionally important. Poor starting values might bring about a model that neglects to unite, or a solution that is just optimal locally, as opposed to internationally, even assuming you've determined the right functional form for the model.

## Features
- Nonlinear regression can show a prediction of population growth after some time.
- Nonlinear regression is a curved function of a X variable (or variables) that is utilized to foresee a Y variable
- Both linear and nonlinear regression foresee Y responses from a X variable (or variables).
