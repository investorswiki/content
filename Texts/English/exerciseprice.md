# Exercise Price
## What Is an Exercise Price?

The exercise price is the price at which a [underlying security](/underlying-security) can be purchased or sold while trading a call or put [option](/option), individually. It is additionally alluded to as the strike price and is known when an investor starts the trade.

An option gets its value from the difference between the fixed exercise price and the [market price](/market-price) of the underlying security.

## Understanding Exercise Prices

"Exercise price" is a term utilized in [derivatives](/derivative) trading. A derivative is a financial instrument in view of an underlying asset. Options are derivatives, while the stock, for instance, alludes to the underlying security.

In options trading, there are calls and puts and the exercise price can be [in the money](/inthemoney) (ITM) or [out of the money](/outofthemoney) (OTM). A call option would be ITM on the off chance that the exercise price is below the underlying security's price and OTM assuming the exercise price is over the underlying security's price. The opposite would hold for a put option.

### Calls versus Puts

A [put](/putoption) gives investors the right, yet not the obligation, to sell a stock from now on. Investors buy puts on the off chance that they think the stock is going down or on the other hand assuming they own the stock and need to [hedge](/hedge) against a potential price decline. They buy puts since it permits them to sell the stock at the strike price of the option, even if the stock falls dramatically.

A [call](/calloption), in the mean time, gives investors the right, yet not the obligation, to buy a stock from here on out. Investors buy calls in the event that they think the stock is going up from here on out or on the other hand in the event that they sold the stock [short](/short) and need to hedge against a potential flood in price. Calls give them the right to buy at the strike price even assuming that the stock price revitalizes forcefully.

Typically, put option investors just [exercise](/exercise) their right to sell their shares at the exercise price assuming the price of the underlying is below the [strike price](/strikeprice). Similarly, call options are normally possibly exercised assuming the price of the underlying is trading over the strike price.

## Exercise Price Example

We should expect that Sam claims call options for Wells Fargo and Company with an exercise price of $45, and the underlying stock is trading at $50. This means the call options are trading ITM — the exercise price is lower than the price at which the stock is right now trading — by $5.

The call options give Sam the right to buy the stock at $45 even however it's trading at $50, permitting him to make $5 per share by practicing the option. Sam's profit would be $5 less the [premium](/premium) or cost he paid for the option.

If, then again, Wells Fargo is trading at $50, and the strike price of Sam's call option is $55, that option is OTM. It wouldn't be beneficial for Sam to exercise that option since there is compelling reason need to pay $55 (utilizing the option) when he can at present buy the stock for $50.

The further OTM an option moves, the less important it gets. It just has [extrinsic value](/extrinsicvalue), or value in view of the possibility that the price of the underlying **could** travel through the strike price. In the mean time, the further ITM an option is, the more value it has, giving Sam a better price than what is accessible in the stock market — or another underlying market.
