# Thrift Associations
## What Are Thrifts?

Even however they're not generally so common as they used to be, thrifts, or savings and loan associations, actually play an important part in many consumers' lives. Thrifts likewise allude to [credit unions](/creditunion) and [mutual savings banks](/mutual-savings-bank) that give various savings and loan services. Thrifts vary from commercial banks in that they can borrow money from the [Federal Home Loan Bank System](/fhlb), which permits them to pay members higher interest.

## Grasping Thrifts

Thrifts, alongside commercial banks and credit unions, qualify as [depository institutions](/depository). A great many people are know all about commercial banks and credit unions, however the line becomes fuzzy while characterizing a thrift. Thrifts are basically savings and loan associations that assist members' savings with developing at a higher interest rate. All the more importantly, they are savings banks that have practical experience in [real estate](/realestate).

Originally, thrifts just offered [savings accounts](/savingsaccount) and [time deposits](/timedeposit), however throughout recent years, the banks' scope of services has expanded to address the issues of the average consumer. They currently offer similar products as credit unions and commercial banks.

## Commercial Banks versus Thrifts

Commercial banks, as most corporations, are in it for the profit. They have no specific order in terms of [asset class](/assetclasses). Shareholders own these organizations, and, as most corporations, the goal is to develop earnings. The scope of powers given to commercial banks not set in stone by state and federal law, as both issue bank charters.

[Corporate charters](/corporatecharter), and the powers allowed to banks under state and federal law, decide the scope of the banks' activities. Commercial banks receive deposit insurance from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) and are under the [Federal Reserve System](/federalreservesystem). Moreover, what commercial banks lose in terms of member savings they gain in comfort; with huge number of branches cross country, you will not experience difficulty finding a neighborhood office in the event that you run into an emergency while voyaging.

Paradoxically, thrifts have practical experience in mortgages and real estate lending. The principal command is to the members of the thrift, not profit. Like commercial banks, thrifts might be chartered by either the [Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC)](/office-comptroller-currency-occ) or by the state. The FDIC likewise guarantees them. Thrifts will generally hold their loan portfolio as opposed to securitize loans so members with abnormal profiles that don't squeeze into agency mortgage standards might have a better potential for success of getting a loan through a nearby thrift than a national [commercial bank](/commercialbank).

## Qualified Thrift Lender

Because of their charter, thrifts are ordered to zero in on lodging related assets and must be members of the Federal Home Loan Bank System. Originally, thrifts were required to have no less than 65% of their portfolio in lodging related assets; this threshold was alluded to as the qualified thrift lender (QTL) test as it was a measure of adherence to the original charter.

One benefit to finishing the QTL assessment is that thrifts likewise get to borrow from the Federal Home Loan Bank System, which converts into higher interest for depositors compared to commercial banks.
