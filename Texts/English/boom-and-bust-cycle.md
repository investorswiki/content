# Boom And Bust Cycle
## What Is the Boom and Bust Cycle?

The boom and bust cycle is a course of economic expansion and [contraction](/contraction) that happens more than once. The [boom](/boom) and [bust](/bust) cycle is a key characteristic of capitalist economies and is at times inseparable from the [business cycle](/businesscycle).

During the boom the economy develops, occupations are copious and the market carries high returns to investors. In the subsequent bust the economy recoils, individuals lose their positions and investors lose money. Boom-bust cycles last for changing timeframes; they likewise shift in seriousness.

## Grasping the Boom and Bust Cycle

Since the mid-1940s, the United States has encountered several boom and bust cycles. For what reason do we have a boom and bust cycle rather than a long, consistent [economic growth](/economicgrowth) period? The response can be found in the manner central banks handle the [money supply](/moneysupply).

During a boom, a [central bank](/centralbank) makes it simpler to get credit by lending money at low interest rates. People and businesses can then borrow money effectively and efficiently and invest it in, say, technology stocks or houses. Many individuals earn high returns on their investments, and the economy develops.

The problem is that when credit is too simple to acquire and [interest](/interest) rates are too low, individuals will overinvest. This excess investment is called "malinvestment." There won't be sufficient demand for, say, every one of the homes that have been constructed, and the bust cycle will set in. Things that have been overinvested in will decline in value. Investors lose money, consumers cut spending and companies cut positions. Credit turns out to be more hard to acquire as boom-time borrowers become unfit to make their loan payments. The bust periods are alluded to as recessions; if the [recession](/recession) is especially extreme, it is called a depression.

## Extra Factors in Boom and Bust Cycles

Falling confidence likewise adds to the bust cycle. Investors and consumers get nervous when the stock market rectifies or even an accidents. Investors sell their positions, and buy place of refuge investments that customarily don't lose value, like bonds, gold, and the U.S. dollar. As companies lay off workers, consumers lose their positions and stop buying everything except necessities. That compounds the a descending economic spiral.

The bust cycle eventually stops all alone. That happens when prices are low to such an extent that those investors that actually have cash begin buying once more. This can consume a large chunk of the day, and even lead to a depression. Confidence can be reestablished all the more rapidly by central bank [monetary policy](/monetarypolicy) and government financial policy.

Government sponsorships that make it more affordable to invest may likewise add to the boom-bust cycle by empowering companies and people to overinvest in the financed thing. For instance, the [mortgage interest](/mortgageinterest) [tax deduction](/tax-deduction) finances a home purchase by making the mortgage interest more affordable. The subsidy urges more individuals to buy homes.
