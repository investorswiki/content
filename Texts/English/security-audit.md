# Security Audit
A security audit comprises of a systematic analysis of an application, system, or database to assess how strong and safe it is. With regards to blockchains, security audits comprise of a peer survey of a smart contract or blockchain code to recognize expected bugs or blemishes.
Taking into account the traditional definition, a security audit researches processes as per a predetermined guideline or corresponding to a standard, like the Common Criteria for IT Security Evaluation. Many companies perform security audits as a method for guaranteeing that their systems are strong enough against likely breaks, interruptions, or cyberattacks.
Other than that, security audits are vital in determining regulatory compliance since they clarify how a company or institution is dealing with and protecting sensitive data. The audits may likewise look at physical access to the company's facilities and data systems, as well as the preventive strategies in place against possible assaults.
Security audits might be viewed as one of the three fundamental types of security diagnostics methods, alongside weakness assessments, and penetration tests (also known as. pen test). In any case, full security audits will frequently incorporate pen tests and weakness assessments, so the term definition might change depending on the unique situation.
As referenced, a security audit typically assesses the safety of a data system corresponding to a rundown of criteria. Conversely, a weakness assessment depends on a broad analysis of the whole system to distinguish security provisos at last. As such, security audits are more specific, centered around a specific niche, and weakness assessments are more generalistic. Ultimately, we have penetration tests, which comprise of reenacted assaults as a method for testing both the shortcomings and qualities of a system. Now and again, white-cap programmers are employed just to perform these authorized cyberattacks. A few companies likewise offer rewards by means of Bug Bounty programs.
Preferably, security audits ought to be carried out no less than one time each year, to guarantee that the defense systems are cutting-edge against the latest dangers.
