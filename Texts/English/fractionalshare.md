## What Is a Fractional Share?

Short of what one full share of [equity](/equity) is called a fractional share. Such shares might be the consequence of stock splits, dividend reinvestment plans (DRIPs), or comparative corporate activities. Commonly, fractional shares aren't accessible from the stock market, and keeping in mind that they have value to investors, they are likewise challenging to sell.

## Figuring out a Fractional Share

Fractional shares occur in a number of ways, including dividend reinvestment plans, stock splits, mergers, and acquisitions.

### Dividend Reinvestment Plans

[Dividend reinvestment plans](/dividendreinvestmentplan) (DRIP) frequently make fractional shares. A dividend reinvestment plan is a plan where a dividend-offering corporation or brokerage firm permits investors to utilize dividend [payouts](/payout) to purchase business as usual shares. As this amount "drips" once again into the purchase of additional shares, it isn't limited to whole shares. Reinvesting capital gain distributions and dollar-cost averaging programs can likewise bring about purchasing fractional shares.

### Stock Splits

[Stock splits](/stocksplit) don't necessarily bring about an even number of shares. A 3-for-2 stock split would make three shares for each two shares an investor possesses, so an investor with an odd number of shares would wind up with a fractional share after the split. Three shares would become 4\u00bd, five would become 7\u00bd, etc.

### Mergers and Acquisitions

Some brokerage firms will split whole shares intentionally so they can sell fractional shares to clients. This division of shares is most frequently the case with high-priced stocks like Amazon (AMZN) or Alphabet, Google's parent company (GOOGL). As of March 2020, AMZN was selling for more than $1,800 per share, and GOOGL was selling for more than $1,100 per share. Fractional shares frequently can be the main way individual investors can buy stock in

such companies.

For instance, a youthful investor with limited funds could have their heart set on buying stock in Amazon. Starting with $1,000 to invest, they will not have to the point of buying a full share of stock, so they could find a brokerage firm ready to sell a fractional share. They could invest half of the money in one-third of a share of Amazon and utilize the other half to invest in lower-priced stocks that would permit them to buy full shares.

An investor could have 225 shares of XYZ stock priced at $12 per share. After a 3-for-2 stock split, they would wind up with 337\u00bd shares priced at $8 per share. On the off chance that there is a high demand for XYZ stock in the market, they'll be bound to find a brokerage firm ready to take the fractional share.
