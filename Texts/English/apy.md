# Annual Percentage Yield (APY)
## What is APY (annual percentage yield)?
APY, an ordinarily involved abbreviation for annual percentage yield, is the rate earned on a [investment ](/investing)in a year, considering the effects of compounding interest. APY is calculated utilizing this formula: APY= (1 + r/n )^n^ - 1, where "r" is the stated annual interest rate and "n" is the number of compounding periods every year. APY is likewise now and again called the effective annual rate, or EAR.
## More profound definition
At the point when the APY is equivalent to the interest rate that is being paid on an individual's investment, he is earning simple interest. At the point when the APY is higher than the interest rate, nonetheless, the interest is being compounded, and that means he is earning interest on his accumulating interest.
Individuals in some cases mistake APY for APR. APR alludes to the annual interest rate without considering compounding interest. APY, then again, considers the effects of compounding soon. The difference between the two can have important ramifications for borrowers and investors.
At the point when banks or other financial institutions are searching for clients for interest-bearing investments, for example, money market accounts and certificates of deposit, it is to their greatest advantage to advance their best APY, not their APR. APY is higher than APR, so it seems to be a better investment for the client.
The more continuous the compounding periods, the higher the APY. Subsequently, individuals who set aside cash in their bank accounts ought to check how frequently the money is compounded. Regularly, daily or quarterly is better than annual compounding, yet make a point to check the quoted APY for every option in advance.
## APY model
On the off chance that an individual deposits $1,000 into a savings account that pays 5 percent interest annually, he will make $1,050 toward the finish of year.
Notwithstanding, the bank might compute and pay interest consistently, in which case he would end the year with $1,051.16. In the last option case, he would have earned an APY of in excess of 5 percent. The difference may not be colossal, yet following several years (or with bigger deposits), the difference is critical. In this model, APY is calculated this way:
Annual percentage yield = (1+0.5/12)^12-1= 5.116 percent
APY can show investors precisely how much interest they will earn. With this data, they can compare options. They will actually want to conclude which bank is the best, and whether they need to go for a higher rate.

## Features
- Compound interest is added periodically to the total invested, expanding the balance. That means each interest payment will be bigger, in view of the higher balance.
- APY is the genuine rate of return that will be earned in one year assuming the interest is compounded.
- The more frequently interest is compounded, the higher the rate will be.
## FAQ
### How Is APY Calculated?
APY normalizes the rate of return. It does this by expressing the real percentage of growth that will be earned in compound interest expecting that the money is deposited for one year. The formula for computing APY is: (1+r/n)n - 1, where r = period rate and n = number of compounding periods.
### How Might APY Assist an Investor?
Any investment is at last decided by its rate of return, whether it's a certificate of deposit, a share of stock, or a government bond. APY permits an investor to compare various returns for various investments on consistent basis, permitting them to go with a more educated choice.
### What Is the Difference Between APY and APR?
APY computes that rate earned in one year assuming the interest is compounded and is a more accurate representation of the genuine rate of return. APR incorporates any fees or extra costs associated with the transaction, however it doesn't consider the compounding of interest inside a specific year. Rather, it is a simple interest rate.
