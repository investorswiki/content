# Loan Constant
## What Is a Loan Constant?

A loan consistent is a percentage that shows the annual [debt service](/debtservice) on a loan compared to its total principal value. The calculation for a loan steady is the annual debt service separated by the total loan amount. While shopping for a loan, borrowers can compare the loan consistent of different loans before going with a choice. The loan with the most reduced loan steady will have lower debt service requirements, meaning the borrower will pay less in interest and principal over a given period. Loan constants are simply applicable to fixed interest rate loans and not [loans with variable interest rates](/variableinterestrate).

## How a Loan Constant Works

A loan consistent is a comparison of a loan's annual debt service to the loan's total [principal value](/principal). A loan's debt service is the total cash the borrower must pay to cover the repayment of interest and principal on the loan for a given period.

The loan steady is communicated as a percentage and can be determined for all [types of loans](/loan). It helps borrowers and analysts to see better the factors engaged with a loan and the amount they are paying annually in comparison to the loan principal.

## Computing a Loan Constant

Computing the loan consistent frequently requires a borrower to get from the lender the various terms associated with the lending deal. Terms incorporate factors like total principal, [loan interest rate](/interestrate), length of payments, and frequency of payments. Getting these loan term factors takes into consideration the calculation of a simple present-value payment to show up at the regularly scheduled payments. When the regularly scheduled payments are distinguished, a borrower can undoubtedly work out their loan steady utilizing the accompanying equation:

Loan Constant = Annual Debt Service/Total Loan Amount

For instance, take a mortgage borrower who has gotten a $150,000 loan. The loan has a [fixed interest rate](/fixedinterestrate) of 6% with a 30-year duration and month to month interest payments. Utilizing a payments calculator, the borrower would compute regularly scheduled payments of $899.33, which brings about an annual debt service of $10,791.96. With this annual debt service, the borrower's loan consistent would be 7.2% or $10,791.96/$150,000.

## Special Considerations

The loan consistent, when duplicated by the original loan principal, gives the dollar amount of the annual periodic payments. The loan consistent can be utilized to compare the true cost of borrowing. Loan constants are just accessible for loans with fixed interest rates since variable interest rates have varying annual debt service levels in light of variable interest. Given the decision of two loans, a borrower will generally opt for the one with the lower loan consistent, since it will have the lower debt service requirement.

## Loan Constant Tables

Loan steady tables were widely utilized in the real estate industry before the appearance of financial calculators since they made it moderately simple to compute month to month mortgage payments. Loan consistent tables give prepopulated data to borrowers about their loan with a quoted loan steady level.

On the off chance that the borrower from the model above were given their loan steady, they could find the interest and payment terms from a loan consistent table without different data sources. The borrower would just have to distinguish 7.2% in the table. From that point, they would find the relating interest rate of 6% on the horizontal pivot. On the vertical hub, the number of payments in months would likewise be given at 360.
