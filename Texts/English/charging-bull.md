# Charging Bull Sculpture
## What Is the Charging Bull?

**The Charging Bull** is the official title of the famous bronze sculpture depicting a bull raising its horns, made by artist Arturo Di Modica that is situated at Bowling Green, close to [Wall Street](/wallstreet) in Downtown Manhattan. The 7,100 lb charging bull, a powerful moral story of "[bullish](/bullmarket)" market confidence, has turned into the de facto symbol of Wall Street and the Financial District, and has turned into a famous vacation spot in New York City.

## History of the Charging Bull

Arturo Di Modica made the charging bull without the contribution of the city, funding the $360,000 project himself in the repercussions of the 1987 market crash. In Dec. 1989, he brought the charging bull to the city and introduced it under the Christmas tree in front of the New York Stock Exchange, as a gift to New York. NYPD momentarily impounded the sculpture, however after the public dissented, the NYC Parks Department officially introduced it in Bowling Green Park seven days after the fact.

The charging bull addresses the mental fortitude and can-do soul of Americans and New Yorkers specifically. In a mixture of foundations and encounters, Arturo Di Modica introduced the bull as a cure to the reasons for the 1987 Wall Street crash: privilege, greed, and excess. He accepted the sculpture's representation of strength and fortitude was a model of integrity.

The artist went through over two years chiseling the now world-popular Charging Bull at his studio in the Soho district of Manhattan (Crosby Street). The piece was so large and aggressive that Arturo needed to project it in separate bronze pieces and afterward weld and hand finish them. In its last state, it weighed north of three and a half tons.

> Different artists have made sculptural statements in a similar location including the **Fearless Girl** sculpture, depicting a little kid standing defiant in front of the bull. It was introduced to pay tribute to International Women's Day in 2017.

## Charging Bull and the 1987 Market Crash

On Oct. 19, 1987, world markets went tumbled down, due to a combination of programming errors and international factors. While the real catalyst for the crash keeps on eluding analysts, complex communications between international currencies and markets contributed. Overall, program traders shouldered the majority of the fault; following the short meltdown several exchanges carried out [circuit breaker](/circuitbreaker) rules, among different precautionary measures, to slow the impact of such anomalies later on.

Similarly as with other financial crisis situations, (for example, in 2008), a few warning indications of excesses preceded the [inflection point](/inflectionpoint) in 1987. Economic growth had started to slow and inflation was raising its head. A strong U.S. dollar was forcing exports, and [valuations](/valuation) were moving to extremely high levels. While market participants knew about these issues, many disregarded the warning signs and kept on facing aggressive challenges.
