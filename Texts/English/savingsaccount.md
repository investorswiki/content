# Savings Account
## What is a savings account?
A savings account is a fundamental type of financial product that allows you to deposit your money and ordinarily earn an unassuming amount of interest. These accounts are federally insured up to $250,000 per account owner and offer a safe place to put your money while earning interest.
You can find savings accounts at banks and credit unions. You needn't bother with a large amount of money to open a savings account, and you likewise have simple access to your money.
## Why you really want a savings account
A savings account is a decent place to keep money for a later date, separate from ordinary spending cash, in light of their safety, dependability and liquidity. These accounts are a great place for your emergency fund or savings for shorter-term goals, similar to a vacation or home repair.
Past quick access to your cash when you want it, savings accounts frequently offer higher interest rates than checking accounts. You could even discover a few savings accounts with a higher APY than money market accounts. The average APY on savings accounts is just 0.06 percent, however you can find high-yield savings accounts paying around 0.6 percent.
At last, there are numerous opportunities to open a savings account with low fees. You can frequently track down simple options to avoid bothersome maintenance fees.
## How does a savings account work?
You will open a savings account at a bank or credit union, either online or in person. The interaction is like opening a checking account. You will provide the institution with personal data and then, at that point, deposit money into the account.
Whenever you've set aside an installment, the money in your savings account will start to earn interest. The amount you earn will rely upon a couple of factors, including your savings account APY, the amount of money you deposit and how long you keep money in your account.
Your bank might decide to compound interest on a daily, month to month, quarterly or yearly basis. Toward the finish of each compounding period, your accrued interest is deposited into your account. From that point, your new account balance (deposits plus interest) will start earning interest.
For instance, let's say that you set aside an initial installment of $10,000, and your bank compounds interest annually. With a 0.06 percent APY, you'd earn about $6 in interest for the year. In any case, with a high-yield savings account APY of 0.6 percent, you'd make about $60 for the year. Then, your new balance (either $10,006 or $10,060) would begin to earn interest. On the off chance that you have a shorter compounding period, your money will develop even quicker.
Your savings account APY is variable and can change whenever. You can move money out of the account at whatever point you need, however Regulation D limits the amount of times you can do as such to six every month.
## What amount would it be advisable for you to keep in your savings accounts?
The amount of money you ought to keep in a savings account largely relies upon your goal. Assuming that you're involving it as an emergency fund, most financial advisors recommend that you keep three to a half year's worth of everyday costs in your account.
For instance, in the event that you spend an average of $3,000 each month on costs, for example, your mortgage, vehicle payment and food, you would save somewhere in the range of $9,000 to $18,000 in the account.
On the off chance that you're saving for a specific goal — like a vacation, buying a house or purchasing a vehicle — you would keep sufficient in the account to pay for that expense.
## Might you at any point lose money in a savings account?
You won't ever lose the money you have saved — up to the FDIC insurance limit of $250,000 per account owner at FDIC-insured banks. Yet, the money in your savings account can lose purchasing power after some time. For instance, on the off chance that somebody earns 0.2 percent APY on their savings account and inflation is at a 2 percent annual rate, they'd face a 1.8 percent decline in purchasing power north of a year.
Track down the right balance of cash to store in your savings account. You need to keep sufficient on hand to deal with any crises. In any case, you would rather not get out of hand and pass up the opportunity to develop your investments over the long term.
