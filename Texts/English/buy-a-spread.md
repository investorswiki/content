All varieties have a buy and a sell order and the spread can be initiated with by the same token.

In every one of these cases the trader buys one in or close to the money option and sells a farther of-the-money option, which makes a net debit in the account. Maximum profit is typically accomplished on the off chance that the underlying asset closes at the strike of the farthest out-of-the-money option.

## Advantage of a Buying Spreads

The fundamental advantage of long spreads is that the net risk of the trade is decreased. Selling the less expensive options helps offset the cost of purchasing the more costly option.
