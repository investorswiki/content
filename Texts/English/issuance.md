# Issuance
The essential definition of issuance is to make something and make it accessible. Yet, in the crypto space, issuance alludes to the generation of new cryptocurrency tokens or coins and this cycle can happen in a wide range of ways, as per the boundaries determined by the makers of the project.
On account of Bitcoin, the issuance is finished through a cycle called mining, where mining hubs invest a great deal of resources to approve new blocks of transactions and afterward create brand new Bitcoins as a reward for their work. While Bitcoin issuance is dependent on mining and on the Proof of Work consensus algorithm, there are some other cryptocurrencies that are not mineable and, in this manner, have an alternate form of issuance (for instance, a steady issuance after some time or a pre-mine generation of coins).
At times, the cryptocurrencies are offered to investors as tokens through Initial Coin Offering sales, right in the wake of being produced by a startup or company. The issuance of the tokens is defined by a [smart contract](/smart-contract) that decides ahead of time what will be the max supply and initial total supply of that specific token. Investors then might decide to take part or not in the sale in view of the token economics introduced by the project.
