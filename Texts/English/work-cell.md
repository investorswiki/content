# Work Cell
## What Is a Work Cell?

A work cell is a coherent and strategic arrangement of resources in a business environment. These arrangements are put into place to sort out and further develop process flow, increase proficiency, reduce costs, and eliminate wastage.

The concept of work cells depends on the platform of [lean manufacturing](/lean-venture), which centers around value creation for the end customer and reduction of wastage. Work cells, which are additionally alluded to as **workcells,** are ordinarily found in manufacturing and office environments.

## Understanding Work Cells

A work cell is generally set up in order to complete a specific activity, most frequently in the manufacturing industry. It is the grouping of machines, individuals, and other equipment companies use in their [manufacturing production](/manufacturing-production) process. These cells are frequently carried out to reduce the costs associated with production and increase productivity. Many companies likewise essentially reduce the rate of mistake by putting work cells into place.

In a manufacturing facility, the machines involved in the production cycle would be set up so the goods being created move without a hitch and consistently starting with one stage then onto the next. This would possibly be conceivable assuming the machines are grouped in work cells that work with the legitimate movement of the goods being created â€” from [raw materials](/rawmaterials) toward one side to finished product at the other.

Work cells may likewise be found in the office or administrative departments. In this specific circumstance, work cells might work with a better flow of communication and more efficient utilization of shared resources.

## Cellular Manufacturing

Cellular manufacturing is a manufacturing cycle which is a subsection of [just-in-time](/jit) manufacturing and lean manufacturing encompassing group technology. The goal of cellular manufacturing is to move as quickly as could be expected, making a wide assortment of comparable products, while producing as minimal waste as could be expected.

Cellular manufacturing involves the utilization of different cells in an assembly line fashion. A cell is made by consolidating the processes required to make a specific output, like a part or a set of instructions. These cells consider the reduction of superfluous strides during the time spent creating the specific output, work with quick identification of issues, and empower communication of employees within the cell in order to determine issues that emerge quickly.

## Illustration of a Work Cell

Suppose a firm that collects air-handling products faces high inventories and sporadic delivery. It originally collected units on a traditional production line. Long setups and [logistics](/logistics) required long production runs. It frequently found that it needed to pull products from finished goods and modify them for custom orders.

Using a lean methodology, the company gathers cells to include twelve small (one to three-man) assembly work cells that were constantly set up and ready. Individuals presently work in various cells every day and collect products per customer orders. Finished goods inventory dropped by 96%, lead-time was 24 hours, and [productivity](/productivity) worked on by as much as 30%.

- Work cells depend on the platform of lean manufacturing, which centers around value creation for the end customer and reduction of wastage.
- In the office or administrative setting, work cells might work with a better flow of communication and more efficient utilization of shared resources.
