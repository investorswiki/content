# Forward Margin
## What Is Forward Margin?

The forward margin, or [forward spread](/forward-spread), mirrors the difference between the [spot rate](/spot_rate) and the forward rate for a certain commodity or currency. The difference between the two rates can either be a [premium](/premium) or a [discount](/discount), in the event that assuming the forward rate is above or below the spot rate, separately.

## Figuring out Forward Margin

The forward margin is an important concept in understanding the working of forwards markets, which are [over-the-counter](/otc) (OTC) marketplaces that set the price of a [financial instrument](/financialinstrument) or asset for future delivery. [Forward markets](/forwardmarket) are utilized for trading a scope of instruments, including the [foreign exchange market](/foreign-exchange-markets), securities and interest rates markets, and [commodities](/commodity).

The forward margin provides traders with a few indication of supply and demand over season of the underlying asset that the forward depends on. The more extensive the spread, the more important the underlying asset is perceived to be from here on out. In the mean time, the smaller margins demonstrate that the underlying asset is probably going to be more important now than later on. The forward margin is much of the time estimated in basis points, known as [forward points](/forwardpoints), and in the event that you add or take away the forward margin to the spot rate, you would get the [forward rate](/forwardrate).

Narrow, or even negative margins, could result from short-term shortages, either real or perceived, in the underlying asset. With [currency forwards](/currencyforward), negative margins (called [discount spreads](/discount-spread)) happen every now and again in light of the fact that currencies have interest rates appended to them which will influence their future value.

There is likewise an element of [carrying cost](/carrying-costs). Claiming the asset currently proposes that there are costs associated with keeping it. For commodities, that can be storage, insurance, and financing. For financial instruments, it very well may be financing and the [opportunity costs](/opportunitycost) of getting into a future commitment.

Carrying costs might change over time. While storage costs in a warehouse might increase, interest rates to finance the underlying might increase or diminish. In other words, traders must monitor these costs over opportunity to be certain their holdings are priced appropriately.

Keep in mind, the spot rate, likewise called **spot price,** is the price quoted for immediate settlement on a commodity, security or a currency. It is the market value of an asset at the moment of the quote. Because of continually fluctuating demand, spot rates change habitually and now and then decisively.
