# Detainee's Dilemma
Detainee's dilemma is an illustration of a situation where individual decision-creators, acting to their greatest advantage, produce a suboptimal result for the individuals collectively. It is quite possibly of the most notable model in game theory.
The normalized illustration of detainee's dilemma, initially proposed by mathematicians Merrill Flood and Melvin Dresher, and afterward formalized by Albert W. Exhaust, presents the accompanying situation:
- Two members of a group of thugs are captured and questioned in separate rooms. There could be no different observers accessible, and the specialists just have adequate evidence to convict one of the detainees, yet provided that the other detainee affirms against them.
- The specialists offer every detainee a bargain. They can deceive the other detainee by affirming that the other detainee committed the crime, or they can help out the other detainee by staying silent.

This scenario can lead to **three conceivable outcomes:**
- If **both of them remain silent**, both **serve one year each**.
- If **both of them betray** the other, both **serve two years each**.
- If **one sells out the other**, however the **other remains silent**, the **prisoner who affirmed is set free**, and the **prisoner who stayed silent serves three years**.

Deceiving the other detainee offers a greater reward than helping out them, so it tends to be assumed that all simply rational detainees will double-cross the other, bringing about the main conceivable outcome being the two detainees selling out one another.
Seeking after individual reward consistently ought to lead to a better outcome; but in a detainee's dilemma, chasing after individual reward leads to a more terrible individual outcome.
Detainee's dilemmas happen in numerous parts of the economy, however various solutions have been proposed and executed over the long run that leans toward the common great over individual incentives.
For instance, in real-world situations, most connections are rehashed at least a time or two. In the event that a detainee's dilemma happens at least a couple of times, it very well may be alluded to as an iterated detainee's dilemma. In such a situation, the individual entertainers can execute strategies that reward cooperation over the long haul.
Another solution is formal, institutional strategies that adjust the incentives that individual decision-creators might possibly face. By having a comprehension of the collective objectives and the ability to uphold cooperative behavior through different sets of rules, detainee's dilemmas can be guided towards the more collectively beneficial outcome.
