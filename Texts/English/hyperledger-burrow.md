# Hyperledger Burrow
## What Is Hyperledger Burrow?

Hyperledger Burrow is a structure for executing smart contracts in permissioned blockchains. It is presently being incubated as part of Hyperledger, a community of open-source projects and tools for commercial implementations of blockchain technology. The goal of Hyperledger Burrow is to work with cross-industry applications for smart contracts.

## Grasping Hyperledger Burrow

Following the outcome of [Bitcoin](/bitcoin), numerous blockchain advocates recognized the capability of utilizing distributed ledgers to record [smart contracts](/smart-contracts), self-executing programs that can operate without human management. Notwithstanding, existing networks, for example, Bitcoin or Ethereum were too limited for business applications, due to the high cost and latency of open blockchains.

To work with more versatile blockchains, the Linux Foundation sent off the Hyperledger community in 2015. Numerous industry leaders joined the initiative to foster undertaking grade blockchain tools, including IBM, Intel, and Microsoft.

Burrow is one of the projects under the Hyperledger umbrella, alongside other endeavor arranged platforms like [Hyperledger Fabric](/hyperledger-fabric), [Hyperledger Sawtooth](/hyperledger-sawtooth), and [Hyperledger Iroha](/hyperledger-iroha). Initially called ErisDB, the project was planned by Monax, an open platform to build, ship, and run blockchain-based applications for [business ecosystems](/business-ecosystem). Processor and chipmaker, Intel, has additionally co-supported the project, which was accepted to the Hyperledger Incubator in April of 2017. The 2021 Q2 Hyperledger Burrow update recommends that it is showing improvement over ever before and that a logistics platform is being based on top of Burrow.

## How Hyperledger Burrow Works

Hyperledger Burrow is a software that can be utilized to run hubs in a permissioned blockchain network. Since the participants in permissioned blockchains are known and believed by the remainder of the network, accomplishing higher speeds and throughput than permissionless chains is conceivable.

Not at all like proof-of-work blockchains like [Ethereum](/ethereum), Hyperledger Burrow utilizes a Byzantine Fault-Tolerant consensus algorithm to lay out transaction finality. There are no mining or transaction costs, and it can execute smart contracts at a lot greater scale than open blockchains.

While it is like numerous other Hyperledger blockchain tools, the concentration for Hyperledger Burrow is to give a "spotless and straightforward" engineer experience, as indicated by the Hyperledger Wiki. The key part of Hyperledger Burrow is a permissioned implementation of the Ethereum Virtual Machine, which permits it to collaborate with smart contracts on other Ethereum-based networks.

## Plans of Hyperledger Burrow

Despite the fact that it is still in the brooding stage, engineers of Hyperledger Burrow accept that the project can assist with connecting the universes of private and public blockchains. It is closely associated with the Cosmos Network, a network of interoperable blockchains that utilization a comparable BFT consensus model.

Hyperledger Burrow can likewise communicate with the Ethereum public chain, since they share a similar smart contract language. Burrow's designers plan to present a two-way peg system with the Ethereum mainnet, permitting data and tokens to move flawlessly between chains. This would permit Hyperledger Burrow to operate as a high-speed "sidechain" to the public network. As Ethereum changes to a proof-of-stake model, they will likewise coordinate support for public staking.

## Highlights
- Hyperledger Burrow was imagined as ErisDB by Monax in 2014. It is currently part of the Hyperledger family of blockchain projects.
- Hyperledger Burrow is worked around a Byzantine Fault Tolerant consensus algorithm. There are no mining or transaction fees, permitting blockchains to scale up for commercial applications.
- Hyperledger Burrow is a system that can be utilized to execute smart contracts in [permissioned blockchains](/blockchain).
