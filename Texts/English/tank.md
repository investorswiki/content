# Tank
The shoptalk word "tank" is a term that was adopted from the traditional financial markets and depicts a strong negative financial performance of a specific asset. Accordingly, an asset is supposed to be "tanking" when its price is falling quickly. The term tank may likewise be utilized to allude to a specific industry or company that isn't performing great.
One more common utilization of the word, particularly in traditional markets, is that an asset or portfolio is viewed as "in the tank" in the event that its financial performance over a more extended period of time is declining fundamentally in value.
The maxim "tanking" is much of the time utilized as something contrary to "energizing" - basically the same as how the terms "dumping" and "pumping" are utilized. An asset is energizing (or pumping) when it encounters a fast short-term increase in value, while a tanking (or dumping) alludes to the contrary when market prices present a sharp and quick decline.
One more related term to tanking is "bleeding", which likewise alludes to a decline in market prices. Nonetheless, bleeding frequently portrays a more slow drop that happens on a delayed period, as opposed to a quick and sharp one.
