## How Judicial Foreclosure Works

By and large, the debtor then has 30 days to fix the default, and in the event that they are not able to, the servicer will push ahead with foreclosure procedures.

The dispossessing party next files a lawsuit in the region where the property is found and demands the court to permit the home to be sold to pay the debt. As part of the lawsuit, the dispossessing party incorporates a petition for foreclosure that makes sense of why a judge ought to issue a foreclosure judgment. Much of the time, the court will do as such, except if the borrower has a defense that legitimizes the delinquent payments.

Contingent upon the state, the dispossessing party may likewise be qualified for a [deficiency judgment](/deficiency-judgment). A deficiency judgment permits the house to be sold at a foreclosure sale for not exactly the outstanding mortgage debt. The difference between the debt and the foreclosure sale price is the deficiency. In many states, the dispossessing party can get a personal judgment against the borrower for the deficiency.
