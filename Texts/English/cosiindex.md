# Cost of Savings Index (COSI)
## What Is the Cost of Savings Index (COSI)?

The Cost of Savings Index (COSI) is a famous index utilized for working out the interest rate of certain [adjustable-rate mortgages (ARMs)](/arm). Formally known as the Wells Fargo Cost of Savings Index, it depends on the interest rates that Wells Fargo Bank pays to people on [certificates of deposit (CDs)](/certificateofdeposit).

Like different ARMs, COSI-connected loans transfer part of the risk from the lender to the borrower. While the early on rates are more good than the terms for [fixed-rate](/fixed-rate-payment) loans, changing interest rates can mean that a few customers might wind up paying more money than they would have paid in any case. Now and again, they might even wind up venturing further into the red.

## Figuring out the COSI

The COSI is viewed as among the most stable ARM indexes in the industry. By and large, it is less unstable than other famous benchmarks, like the one-month [London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) index](/libor). As CD interest rates move more slowly than market interest rates by and large, the COSI additionally will in general lag behind other [mortgage](/home-mortgage) indexes with regards to adjusting to changes in interest rates.

The COSI is calculated consistently and used to decide the interest rate on ARMs. The interest rate that mortgage-holders need to pay is the sum of the index value plus an extra amount called the [ARM margin](/armmargin).

> ### History of COSI
> The COSI was initially distributed by World Savings Bank, a subsidiary of Golden West Financial Corp. Thus, it was usually alluded to as the GDW COSI or World Savings COSI. In 2006, Wachovia Corp. acquired Golden West, and the index turned into the Wachovia COSI. In 2009, Wachovia turned out to be part of Wells Fargo, and in November of that year, the index turned into the Wells Fargo Cost of Savings Index or Wells COSI.

## Advantages and disadvantages of COSI-Indexed Mortgages

Loans with a COSI-connected interest rate might offer captivating flexibility and payment options compared to different mortgages. ARMs can be fundamentally less expensive than fixed-rate mortgages, essentially during the initial not many years, when the basic rates are low. Numerous COSI-indexed ARMs have least payment change covers — which limit the amount that the regularly scheduled payment can increment — as well as lifetime [interest rate caps](/capstructure).

Since the COSI is steadier than different indexes, ARMs tied to this index benefit mortgage-holders when rates are rising. They're less advantageous when rates are falling.

On the downside, COSI-indexed mortgages tend not to offer periodic interest rate covers, which limit how much the interest rate can rise at one time. This makes the possibility for [negative amortization](/negativeamortization): If the interest rates rise to the point that the month to month mortgage payment doesn't cover the interest due, any unpaid [interest](/interest) will get added to the loan balance, so the overall amount due on the mortgage increments.
