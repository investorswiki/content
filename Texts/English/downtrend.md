## What Is a Downtrend?

A downtrend is a steady reduction in the price or value of a stock or commodity, or the activity of a financial market. A downtrend can be contrasted with a [uptrend](/uptrend).

## Grasping Downtrends

While the price might move irregularly higher or lower, downtrends are portrayed by lower [peaks](/pinnacle) and lower [troughs](/trough) over the long run. Technical analysts pay regard for downtrends on the grounds that they address more than a random losing streak. Securities in a downtrend appear to be bound to continue trending lower until some market condition changes, suggesting that a downtrend marks a fundamentally decaying condition.

A security that changes from an uptrend to a downtrend rarely rolls out an immediate improvement from one to the next. All things being equal, the price action in an uptrend gives indications of strain and afterward the downtrend gradually starts. Both vertical and descending trends are set apart by their pinnacles and troughs (additionally alluded to as [swing highs](/swinghigh) and [swing lows](/swinglow)), and the overall course they give off an impression of being continuing. The following illustration shows a series of pinnacles and troughs (tops are even-numbered, troughs are odd).

The dynamic displayed in this illustration mirrors all trend changes from vertically to descending. However particulars fluctuate in each occurrence, three qualities of this change are common:

1. The price action falls below the latest trough (displayed in points 1-3)
1. The next top neglects to rise higher than its ancestor (points 3-5)
1. The descending trend improves its probability of continuing (points 5-7)

The principal indication of a downtrend marks a point in the price action where supply surpasses demand. The number of available sellers and the quantity of the security they need to sell is more than the number of ready buyers and the quantity they need to buy. Market participants are directing that the security ought not be priced however high as it seems to be.

The second indication is the rising number of market participants convinced that they must presently not own (or own as quite a bit of) the security. The number of sellers increments at the same time with the number of buyers decreasing.

The third sign is typically accompanied by news or new data that confirms the doubts of the people not entirely settled to exit the market, or who are done considering buying the security. More buyers step back and extra sellers become anxious to take profits or limit losses.

## Trading Downtrend

The majority of equity traders try to keep away from downtrends in light of the fact that they are innately centered around up trends and [trade long](/long) as it were. Downtrends can be found in each trading time period, whether minutes, days, weeks, months, or years. Traders search for ways of recognizing a downtrend as soon as could be expected. A few traders like to trade both long and short, so they recognize downtrends for new trading opportunities.

Traders recognize that once a downtrend has been laid out it is best to tread carefully while going into any new [long positions](/long). This reluctance intensifies the downtrend by contributing to decreased demand. Traders who trade both long and short recognize the inverse, another opportunity to profit from the downtrend.

Short sellers profit from downtrends by borrowing and afterward immediately selling shares with the agreement to repurchase them later on. These are known as short positions or [short selling](/shortselling). Assuming the resource's price continues to decline, the trader profits from the difference between the immediate sale price and the lower future repurchase price. Short sellers add to the price action by entering with sell orders, speeding up the descending trend. Such traders hope to profit from the next low swing, persistently anticipating the trend to continue lower.

Traders frequently use [technical indicators](/technicalindicator) and chart examples to distinguish and confirm downtrends. [Moving averages](/movingaverage) can be utilized to distinguish the overall trend. In the event that the price is lower than a moving average, the stock is probably going to be in a downtrend, and vice versa for an uptrend. Technical indicators, for example, the [relative strength index](/rsi) (RSI) or [Average Directional Index ](/adx) (ADX), can likewise show the extent or strength of the downtrend at a given point, which assists a trader with choosing whether or not to enter a short position.

## Illustration of a Prolonged Downtrend

The extensive downtrend in the General Electric Co. (GE) stock price uncovers that the company's inconveniences were more profound than initially anticipated and that cutbacks, side projects, plant closings, and product undoings were signaling a major change in the economic environment and one for which that GE was not prepared.

In this chart, the stock makes its last pinnacle followed by the next trough moving lower than the previous trough (as displayed in the inset). This lower trough coincides with the moment that the supply of stock that investors need to sell has outnumbered the demand that investors need to buy the stock at the price. This initial indication of weakness, an illustration of the principal sign referenced previously, was not accompanied by insight about the company's inconveniences. Investors had the option to establish that the company's possibilities were on the decline.

The lower pinnacles and troughs that follow show an extended downtrend enduring over two years, when the remainder of the market was generally moving higher. Traders that had taken a [bearish ](/bear)stance on the stock following the [breakdown](/breakdown) from the main trough would have found numerous opportunities for profitable trades. On the other hand, long traders might have locked in their profits toward the beginning of the downtrend and reemerged their long position after the stock gave indications of a [rebound](/rebound).
