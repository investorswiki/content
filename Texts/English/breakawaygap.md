# Breakaway Gap
## What Is a Breakaway Gap?

A breakaway gap is a term utilized in [technical analysis](/technicalanalysis) which distinguishes a strong price movement through support or resistance. A [gap](/gapping) is the difference between the open price and prior close price, where no trading activity happens. The price breaks from the support or resistance through a gap, instead of a [intraday](/intraday) breakout. Breakaway gaps are many times seen from the get-go in a trend when the price moves out of a trading reach or following a trend reversal.

## Figuring out the Breakaway Gap

A breakaway gap happens when the price gaps over a support or resistance area, similar to those laid out during a [trading range](/tradingrange). At the point when the price breaks out of a deep rooted trading range through a gap, that is a breakaway gap. A breakaway gap could likewise happen out of one more type of chart pattern, like a triangle, [wedge](/wedge), cup and handle, [rounded bottom](/roundingbottom) or top, or head and shoulders pattern.

Breakaway gaps are likewise regularly associated with affirming a recent fad. For instance, the prior trend might have been down, the price then forms a large cup and handle pattern, and afterward has a breakaway gap to the upside over the handle. This would assist with affirming that the downtrend is finished and the uptrend is in progress. The breakaway gap, which shows strong feeling with respect to the purchasers, in this case, is a piece of evidence that points to additional upside notwithstanding the chart pattern breakout.

A breakaway gap with larger than average [volume](/volume), or particularly high volume, shows strong feeling in the gap heading. A volume increase on a breakout gap affirms that the price is probably going to go on in the breakout heading. In the event that the volume is low on a breakaway gap there is a greater chance of disappointment. A [failed breakout](/failedbreak) happens when the price gaps above resistance or below support yet can't support the price and moves once more into the prior trading range.

Gaps can happen whenever yet are highly liable to happen following [earnings](/earnings) announcements or other major corporate announcements.

## Trend and Gap Cycles

While few out of every odd trend has a breakaway gap, a few trends truly do have a breakaway gap and they are many times seen from the get-go in a trend when the price takes a critical action outside of a chart pattern. All things considered, whenever a critical chart pattern is followed by a gapping breakout, it very well may be called a breakaway gap.

As the trend speeds up it then, at that point, will in general see one more type of gap called the [runaway gap](/runawaygap). A runaway gap is the point at which the price opens essentially higher than the prior close in a laid out uptrend. During a downtrend, a runaway gap is the point at which the price opens essentially lower than the prior close. Normally the price keeps moving in the runaway gap bearing inside half a month, and in some cases in practically no time or even the next day. A runaway gap doesn't have to breach a major support or resistance level (like a breakaway gap) however it must happen in the current trend bearing.

As a trend approaches its end, it might experience a [exhaustion gap](/exhaustiongap). An exhaustion gap happens close to the furthest limit of a trend and is brought about by a last group of purchasers, who regret not having bought prior, flooding in. In a downtrend, an exhaustion gap is a gap brought about by venders. An exhaustion gap is like a runaway gap, then again, actually an exhaustion gap is typically associated with **very high** volume. A few runaway gaps are too, yet traders can likewise look for exhaustion gaps to rapidly fill. Since an exhaustion gap generally happens close to the furthest limit of the trend, any progress the gap made is normally eradicated (gap filled) inside half a month and frequently soon.

There are likewise [common gaps](/commongap) which happen when there is a small difference between the open and closing price. These happen often and most traders consider them to have less significance than breakaway, runaway, and exhaustion gaps.

## Illustration of a Breakaway Gap in the Stock Market

The chart of Apple Inc. (AAPL) below has three gaps set apart on it. The main comes when the price forms a triangle pattern after a downtrend. The price then, at that point, gaps over the triangle, on high volume, and afterward keeps on rallying to the upside. This is a breakaway gap associated with an earnings announcement.
