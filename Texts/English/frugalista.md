The word acquired prevalence as the 2008 financial crisis unfurled, and it was talked about by **The** **New York Times** columnist William Safire in his "On Language" column on November 28 of that year.

## Grasping Frugalista

## Special Considerations

Initially, frugalistas were defined as ladies (in part as a result of the ladylike sounding word ending and partly in view of the similitude to "fashionista") who kept a costly looking appearance on a tight spending plan. This definition retained hints of the **Sex in the City** ethos of the early aughts and from that point forward.

Frugalistas in 2021 are as liable to live in a van and work from a distance while extending their lifestyle onto the Internet through the Instagram hashtag #vanlife. They embrace voluntary simplicity as a philosophy and are heirs to the back-to-the-land movements that are a recurring feature of American social life. The difference is they presently utilize the wisdom of lived thriftiness as a marketing instrument to pay for their peripatetic undertakings.
