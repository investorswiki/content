# Negative Amortization Limit
## What is Negative Amortization Limit?

The negative amortization limit is a provision in certain bonds or other loan contracts that limits the amount of unpaid interest charges that can be added to the loan's principal balance.

## Understanding Negative Amortization Limit

A loan negatively amortizes when scheduled payments are made that are not exactly the interest charge due on the loan at that point. At the point when a payment is made that is not exactly the interest charge due, [deferred interest](/deferredinterest) is made and added to the loan's [principal](/principal) balance, making negative amortization.

A negative amortization limit states that the principal balance of a loan can't surpass a certain pre-determined amount, normally designated as a percentage of the original loan balance. Such limits keep borrowers from getting into circumstances where they can't pay back the loan and are forced to [default](/default2) or declare insolvency — thus additionally safeguards lenders from [default risk](/defaultrisk).

Negative amortization happens when the regularly scheduled payments on a loan are deficient to pay the interest building on the principal. The extra interest is added to the loan balance, bringing about a consistently higher interest expense and loan balance. Thus the term "negative amortization," as the payments are inadequate to amortize the loan balance.

On account of a negatively amortized mortgage, the homeowner in effect is borrowing more money every month to cover the interest on the loan. Until the loan starts to [amortize](/amortization), there isn't a principal part of the regularly scheduled payment, and that means that the mortgage balance doesn't diminish.

Frequently, these types of loans will have a limit on the amount of negative amortization that can accrue on the loan — set regularly as a percentage of the loan's original size. A negative amortization limit keeps a loan's principal balance from turning out to be too large, causing exorbitantly large payment increments to pay back the loan toward its term's end. For example, a negative amortization limit of 15% on a $500,000 loan would determine that the amount of negative amortization wouldn't surpass $75,000.

At the point when a negative amortization limit is arrived at on a loan, a [recasting](/mortgagerecast) of the loan's payments is set off with the goal that another amortization schedule is laid out and the loan will be paid off toward its term's end. This might be basically as simple as arranging a [refinancing](/renegotiate) of the original loan.
