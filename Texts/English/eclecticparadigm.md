# Eclectic Paradigm
## What Is an Eclectic Paradigm?

An eclectic paradigm, otherwise called the ownership, location, [internalization](/internalization) (OLI) model or OLI system, is a three-layered evaluation structure that companies can follow while attempting to determine assuming that it is beneficial to seek after [foreign direct investment](/foreign-investment) (FDI). This paradigm expects that institutions will keep away from transactions in the [open market](/open-market) if the cost of completing similar activities internally, or in-house, conveys a lower price. It depends on internalization theory and was first elucidated upon in 1979 by the researcher John H. Dunning.

## Understanding Eclectic Paradigms

The eclectic paradigm adopts a comprehensive strategy to examining whole connections and interactions of the different parts of a business. The paradigm gives a strategy to activity development through FDI. The goal is to determine in the event that a specific methodology offers greater generally benefit than other accessible national or international decisions for the production of goods or services.

Since businesses look for the most cost-compelling options while as yet maintaining quality, they might utilize the eclectic paradigm to assess any scenario which exhibits potential.

## Three Key Factors of the Eclectic Paradigm

For FDI to be beneficial, the following advantages must be apparent:

The primary consideration, **ownership advantages**, include exclusive information and different [ownership rights](/real proprietor) of a company. These may comprise of branding, copyright, trademark or patent rights, plus the utilization and management of internally-accessible skills. Ownership advantages are commonly viewed as intangible. They include what gives a competitive advantage, like a reputation for dependability.

**Location advantage** is the second vital great. Companies must evaluate whether there is a comparative advantage to performing specific capabilities within a specific nation. Frequently fixed in nature, these considerations apply to the availability and costs of resources, while functioning in one location compared to another. Location advantage can allude to natural or made resources, yet one way or the other, they are generally fixed, requiring a partnership with a foreign investor in that location to be used to full advantage.

Finally, **internalization advantages**, signal when it is better for an organization to deliver a specific product in-house, versus contracting with a third-party. On occasion, it could be more cost-successful for an organization to operate from an alternate market location while they keep doing the work in-house. On the off chance that the business chooses to [outsource](/outsourcing) the production, it might require negotiating partnerships with neighborhood producers. In any case, taking an outsourcing route possibly seems OK on the off chance that the contracting company can address the organization's issues and quality standards at a lower cost. Maybe the foreign company can likewise offer a greater degree of neighborhood market information, or even more skilled employees who can make a better product.

## Real World Example

According to Research Methodology, an independent research and analyst firm, the eclectic paradigm were applied by Shanghai Vision Technology Company, in its decision to export its 3D printers and other innovative tech offerings. While their decision firmly viewed as the disadvantage of higher tariffs and transportation costs, their internationalization strategy at last permitted them to prosper in new markets.
