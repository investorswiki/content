# Delivery Risk
## What Is Delivery Risk?

Delivery risk alludes to the chance that a [counterparty](/counterparty) may not satisfy its side of the agreement by neglecting to convey the underlying asset or cash value of the contract. Different terms to depict what is going on are settlement risk, default risk, and [counterparty risk](/counterpartyrisk). It's a risk the two players must consider before focusing on a financial contract. There are changing degrees of delivery risk that exist in every single financial exchange.

## How Delivery Risk Works

Delivery risk is somewhat rare yet increments during times of global financial strain like during and after the breakdown of [Lehman Brothers](/lehman-brothers) in September 2008. It was quite possibly of the biggest breakdown in financial history and brought mainstream consideration back to delivery risk.

Presently, most asset managers utilize collateral to limit the downside loss associated with counterparty risk. In the event that an institution holds collateral, the damage done when a counterparty kicks the bucket is limited to the gap between the [collateral](/collateral) held and the market price of supplanting the deal. Most fund managers demand collateral in cash, [sovereign bonds](/sovereignbond) and even demands critical margin over the derivative value on the off chance that they see a huge risk.

## Special Considerations

Different measures to alleviate this risk incorporate settlement by means of [clearing house](/clearinghouse) and [mark to market](/marktomarket) (MTM) measures while dealing with over the counter trading in bonds and currency markets.

In retail and commercial financial transactions, [credit reports](/creditreport) are frequently used to decide the counterparty credit risk for lenders to make car loans, home loans and business loans to customers. In the event that the borrower has low credit, the creditor charges a higher interest rate premium due to the risk of default, especially on uncollateralized debt.

In the event that one counterparty is thought of as riskier than the other, a premium might be joined to the agreement. In the [foreign exchange](/foreign-exchange) market, delivery risk is otherwise called Herstatt risk, named after the small German bank that failed to cover due obligations.

## Illustration of Delivery Risk

Financial Institutions look at numerous metrics to decide whether a counterparty is at an increased risk of [defaulting](/default2) on their payments. They look at a company's financial statements and utilize various ratios to decide the probability of repayment.

[Free cash flow](/freecashflow) is frequently used to lay out the basis for whether the company might experience difficulty generating cash to satisfy their obligations.

A company with negative or contracting cash flow could demonstrate higher delivery risk. In the credit market, risk managers consider credit exposure, expected exposure and future possible exposure to estimate the practically equivalent to credit exposure in a credit derivative.
