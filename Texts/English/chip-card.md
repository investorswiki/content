## What Is a Chip Card?

A chip card is a standard-size plastic debit or credit card that contains an embedded microchip along with a traditional magnetic stripe. The chip scrambles data to increase data security while making transactions at stores, terminals, or automated teller machines (ATMs). Chip cards additionally are known as smart cards, [chip-and-PIN cards](/chipandpin-card), chip-and-signature cards, and the Europay, Mastercard, Visa (EMV) card.

## How Chip Cards Work

Plastic has been a go-to payment method for a long while giving consumers convenience and security over cash payments. Credit cards with [revolving credit](/revolvingcredit) — like we have today — have been around since the 1950s, while debit cards have been on the market since the last part of the 1960s. Account data, for example, the cardholder's [credit limit](/credit_limit), accessible balance, and transaction limits was stored in the magnetic stripe on the back.

Chip cards turned into a global standard for debit and credit transactions after the technology was presented by [Europay, Mastercard, and Visa](/emv). To this end it's additionally called an EMV card. Chip cards have a little silver or gold microchip embedded on the front of a debit or credit card. Just like the magnetic stripe, the chip contains data about the account(s) associated with the card. The technology was first utilized in Europe before turning into a standard around the world. The technology was officially adopted in the United States in October 2015.

To utilize the chip card, the cardholder embeds the card into a chip-empowered terminal like an ATM or a [point-of-sale](/point-of-sale-terminal) (POS) terminal. The terminal submits the cardholder's data to the merchant or card provider's site. In the event that the account balance upholds the transaction, it is approved. In the event that not, the terminal oddballs the transaction and it doesn't go through. A few terminals require the cardholder to enter a [personal identification number](/personal-identification-number) (PIN) or a signature to complete the transaction.

## Special Considerations

Regardless of the efforts of the global financial community to give a uniform environment to financial transactions, not all card readers are chip-empowered. High costs, the availability of equipment and technology, alongside different factors might prevent merchants from carrying out chip-empowered technology. At the point when a retailer or other service provider doesn't have a chip understanding terminal, cardholders must swipe their cards utilizing the magnetic stripe. Users might be required to enter their PINs or sign to approve the transaction and complete the purchase.

## Types of Chip Cards

By and large, a cardholder is basically required to enter their chip card into a terminal to execute a transaction in the United States. However, in different cases — remembering for different countries — consumers might be required to make extra strides to make a purchase or pull out cash from the ATM utilizing the accompanying cards.

### Chip-and-signature cards

A [chip-and-signature card](/chipandsignature-card) gives somewhat more security over the traditional magnetic stripe. Instead of utilizing the stripe, the cardholder utilizes the chip to send data from the terminal to the financial institution. On the off chance that the transaction is approved, the consumer must give a signature to complete the transaction.

### Chip-and-PIN cards

These cards offer the most security for consumers. They work similarly as a standard chip card, yet in addition require the utilization of a PIN to complete a transaction. A customer must enter their personal identification number to make a purchase or pull out money from the ATM utilizing their credit or debit card. PINs are ordinarily utilized for ATM withdrawals utilizing debit and credit cards in the United States. Consumers in Canada and different countries are required to utilize their PINs paying little mind to how or where they utilize their cards — regardless of whether it's a credit card.

## Benefits of Chip Cards

Chip card technology gives an extra layer of security when utilized at a chip-empowered terminal on the grounds that the cards are more hard to skim. This encryption security is notwithstanding the fraud prevention monitoring previously offered via card providers. As a rule, purchases have coverage for fraudulent utilization. This coverage limits a customer's liability in the event of theft. Embedded chips assist merchants with keeping away from [card-present fraud](/cardpresent-fraud), however different lines of protection must come from different methods to prevent [card-not-present-fraud](/cardnotpresent-fraud).

The chip makes transactions safer by scrambling data when utilized at a chip-empowered terminal. Chip card technology isn't yet a finder system so you can't find your card utilizing a finder service in the event that you lose it. In this case, you need to request a replacement card from your provider. Until participated in a reader, the card can't identify its location for security or advertising purposes. The chip is limited to supporting [authentication of card data](/credit-card-authentication) during purchases. Typically, this type of card is effectively replaceable in the event of loss or damage.

Banks monitor the chip card's activity by location use, the purchase amount, and the merchant charging the account. Assuming any tricky activity is recognized, the card provider will endeavor to contact the customer. The bank issues a credit to the chip-card account after verification of fraudulent charges.
