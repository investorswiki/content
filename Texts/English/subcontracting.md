# Subcontracting
## What Is Subcontracting?

Subcontracting is the practice of relegating, or outsourcing, part of the obligations and tasks under a contract to one more party known as a subcontractor.

Subcontracting is particularly pervasive in areas where complex projects are the standard, like construction and information technology. Subcontractors are hired by the project's overall contractor, who keeps on having overall responsibility for project completion and execution inside its stipulated boundaries and cutoff times. This can make a subcontractor risk for [compliance](/compliancedepartment).

## How Subcontracting Works

Involving the construction industry for instance, when a government body or a company needs to build or make repairs to infrastructure, it would typically award the contract for the job to a contractor. The contractor is a business owner who arranges the arrangement and deals with a contractual basis for a settled upon fee. Sometimes the work to be done is in a specific field, for example, electrical, plumbing, protection, or later areas like energy optimization and smart wiring infrastructure, which requires the contractor to contract out to another party. In this case, the contractor will subcontract the work to a particular subcontractor.

A subcontractor is a type of contractor who works in a specific area and could be a freelancer, [independent contractor](/independent-contractor), or vendor. While the contractor keeps up with relationships with clients (e.g., corporations or the government), the subcontractor works with a contractor, giving their specific range of abilities in exchange for a contractual fee. The subcontracting individual or company reports to the primary contractor, who is responsible for dealing with the contracted work from commencement to completion.

## Why Subcontract?

There are several motivations behind why subcontracting is carried out. Subcontracting is exceptionally helpful in situations where the scope of required capacities for a project is too different to be carried out by a single general contractor. In such cases, subcontracting parts of the project that don't form the general contractor's core competencies might help with keeping costs taken care of and moderate overall project risk. It might even grant some defense in a [vis major](/vis-major) situation.

Likewise, some large government contracts or contracts that impact neighborhood community development might require the primary contractor to hire a certain number of subcontracting elements from the community as part of the contract. Moreover, a business might choose to subcontract a few unremarkable however vital jobs to free up time and resources to take care of other profitable undertakings.

At last, it is more affordable for a contractor to hire the services of a subcontracting firm or freelancer than it is to hire an employee since the primary contractor isn't responsible for paying specialists' compensation benefits, vehicle and [commercial general liability insurance](/commercial-general-liability-cgl), medical coverage, full-time salaries, and [Social Security](/socialsecurity) taxes for independent contractors or subcontractors. According to a management point of view, outsourcing is a variable cost that happens just when the work is required though hiring full-time employees is a fixed cost that happens regardless of whether the work is available. That is called operating leverage. It is high when the fixed cost structure is high and vice versa.

To be given a subcontract, a business must be on favorable terms with its home state limitations, for example, having a cutting-edge file for its tax returns. For tax purposes, a subcontracting company is required to register with the [Internal Revenue Service](/irs) (IRS) to receive an Employer Identification Number (EIN). The EIN will be utilized by the primary contractor to report to the IRS all [business income](/businessincome) paid to the subcontracting company.

## Subcontracting and Taxes

As indicated by the IRS, subcontractors are small business owners who are responsible for the self-employment taxes that cover both [Medicare](/medicare) and Social Security taxes. Subcontractors might fit the bill for certain [tax deductions](/tax-deduction) that can be claimed on their business expenses. These expenses must be ordinary and essential for the operation of a self-employed business. This means that a subcontractor wouldn't have the option to claim a deduction on an expense they would regularly make without the business.

A few instances of deductions that can be claimed incorporate [home office deductions](/homeofficeexpense), like rent and utilities, costs of going to a job, and costs of courses or certifications that straightforwardly connect with the business calling.

The IRS investigates the income reported by a contractor and utilizations a relationship criterion to confirm whether the subcontractor is to be sure an independent contractor or an employee. Two or three measures utilized by the IRS to finish up on the relationship between the two players incorporate figuring out who sets the rules, who gives the tools and materials utilized for the job, and who pays for business expenses.

On the off chance that the primary contractor sets the rules for how the project is to be finished, gives the tool expected to complete the project, and pays for any business expense incurred by the subcontractor, the IRS will regard the subcontractor as an employee. On the off chance that this occurs, the primary contractor will be required to pay Social Security tax and benefits.
