# Eligible Contract Participant
## What Is an Eligible Contract Participant?

There are extremely tough requirements before one can arrive at eligible contract participant status.

While the base for individuals, partnerships, and corporations to turn into an ECP is $10 million in assets, that figure drops to $5 million assuming the ECP contract is being utilized to hedge risk. Government substances, agent sellers, and commodity pools (with more than $5 million of assets under management) are here and there eligible contract participants too.

ECPs are permitted to utilize margin subsequent to meeting certain requirements. In the first place, the amount invested, on a discretionary basis, must surpass $5 million. Second, the purpose of margin trading is to deal with the risk of an existing asset or liability.
