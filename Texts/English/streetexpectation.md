# Street Expectation
## What is Street Expectation

The Street expectation is the average estimate of a public company's quarterly [earnings](/earnings) and revenues, that is derived from forecasts of securities analysts who provide research coverage on the company. The Street expectation is a closely-watched number that becomes prominent during the period when most public companies report their results. The term is derived from the way that analysts of the biggest brokerages are typically based on Wall Street in the U.S. furthermore, Bay Street in Canada.

The Street expectation is otherwise called a [earnings estimate](/earningsestimate) or **earnings expectation.** **Consensus estimate,** another equivalent word, is seldom used these days.

## BREAKING DOWN Street Expectation

Investors' reactions to a company that misses Street expectations are often negative and can trigger a substantial decline in the stock. Conversely, a company that beats expectations can generally expect to be rewarded with an appreciation in its stock price.

A company needs to beat the average analyst forecast for the two sales and earnings per share (EPS) - or the top line and bottom line - to exceed Street expectations. A miss on either the average [revenue number](/revenue) or EPS forecast would count as falling short of expectations.

Factors that influence the magnitude of price movement in the underlying stock when a company exceeds or misses Street expectations (otherwise called a positive or negative "surprise," respectively) include the extent of the surprise, the overall market trend (bullish or bearish) and the company's outlook for the period ahead.

In broad terms, the bigger the surprise, the bigger the market reaction. The reaction to negative surprises is typically more adverse than the favorable reaction to positive surprises. This means that a stock is generally likely to suffer a greater percentage decline on the off chance that it misses expectations overwhelmingly, compared to the percentage gain that can be expected on the off chance that it exceeds the estimate by a comparative margin.

During a strong [bull market](/bullmarket), stocks that beat expectations often surge in price. When experiencing a dismal [bear market](/bearmarket), stocks that miss expectations often endure precipitous price declines, while stocks that beat expectations in terrible times record muted gains.

Market reaction to an earnings hit or miss can likewise be dictated by the company's outlook. The negative reaction to an earnings miss might be tempered by a strong outlook, while the positive reaction to an earnings beat might be negated by a poor outlook. The forward price to earnings (forward P/E) is a measure of the price-to-earnings (P/E) proportion that uses forecasted earnings to guide a company's future outlook.
