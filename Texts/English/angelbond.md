## What is Angel Bond?

Angel Bond, inverse of 'fallen angels', is shoptalk for a [investment-grade](/investmentgrade) bond with a sufficiently high credit rating that banks can legally invest in them.

## Understanding Angel Bond

An angel bond pays a lower interest rate as a result of the responsible company's high credit rating which suggests a lower risk investment. Angel bonds are something contrary to fallen angels, which are [bonds](/bond) that were initially investment-grade yet have been downgraded to a "[junk](/junkbond)" rating, and are in this manner significantly more risky.

Angel bonds receive investment-grade credit ratings that can go from a high of 'AAA' by [Standard and Poor's](/sp) (S&P) and Fitch and 'Aaa' by [Moody's](/moodys) Investors Service to the base investment-grade ratings issued by each service of 'BBB' by S&P and Fitch, and 'Baa' by Moody's. In the event that the company's ability to pay back the bond's principal is diminished, the [bond rating](/bondrating) may fall below investment-grade essentials and become a fallen angel.

Angel bonds are most usually utilized as a point of reference while depicting fallen angels. The last option have "fallen" by seeing their credit ratings slip through the different levels of investment-grade ratings into the below-investment grade area, likewise alluded to as high yield or junk ratings categories. Fallen angels contrast from other [high yield bonds](/high_yield_bond) that were initially rated below investment grade.

A bond rating is a grade given to bonds that shows their [credit quality](/creditquality). Private independent rating services like Standard and Poor's, Moody's Investors Service and [Fitch Ratings Inc.](/fitch-ratings) give these assessments of a bond issuer's financial strength, or its ability to pay a bond's [principal](/principal) and interest in an ideal fashion.
