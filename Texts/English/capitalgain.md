# Capital Gain
## What Is a Capital Gain in Simple Terms?
A capital gain is the positive difference between what an asset was purchased for and what it is currently worth. All in all, it is the amount by which an asset has gone up in value since it was acquired.
For example, assuming an investor bought a share of an organization's stock for $40 a year prior, however presently it trades at $55, that $15 difference is the investor's capital gain. If, then again, this $40 investment went down in value to $25 throughout the past year, the investor would have encountered a **capital loss** of $15.
Stocks aren't the main assets that can drive capital gains and losses, however — any asset, whether purchased as an investment (like a [treasury bond](/treasurybond) or a [call option](/calloption)) or for personal use (like a home or motor vehicle) can go up or down in value after some time, bringing about capital gains or losses.
A capital gain addresses a positive change in an asset's value after some time, yet it isn't viewed as income — or taxed — until it is **realized**. Assuming an investor actually possesses an asset that has gone up in value, their capital gain is considered **unrealized**.
## What's the significance here When a Capital Gain Is Realized?
Capital gains are realized when they are "secured" through the sale of an asset that has valued in value since it was purchased.
For example, if the investor in the model above sold their share of stock once it was worth $55, they would understand their capital gain of $15. If, then again, they kept on holding the stock, their capital gain would stay unrealized, and the value of the stock would keep on changing over the long haul.
When realized, a capital gain turns into a form of income, and therefore, it is subject to taxes.
## How Are Realized Capital Gains Calculated?
To work out the realized capital gain on an asset, basically deduct its purchase price from the amount it was sold for.
### Realized Capital Gain Formula
> RCG = Sale Price - Purchase price

## How Are Capital Gains Taxed?
As referenced above, when realized, capital gains are subject to taxes. The rate at which they are taxed relies upon two things — how long the asset being referred to was held before being sold, and how much taxable income the person who sold it made that year.
### Short-Term Capital Gains
Assuming an asset is held for short of what one year before being sold, the subsequent capital gain (or loss) is viewed as short-term. Short-term capital gains are taxed at a similar rate as normal income. For the 2022 tax year, income tax rates shift somewhere in the range of 10% and 37% relying upon an individual's tax bracket.

## How Might You Reduce or Avoid Capital Gains Tax?
There are a number of (legal) approaches to completely or somewhat try not to pay capital gains taxes, and some — like 1031 exchanges and like-kind stock exchanges — include genuinely muddled desk work and the aid of a financial professional. Others, nonetheless, are more clear. Below are a couple of simple methods for lessening capital gains taxes.
### Hold Your Securities for More Than a Year Before Selling
The most direct method for diminishing your capital gains taxes is to stay away from short-term capital gains through and through. Assuming you hold all securities for over one year before selling them, they will be taxed at the long-term rate, which is lower than the short-term rate.
### Invest Through a 401(k) or Individual Retirement Account
On the off chance that you needn't bother with the funds you've made by means of capital gains right away, investing through an IRA or 401(k) can be an effective method for lessening the impact of taxes on your gains. With a traditional IRA or 401(k) your contributions are tax-deferred, so you don't pay income tax on them until they are removed during retirement. Numerous people fall into a lower tax bracket during retirement, so when they start taking distributions (which are taxed as ordinary income), they might be in a lower tax bracket.
Roth 401(k)s and IRAs can be even more profitable. While contributions are taxed as ordinary income during the years they are made, withdrawals (and thusly any gains) are tax-free insofar as they meet certain expectations.
### Give Securities to Family Members Before or After You Die
In the event that you gift stocks or different securities to family members, they expect your cost basis, yet assuming that they sell, their capital gains (which were formerly yours) are taxed at their capital gains rate, so assuming that they are in a lower tax bracket, they will not need to pay however much you would have.

Better yet, on the off chance that you hold your securities until you die, you can pass on them to whoever you wish (like a family member). The current value of your securities at the hour of your death turns into the beneficiary's cost basis, so they could sell them and pay zero in capital gains tax.
### Offset Capital Gains (or Reduce Income) With Capital Losses
Up to $3,000 in capital losses you bring about by selling assets for short of what you paid for them can be utilized to offset your capital gains in terms of taxes. Any extra capital losses up to this $3,000 limit can be saved to use against future taxes once your current year's capital gains are offset.
This strategy is not great, as it requires selling investments for a loss, yet numerous investors do this close to the furthest limit of certain years on the off chance that it winds up saving them more on their tax bill than they think they would make by continuing to hold certain securities.
## Capital Gains Tax Example
Suppose an individual purchased 10 shares of Alphabet Class A stock (GOOGL) on May nineteenth, 2021 for $2,308 per share ($23,080 total), then sold every one of them on November seventeenth, 2021 for $2,981 per share ($29,810 total). What is their realized capital gain?
> RCG = Sale Price - Purchase Price
>
> RCG = $29,810 - $23,080
>
> RCG = $6,730

In this way, the investor encountered a capital gain as much as $6,730. Since the 10 shares of GOOGL were held for under a year before being sold, this would be viewed as a short-term capital gain for tax purposes.
Suppose this investor made $97,000 in taxable income in 2021 and recorded as single. In this way, they would have fallen into the 24% tax bracket. All in all, what amount could they have paid in capital gains tax on this sale?
24% of $6,730 is **$1,615.20**, which is the amount the investor would owe in capital gains tax for this stock sale. As may be obvious, capital gains taxes — particularly those that are short-term — can eat into an investor's profits altogether.
