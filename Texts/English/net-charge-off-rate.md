# Net Charge-Off Rate
## What Is the Net Charge-Off Rate?

The net charge-off rate is the annualized ratio of [net charge-offs](/net-charge-off-nco) (NCOs) to average loans outstanding. NCOs are a loan specialist's gross charge-offs less recuperations of its [delinquent](/delinquent) debt.

The net charge-off rate measures the extent of debt owed to a company that is probably not going to be paid back to that company. This "[bad debt](/baddebt)" will then, at that point, be [written off](/discount) on its financial statements. NCO rates shed important data to investors and analysts about credit standards of lenders and the quality of their loan portfolio, and may likewise give signals about broad economic conditions.

## Figuring out Net Charge-Off Rate

A net charge-off (NCO) is the dollar amount that measures the difference between gross charge-offs and any subsequent recuperations of [delinquent](/delinquent) debt. Debt that is probably not going to be recuperated is in many cases written off and classified as gross charge-offs. If, sometime in the not too distant future, some money is recuperated on the debt, the amount is deducted from the gross charge-offs to figure the new net charge-off rate.

The net charge-off rate is the percentage addressing that amount of debt that a company accepts it won't ever collect and is an indicator of a financial organization's loan portfolio performance. A high net charge-off rate, particularly when compared to the previous period or to different banks, would propose that the loan portfolio might be too unsafe:

- **Net charge-off rate** = (net charge-off/average outstanding loans) x 100

[Non-performing loans](/nonperformingloan) might be charged off as [bad debt](/baddebt) and cleansed from the books, frequently on a month to month or quarterly basis. In the event that and when part of the debt is repaid, the net charge-off can be calculated by finding the difference between the gross charge-offs and the repaid debt. A negative value for net charge-offs demonstrates that recuperations are greater than charge-offs during a particular period.

The [charge-off rate of a credit card company](/chargeoff-rate-credit-card) depends on statistics recognizing what debt is probably going to default. A credit card company, for instance, may post a 10.31% net charge-off rate, intending that, for the predefined period, the company expects that 10.31% of its debt won't ever be recuperated.

## Model

For example, in the event that a bank's average loans outstanding is $1 million and the net charge-off is $75,000, then, at that point, the net charge-off rate would be as per the following:

- ($75,000 \u00f7 $1,000,000) x 100 = 7.5%

We should check a genuine model: Capital One Financial Corp (COF out). reported that its total net charge-off rate in 2017, as a percent of average loans outstanding, was 2.67%. This was an increase in the net charge-off rate compared to the 2.17% figure it posted in 2016, or an increase of 50 [basis points](/basispoint) (bps). Per accounting rules, the bank applied the net charge-off amount to the loan loss provision.

## Highlights
- A high net charge-off rate shows that a company accepts it won't ever collect a lot of its debt, and lead investors or analysts to accept it has an extremely dangerous portfolio.
- The net charge-off rate is the percentage of a moneylender's debt outstanding that is delinquent or terrible debt.
- The net charge-off rate is utilized to assess the quality of a loan portfolio.
