Nigeria is situated on the West Africa coast and gets its name from the Niger river. The region was home to numerous old and prosperous social orders before falling under British provincial rule during the 1800s. In 1960, the region turned into the independent Federation of Nigeria. Soon after, the country spiraled into a civil war which went on until the 1970s. France, Egypt, Britain, and the Soviets intruded in the country during the long periods of war. Until 1999, the leadership of Nigeria switched back and forth between chose officials and military tyrannies.

Military rule, political corruption, and fumble harmed the economy and ran up monstrous foreign debt. Nigeria defaulted on its debt as oil prices fell during the 1980s. Renegotiation of its [Paris Club](/parisclub) debt happened in 2005, and in 2006 Nigeria cleared its debt.

## Illustration of NGN On Forex Markets

Expect the exchange rate for the USD/NGN is 361. This means it costs 361 naira to buy one U.S. dollar. Currency dealers and banks won't offer this rate while seeking exchange one currency for the other in cash (carefully or physically), since they will incorporate their exchange fee into the rate. Hence, somebody changing over NGN cash to USD cash might pay 379 NGN for one USD, around 5% more.

This 5% [markup](/markup), is the bank or dealer's profit on the transaction. Fees to exchange physical currencies normally range from 0.5% on bigger amounts of currency to up to 5% or more, contingent upon the currency being exchanged and the amount of currency.

On the flip side, somebody who needs to change over U.S. dollars into NGN will not get 361 of them by the same token. They might get 5% less (in light of what the bank or dealer charges), and that means that for each U.S. dollar they will receive approximately 343 NGN.

Assuming the exchange rate goes from 361 up to 400, that means the naira has diminished in value, since it costs more naira to buy one USD. Assuming that the rate were to be brought down to 320, that would mean the naira has increased in value against the USD, in light of the fact that it currently costs less naira to buy a USD.

The naira will in general vary more against different currencies since the Central Bank of Nigeria screens the USD the most and endeavors to the peg the currency to it. The NGN isn't pegged to different currencies, so the rate could shift daily. Expect the AUD/NGN rate is 245.30. That means it costs 245.30 NGN to buy one Australian dollar.

To see what the exchange rate is in terms of NGN/AUD, partition one by the AUD/NGN rate, or 1 \u00f7 245.30 = 0.004. That means it costs not exactly half a penny AUD to buy one NGN.
