# Give-Up
## What Is Give-Up?

Give-up is a technique in securities or commodities trading where a [executing broker](/executingbroker) places a trade for the benefit of another broker. It is called a "give-up" in light of the fact that the broker executing the trade gives up credit for the transaction on the record books. A give-up ordinarily happens in light of the fact that a broker can't place a trade for a client in view of other workplace obligations. A give-up may likewise happen on the grounds that the original broker is working for the benefit of a [interdealer broker](/between dealerbroker) or [prime broker](/primebrokerage).

## Grasping Give-Up Trades

Give-up is at this point not a common trading practice in the financial markets. Give-up was more normal before the development of electronic trading. In the floor trading period, a broker probably won't have the option to come to the floor and would have one more broker place the trade as a kind of [proxy](/proxy). Overall, the act of playing out a trade for the sake of another broker is generally part of a set up give-up agreement. Set up agreements commonly incorporate provisions for the give-up trade procedures as well as compensation. Give-up trades are not standard practice, so payment isn't plainly defined without a set up agreement.

## Give-Up versus Give-In

Acceptance of a give-up trade is at times called a give-in. After a give-up trade is actually executed, it can then be called a give-in. Notwithstanding, the utilization of the term "give in" is considerably less common.

## Parties Involved in the Trade

There are three principal parties engaged with a give-up trade. These parties incorporate the executing broker (Party A), the client's broker (Party B), and the broker taking the contrary side of the trade (Party C). A standard trade just includes two parties, the buying broker and the selling broker. A give-up likewise requires another person who executes the trade (Party A).

In situations where both the original buying and selling brokers are generally committed, a fourth party can become engaged with a give-up trade. In the event that the buying broker and the selling broker both ask separate traders to act for their sake, then, at that point, this scenario would bring about a give-up on the selling side and the buying side.

A request is made of Party A to place the trade in the interest of Party B to guarantee the opportune execution of a trade. On the record books, otherwise called a trade log, a give-up trade shows the data for the client's broker (Party B). Party An executes the transaction for Party B and isn't officially noted in the trade record.

Compensation agreements are ordinarily made to deal with the provisions of give-up trades. The executing broker (Party A) might receive the standard trade spread. Executing brokers are many times paid by the non-floor brokers either on retainer or with a for each trade [commission](/commission). This extensive payment to the executing broker could possibly be part of the commission that Broker B charges his client.

## Illustration of a Give-Up Trade

Broker B gets a buy order from a client to buy 100 shares of XYZ on the [New York Stock Exchange](/nyse) (NYSE). Broker B works upstairs at a large brokerage firm and needs to get the order down to the floor of the NYSE. To execute the trade in an opportune fashion, Broker B asks Floor Broker A to place the order. Floor Broker A then buys the stock in the interest of the client of Broker B.

In spite of the fact that Floor Broker A places the trade, he must give up the transaction and record maybe Broker B made the trade. The transaction is recorded as though Broker B made the trade, even however Floor Broker An executed the trade.
