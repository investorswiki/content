## What Is a Quota?

A quota is a government-imposed trade restriction that limits the number or monetary value of goods that a country can import or commodity during a specific period. Countries use quotas in international trade to help control the [volume of trade](/volumeoftrade) among them and different countries. Countries now and again impose quotas on specific products to reduce [imports](/import) and increase domestic production. In theory, quotas help domestic production by confining foreign competition.

Government programs that execute quotas are frequently alluded to as [protectionism](/protectionism) policies. Furthermore, governments can institute these policies assuming they have worries over the quality or safety of products showing up from different countries.

In business, a quota can allude to a sales target that a company needs a salesperson or sales team to accomplish for a specific period. Sales quotas are in many cases month to month, quarterly, and yearly. Management can likewise set sales quotas by region or business unit. The most common type of sales quota depends on [revenue](/revenue).

## How a Quota Works

Quotas are not quite the same as [tariffs](/levy) or customs, which place taxes on imports or exports. Governments impose the two quotas and tariffs as defensive measures to try to control trade between countries, however there are distinct differences between them.

Quotas center around restricting the amounts (or, at times, cumulative value) of a specific decent that a country imports or [exports](/trade) for a specific period, though tariffs impose specific fees on those goods. Governments design tariffs (otherwise called customs duties) to raise the overall cost to the producer or provider looking to sell products inside a country. Tariffs furnish a country with extra revenue and they offer protection to domestic producers by making imported things become more costly.

> Quotas are a type of [nontariff barrier](/nontariff-barrier) governments establish to confine trade. Different sorts of trade barriers incorporate [embargoes](/ban), imposes, and sanctions.

Quotas are more effective in limiting trade than tariffs, particularly in the event that domestic demand for something isn't cost touchy. Quotas may likewise be more disruptive to international trade than tariffs. Applied specifically to different countries, they can be used as a coercive economic weapon.

## Import Quota Regulatory Agencies

The U.S. Customs and Border Protection Agency, a federal policing of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, manages the regulation of international trade, gathering customs, and upholding U.S. trade regulations. Inside the United States, the three forms of quotas are absolute, duty rate, and tax inclination level:

1. An absolute quota gives a definitive restriction on the quantity of a specific decent that might be imported into the United States, albeit this level of restriction isn't generally being used. Under an absolute quota, when the quantity permitted by the quota is filled, merchandise subject to the quota must be held in a reinforced warehouse or went into a foreign trade zone until the opening of the next quota period.
1. Levy rate quotas permit a country to import a certain quantity of a specific decent at a reduced [duty](/duty) rate. When the tax rate quota is met, all consequently imported goods are charged at a higher rate.
1. A separate set of dealings make duty inclination levels, for example, those laid out through [Free Trade Agreements](/free-trade) (FTAs).

### Goods Subject to Tariff-Rate Quotas

Different commodities are subject to levy rate quotas while entering the United States. These eligible [commodities](/item) incorporate, yet are not limited to, milk and cream, cotton texture, blended syrups, Canadian cheddar, cocoa powder, baby formula, peanuts, sugar, and tobacco.

## Real World Example

For instance, in January 2018, President Trump imposed 30% tariffs on imported sunlight based chargers from China. This push flagged a more aggressive approach toward China's political and economic position. It was likewise a blow to the U.S. sun powered industry, which was responsible for generating $18.7 billion of investment in the American economy and which at the time imported 80% to 90% of its sunlight based charger products.
