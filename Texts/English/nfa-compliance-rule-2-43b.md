# NFA Compliance Rule 2-43b
## What Is NFA Compliance Rule 2-43b?

NFA Compliance Rule 2-43b, carried out in 2009 by the [National Futures Association](/nfa) (NFA), states that forex dealer members (FDM) and [retail foreign exchange dealers](/retail-foreign-exchange-dealer-rfed) (RFED) can't permit clients to hedge and must offset positions on a [first-in-first-out](/fifo) (FIFO) basis.

## Understanding NFA Compliance Rule 2-43b

Rule 2-43b was executed by the U.S. forex (FX) industry's self-regulatory organization, the National Futures Association (NFA). It's known as the "FIFO rule" and, basically, disposes of hedging. Hedging in forex trading is where a trader will have both a long and a short position in a single currency pair simultaneously, offsetting one another.

Rule 2-43b prohibits the dealers from permitting this practice by expecting that various positions held in a similar currency pair be offset on an earliest in, earliest out (FIFO) basis. It likewise boycotts price adjustments to executed customer orders, but to determine an objection that is in the customer's approval. The rule likewise limits changes to certain straight-through processing transactions. These changes must be investigated, approved, and archived by the NFA.

The National Futures Association (NFA) executed the rule in 2009. It applies to all brokers and traders who fall under the NFAs jurisdiction. The NFA is a self-controlling organization, and mandatory membership is critical to permitting the organization to implement its rules and policies. Its membership necessity applies to essentially undeniably registered [forex](/forex) experts working in jobs which incorporate all registered:

- [Futures Commission Merchants](/fcm) (FCM)
- Retail Foreign Exchange Dealers (RFED)
- [Introducing Brokers](/introducingbroker) (IB)
- [Swap Dealers](/swap-dealer) (SD)
- Major Swap Participants (MSP)
- [Commodity Pool Operators](/cpo) (CPO)
- [Commodity Trading Advisors](/cta) (CTA) who direct client accounts or give tailored investment guidance.

In Dec. 2017, the NFA approved an amendment to Rule 2-43b. Under the amendment, price adjustment prohibition doesn't make a difference when a forex dealer member changes all orders in support of customers to correct circumstances that are outside of the customers' reach. A model would incorporate incidents where there are issues with [third-party](/third-party) sellers.

The entry of 2-43b saw a mass departure of trading capital to offshore forex dealers that actually permitted "hedging." While this may be a seen as a boon by the forex customers that use this as part of their trading strategies, they run the risk of being more susceptible to fraudulent practices at the brokerage level, given that the offshore firms aren't held to similar regulatory requirements as their U.S.- based counterparts.

Traders allude to 2-43b as the FIFO rule. This earliest in, earliest out approach means that traders must close the earliest trades first in quite a while where several open trades-in-play include a similar [currency pairs](/foreign-currency-pairs) and are of a similar position size. The rule's allies say it increments transparency for customers and aligns forex trading practices with those of the equities and [futures markets](/futuresmarket).

This elaborate a few initial adjustments from a down to earth perspective for the impacted firms. The forced numerous forex firms to change their trading platforms on the grounds that more established software permitted users to pick which orders they wanted to close out. By enabling customers, the more established software didn't agree with the FIFO rule. Under the new rules, stop and limit orders can be set, yet they must now be input in an unexpected way.
