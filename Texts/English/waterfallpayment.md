# Waterfall Payment
## What Is a Waterfall Payment?

Waterfall payment structures expect that higher-layered creditors receive interest and principal payments, while the lower-layered creditors receive principal payments after the higher-layered creditors are paid back in full. Debtors commonly structure these schemes into such [tranches](/traunch) to focus on the most elevated principal loans first since they are additionally probable the most costly.

## How a Waterfall Payment Works

Envision a waterfall flowing down into upward adjusted buckets. The water addresses money, and the buckets address creditors. The water fills the primary bucket first. The subsequent bucket will fill only after the first is full. As water flows, more buckets are filled in the order in which they show up.

Commonly, bucket sizes (size of debt) decline as the water slides. This is logical in light of the fact that paying off large debts lessens the risk of insolvency and opens up cash for operations, capital expenditures, and investments.

For instance, this type of plan turns out best for a company repaying more than one loan. Accept this company has three operating loans, each with various interest rates. The company makes principal and interest payments on the costliest loan and makes only interest payments on the leftover two. When the most costly loan is paid off, the company can make all interest and principal payments on the next, more costly loan. The interaction go on until all loans are repaid.

## Illustration of Waterfall Payments

To show how a waterfall payment scheme functions, expect a company has taken loans from three creditors, Creditor A, Creditor B, and Creditor C. The scheme is structured with the goal that Creditor An is the most noteworthy layered creditor while Creditor C is the least layered creditor. The arrangement for what the company owes every one of the creditors is as per the following:

- Creditor An is owed a total of $5 million in interest and $10 million in principal.
- Creditor B is owed a total of $3 million in interest and $8 million in principal.
- Creditor C is owed a total of $1 million in interest and $5 million in principal.

Accept in year one the company procures $17 million. It then, at that point, pays off the whole $15 million owed to Creditor A, passing on it with $2 million to pay off additional debts. Since the priority structure is still in place, this $2 million must be applied to Creditor B. Expect the company pays $1 million to Creditor B for interest and $1 million to Creditor B for the principal. The outcome after year one is as per the following:

- Creditor An is fully paid.
- Creditor B is owed a total of $2 million in interest and $7 million in principal.
- Creditor C is owed a total of $1 million in interest and $5 million in principal.

In the event that in year two, the company procures $13 million, it could pay off the leftover obligation to Creditor B and start paying off Creditor C. The outcome after year two is as per the following:

- Creditor An is fully paid.
- Creditor B is fully paid.
- Creditor C is owed $2 million in principal.

This model was simplified to show the mechanics of a waterfall payment scheme. In reality, some waterfall schemes are structured so least interest payments are made to all tiers during every payment cycle.

## Features
- Waterfall payments can be structured to pay off each loan in turn or pay all loans in a systematic fashion.
- Lower-layered creditors are paid interest-only payments until the higher-layered creditors are paid in full.
- Waterfall payment structures permit higher-layered creditors to be paid principal and interest ahead of lower-layered creditors.
