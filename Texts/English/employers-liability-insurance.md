To cover these situations, an employer would have to purchase a separate type of policy called employment rehearses liability insurance (EPLI).

## How Employers' Liability Insurance Works

The majority of private-area employees are covered by workers' compensation laws laid out at the state level (federal employees work under federal workers' compensation laws). States require most employers to carry workers' compensation insurance.

Workers' compensation gives a level of coverage to [medical expenses](/medical-expenses) and lost wages for employees or their beneficiaries when an employee is harmed, falls sick, or is killed because of their job.

In any case, on the off chance that an employee feels that workers' compensation doesn't enough cover their loss — maybe in light of the fact that they feel their employer's negligence caused their injury — they might choose to sue their employer for punitive damages emerging from their situation, for things like agony and languishing.

This is where employers' liability insurance comes in. Intended to deal with expenses that fall outside the domain of the workers' compensation statutes or general liability [insurance](/insurance), it gives extra protection against financial loss for the company or business.

Employers' liability coverage is commonly purchased alongside workers' compensation.

Take, for instance, a company that has offices and work destinations overall around the U.S. A claim emerges in a state where punitive damages are excluded from employers' liability insurance. Assuming the company is laid out in a state that permits punitive damages coverage, then the company employers' liability insurance policy can safeguard it all things considered.
