# Mortgage-Backed Security (MBS)

While we as a whole grew up with the possibility that banks make loans and afterward hold those loans until they mature, the reality is that there's a high chance that your lender is selling the loan into what's known as the [secondary mortgage market](/secondary_mortgage_market). Here, aggregators buy and sell mortgages, finding the right sort of mortgages for the security they need to make and sell on to investors. This is the most common explanation a borrower's mortgage loan servicer changes in the wake of getting a mortgage loan.
Think of a mortgage-backed security like a goliath pie with large number of mortgages tossed into it. The makers of the MBS might cut this pie into possibly a great many cuts — each maybe with a little piece of each mortgage — to give investors the sort of return and risk they demand.
The aggregators might make various sorts of bond cuts from the pool of mortgages. The risk and returns are associated with the profiles of the borrowers on the opposite finish of the mortgages. For instance, on the residential side, stable earners with consistent income narratives and high credit scores generally receive a lower interest rate on their mortgage than borrowers who lenders consider as a greater risk and hence have a higher interest rate on their loan. The interest rate addresses the return on the mortgage-backed securities, and as a rule is adjusted for interest rate developments and risk of default in the portfolio of mortgages.
Mortgage-backed securities regularly pay out to investors consistently, similar to the mortgages behind the securities.
