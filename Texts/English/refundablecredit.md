# Refundable Credit
## What Is a Refundable Credit?

A refundable credit is a [tax credit](/taxcredit) that is refunded to the taxpayer regardless of how much the taxpayer's liability is. Ordinarily, a tax credit is non-refundable, and that means that the credit offsets any tax liability the taxpayer owes, however assuming the credit brings this liability amount down to zero, no genuine money is refunded to the taxpayer. Conversely, refundable credits can bring the tax liability down below zero and this amount is refunded in cash to the taxpayer.

## Grasping Refundable Credits

A refundable credit is called refundable in light of the fact that the taxpayer can receive a payment from the U.S. government through the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) assuming the credit puts the taxpayer's tax liability into the negative numbers. This varies from a non-refundable credit, which can reduce the taxpayer's liability down to zero, however that is. No money can be refunded to the taxpayer, regardless of the amount of the tax credit is left after the liability hits zero.

A taxpayer can claim a refundable credit that is larger than their tax liability, and the IRS will send them the balance of the credit. A taxpayer with no tax liability can't utilize a non-refundable tax credit in light of the fact that a non-refundable tax credit can't take a liability balance below zero. A taxpayer with no tax liability, be that as it may, can utilize a refundable tax credit — regardless of how large or small the credit is — and will be refunded the full balance of money credited. It in this manner checks out for a taxpayer to work out the entirety of their taxes previously paid, deductions, and nonrefundable credits, and afterward compute and apply any refundable credits.
