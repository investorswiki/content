# Private Sector Adjustment Factor (PSAF)
## What Is the Private Sector Adjustment Factor (PSAF)?

The term private sector adjustment factor (PSAF) alludes to the method utilized by the [Federal Reserve Board](/frb) to work out the costs associated with services gave to depository institutions as though they were given by private banks. These services incorporate checks and [Automated Clearing House](/ach) (ACH) among others. The PSAF was presented by the Monetary Control Act of 1980. The PSAF is adjusted and recalculated on an annual basis.

## How the Private Sector Adjustment Factor (PSAF) Works

The Federal Reserve is required to charge for any services it gives to various depository institutions. This rule is part of the [Monetary Control Act of 1980](/monetary-control-act). This federal law helped change how the banking industry is regulated. It made the private sector adjustment factor, a blanket term that incorporates any hidden or [imputed costs](/imputed-cost) and profits. The Fed recuperates both direct and indirect costs of offering types of assistance plus the imputed costs that would have been incurred assuming the services were given by the private sector.

The fees are set each year and are intended to recuperate something like 100% of these expenses. As referenced over, this incorporates services, for example,

- Checks
- Automated Clearing House
- [Fedwire](/fedwire) reserves
- Fedwire protections
- National Settlement Service
- FedLine Solutions

The Fed utilizes data from public banks to figure out its PSAF models. It gauges imputed debt and equity levels, then applies applicable financing rates. The yearly PSAF model is a proforma [balance sheet](/balancesheet) of approximated [assets](/asset) and [liabilities](/responsibility), with different sources of info imputed as though the Fed-offered types of assistance listed above were offered by private sector substances. The equivalent [generally accepted accounting principles](/gaap) (GAAP) utilized by private sector firms are applied by the Fed to foster the financial statements in its model.

The Fed's Board of Governors approved the 2021 PSAF in November 2020 for a total of $16.4 million according to the Monetary Control Act.

## Special Considerations

The Fed surveys its PSAF methodology occasionally to ensure it is current with changes in the banking industry. The Fed changed its cost setting methodology in 2005. It did this so that just the [capital asset pricing model](/capm) (CAPM) is utilized to determine a [return on equity](/returnonequity) (ROE). Prior to this, the aftereffects of three models, including CAPM, were found the middle value of to work out ROE, which is the underlying basis of the annual fee.

For the CAPM calculation, the three-month [Treasury bill](/treasurybill) rate is the risk-free rate, the [beta](/beta) (the measure of volatility) is assumed at 1.0. The [market risk premium](/marketriskpremium) depends on 40-year historical month to month returns over risk-free rates. With the determination of an estimated ROE, the Fed then, at that point, can work out the fee for its services to [depository](/depository) institutions. The ROE is an impression of the expected return of a shareholder in a private entity. The PSAF model ascertains how much in fees it charges to reach this ROE.
