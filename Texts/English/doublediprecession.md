# Double-Dip Recession
## What Is Double-Dip Recession?

A double-dip [recession](/recession) alludes to a recession followed by a short-lived recovery, followed by another recession. Out of the blue, after the initial recession has passed the recovery slows down and the second round of recession sets in just as, or even before, the economy has fully recovered from the losses of the initial recession. One great indicator of a double-dip recession is when [gross domestic product (GDP)](/gdp) growth slides back to negative after a few quarters of positive growth. A double-dip recession is otherwise called a [W-shaped recovery](/w-shaped-recovery).

## Seeing Double-Dip Recession

The foundations for a double-dip recession vary yet frequently remember a slowdown for the production of goods and services that brings [renewed layoffs](/cutback) and investment cutbacks from the previous downturn. A double-dip (or even triple-dip) is a very terrible scenario or the economy, just hardly better than a supported depression.

A double-dip recession happens when the economy experiences an initial recession and afterward starts to recover, however at that point something ends up disrupting the course of recovery. Major economic shocks, continuous debt deflation, and new public policies that increase price rigidities or disincentivize investment, employment, or production can frequently lead to renewed rounds of recession before the economy can recover fully.

Economic indicators can provide early warning of a double-dip recession. Double-dip signals are signs that an economy will move back into a more profound and longer recession, making a recovery even more troublesome. A few indicators of a double-dip recession incorporate high or speeding up consumer price inflation during the initial recession and recovery and sluggish job creation, indications of secondary asset price bubbles yet to burst, or renewed rise in unemployment meanwhile recovery.

## Inflation Begets Recession â€” The Early 1980's

The last double-dip recession in the United States occurred in the mid 1980s, when the economy experienced back-to-back episodes of recession. From January to July 1980, the economy shrank at a 8 percent annual rate from April to June of that year. A quick period of growth followed, and in the initial three months of 1981, the economy grew at an annual rate of a little over 8 percent. The economy fell back into recession from July 1981 to November 1982. The economy then entered a strong growth period until the end of the 1980s.

These seeds of this double dip recession were laid in the mid 1970's when President Richard Nixon broadly "shut the gold window", breaking the last connection of the U.S. dollar to anything looking like a commodity standard. This converted the U.S. dollar into a full fiat currency with zero physical imperatives on the ability of the Federal Reserves and the banking system under its watch to make unlimited amounts of new money.

This prompted high and now and again quickly speeding up erosion of the dollar's purchasing power all through the 1970's, coming to toward 15% consumer price inflation each year before the decade's over. Persevering inflation in the 1970's directed to a situation known as [stagflation](/stagflation), or high unemployment combined with high inflation, and even feelings of dread that the dollar could collapse in the midst of [hyperinflation](/hyperinflation) or a [crack-up boom](/crackup-boom).

In 1979, President Jimmy Carter named Paul Volcker as Chair of the Federal Reserve with the explicit mission of returning inflation to normal. Volcker decisively slowed the rate of growth in the U.S. money supply to handle price inflation.

This provoked an immediate, however relatively short, recession through the main half of 1980. Through the last part of 1980 and into the finish of 1981 the economy started to recover. Real GDP rose, however unemployment and inflation both remained adamantly high at around 7.5% and 8.8% (respectively) through this period.

With inflation again advancing in late 1981 the Volcker Fed kept up with its tight money/high interest rate policy and the economy reappeared recession. Unemployment rose to 10.8% toward the finish of 1982. During this time Volcker confronted progressively sharp analysis and even dangers of impeachment from the U.S. Congress and Treasury Secretary Donald Regan.

Eventually however, inflation was brought taken care of and the economy quickly recovered from the recession. Unemployment tumbled from its pinnacle just as forcefully as it had risen, in a V-shaped recovery, and the economy entered a new period of relatively stable growth, low unemployment, and gentle inflation later known as the [Great Moderation](/great-moderation).
