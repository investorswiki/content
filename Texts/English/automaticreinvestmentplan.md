# Automatic Reinvestment Plan (ARP)
## What Is an Automatic Reinvestment Plan (ARP)?

The term automatic reinvestment plan (ARP) alludes to a plan that automatically reinvests investment distributions back into an investor's [portfolio](/portfolio). In that capacity, they are reinvested as opposed to paid to the investor. This investment option is commonly found in [dividend reinvestment plans](/dividendreinvestmentplan) (DRIPs) for an assortment of investment vehicles, including mutual funds. Investors who use ARPs benefit in light of compound interest. An ARP isn't equivalent to an automatic investment plan (AIP), which permits investors to contribute new money to an investment account at customary stretches to be invested in a pre-set strategy or portfolio.

## Understanding Automatic Reinvestment Plans (ARPs)

Certain individuals invest their money to generate income. Gains accumulated through these investment vehicles can be taken as cash [distributions](/appropriation) at customary stretches. Yet, there are a few options that permit investors to involve their gains to increase their situations in the investment. Thusly, gains are automatically reinvested back into their portfolios through a program called an automatic reinvestment plan.

ARPs are common in various investment options, like mutual funds and [employee stock options](/eso) (ESOs). Brokerage firms are known to offer ARPs to their clients, as do mutual fund companies and publicly-exchanged companies to their shareholders. On account of a mutual fund, for instance, [capital gains](/capitalgain) and fees created by the fund would be utilized to automatically purchase more shares as opposed to being distributed to the investor as cash.

ARPs assist investors with exploiting the compounding effect to deliver further gains. The additional value delivered over a period of years via automatically reinvesting gains can end up being worth a substantial sum. For example, selecting to reinvest a mutual fund's gains brings about purchasing more shares of the fund. More compound interest aggregates after some time and the cycle of purchasing more shares keeps on aiding the fund. All things considered, an individual's initial investment in it fills quicker in value.

## Special Considerations

Automatic reinvestment plans are a great method for exploiting compound interest. However, taking the dividends and reinvesting in different parts of an investment portfolio can help increase [diversification](/diversification), since reinvesting the dividend back into similar mutual funds means that you're keeping a developing heap of eggs in a similar basket. It could be prudent to utilize the dividends to make secondary safe harbor investments. Reinvesting dividends somewhere else can likewise be part of a [rebalancing](/rebalancing) strategy.

## Benefits of an ARP

As indicated over, one of the benefits of reinvesting the gains earned from an investment is compounding. Compound or compounding interest is calculated on the initial principal balance and on the accumulated interest of previous periods of a [deposit ](/deposit)or [loan](/loan). Compound interest can be considered interest on interest and will cause a sum to develop at a quicker rate than [simple interest](/simple_interest), which is calculated exclusively on the principal amount.

To ascertain compound interest, duplicate the [principal](/principal) amount by one plus the annual interest rate raised to the number of compound periods minus one. The total initial amount of the loan is then deducted from the subsequent value.

This is the closely guarded secret utilizing a speculative investment. Consider investing in a mutual fund with an initial deposit of $5,000 and subsequent continuous annual increases of $2,400 toward the beginning of every year. With an average of 12% annual [return](/return) more than 30 years, the future value of the fund is $798,500. Recollect that compound interest is the difference between the cash contributed to the investment and its genuine [future value](/futurevalue) (FV). In this case, the cumulative interest is $721,500 ($798,500 - $2,400 x 30 = $721,500).

## Automatic Reinvestment Plan (ARP) versus Automatic Investment Plan (AIP)

As referenced before, an ARP is not the same as a [automatic investment plan](/automaticinvestmentplan). While an ARP permits investors to reinvest any gains from an investment back into the plan, an AIP lets investors make ordinary contributions to an investment account automatically. This is typically finished through payroll deductions or by charging a bank account.

AIPs are common options for retirement planning, for example, through employer-sponsored plans [401(k)s](/401kplan) and [individual retirement accounts](/ira) (IRAs). Individuals may likewise decide to have money moved automatically from their checking to savings accounts.

## Illustration of an ARP

One illustration of a type of automatic reinvestment plan is a DRIP, which is a program that permits investors to reinvest their cash dividends into extra shares or fractional shares of the [underlying](/underlying) stock on the dividend payment date.

A DRIP can be set up as an automatic reinvestment arrangement set up through a brokerage or investment company. As referenced over, this option can be initiated straight by a public corporation to its existing [shareholders](/shareholder).
