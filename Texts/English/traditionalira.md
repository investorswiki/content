# Traditional IRA

Starting around 2017, the maximum amount somebody can add to her traditional IRA is $5,500 each year, until age 50, after which the maximum annual contribution becomes $6,500. The account holder can contribute until she turns 70 \u00bd years old, the age at which she must beginning pulling out her money.
The account holder can [deduct](/tax-deduction) her contributions to a traditional IRA from her tax return, which is a tax benefit not offered to holders of other retirement accounts, like the [Roth IRA](/rothira). Furthermore, there is no income limitation on the people who can add to an IRA, however the contributions must be funded with cash and fall under "taxable compensation," which bars tax-exempt income.
