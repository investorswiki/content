# Currency Peg
## What Is a Currency Peg?

A [currency](/currency) peg is a policy wherein a national government sets a specific [fixed exchange rate](/fixedexchangerate) for its currency with a foreign currency or a basket of currencies. Pegging a currency settles the exchange rate between countries. Doing so gives long-term consistency of exchange rates for business planning. In any case, a currency peg can be trying to keep up with and distort markets on the off chance that it is too distant from the natural market price.

## Understanding Currency Pegs

The primary motivation for currency pegs is to support trade between countries by lessening [foreign exchange risk](/foreignexchangerisk). [Profit margins](/profitmargin) for some businesses are low, so a small shift in exchange rates can take out profits and force firms to track down new providers. That is especially true in the highly competitive retail industry.

Countries commonly lay out a currency peg with a more grounded or more developed economy so domestic companies can access more extensive markets with less risk. The U.S. dollar, the euro, and gold have generally been famous options. Currency pegs make stability between trading partners and can stay in place for a really long time. For instance, the Hong Kong dollar has been pegged to the U.S. dollar starting around 1983.

> Just realistic currency pegs pointed toward decreasing volatility can deliver economic benefits. Setting a currency peg falsely high or low makes lopsided characteristics that eventually hurt all countries included.

## Advantages of Pegged Exchange Rates

Pegged currencies can grow trade and lift real livelihoods, especially when currency vacillations are moderately low and show no long-term changes. Without exchange rate risk and [tariffs](/duty), people, businesses, and nations are free to benefit completely from specialization and exchange. As per the theory of [comparative advantage](/comparativeadvantage), everybody will actually want to spend additional time doing what they excel at.

With pegged exchange rates, farmers will actually want to just deliver food overall quite well, instead of spending time and money hedging foreign exchange risk with [derivatives](/subsidiary). Also, technology firms will actually want to zero in on building better PCs. Maybe in particular, retailers in the two countries will actually want to source from the most efficient producers. Pegged exchange rates make all the more long-term investments conceivable in the other country. With a currency peg, fluctuating exchange rates are not continually disturbing supply chains and changing the value of investments.

## Disadvantages of Pegged Currencies

The central bank of a country with a currency peg must monitor supply and demand and oversee cash flow to stay away from spikes in demand or supply. These spikes can make a currency stray from its pegged price. That means the central bank should hold large [foreign exchange reserves](/foreign-exchange-reserves) to counter extreme buying or selling of its currency. Currency pegs influence forex trading by misleadingly stemming [volatility](/volatility).

Countries will experience a specific set of issues when a currency is pegged at an excessively low exchange rate. From one viewpoint, domestic consumers will be denied of the [purchasing power](/purchasingpower) to buy foreign goods. Assume that the Chinese yuan is pegged too low against the U.S. dollar. Then, at that point, Chinese consumers should pay something else for imported food and oil, lowering their consumption and standard of living. Then again, the U.S. farmers and Middle East oil producers who might have sold them more goods lose business. This situation naturally makes trade pressures between the country with an undervalued currency and the remainder of the world.

One more set of issues arises when a currency is pegged at an excessively high rate. A country might be unable to shield the peg after some time. Since the government set the rate too high, domestic consumers will buy too many imports and consume beyond what they can deliver. These persistent [trade deficits](/trade_deficit) will make descending pressure on the home currency, and the government should spend foreign exchange reserves to safeguard the peg. The government's reserves will ultimately be exhausted, and the peg will collapse.

At the point when a currency peg collapses, the country that set the peg too high will out of nowhere find imports more costly. That means inflation will rise, and the nation may likewise experience issues paying its obligations. The other country will find its exporters losing markets, and its investors losing money on foreign assets that are presently not worth as much in domestic currency. Major currency peg breakdowns incorporate the Argentine peso to the U.S. dollar in 2002, the British pound to the German mark in 1992, and ostensibly the U.S. dollar to gold in 1971.

## Illustration of a Currency Peg

Starting around 1986, the Saudi riyal has been pegged at a fixed rate of 3.75 to the USD. The Arab oil embargo of 1973 — Saudi Arabia's response to the United State's association in the Arab-Israeli conflict — accelerated occasions that prompted the currency peg.

The effects of the fleeting embargo devalued the U.S. Dollar and prompted economic turmoil. Subsequently, the Nixon administration drafted a deal with the Saudi government with the hope of reestablishing the USD to the super currency it used to be. From this arrangement, the Saudi government partook in the utilization of U.S. military resources, a wealth of U.S. Treasury savings, and a thriving economy — an economy saturated with the USD.

Around then, the riyal was pegged to the [Special Drawing Rights](/sdr) (SDR) currency, a bucket of several national currencies. Without being pegged to the currency energizing its oil-based economy, inflation rose. Due to high inflation and[ the 1979 Energy Crisis](/1979-energy-crisis), the riyal started to endure devaluation. To save it from total ruin, the Saudi government pegged the riyal to the US Dollar.

The currency peg reestablished stability and lowered inflation. The Saudi Arabian Monetary Authority (SAMA) credits the peg for supporting economic growth in its country and for stabilizing the cost of foreign trade.
