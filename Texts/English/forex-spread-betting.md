## What is Forex Spread Betting?

Forex spread betting permits speculation on the movements of the chose currency without really executing in the [foreign exchange market](/foreign-exchange-markets).

## Grasping Forex Spread Betting

Forex spread betting is a class of [spread betting](/spreadbetting) that includes taking a bet on the price movement of currency pairs. A company offering currency spread betting normally provides two cost estimates, [bid and ask](/bid-askspread) â€” this is called the [spread](/spread). Traders bet whether the price of the currency pair will be lower than the bid price or higher than the ask price. The smaller the spread, the more alluring the currency pair is on the grounds that the transaction cost, the cost of entering and leaving a trade, is lower.

The draw of forex spread betting, and spread betting by and large, lies in its simplicity. There are three principal parts to each spread bet:

1. Spread of the instrument
1. Course of the trade
1. Size of the bet

The advantage of forex spread betting is that it permits traders the ability to use the concept of [leverage](/leverage) while setting a trade. Basically, leverage allows the investor to borrow money, as a rule from the brokerage firm, to place wagers on a currency. The investor need just fulfill the [margin](/margin) requirements, which is the capital required to finance the bet, and not the full amount of the whole wagered.

For instance, a brokerage firm provides an ask cost estimate for the [EUR/USD](/eur-usd-euro-us-dollar-currency-pair) pair at 1.0015 and a bid price at 1.0010. If you, as a trader, accept that the [euro](/euro) will reinforce compared to the [USD](/usd), you could "bet" \u20ac0.5 for each point ([pip](/pip)) the euro increments above 1.0015. If the EUR/USD after a certain period of opportunity arrived to $1.0025, you would receive \u20ac5 (\u20ac0.5 * 10 pips). Assuming the price of the euro was rather $1.0005, you would wind up losing \u20ac5.

Like spread betting, traders don't have to really possess any currency when forex spread betting. Be that as it may, they will require capital in their account in the currency in which the underlying profit or loss is credited or charged. This currency is generally the currency of where the spread betting service is found. For instance, a spread betting site in the U.K. would require British pounds ([GBP](/gbp)) as capital.
