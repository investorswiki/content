# Appraisal Ratio
## What Is the Appraisal Ratio?

An appraisal ratio is a ratio used to measure the quality of a [fund manager](/fundmanager's) investment-picking ability.

The ratio shows the number of units of active return the manager that is delivering per unit of risk. This is accomplished by contrasting the fund's [alpha](/alpha), the amount of excess return the manager has earned over the benchmark of the fund, to the portfolio's unsystematic risk or [residual standard deviation](/residual-standard-deviation).

## Grasping the Appraisal Ratio

Managers of a [active investment](/activemanagement) fund are entrusted with choosing a basket of investments equipped for beating the returns of a significant [benchmark](/benchmark) or the overall market. While that sounds simple in practice, few routinely prevail with regards to achieving this goal, particularly while thinking about the fees that they charge.

Luckily, there are several different ways for [investors](/investor) to examine how great a job fund managers do. One method to decide their investment-picking ability is to utilize the appraisal ratio.

The appraisal ratio measures the managers' performance by contrasting the return of their stock picks to the specific risk of those selections. Alpha, the portion of the return that the active management is responsible for, is compared to [unsystematic risk](/unsystematicrisk): the portion of risk associated with the investments being made as opposed to with the whole [securities](/security) market overall.

The ratio is calculated as follows:

The higher the ratio, the better the performance of the manager being referred to. Low appraisal ratios signal that a fund is inadequately run, facing a ton of risk challenges generate the [returns](/return) it conveys. A high perusing, then again, is positive, inferring that the manager is beating their passive portfolio benchmark without making investors sweat too much by presenting them to excessive risk or [volatiltiy](/unpredictability).

## Appraisal Ratio versus the Sharpe Ratio

Like the appraisal ratio, the [Sharpe ratio](/sharperatio) additionally works as an indicator of [risk-adjusted returns](/riskadjustedreturn). However, there are a few eminent differences.

The Sharpe ratio sorts out the difference between the portfolio return and the [risk-free rate of return](/risk-freerate). The appraisal ratio, then again, is worried about measuring the risk-adjusted return corresponding to a benchmark, like the Standard and Poor's 500 Index (S&P 500), instead of a [risk-free asset](/riskfreeasset) that is guaranteed to generate investors money, like a U.S. Treasury security.

Both financial metrics can prove to be useful. One of the areas where the appraisal ratio maybe has an edge is in its index comparison. [Index funds](/indexfund) are normally the benchmark utilized in looking at investment performance and the market return is generally higher than the risk-free return.

The appraisal ratio is additionally generally more helpful for measuring the consistency of an investment's performance.

## Limitations of the Appraisal Ratio

Ratios that measure risk-adjusted returns can be deciphered in an unexpected way. Not every person is something similar and every investor will have differing [risk tolerance](/risktolerance) levels, contingent upon factors like age, financial situation, [income](/income), and general personality.

Another point worth raising is the entanglements that can emerge while looking at numerous funds against a benchmark. Each fund could have various securities, [asset allocations](/assetallocation) for every sector, and entry points in their investments, making such appraisals hard to decipher.

Similarly as with every single financial ratio, it's generally best to counsel several of them as opposed to depending on just one. The more data that is thought about, the better chance investors have at settling on additional exhaustive and informed conclusions about where to distribute their money.

## Highlights
- Alpha is compared to the portfolio's specific risk, giving investors a snapshot of the number of units of active return the manager that is delivering per unit of risk.
- An appraisal ratio is a ratio used to measure the quality of a fund manager's investment-picking ability.
- The higher the ratio, the better the performance of the manager being referred to.
