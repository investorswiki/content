# Exposure Netting
## What Is Exposure Netting?

Exposure netting is a method of hedging [currency risk](/currencyrisk) by offsetting exposure in one currency with exposure in the equivalent or another comparable currency.

## Understanding Exposure Netting

Exposure [netting](/netting) has the objective of decreasing a company's exposure to exchange rate (currency) risk. It is particularly applicable on account of a large multinational company, whose different currency exposures can be managed as a single portfolio; it is frequently difficult and costly to [hedge](/hedge) every single currency risk of a client exclusively while dealing with numerous international clients.

A firm's exposure netting strategy relies upon a number of factors, including the currencies and sums associated with its payments and receipts, the corporate policy as to hedging currency risk, and the likely correlations between the various currencies to which it has exposure.

Exposure netting permits companies to deal with their currency risk more comprehensively. Assuming a company observes that correlation between exposure currencies is positive, the company would take on a long-short strategy for exposure netting. The justification for doing so is that with a [positive correlation](/positive-correlation) between two currencies, a long-short approach would bring about gains from one currency position offsetting losses from the other. Conversely, on the off chance that the correlation is negative, a long strategy would bring about an effective hedge in the event of currency movement.

Exposure netting should likewise be possible to offset counterbalancing risks of a large portfolio or financial firm among its portfolios. As a [enterprise risk management (ERM)](/enterprise-risk-management) strategy, if portfolio A for a bank is long 1,000 shares of Apple (AAPL) stock and another portfolio B is short 1,000 of Apple, the positions and the exposure to Apple price can be netted out at the managerial level.

Exposure netting normally alludes to netting that occurs inside an organization among its different units, tasks, or portfolios, making it a unilateral netting.

> Netting with another party (e.g., on account of a currency swap), would be considered [bilateral](/bilateral-netting), or even [multilateral netting](/multilateral-netting).

## Exposure Netting Example

Accept Widget Co., situated in Canada, has imported machinery from the United States and routinely [exports](/trade) to Europe. The company must pay $10 million to its U.S. machinery provider in 90 days, when it is likewise anticipating a receipt of EUR 5 million and CHF 1 million for its exports. The spot rate is EUR 1 = USD 1.35, and CHF 1 = USD 1.10. How might Widget Co. use exposure netting to hedge itself?

The company's net currency exposure is USD $2.15 million (i.e., USD $10 million - [(5 x 1.35) + (1 x 1.10)]). In the event that Widget Co. is confident that the Canadian dollar will increase in value throughout the next 90 days, it would sit idle, since a more grounded Canadian dollar would bring about U.S. dollars becoming less expensive in 90 days. Then again, assuming the company is concerned the Canadian dollar might deteriorate against the U.S. dollar, it might choose for lock in its exchange rate in 90 days through a forward contract or a [currency option](/currencyoption). Exposure netting is subsequently a more efficient approach to overseeing currency exposure by survey it as a portfolio, as opposed to hedging every currency exposure separately.
