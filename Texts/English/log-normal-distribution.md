# Log-Normal Distribution
## Definition of Log-Normal Distribution

A log-normal distribution is a statistical distribution of logarithmic values from a connected normal distribution. A log-normal distribution can be meant a normal distribution and vice versa utilizing associated logarithmic estimations.

## Figuring out Normal and Lognormal

A normal distribution is a likelihood distribution of results that is symmetrical or forms a bell curve. In a normal distribution 68% of the outcomes fall inside one standard deviation and 95% fall inside two standard deviations.

While a great many people are know about a normal distribution, they may not be as acquainted with log-normal distribution. A normal distribution can be switched over completely to a log-normal distribution utilizing logarithmic math. That is basically the basis as log-normal distributions can emerge out of a normally distributed set of random variables.

There can be a couple of explanations behind involving log-normal distributions related to normal distributions. By and large, most log-normal distributions are the aftereffect of taking the natural log where the base is equivalent to e=2.718. In any case, the log-normal distribution can be scaled utilizing an alternate base which influences the state of the lognormal distribution.

Overall the log-normal distribution plots the log of random variables from a normal distribution curve. As a rule, the log is known as the type to which a base number must be brought up in order to deliver the random variable (x) that is found along a normally distributed curve.

## Applications and Uses of Log-Normal Distribution in Finance

Normal distributions might introduce a couple of issues that log-normal distributions can tackle. Primarily, normal distributions can allow for negative random variables while log-normal distributions incorporate every single positive variable.

One of the most common applications where log-normal distributions are utilized in finance is in the analysis of stock prices. The possible returns of a stock can be charted in a normal distribution. The prices of the stock, be that as it may, can be diagramed in a log-normal distribution. The log-normal distribution curve can subsequently be utilized to assist better with distinguishing the compound return that the stock can hope to accomplish throughout some stretch of time.

Note that log-normal distributions are positively [skewed](/skewness) with long right tails due to low mean values and high variances in the random variables.

**Lognormal Distribution in Excel**

Lognormal distribution should be possible in Excel. It is found in the statistical capabilities as LOGNORM.DIST.

Succeed characterizes it as the following:

**LOGNORM.DIST (x,mean,standard_dev,cumulative)**

**Returns the lognormal distribution of x, where ln(x) is normally distributed with boundaries mean and standard_dev.**

To work out LOGNORM.DIST in Excel you will require the following:

x = value at which to assess the capability

Mean = the mean of ln(x)

Standard Deviation = the standard deviation of ln(x) which must be positive
