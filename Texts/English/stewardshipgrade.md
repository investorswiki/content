## What Is Stewardship Grade?

A stewardship grade is an assessment of the quality of a company's [governance](/corporategovernance) rehearses, utilized in mutual fund and stock reports issued by [Morningstar](/morningstarinc), the investment research firm.

Stewardship grades for the two funds and stocks range from A (magnificent) to F (exceptionally poor) in light of criteria that measure the viability of fund and corporate managers in reliably acting considering their shareholders' best interests.

## Understanding Stewardship Grades

Morningstar initiated its stewardship grades for both the funds and stocks covered by its investment research services in 2004 after the notorieties of a number of mutual fund companies were discolored by government regulatory examinations concerning their practices.

Morningstar sees a high level of managerial stewardship as an important investment quality for investors to show up their selection of funds and stocks. Its stewardship grade for funds goes past the standard analysis of strategy, risk, and return. It permits investors and advisers to evaluate funds in view of factors that they trust influence the accompanying:

- How funds are run
- The degree to which the management company's and fund board's interests are lined up with fund shareholders
- The degree to which shareholders can anticipate that their interests should be protected from any possibly clashing interests of the management company.

> Morningstar Stewardship Grades are completely separate from Morningstar Star Ratings. A company's Stewardship Grade doesn't influence its Star Rating.

## Morningstar Stewardship Grade Criteria

Morningstar analysts' evaluation of five factors decide the grade for each fund:

1. Regulatory issues
1. Board quality
1. [Manager incentives](/motivation expense)
1. Charges
1. Corporate culture

Morningstar's stewardship grade for funds is totally unique in relation to the Morningstar Rating for funds, ordinarily known as the Star Rating. There is no relationship between the two.

For stocks, three broad areas are analyzed:

- Transparency in financial revealing
- Shareholder kind disposition, incentives, and proprietorship
- Overall stewardship

The stewardship grade endeavors to capture a portion of the intangibles associated with pursuing an investment choice. While the grades are not planned to act as buy or sell signals in disengagement, when combined with other Morningstar analyst critiques — like an assessment of a fund's strategy and management — they can assist with deciding the difference between a wise investment and one to stay away from.

The grades are essentially founded on data aggregated from [public filings](/public) and the aptitude of Morningstar's fund analysts.
