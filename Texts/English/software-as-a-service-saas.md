# Software-as-a-Service (SaaS)
## What Is Software-as-a-Service (SaaS)?

Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) is a software licensing model in which access to the software is given on a subscription basis, with the software being located on external servers rather than on servers located in-house.

Software-as-a-Service is typically accessed through a web browser, with users logging into the system using a username and password. Instead of each client having to install the software on their computer, the client can access the program via the Internet.

## Understanding Software-as-a-Service (SaaS)

The rise of Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) coincides with the rise of [cloud-based computing](/cloud-computing). Cloud computing is the most common way of offering technology services through the Internet, which frequently includes data storage, networking, and servers. Before SaaS was available, companies looking to update the software on their computers had to purchase compact circles containing the updates and download them onto their systems.

For large organizations, updating software was a tedious endeavor. Over the long run, software updates became available for download through the Internet, with companies purchasing additional licenses rather than additional circles. Nonetheless, a copy of the software actually should have been installed on all gadgets that required access to it.

With SaaS, users don't have to install or update any software. Instead, users can sign in through the Internet or web browser and associate with the service supplier's network to access the particular service.

SaaS is viewed as an example of [endogenous growth theory](/endogenousgrowththeory), which is an economic theory that buys into the conviction that economic growth can be achieved through developing new advances and improvements in [production](/manufacturing-production) productivity. Technology companies, financial services companies, and utilities have driven the business world in adopting SaaS technology.

## History of SaaS

SaaS can freely trace its origins to a concept called time-sharing, which was developed in the late 1950s and early 1960s to make more savvy utilization of costly processor time.

Throughout the next couple of decades, hardware and computing became less exorbitant. Organizations made the shift to individual ownership of personal computers using on-premise software. However, unfortunately, the system actually proved to be inefficient on a larger scale as companies were burdened by ongoing software and hardware maintenance of the individual computers.

During the 90s, the Internet reached new levels in terms of web based business transactions, The growth of the Internet then, at that point, filled the introduction of the "online cloud," which allowed organizations to access software from anywhere.

In 1999, Salesforce bet everything on SaaS by launching its own customer relationship management (CRM) platform. Thanks to its head start and "no software" mantra, Salesforce before long became the principal superstar in the SaaS space. It remains one of the largest pure SaaS companies in the U.S.

With Salesforce having proved the viability of the SaaS business model, companies of all shapes and sizes — from youthful startups to established industry giants including Microsoft, Oracle, and SAP — were eager to advance toward it.

Today, SaaS is omnipresent. With pure-play companies like Adobe, Salesforce, Shopify, and Intuit leading the way, the SaaS market is expected to reach $145 billion in 2022.

> With SaaS, users can access software through a web browser from different locations, including outside the office. Remote work area software can assist employees with safely accessing work computers from home or allow technicians to determine computer issues without having to make an on location visit.

## Advantages and Disadvantages of SaaS
### Advantages

SaaS offers a variety of advantages over traditional software licensing models. Because the software doesn't live on the licensing company's servers, there is less demand for the company to invest in new hardware.

It is easy to execute, easy to update and troubleshoot, and can be more affordable (or if nothing else have lower up-front costs) since users pay for SaaS as they go instead of purchasing various software licenses for numerous computers.

SaaS has various applications, including:

- Email services
- Auditing capabilities
- Automating pursue products and services
- Managing documents, including file sharing and document collaboration
- Shared company calendars, which can be utilized for scheduling events
- [Customer relationship management (CRM)](/customer_relation_management) systems, which are essentially a database of client and prospect information. SaaS-based CRMs can be utilized to hold company contact information, business activity, products purchased as well as track leads.

Types of software that have migrated to a SaaS model are many times centered around enterprise-level services, like human resources. These types of tasks are much of the time collaborative in nature, requiring employees from various departments to share, alter, and distribute material while not necessarily in the same office.

### Disadvantages

Drawbacks to the adoption of SaaS center around data security and speed of delivery. Because data is stored on external servers, companies have to be certain that it is safe and cannot be accessed by unauthorized parties.

Slow Internet associations can reduce performance, especially assuming the cloud servers are being accessed from far-off distances. Internal networks will generally be faster than Internet associations. Due to its remote nature, SaaS arrangements also experience the ill effects of a loss of control and a lack of customization.

## Examples of SaaS
### Google Docs

One of the simplest real-world examples of SaaS is Google Docs, Google's free online word processor.

In order to utilize Google Docs, all you want to do is sign in on a web browser for instant access. Google Docs allows you to compose, alter, and even collaborate with others any place you happen to be.

Google Docs was launched in October 2012.

### Dropbox

Dropbox is another simple example of SaaS in real life. Dropbox is a cloud storage service that allows businesses to store, share, and collaborate on files and data. For example, users are able to back up and match up photographs, recordings, and different files to the cloud and access them from any gadget, regardless of where they are.

Dropbox was established in 2007.

## SaaS versus IaaS versus PaaS

As-a-service products continue to rapidly develop. Be that as it may, generally speaking, they fall into one of three main categories: SaaS, IaaS, and PaaS.

SaaS typically utilizes the Internet to deliver subscription software services, which are managed by a third-party vendor. Notable SaaS examples include Dropbox, Google Workspace, and Salesforce.

Infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS), meanwhile, offers access to resources like servers, storage, memory, and different services. It allows organizations to purchase resources as required. A few common IaaS examples include Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, and Rackspace.

Finally, platform-as-a-service (PaaS) gives a software development platform over the web. Specifically, it allows designers to concentrate on software creation without worrying about things like storage and infrastructure.

### What Is B2B SaaS?
