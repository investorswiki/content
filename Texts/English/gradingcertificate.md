## True Example

A coffee futures contract indicates the delivery of 37,500 pounds of:

>
> "Washed arabica coffee of the growths of Brazil, Burundi, Colombia, Costa Rica, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, Guatemala, Honduras, India, Kenya, Mexico, Papua New Guinea, Nicaragua, Panama, Peru, Rwanda, Salvador, Tanzania, Uganda, or Venezuela."
>

Moreover, the ICE determines:

>
> "Coffee 'C' will comprise of one (1) growth, in sound condition, free from all unwashed and aged flavors in the cup, of good broiling quality, and of bean size and variety as per criteria laid out by the Exchange. No delivery will be permitted of coffee containing more than fifteen (15) full flaws below the basis for the separate growth, then again, actually on account of Colombian coffee no delivery will be permitted of coffee containing more than ten (10) full defects below the basis for the individual growth. Blemishes will be laid out on the basis of a grading schedule laid out by the Exchange."
>

Then, at that point, a master sampler (who is haphazardly chosen from among a rundown of eligible and fair graders) will investigate the deliverable coffee from a 5x8" aluminum plate with 1.2" sidewalls. Examining now less than six cups tested from the batch, the grader will assess its neatness, bean size, smell, flavor, roastability, and blemishes (like crude, off-scent, broken shells, and so on.). The master sampler will then, at that point, review a grading report and a relating certificate will be issued by the exchange.

> The fee for grading a commodity is paid by the one requesting the grading certificate. On account of grading coffee contracts, the ICE charges $1.25 per bag of coffee with a base fee of $40.
