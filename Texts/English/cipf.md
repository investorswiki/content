# Canadian Investor Protection Fund (CIPF)
## What is the Canadian Investor Protection Fund?

The Canadian Investor Protection Fund is a [not-for-profit](/not-for-benefit) insurance program laid out by the provincial and regional securities regulators across Canada. The Canadian Investor Protection Fund is intended to shield investors from the bankruptcy of an individual investment firm.

Accounts are covered for up to $1 million in [shortfalls](/shortfall) in an account with securities, commodity and futures contracts, segregated insurance funds or cash. A shortfall is the difference between the market value of the account and what the bankrupt company can return to the customer. While investment firms rarely become ruined, the CIPF exists to safeguard the investment accounts of customers.

## Understanding the Canadian Investor Protection Fund (CIPF)

The Canadian Investor Protection Fund just shields investors for losses that outcome from the insolvency of an investment firm. It doesn't shield investors from losses that happen in light of the fact that an investor put money in a fund that was not fitting for their risk profile, in light of the fact that the investor was duped or controlled, on the grounds that poor data was given to a client or in light of the fact that a client was deluded. There might be other [recourse](/recourse) for investors who are survivors of such behavior, yet the Canadian Investor Protection Fund won't restore such investors.

CIPF insurance is purchased by member firms through the Canadian Investor Protection Fund. However long you have an investment account with a member firm, you don't have to purchase extra insurance, and you benefit from the insurance at no charge. Even non-Canadian inhabitants who have investment accounts with Canadian member firms can benefit from the insurance program.

The Canadian Investor Protection Fund is in some cases mistook for the [Canadian Deposit Insurance Corporation](/cdic), a corporation laid out by the Canadian Federal government in 1967 to guarantee consumer banking deposits. The Canadian Investor Protection Fund is more liberal than Canadian deposit insurance. While consumer savings deposits are insured up to $100,000 Canadian, an investor can receive upwards of $1 million Canadian in investor protection.
