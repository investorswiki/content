# Cut-Through Clause
## What Is a Cut-Through Clause?

A cut-through clause is a [reinsurance](/reinsurance) contract provision that permits a party, other than the [ceding company](/ceding-company) and reinsurance company, to have rights under the agreement. Cut-through clauses are much of the time set off by specific events, for example, while a ceding company becomes indebted.

## How a Cut-Through Clause Works

The relationship between the ceding company and [reinsurer](/reinsurer) changes when a cut-through clause is available. A reinsurance contract is made between a ceding company, for example, a [insurance](/insurance) company, and a reinsurance company. An insurance company is generally at risk of an event happening that would result in a payout of [insurance claims](/insurance_claim) made by their policyholders. An insurance company can reduce the risk of their policies being paid out by ceding or transferring a portion of their policies to another insurer-called a reinsurer. The reinsurance company gets a portion of the ceding company's policies and in exchange, gets compensated a portion of the [premiums](/premium) earned by the ceding company-called the [cedent](/cedent)- from its policyholder customers.

Thus, the reinsurance company consents to [indemnify](/reimbursement) the ceding company from claims made. The reinsurance contract is commonly between the ceding company and the reinsurer and no different parties, like policyholders. At the end of the day, even the insured can't force the reinsurance company to act since the insured isn't part of the contractual relationship between the cedent and reinsurer. Be that as it may, a cut-through clause changes this contractual relationship permitting an outsider to have rights against the reinsurance company.

Nonetheless, those rights only kick in assuming the cut-through provision has been set off. The cut-through provision is a clause inside the reinsurance agreement that permits an outsider to have rights in certain conditions. A cut-through clause basically cuts through the contract. In any case, a cut-through [endorsement](/endorsement) could be neeeded too, which is a separate add-on permitting an outsider to file a claim for damages from the reinsurer if the cedent is unable to pay.

## How a Cut-Through Clause is Used

Cut-through clauses are generally commonly appended to reinsurance agreements while the ceding company is battling or turns out to be financially [insolvent](/bankruptcy), meaning it can't pay its obligations. A cut-through endorsement could likewise be incorporated, which takes into consideration financial payouts by the reinsurer for claims. Normally, the insured parties getting rights under the clause are most needing protection when the insurance company is bankrupt and can't make payments on claims, or is liquidated by insurance regulators.

Insurance policies and the relationships between the reinsurance companies, cedents, and the insureds can turn out to be very complex. Even reinsurers, for instance, surrender a portion of their policies to other reinsurers in a cycle called retrocession. The getting reinsurance company of policies from another reinsurer is called the retrocessionaire.

These actions of ceding policies starting with one insurance company then onto the next assists the insurance industry with spreading out the risk of claims being paid by one insurer. At the end of the day, ceding policies assist with preventing one insurer from enduring the brunt of payouts following a major event, like a natural disaster.

A cut-through clause permits outsiders, for example, reinsurers, insurance companies, and policyholders, to change the original reinsurance agreement and gain access to funds or rights inside that agreement.

Nonetheless, conditions can become testing when a reinsurer has an obligation to the cedent, while the policyholders are likewise filing a claim for money from the cedent. Thus, a reinsurer might be gotten between conflicting requests between the insured, the cedent, and other reinsurers. An obviously defined cut-through clause can help in these difficult situations, particularly if the cedent is bankrupt.
