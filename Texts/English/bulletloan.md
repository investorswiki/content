## What Is a Bullet Loan?

A bullet loan is commonly alluded to as a balloon loan that requires a [balloon payment](/balloon-payment), generally a large balance, and a last payment due at the maturity of a loan.

Throughout the borrowing period, the only payment made, if any, is the interest expense, and the original principal borrowed is paid toward the finish of the lending term. Bullet loans are more normal in commercial real estate than in residential real estate.

## How a Bullet Loan Works

Most bullet loans are issued for land contracts to real-estate designers. A bullet loan doesn't fully amortize over the term of the note, consequently leaving a large principal balance due at maturity. The term "bullet" alludes to the large lump sum payment, typically the full value of the principal, due at the loan's maturity.

A borrower is approved for a maximum principal amount determined through the customary [underwriting process](/underwriting). The loan can then be structured in more ways than one, contingent upon how the borrower needs to repay it.

Bullet loan borrowers might be offered a zero payments option over the life of the loan or interest-only payments.

At the point when a zero payment loan is offered, interest will accrue as per the loan terms, normally month to month or every year, and the borrower will be required to pay the total balance as a large lump sum of both principal and accrued interest at maturity.

In an interest-only bullet loan, the borrower is required to make consistently scheduled interest payments. This decreases the bullet or balloon payment at maturity to the amount of the loan's total principal.

Bullet loans are generally viewed as short-term financing and can be offered with shifting durations, contingent upon how soon the borrower hopes to repay. Due to the flexibility gave to borrowers, lenders ordinarily charge higher rates of interest for bullet loans.

Bullet loans can be secured or unsecured. Frequently, bullet or balloon loans are utilized to purchase undeveloped land, which gives less collateral than a fully developed property. A few designers might decide to buy single plots of land with bullet loans, while others might utilize a bullet loan for fostering a whole region with various parcels of land.

## Upsides and downsides of a Bullet Loan

Bullet loans offer the benefits of lower interest-only or zero payments and loan structure flexibility. In any case, bullet loans may likewise have a generally higher interest rate and the disservice of the large payment toward the finish of the loan term.

Designers frequently initially benefit from a bullet loan on a building project and structure the loan's duration in view of their expectations of how long the project will take to complete. Nonetheless, engineers may not receive cash flow from the project to support standard loan payments until it is done when they have real property to sell to pay for the cost of the loan. The bullet payment might come due also before cash flow has begun.

Numerous builders opt for a [take-out loan](/take-out-loan) to refinance their debt. In a take-out loan, the borrower offers the recently completed buildings as [collateral](/collateral) for another loan and afterward utilizes that money to pay off the existing bullet loan.
