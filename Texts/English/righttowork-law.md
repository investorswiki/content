A right-to-work law gives workers the freedom to pick the choice about whether to join a [labor union](/labor-union) in the workplace. This law likewise makes it optional for employees in unionized workplaces to pay for union duty or other participation fees required for union representation, regardless of whether they are in the union. Right-to-work is otherwise called workplace freedom or workplace decision.

## Seeing Right-to-Work Laws

Currently, 27 states have passed right-to-work laws, providing employees with the decision of the choice about whether to join a union. Right-to-work laws in these states prohibit contracts that expect workers to join a labor union to find or keep a line of work.

States without right-to-work laws expect employees to pay union levy and fees as a term for employment. While labor unions are still completely usable in right-to-work states, the law protects these states' employees by making payment of union fees an elective decision not bound to the employees' employment contracts.

## History of Right-to-Work Laws

In 1935, the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA), or the Wagner Act, was endorsed into law by President Franklin Roosevelt. The Act protected the rights of employees to make a self-coordinated organization and ordered employers to take part in [collective bargaining](/collective-bargaining) and employment talks with these self-coordinated organizations, called labor unions. Employees were likewise constrained to pay the union for addressing and protecting their interests. The NLRA required union participation as a condition for employment, in this manner limiting employment to union individuals as it were.

In 1947, President Harry Truman amended parts of the NLRA when he passed the [Taft-Hartley Act](/tafthartleyact). This Act made current right-to-work laws, which permit states to prohibit compulsory enrollment in a union as a condition for employment in the public and private sectors of the country.

In February 2021, Congress once again introduced the National Right to Work Act. It would give employees cross country a decision to opt-out of joining or paying contribution to unions. The Act was additionally presented in 2019 and 2017 yet stalled.

In March 2021, the United States House of Representatives passed the Protecting the Right to Organize Act (PRO Act). The pro-union legislation supersedes right-to-work laws and would make it simpler to form unions. The PRO Act faces a difficult task in the Senate, as most Republicans go against it.
