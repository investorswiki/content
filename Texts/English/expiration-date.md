## What Is an Expiration Date?

An expiration date is the last day that a consumable product, for example, food or medication will be at its best quality, as per the manufacturer. There are important differences between expiration dates on food and those on medication:

- Expiration dates on food products are not required by federal law, aside from newborn child formula. At the point when they're utilized, they as a rule show that the food ought to have its best taste and surface up until that date. It is an assurance of quality, not an assurance of safety.
