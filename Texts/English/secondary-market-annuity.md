# Secondary Market Annuity (SMA)
## What Is a Secondary Market Annuity (SMA)?

A secondary market [annuity](/annuity) (SMA) is a transaction wherein the current owner of a [income annuity](/income_annuity) trades their future income payments for a lump sum payment. Annuities are commonly intended to offer a constant flow of income for the owner either right away or eventually. Be that as it may, a secondary market annuity allows an investor to take the one-time payment rather than a flood of payments over numerous years.

## Figuring out a Secondary Market Annuity (SMA)

Secondary market annuities started during the 1980s and have turned into a profitable business, taking special care of the people who wish to receive a lump sum of cash and the individuals who wish for high-yield investments with next to zero risk.

Purchasing an annuity includes the investor paying for it by means of a series of payments, like month to month, or a lump sum payment. Thusly, the financial provider, which may be an insurance company, consents to pay back the owner a constant flow of payments.

Assuming that you have an annuity, it means you collect annual or regularly scheduled payments, typically until the end of your life. Instances of annuity income streams incorporate the following:

- Insurance money
- Lottery payoffs
- Claim settlements
- Money left to someone as part of a [will](/will)

Normally, annuities, with their proceeded, fixed income stream are great for people in [retirement](/retirement-arranging), who are guaranteed income during a period of their life when they will not be getting a consistent salary or wage. Contingent upon your situation, getting annuity payments more than several years may not be great, and you might be better off selling the annuity at a fixed cost to a buyer interested in the annuity.

According to the point of perspective on the buyer, secondary market annuities will generally have high-interest rates and low risk, so they are a decent long-term investment. Buyers of secondary market annuities ought to be already financially stable to have the option to invest a large amount of money without the option of hauling it out.

## Secondary Market Annuity (SMA) Process

Secondary market annuities are frequently bought from the original owner with an inclusion from intermediaries and courts of some sort or another. SMAs are typically endorsed by credit-rated insurance organizations; the common issuers of the underlying annuities.

A secondary market annuity buyer can hope to receive annual payments and a [interest rate](/interestrate), contingent upon the terms of the annuity. Compared to comparative annuity products, yields on secondary market annuities are ordinarily higher in light of the fact that SMAs are sold at a discount to understand a lump-sum payment in advance.

The normal terms for secondary market annuities range from five to 20 years, yet they can be all around as short as one year or up to 35. Secondary market annuities with deferred start dates and those that apply to longer amounts of time commonly have the highest yields.

When the transfer is made, the buyer of the secondary market annuity will receive payments from the original annuity insurance company or another entity. The annuity is as yet paid similarly, yet the beneficiary is unique.

## Special Considerations

Regularly, secondary market annuities can't be sold; the buyer must hold on to it for the life of the contract. The buyer can't take out an advance on the payments. Likewise, there are frequently [bureaucratic](/organization) issues in the court that keep secondary market annuities from being approved, so it could take surprisingly long for a buyer to get the annuity and begin getting payments.
