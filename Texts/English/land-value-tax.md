# Land Value Tax (LVT)
## What Is a Land Value Tax?

A land value tax is a more unsurprising method for taxing property based exclusively on the value of a package of land and no associated structures. The concept of a land value tax traces all the way back to the beginning of agrarian societies while choosing how to tax landowners fairly for the benefit of the larger community was a common social goal.

## Understanding the Land Value Tax

A land value tax (LVT) is expected to fairly value land, which is a finite asset with a base value that doesn't change as dramatically as the designs based upon the land. Changes in land not entirely settled to a great extent by what occurs with and around the land. For instance, a section of land of land in a rural setting may not contribute as a lot to the encompassing economy as a similar estimated plot in a midtown urban location, where the location may be next to another food distribution center requiring an extra loading dock.

From the earliest times, land has been seen by societies as an asset that can't be owned by an individual in the traditional feeling of responsibility, yet rather something to be treated as a rental passing from one generation to another. It is the human activity embraced on a bundle of land that largely decides its overall value, and that activity is quite often linked to the wealth of the landowner, so a land value tax is seen as a fairer basis for deciding tax responsibility. This has driven us to our modern-day system of [assessing](/assessor) land and structures separately for taxation purposes.

LVT is otherwise called a site valuation tax, an illustration of a [ad valorem tax](/advaloremtax). Promotion Valorem is the Latin phrase signifying "as per value." Modern instances of these are most commonly found in the [municipal land assessments](/assessedvalue) homeowners receive every year, wherein their land is valued separately from the different structures on their land. A homeowner can make improvements to the structures on the land, changing the taxable value. Be that as it may, the land itself will in general keep a more stable value over the long haul. The opposite is likewise true on account of a his landowner structures fall into deterioration. In this case, the overall property taxes paid to the community will be not exactly before, yet the land itself keeps up with pretty much its original worth, which will be important when a potential buyer is thinking about their tax burden and the real value of what they are purchasing.

## Deadweight Loss and the Land Value Tax

Changes in property values still up in the air by market swings and can be very unpredictable. These changes make what business analysts call [deadweight loss](/deadweightloss), which is the measure of the loss to society in general. These losses have extensive adverse effects in funding the essential services any prosperous society needs, like police, fire and salvage.

The land value tax mitigates these market drops by isolating the more stable value of the land from the structures in making a sensible system for real estate taxation.

## Features
- A land value tax (LVT) is a method of surveying property taxes that main thinks about the value of the land itself and related improvements, and not the designs based on the land.
- Land value taxes are instances of promotion valorem taxation and are leaned toward by certain financial specialists since land value will in general be more stable than that of houses or different structures.
- A LVT is viewed as an all the more fair method of land taxation for agricultural locales where the land is useful.
