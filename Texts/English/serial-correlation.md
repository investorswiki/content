# Serial Correlation
## What Is a Serial Correlation?

Serial correlation happens in a [time series](/timeseries) when a variable and a lagged rendition of itself (for instance a variable at times T and at T-1) are seen to be correlated with each other over periods of time. Repeating patterns often show serial correlation when the level of a variable affects its future level. In finance, this [correlation](/correlation) is utilized by technical analysts to determine how well the past price of a security predicts the future price.

Serial correlation is like the statistical concepts of [autocorrelation](/autocorrelation) or lagged correlation.

## Serial Correlation Explained

Serial correlation is utilized in statistics to portray the relationship between observations of similar variable over specific periods. In the event that a variable's serial correlation is measured as zero, there is no correlation, and every one of the observations is independent of each other. On the other hand, on the off chance that a variable's serial correlation slants toward one, the observations are serially correlated, and future observations are affected by past values. Essentially, a variable that is serially correlated has a pattern and isn't random.

[Blunder terms](/errorterm) happen when a model isn't completely accurate and results in that frame of mind during true applications. At the point when blunder terms from different (normally adjacent) periods (or cross-section observations) are correlated, the mistake term is serially correlated. Serial correlation happens in time-series studies when the errors associated with a given period carry over into future periods. For instance, while predicting the growth of stock dividends, an overestimate in one year will lead to overestimates in succeeding years.

[Technical analysis](/technicalanalysis) utilizes measures of serial correlation while examining a security's pattern. The analysis depends entirely on a stock's price movement and associated volume rather than an organization's fundamentals. Practitioners of technical analysis, in the event that they utilize serial correlation correctly, identify and validate the profitable patterns or a security or group of securities and spot investment opportunities.

## The Concept of Serial Correlation

Serial correlation was initially utilized in engineering to determine how a signal, for example, a computer signal or radio wave, fluctuates compared to itself over the long run. The concept filled in popularity in economic circles as economists and practitioners of econometrics utilized the measure to examine economic data over the long haul.

Almost all large financial institutions presently have quantitative analysts, known as quants, on staff. These financial trading analysts utilize technical analysis and other statistical inductions to investigate and predict the stock market. These modelers attempt to identify the structure of the correlations to further develop forecasts and the potential profitability of a strategy. In addition, identifying the correlation structure works on the authenticity of any simulated time series in light of the model. Accurate simulations reduce the risk of investment strategies.

Quants are integral to the progress of large numbers of these financial institutions since they give market models that the institution then utilizes as the basis for its investment strategy.

Serial correlation among these quants is determined utilizing the [Durbin-Watson (DW) test](/durbin-watson-statistic). The correlation can be either positive or negative. A stock price showing positive serial correlation has a positive pattern. A security that has a negative serial correlation impacts itself over the long haul.

## Highlights
- A variable that is serially correlated indicates that it may not be random.
- Serial correlation is the relationship between a given variable and a lagged rendition of itself throughout different time intervals.
- Technical analysts validate the profitable patterns of a security or group of securities and determine the risk associated with investment opportunities.
- It measures the relationship between a variable's current value given its past values.
