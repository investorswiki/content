# Recovery Rate
## What Is the Recovery Rate?

Recovery rate is the degree to which [principal](/principal) and [accrued interest](/accruedinterest) on defaulted debt can be recuperated, communicated as a percentage of face value. The recovery rate can likewise be defined as the value of a security when it rises up out of default or bankruptcy.

The recovery rate empowers an estimate to be made of the loss that would emerge in the [event of default](/event-of-default), which is calculated as (1 - Recovery Rate). Hence, assuming that the recovery rate is 60%, the [loss given default](/lossgivendefault) or LGD is 40%. On a $10 million debt instrument, the estimated loss emerging from default is consequently $4 million.

## Understanding Recovery Rates

Recovery rates can fluctuate widely, as they are impacted by a number of factors, for example, instrument type, corporate issues and macroeconomic conditions. The type of instrument and its seniority inside the corporate [capital structure](/capitalstructure) are among the main determinants of the recovery rate. The recovery rate is straightforwardly proportional to the instrument's seniority, and that means that an instrument that is more senior in the capital structure will ordinarily have a higher recovery rate than one that is further down in the capital structure.

Corporate issues incorporate the company's capital structure, its level of indebtedness and amount of equity. Debt instruments issued by a company with a lower level of debt corresponding to its assets might have higher recovery rates than a company with substantially more debt.

Macroeconomic conditions incorporate the stage of the economic cycle, [liquidity](/liquidity) conditions and the overall default rate. On the off chance that a large number of companies are defaulting on their debt — as would be the case during a deep recession — the recovery rates might be lower than during normal economic times. For instance, Standard and Poor's estimated that for all issuers that arose out of default during the difficult 2008-2010 period, the average recovery rate across all instruments was 49.5%, compared with the 51.1% average over the 1987-2007 period.

## Recovery Rate and Lending

In lending, the recovery rate can be applied to cash extended by means of loans or credit and recuperated by [foreclosure](/foreclosure) or bankruptcy. Knowing how to appropriately work out and apply a recovery rate can assist organizations with setting rates and terms for future credit transactions. For instance, in the event that a recovery rate ends up being lower than expected, lenders can increase interest rates on a loan or abbreviate its payout cycle to better deal with the additional risk.

## Working out Recovery Rate

To work out recovery rate, one must initially pick what type of group to zero in on and set a time span, like weeks, months or years. When a target group is recognized, include how much money was extended to it throughout the given time span and afterward include the total sum paid back by that group. Next, partition the total payment amount by the total amount of debt. The outcome is the recovery rate. For instance, during multi week you extended $15,000 in credit and received $2,000 in payments, accordingly $2,000/$15,000 = 13.33% recovery rate for the week.

## Features
- The recovery rate is the estimated percent of a loan or obligation that will in any case be repaid to creditors in the event of a default or bankruptcy.
- In a company's capital structure, the recovery rate on senior collateralized debt will frequently have the highest recovery rate, while equity holders can frequently expect a recovery rate of close to zero.
- Following the wave of defaults following the 2008 financial crisis, the estimated recovery rate across debt interests was around 49.5%, lower than the 51.1% recovery rate saw over the previous decade.
