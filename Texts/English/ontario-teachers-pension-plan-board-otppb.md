# Ontario Teachers' Pension Plan Board (OTPPB)
## What Is the Ontario Teachers' Pension Plan Board (OTPPB)?

The Ontario Teachers' Pension Plan Board (OTPPB) manages the retirement plan that was laid out for the benefit of public school teachers in Ontario.

## Understanding the Ontario Teachers' Pension Plan Board (OTPPB)

The Ontario Teachers' Pension Plan Board (OTPPB) administers the [defined benefit plan](/definedbenefitpensionplan) shared by teachers at public schools in Ontario, the most populous province in Canada. The board was laid out in 1990 and has since become one of the largest investment funds in Canada.

As of the beginning of 2022, the [pension plan](/pensionplan) held roughly CAD $227.7 billion in investments. These assets serve the requirements of in excess of 300,000 retired folks and employees. Prior to the foundation of OTPPB, teachers' pensions were managed wholly by the provincial government.

Under the government's oversight, the pension fund invested solely in low-risk [government bonds](/government-security). A critical part of OTPPB's command at its inception was to make a more sophisticated and diversified investment system. Simultaneously, the plan's obligations to current and future retired folks expect it to maintain a conservative approach to risk.

Like any pension fund, OTPPB's fundamental goal is to oversee funding risk, the risk that assets and returns fail to fulfill the plan's obligations to its participants. OTPPB presently deals with different assets, including international equities, commodities, natural resources, and real estate.

## The OTPPB and the Canadian Model

OTPPB was an early trailblazer in the development of a pension management style known as the Canadian Model. Other pension funds like the Ontario Municipal Employees Retirement System (OMERS) have followed suit, and Canadian plans have accomplished a global reputation as leaders in effective and responsible management. The OTPPB depicts the mainstays of this system as independence, strong internal [governance](/corporategovernance) starting with board individuals, direct investment, and an emphasis on retaining ability.

In practice, the most important phase in this innovation was to bring investment management as a rule in-house. This frequently means that the board will go into bargains directly as opposed to utilize a [private equity](/privateequity) firm as an intermediary. Managing investments directly allows OTPPB to keep costs low and to keep to a long-term approach that can conflict with the investment strategies of non-pension funds.

OTPPB has likewise made progress by maintaining a board that has kept away from political worries that have frequently struck other public pension institutions. Board individuals have would in general come from foundations in finance as opposed to political or public service. Large funds in the United States, paradoxically, will generally have boards drawn from a more extensive scope of foundations, frequently leading to conflicts in oversight.

Finally, OTPPB's adaptation of the Canadian Model includes executive pay that is out of scale with its counterparts in the United States. OTPPB executive pay is competitive with [Bay Street](/baystreet), the investment community in Toronto, and is structured to reward long-term returns. Pension managers in the United States, for comparison, will generally receive compensation far below the standards of Wall Street.
