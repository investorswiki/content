## What is a Hammer Clause?

This cap might be set, for instance, at the amount the insurer imagines that the settlement is worth. On the off chance that the insured won't settle, it very well might be responsible for its own defense costs.

We will investigate any such claim we consider proper. We won't settle any claim without your written consent, which will not be preposterously held back. You and we consent to talk with one another to determine any differences to such settlement**.

## Illustration of the Hammer Clause

For instance, consider a manufacturer that is being sued for wounds supported by consumers who utilized its product. The manufacturer's liability policy requires the insurer to protect the manufacturer in court.

The insurer might perceive that guarding the insured will be a long cycle and that the consumer claim might be finished rapidly by offering a settlement. The manufacturer, notwithstanding, doesn't need the settlement since it will cost it money out-of-pocket. A hammer clause will permit the insurer to urge the manufacturer to settle.
