# Asset-or-Nothing Put Option
## What Is an Asset-or-Nothing Put Option?

An asset-or-nothing put option gives a fixed payoff if the price of the [underlying asset](/underlying-asset) is below the [strike price](/strikeprice) on the option's [expiration date](/expirationdate). On the off chance that rather it is over the strike price, the option terminates worthless.

Asset-or-nothing put options are a type of [binary option](/binary-option), which are otherwise called "[digital options](/binary-option)." They are so named in light of the fact that their prosperity or disappointment depends on a yes-or-no (binary) proposition.

## Figuring out Asset-or-Nothing Put Options

Dissimilar to standard put options, asset-or-nothing put options don't pay the difference between the strike price and market price of the underlying asset. As a matter of fact, asset-or-nothing put options don't permit the option holder to take a position in the underlying asset by any stretch of the imagination. All things considered, they basically give a fixed payout in the event that the market price is below the strike price at the hour of expiration.

Most asset-or-nothing put options are traded outside of the United States, and are normally structured as [European options](/europeanoption). Dissimilar to [American-style](/americanoption) options, European options must be practiced on their [maturity date](/maturitydate). Albeit a few binary options really do permit execution before the expiration date, this normally diminishes the payout received.

> ### Binary Options
> Inside the United States, a well known scene for trading binary options is the North American Derivatives Exchange (Nadex), a Chicago-based platform that is regulated by the [Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC)](/cftc).

## Real World Example of an Asset-or-Nothing Put Option

Assume you are an options trader who accepts that shares in XYZ Corporation are probably going to fall this Friday, due to a [earnings report](/earningsreport) that you suspect will dishearten investors. The shares are right now trading for $30 each, and despite the fact that you question that the fall will be too sensational, you are very sure that a decline will happen.

Looking for a method for profitting from your prediction, you find an asset-or-nothing put option that terminates on Friday, toward the finish of the trading day, with a strike price of $25. The terms of the contract state that assuming the market price of XYZ shares is below $25 toward the finish of trading on Friday, then, at that point, you will receive a fixed sum of $50. In the event that then again, the shares are above $25, your payout will be zero. Persuaded that XYZ will decline below $25 on Friday, you choose to purchase the option.

On Friday, XYZ reports earnings that are even more frustrating than you envisioned. The reaction from investors and [analysts](/examiner) is unequivocally negative, with the stock declining the whole way to $10 per share.

Before the day's over, you have mixed sentiments. From one viewpoint, your asset-or-nothing put option was profitable, giving a fixed sum of $50. Then again, on the off chance that the option you purchased had been a standard (or "[plain vanilla](/plainvanilla)") put option rather than an asset-or-nothing put option, you could have profited even more from XYZ's staggering decline.

## Features
- These binary options pay a foreordained payout, or else or zero at expiration.
- Asset-or-nothing put options settle with the physical delivery of the underlying asset in the event that the option terminates in the money.
- Asset-or-nothing options can be a simplified risk hedge.
