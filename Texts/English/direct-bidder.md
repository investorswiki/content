# Direct Bidder
## What Is a Direct Bidder?

A direct bidder is an entity or individual that purchases Treasury securities at auction for a house account as opposed to in the interest of another party.

## Figuring out a Direct Bidder

At the point when an individual or entity purchases for their own account instead of buying for another person, that individual or entity is a direct bidder. Direct bidders incorporate primary dealers, non-primary dealers, [hedge funds](/hedgefund), pension funds, [mutual funds](/mutualfund), insurers, banks, state run administrations, and individuals.

Each U.S. Treasury bill, note, bond, [floating-rate note](/frn) (FRN), or [Treasury inflation-protected security](/tips) (TIPS) is sold at a public [auction](/auction). The Treasury Department has permitted direct bidding on securities, both competitively and noncompetitively, since auctions previously came into utilization.

## Bidding Process

[Competitive bids](/competitivebid) require the direct bidder to determine the ideal return, with the number of securities succeeded at auction contingent upon the highest competitive discount rate. A noncompetitive bid doesn't need the bidder to demonstrate the ideal return. Noncompetitive bids must be $5 million or less. The Treasury acknowledges every noncompetitive bid, and afterward competitive bids arranged by expanding yield.

Bidders can place their bids over determined systems that are made accessible to those gatherings interested in purchasing at auction. Institutional bidders utilize the Treasury Automated Auction Processing System (TAAPS). TAAPS acknowledges both competitive and noncompetitive bids. Real bidders, which are principally individuals, can utilize Treasury Direct and Legacy Treasury Direct. These two systems just acknowledge noncompetitive bids.

After an auction has ended, the Treasury Department declares the dollar amount of securities purchased by primary dealers and other direct bidders, as well as indirect bidders. This data incorporates the amount purchased by each group. All fruitful bidders are granted securities at a similar price, which is the price that compares to the highest rate, [yield](/yield), or discount margin of the competitive bids accepted.

[Primary dealers](/primarydealer) purchase debt directly from the Treasury and exchange it to their clients at a foreordained price. For quite a long time, primary dealers contained the majority of the participation in auctions yet their dominance has been declining for quite a long time.

## Requirements and Limitations of a Direct Bidder

To take part in a Treasury auction, an entity or individual must just present a tender with a bid for the security they might want to purchase. Participants can bid either noncompetitively or competitively, however not the two different ways in a similar auction.

Noncompetitive bidders are permitted to bid somewhere in the range of $100 and $5 million in $100 increases. Competitive bidders can bid with more than one competitive bid, in any case, the Treasury doesn't consider bids that are at a rate or yield greater than 35% of the offering amount.

The Treasury has permitted direct bidding however long it has led security auctions. Any entity or individual might bid directly as long as the entity or individual has made every one of the vital arrangements for access to the specific systems and has made legitimate arrangements for delivery and payment available to be purchased awards.

For institutions, payment is generally made by charging the bidder's account at the [Federal Reserve](/federalreservebank) or through a clearing bank in the event that there is no account at the Federal Reserve. For retail bidders, payment is charged from their bank account.

On the off chance that organizations shift from bidding through primary dealers, alluded to as indirect bidding, to bidding directly themselves, it very well may be more hard for other primary dealers to measure the level of interest in securities auctions.

Banks that act as primary dealers were named in a 2017 claim charging that they plotted to share data on customer orders to rig Treasury auctions in support of themselves.
