## What Is a Super Currency?

A super currency is a speculative global currency or [supranational](/supranational) currency, that would be backed by a basket of reserve currencies at the [International Monetary Fund](/imf) (IMF), and form the basis for another global monetary system. The thought has attracted new interest after the financial crisis, and it has been advanced by China and the remainder of the [BRICS](/brics) (Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa).

## Figuring out a Super Currency

A super currency would supplant the current U.S. dollar-overwhelmed system, which some fault for the undeniably continuous global financial crises since the collapse in 1971 of the [Bretton Woods](/brettonwoodsagreement) system of fixed however adjustable exchange rates - in view of its volatility. What's more, many, as neo-Keynesian economist [Joseph Stiglitz](/joseph-stiglitz) and investor [George Soros](/soros), consider it to be another heading for the development of the global economy.

Prior to that, economist [John Maynard Keynes](/john_maynard_keynes) had proposed at Bretton Woods a supranational world currency referred to as **Bancor** as soon as the 1940s as a method for advancing global monetary stability, yet this was dismissed for the gold-backed currency system. The Bancor currency would have been utilized in all international trade and to settle global financial transactions. The thought gained restored interest following the 2008 global financial crisis yet again failed to gain traction.

## Supplanting the U.S. Dollar System

In 2010, the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development called for another global currency to supplant the U.S. dollar as the world's predominant [reserve currency](/reservecurrency). As conceived, an enormously expanded [special drawing rights](/sdr) (SDRs) at the IMF, with customary or consistently adjusted emissions aligned to the size of reserve gatherings, would be the basis for a global super currency that would add to "global stability, economic strength, and global equity."

Yet, in reality, neither the U.S., the E.U., or China are ready to facilitate their macroeconomic policies or surrender sovereignty to the degree that would make such a system work — especially given the current state of the global financial system and the volatility in emerging markets. To perceive how focused and stressed such a system can become, one need just gander at the [European sovereign debt crisis](/european-sovereign-debt-crisis) — and the eurozone's zombie banks — or the history of currency crises and the countries that have attempted to keep up with [currency pegs](/currency-stake) and failed, similar to the British pound in 1992, the Russian ruble in 1997 and the Argentinean peso in 2002.

## The Future of Global Money

Notwithstanding every one of the forecasts of the dollar's death, the U.S. dollar will stay the world's reserve currency, be that as it may, numerous financial reporters talk about the rise of the Chinese yuan. Obviously the U.S. won't readily surrender the [petrodollar](/petrodollars) system. Maybe the balance in world money and power politics will shift once China gains economic parity with the U.S. what's more, in the event that the yuan turns into a competitor to the dollar.

Or on the other hand, maybe there will be various global currencies later on, that exchange on a single market system. Regardless, for the present, reserve currencies like the dollar, the euro, the sterling, the Japanese yen, and China's renminbi, successfully already act as supranational currencies.
