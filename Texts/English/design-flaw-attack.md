# Design Flaw Attack
A design flaw attack alludes to an attack wherein a malicious client purposely makes a smart contract, decentralized market, or other software with information on certain flaws to **trick people interfacing inside the permissionless environment.**
A design flaw attack normally exhibits high apparent incentives for users to lock their funds into a smart contract. A flawed definition in certain rules encompassing the contract, or the protocol on which it is fabricated, may **lead to unfair settlement or release of funds.**
A design flaw attack can likewise be directed when a malicious client chooses to take advantage of flaws on a contract that was made by one more client with practically no vindictive intent. In this case, **the attack would depend on data asymmetry** between the attacker and any potential open network participant.

#### Models
Expectation markets on the Augur platform are one target of design flaw attacks. For example, a considerable lot of its broken markets depend on dubious and hazy definitions, with the ultimate purpose of fooling users into betting money in a contract whose outcome will be questioned due to clashing boundaries and translations.
Other potential design flaw attacks might target [oracles](/prophet) or data sources, for example, price takes care of. For instance, an attacker could purposely target a market or protocol that depends on a single outer price source [API](/application-programming-interface) that might be censured before a contract termination/settlement date, subsequently giving the attacker an advantage in having the option to control any smart contracts depending on this data source.
