# Fed Model
## What Is the Fed Model?

The Fed model is a [market timing](/markettiming) tool for determining whether the U.S. stock market is genuinely valued. The model depends on an equation that compares the earnings yield of the [S&P 500 ](/sp500)with the yield on [10-year U.S. Treasury bonds](/10-yeartreasury). The model was never authoritatively supported by the [Federal Reserve](/frb) and was initially called the Fed's Stock Valuation Model.

> That's what the Fed model today directs assuming the S&P's earnings yield is higher than the U.S. 10-year bonds yield, the market is "bullish"; assuming the earnings yield dips below the yield of the 10-year bond, the market is thought of "bearish."

## Grasping the Fed Model

Economist Ed Yardeni is credited with fostering the Fed model in its current form in 1999, however a graph showing the relationship between long-term Treasury [bond yields](/bond-yield) and [earnings yields](/earningsyield) from 1982 to 1997 was distributed two years sooner in the Fed's Humphrey-Hawkins Report.

That's what the Fed model today directs assuming the S&P's earnings yield is higher than the U.S. 10-year bonds yield, the market is "bullish." That is, the total earnings of the companies inside the S&P 500 are somewhat high compared to returns from holding 10-year government bonds. A bullish market expects stock prices will rise and hence this present time is a decent opportunity to buy shares.

On the off chance that the earnings yield dips below the yield of the 10-year bond, the market is thought of "bearish." Companies are not delivering generally high earnings compared to the yield on 10-year bond yields. The Fed model predicts a bearish market and recommends that stock prices will decline.

The Fed model doesn't have a reputation as a reliable predictor of markets since it failed to foresee the [Great Recession](/great-recession). Leading up to the financial crisis, the Fed model had assessed the market as being bullish beginning around 2003. This gave Fed model adherents idealism in the markets, empowering them to buy stocks. The model actually declared a bullish market in October 2007, the cusp of the Great Recession.

Investors who heeded the implicit guidance of the Fed model purchased stocks expecting that their prices would rise. All things considered, they saw them drop strongly and keep on losing value through the accompanying, long recession.

## Alternatives to the Fed Model

Subsequent to neglecting to foresee the Great Recession, the Fed model likewise failed to anticipate the euro crisis and the [junk bond](/junkbond) bust of 2015. Notwithstanding these slips, a few investors actually depend on the model as a predictive tool.

Other market timing and valuation models — some with better-demonstrated histories in anticipating market course — additionally exist. These valuation models look at other market data: [price-to-earnings ratios](/price-earningsratio), the price-to-sales ratios, or household equity as a percentage of total financial assets.

Prominently, economist Ned Davis of Ned Davis Research took a gander at the predictive history of every one of these models, including the Fed model, and found that the Fed Model proved to be the least accurate in foreseeing bear and bull markets.

## Highlights
- The Fed Model is a market-timing tool in view of a formula that compares earnings yields and Treasury bond yields.
- At the point when yields are higher in the bond market compared to earnings yields, the Fed model says the outlook is bearish and the time has come to sell stocks.
- In the event that earnings yields are greater than bond yields, the Fed model says the market is bullish, and it is a great opportunity to buy stocks.
- The Fed model's history isn't convincing — it stayed bullish before several important market slumps, including the 2008 financial crisis.
