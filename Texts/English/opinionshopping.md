# Assessment Shopping
## What Is Opinion Shopping?

Assessment shopping is the practice of looking for an outside [auditor](/auditor) able to give a great perspective on a company's financial condition. Securing a positive assessment**,** known as a [unqualified opinion](/unqualified-assessment), persuades the public to think that the company's financials are reasonably introduced and conform to generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), assisting it with securing funding at additional beneficial rates from lenders and keep up with the support of investors.

## Understanding Opinion Shopping

The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) requires all public companies to open up their books to outer auditors and present the findings in their annual filings ([Form 10-K](/10-k)). These surveys come as a [accountant's opinion](/accountantsopinion): a statement by an independent auditor expressing its view with respect to the quality of information contained in a set of financial reports.

An accountant's perspective can be qualified or unqualified. In the event that the assessment is [qualified](/qualifiedopinion), the accountant has inquiries regarding the company's accounting principles or potentially the scope of the information gave. At the point when a company goes assessment shopping, seeking an unqualified assessment views the company's financial statements as decently introduced, in every single material regard, and as per [GAAP](/gaap).

The assessment issued by an auditor can have tremendous ramifications. Statements expressing concerns in regards to the quality of information contained in a set of financial reports may likely put investors off the company. It can likewise make it harder to persuade [financial institutions](/financialinstitution) (FIs) to loan it money and result in a [credit rating](/creditrating) downgrade, expanding the difficulties of raising new capital.

Subsequently, a few companies decide to take part in assessment shopping, the questionable practice of finding an auditor who will overlook any weaknesses in its [financial reporting](/financialaccounting). They do as such, in spite of staying alert that such behavior is disapproved of by regulators.

## History of Opinion Shopping

Assessment shopping is precluded by the [Securities and Exchange Commission](/sec) (SEC) and has been a hot point among regulators, especially since financial outrages in the mid 2000s including publicly traded companies, for example, Enron Corporation, Tyco International plc, and WorldCom.

Laws intended to stamp out fraudulent financial reporting, for example, [The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002](/sarbanesoxleyact), don't seem to have made assessment shopping any less predominant, though.In 2019, the [American Accounting Association](/american-accounting-association-aaa) (AAA) distributed research showing that over half of U.S. businesses in financial difficulty relentlessly seek out auditors able to issue them with afavorable assessment. From a pool of north of 3,500 [distressed](/financial_distress) public companies in the U.S. spreading over a nine-year period, the AAA found that 57 percent looked for sentiments. These measures appeared to pay off, too. As per the research, just 16 percent of guilty parties were issued with [going concern](/goingconcern) sentiments — statements that express substantial uncertainty about a company's ability to proceed — compared to 28 percent among non-assessment customers.

## Special Considerations
### Recognizing Opinion Shoppers

News that assessment shopping is as yet a broad practice ought to maybe make us suspicious of any company that out of nowhere changes its audit firm. It's reasonable to accept that any listed entity able to cause the costs of switching auditor needs something critical in return.

Accountants, too, face fire up costs while taking on another client. Until these costs are recuperated, it very well may be contended that they are under greater pressure to issue shining appraisals. Companies have been known to fire auditors when they unveil critical information about their [accounting practices](/accounting-practice). That will play on auditor's minds, as will the logic that a reputation as being nice and flexible ought to likely assist them with securing more business.

In any case, seeking out a second assessment doesn't be guaranteed to continuously mean that something is not right. As in different callings, public accountants can have various suppositions about the numerous understandings and judgment calls that are engaged with setting up the [financial statements](/financial-statements) of large, complex corporations. Companies are free to talk with different accountants. They may, guiltlessly, opt to pick another auditor more on top of their approach to carrying on with work or to save money on audit fees by picking a less expensive contender.

At the end of the day, it's difficult to decide whether changes are made absolutely to engineer better conclusions. Maybe the most telling sign is the point at which a company reliably hops starting with one auditor then onto the next. On the other hand, it could raise doubt in the event that a company changes from a reputable [big four](/bigfour) accountancy firm to a more modest one frantic to bag new clients and keep them sweet.
