# Limited Convertibility
## What Is Limited Convertibility?

A currency has limited [convertibility](/convertibility) in the event that it can't be switched over completely to a foreign currency due to regulation imposed by the responsible country.

A government can control currency transactions inside its nation, so this policy can't outright forestall currency transformations outside the country. It does, nonetheless, limit the entry of foreign currencies into the country and consequently turns into a barrier to international trade.

## Grasping Limited Convertibility

Convertibility possibly turned into an issue in monetary policy when banknotes started to replace item cash attached to a gold or silver standard. Printed coins were redeemable at [face value](/facevalue), albeit bombing banks or governments could overstretch their reserves.

A [convertible currency](/convertibility), conversely, is less simple for a central bank or other directing authority to control.

Agricultural nations and legitimate governments are bound to place limitations on the exchange of their currencies. Countries in financial difficulty may, too. Greece had currency controls in place from 2015 until 2018 to forestall the wholesale flight of its euro capital to more grounded economies.

## Why Convertibility Is Important

Currency convertibility is an important factor in international trade, as it permits companies to carry on with work across borders with confidence and with unsurprising costs. A prospective trading partner in another country won't have any desire to be paid in currency with limited convertibility. In the mean time, the neighborhood partner can't acknowledge the foreign currency.

Likewise, a convertible currency is more liquid, and that means its value is less unstable. Less [volatility](/volatility) means less risk. Limited convertibility currencies, then again, will quite often be less stable, and connected with higher expansion rates.

## Impact on International Trade

As global trade keeps on expanding, currency convertibility will turn out to be more basic. Currencies with limited convertibility are in a tough spot. The effect of limited currency convertibility is slow economic growth.

The U.S. dollar is the most convertible currency and most traded currency in the world. Central banks around the globe hold the U.S. dollar as their fundamental [reserve currency](/reservecurrency). A number of asset classes are named in U.S. dollars, meaning their payments and settlements are made in U.S. dollars. Thus, the U.S. dollar is the most convertible in the world.

Currencies, for example, the South Korean won and the Chinese yuan are convertible, yet just modestly so. Their governments have controls in place that confine the amount of currency that can exit or enter the country.

## Special Considerations

Limited convertibility can affect [foreign direct investment](/fdi) (FDI) as well as international trade. In any case, countries that are currently moving to a more open economy might have to open up currency limitations step by step to keep away from economic disruption.

This has been the case in the development of countries that once had centrally arranged economies. Opening domestic markets quickly could subject the home market to pulverizing foreign competition.
