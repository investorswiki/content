# Argentinian Nuevo Peso (ARS)
## What Is the Argentine Peso (ARS)?

The Argentine peso, frequently alluded to as the **peso**, is the [national currency](/national-currency) of Argentina and its [ISO currency code](/isocurrencycode) is ARS. The country's central bank, Banco Central de la Rep\u00fablica Argentina, issues the Argentine peso. It tends to be subdivided into 100 **centavos** and is denoted by the symbol "$."

Otherwise called the Argentine peso, the Argentinian nuevo peso has been being used beginning around 1992 when it replaced the Argentinian austral (ARA), which circulated from 1985 to 1991. The austral replaced the original [Argentinian peso](/arp-argentinian-peso) (ARP), utilized momentarily from 1983 to 1985.

## Understanding the Argentine Peso

The Argentine peso started circulation in 1992 following an extreme period of [economic depression](/depression) in the country. This economic hardship, which lasted from 1989 to 2002, came under a decade after Argentina's larger, "Economic crisis", which lasted somewhere in the range of 1974 and 1990.

Initially, the ARS was [pegged](/currency-peg) to the U.S. dollar. After one more steep financial crisis in 2001, the central bank abandoned the peg to the U.S. dollar in 2002. The Argentine peso consequently saw a [devaluation](/devaluation) of 365% against the U.S. dollar.

In response, during the mid 2000s, the Argentine government did whatever it takes to hold the exchange rate in the neighborhood of 3 pesos to 1 U.S. dollar, attempting to trigger a boom in exports, and thusly, get new money. The central bank's purchases of U.S. dollars in the open market implied the country amassed substantial reserves, which the government of Cristina Fern\u00e1ndez de Kirchner at last depleted trying to prop up the value of the peso.

The election of President Mauricio Macri in 2015 prompted a relaxing of monetary controls put in place by the previous administration. In 2016, the central bank eliminated most limitations on the amount of savings people and companies could change over into U.S. dollars. These moves prompted a 30% devaluation of the nuevo peso, energizing restored inflation fears. The central bank moved its monetary policy in response, targeting the year-on-year [inflation](/inflation) rate below 5% per annum through 2020. The Banco Central de la Rep\u00fablica Argentina presently trades straightforwardly in the [forex](/forex) (FX) markets to reinforce its balance sheet and smooth out changes in the currency's value.

As per World Bank data, Argentina keeps on confronting economic headwinds. The country encounters a 39.8% annual inflation rate and has a [gross domestic product](/gdp) (GDP) of negative 9.9%, starting around 2020, which is the latest year of available data.

## Pre-History of the Argentine Peso

By and large, the term "peso" first alluded to a Spanish coin known as the eight-genuine coin or "bits of eight." This coin was being used before and after Argentina acquired its independence in 1816. In 1826, the country started to issue paper currency in two organizations, the **fuete** (ARF), and the **Moneda Corriente,** both denominated in pesos. The **fuete** could switch over completely to gold, and keeping in mind that the **Moneda Corriente** didn't.

Later in 1881, the **Moneda Nacional** (ARM) start to replace the prior paper, and the utilization of the **Moneda Nacional** went on until 1970. The government discontinued the conversion of paper into gold in 1929.

Somewhere in the range of 1970 and 1983, the peso ley (ARL) start to replace all previous money. On the other hand, in 1983, the government moved to replace the currency with the peso **Argentino** (ARP). The peso **Argentine** battled to hold its value and was replaced by the **Austral** (ARA) in 1985, at a rate of 1 **Austral** to 1,000 pesos.

Argentina went through a period of [hyperinflation](/hyperinflation), and the currency immediately lost its value. One more official currency came into utilization in 1992, called the peso **convertible** (ARS). This unit had a coordinated peg with the U.S. dollar. The fixed exchange rate stayed in place until the country encountered a depression in the mid 2000s, after which it vacillated. The Argentine central bank had attempted to support the currency's value against the USD and established limitations on the exchange of the ARS for the USD. These limitations ended in 2015.
