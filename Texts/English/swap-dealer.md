# Swap Dealer
## What Is a Swap Dealer?

A swap dealer is an individual or entity that fills in as a swaps broker, makes markets in swaps, or goes into [swaps contracts](/swap) with counterparties.

Swap dealer, as a legal term, was officially defined in the [Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act](/dodd-frank-financial-regulatory-reform-bill) of 2010, a piece of legislation brought into the world in the aftermath of the 2007-2008 financial crisis.

## Understanding Swap Dealers

A swap is a type of [derivative](/derivative) contract by which two parties exchange the cash flows or liabilities from a pair of various financial instruments. Most swaps include cash flows in view of a [notional principal amount](/notionalprincipalamount) like a loan or bond, albeit the instrument can be nearly anything. Generally, the principal doesn't change hands. Each [cash flow](/cashflow) includes one [leg](/leg) of the swap. One cash flow is generally fixed, while the other is variable and in view of a benchmark interest rate, [floating currency exchange rate](/floatingexchangerate), or index price.

The most common sort of swap is a [interest rate swap](/interestrateswap). Swaps don't trade on exchanges, and retail investors don't generally take part in swaps. Rather, swaps are [over-the-counter (OTC)](/otc) contracts fundamentally between businesses or financial institutions that are altered to the requirements of the two players. Since these are OTC products, they are more opaque than exchange-traded products.

Prior to the financial crisis, swaps had been to a great extent unregulated, occurring primarily among firms and financial institutions, in generally unregulated transactions. In 2011 the [Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)](/sec) settled proposition requiring security-based swap dealers and participants to register with the commission, as part of the Dodd-Frank legislation.

As indicated by Section 721 of the Dodd-Frank Act, a swap dealer is an entity that:

1. Holds itself out as [dealer](/dealer) in swaps;
1. [Makes a market](/marketmaker) in swaps;
1. Routinely goes into swaps with counterparties as an ordinary course of business for its own record; or
1. Takes part in activity making itself be commonly referred to in the trade as a dealer or market maker in swaps, provided, in any case, in no event will an insured depository institution be considered to be a swap dealer to the degree it offers to go into a swap with a customer regarding starting a loan with that customer.

## De Minimus Exception

The Republican-drove administration made strides in 2017 to revoke the Dodd-Frank Act. The legislation is far reaching, addressing numerous parts of banking and finance. The definition of a swap dealer isn't controversial, however there is one provision in the Dodd-Frank Act that Republicans looked to address â€” the **de minimus** exception rule. This rule excludes swap dealer designation of an entity that participates in **de minimus** quantity of swap dealing regarding transactions with or for its customers.

The threshold for aggregate gross notional amount (AGNA) that a swap dealer must have completed has been set to $8 billion, as of November 2018. It should fall to $3 billion, a much lower level that would have brought a lot more substances into the domain of regulatory oversight. In any case, the CFTC decided on a bipartisan basis to set $8 billion as the permanent threshold in a November 2018 meeting. The federal agency refered to the increased regulatory coverage for $8 billion as well as the potential for lower liquidity at a lower threshold figure for nonfinancial commodity swaps. Likewise, the agency stated that it wanted to signal long-term stability of the de minimus threshold to permit market participants to plan as long as possible.

## Features
- The **de minimus** threshold for swap trading has been set at $8 billion. This means that an entity won't be considered a swap dealer except if the aggregate notional amount of its deals surpasses that figure.
- Swap dealers are legally identified in the 2010 Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform.
- A swap dealer works with transactions in swaps contracts, acting as principal or agent.
