# Forex (FX)
Forex (FX) is a contraction of foreign exchange, alluding to the global market for buying and selling currencies. The Forex market is unquestionably the biggest and most liquid financial market in the world, bragging trillions dollars in trading volume daily.
Participants - going from informal investors to international banks - set global exchange rates. Normally, those that have a more substantial impact will be major institutions like commercial banks, which make up the bulk of trading activity. These players collaborate either straightforwardly with each other or through electronic brokers.
Similarly as with cryptocurrency markets, participants trade currency pairs (EUR/USD, GBP/CNY, JPY/CHF, AUD/NZD, and so on.). The difference here is that they deal only in fiat money like the British pound, Canadian dollar, or Japanese yen. Another comparability is uptime: while not accessible 24/7/365 like digital currency markets, Forex is open for 24 hours every day, excluding ends of the week.
You could likewise compare the decentralized idea of the two markets. Dissimilar to with stocks, you're not limited to trading platforms like the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) or NASDAQ for trading currencies. Exchanges are directed around the globe without the oversight of a single regulatory body.
Forex, as far as we might be concerned today, is a moderately recent phenomenon, generally prodded on by the termination of the Bretton Woods system in 1971. This brought about the decoupling of the US dollar from gold, opening it up to floating not entirely set in stone by supply and demand on the foreign exchange market.
Forex trading can be speculative in nature, or it can form part of a hedging strategy. Trades could similarly be executed to secure currency to buy assets in another country. Spot markets are where the majority of trades happen. This makes sense, as derivative products are dependent on this real-time volume to actually function. To expand the proficiency of spot trades (and given the extremely thin edges), traders frequently opt to utilize a combination of specialized analysis, leverage, and scalping to create returns.
Futures and forward contracts are well known alternatives to the spot markets. These can be particularly helpful for the reasons for hedging.
