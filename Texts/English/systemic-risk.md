# Systemic Risk
## What Is Systemic Risk?

Systemic risk is the possibility that an event at the company level could trigger extreme flimsiness or collapse a whole industry or economy. Systemic risk was a major supporter of the [financial crisis](/financial-crisis) of 2008. Companies viewed as a systemic risk are called "[too big to fail](/too-big-to-fail)."

These institutions are large relative to their individual industries or make up a critical part of the overall economy. A company exceptionally interconnected with others is likewise a source of systemic risk. Systemic risk ought not be mistaken for [systematic risk](/systematicrisk); systematic risk connects with the whole financial system.

## Grasping Systemic Risk

The federal government involves systemic risk as a defense — a frequently right one — to mediate in the economy. The basis for this intervention is the conviction that the government can reduce or limit the ripple effect from a company-level event through targeted regulations and actions.

Nonetheless, sometimes the government will decide not to mediate basically in light of the fact that the economy around then had gone through a major rise and the general market needs a breather. This is more frequently the exception than the rule, since it can weaken an economy more than projected due to consumer sentiment.

## Instances of Systemic Risk

The Dodd-Frank Act of 2010, completely known as [Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act](/dodd-frank-financial-administrative reform-bill), presented a colossal set of new laws that should prevent one more Great Recession from happening by firmly managing key financial institutions to limit systemic risk. There has been a lot of discussion about whether changes should be made to the reforms to work with the growth of small business.

Lehman Brothers' size and integration into the U.S. economy made it a source of systemic risk. At the point when the firm collapsed, it made issues all through the [financial system](/financial-system) and the economy. Capital markets froze up while businesses and consumers couldn't get loans, or could get loans in the event that they were very creditworthy, presenting negligible risk to the lender.

At the same time, AIG was likewise experiencing serious financial issues. Like Lehman, AIG's interconnectedness with other financial institutions made it a source of systemic risk during the financial crisis. AIG's portfolio of assets tied to subprime mortgages and its participation in the [residential mortgage-backed securities](/rmbs) (RMBS) market through its securities-loaning program prompted collateral calls, a loss of liquidity, and a downgrade of AIG's credit rating when the value of those securities dropped.

While the U.S. government didn't bail out Lehman, it chose to bail out AIG with loans of more than $180 billion, preventing the company from failing. Analysts and regulators accepted that an AIG liquidation would have made various other financial institutions collapse also.
