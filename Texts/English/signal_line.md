# Signal Line
## What is a Signal Line

Signal lines are utilized in technical indicators, particularly [oscillators](/oscillator), to create buy and sell signals or propose a change in a trend. They are called signal lines since when another indicator or line crosses them it is a signal to trade or that something possibly important is going on with the price of an asset. It may be the case that the price was trending, [pulled back](/pullback), and is currently starting to trend or once more, or it could signal that a new uptrend or downtrend is starting.

Signal lines are many times moving averages of a technical indicator, for example, the [moving average intermingling divergence](/macd) (MACD) or [stochastic oscillator](/stochasticoscillator). The signal line is applied to the indicator to create more trade signals than would be accessible without the signal line.

A signal line is likewise regularly known as a "trigger line."

## The Formula For a Signal Line is

The signal line isn't an indicator, subsequently, it will be calculated distinctively for every indicator it is utilized in. This is on the grounds that the maker of an indicator will frequently make a formula for the signal line while making the indicator. The signal line is part of the indicator.

Signals lines are generally simple calculations. For the model, the signal line for the MACD is a nine-period [exponential moving average](/ema) (EMA) of the MACD value.

The signal line for the stochastic oscillator is a three-period [simple moving average](/sma) (SMA) of the stochastic (called %K in this case).

## The most effective method to Calculate a Signal Line
1. Find the formula for the signal line of the indicator you are utilizing. Regularly the formula is an EMA or SMA of the indicator.
1. Compute the indicator or add it to a chart in charting software.
1. Ascertain the EMA or SMA of the indicator. On the other hand, apply the applicable moving average to the indicator on the chart to make the signal line.

## What Does a Signal Line Tell You?

Signal lines can be applied to a wide range of technical indicators, yet the moving average combination dissimilarity (MACD) and stochastic oscillators are the two generally well known. Most signal lines are made by utilizing a moving average of the indicator values. These moving averages are generally SMAs or EMAs.

Signal lines may likewise be utilized to demonstrate a change in the [momentum](/momentum) of a trend. For instance, on the off chance that an indicator crosses over the signal line it shows the price is starting to climb. In the event that an indicator crosses below the signal line it demonstrates the price is starting to drop down.

These signals are regularly utilized related to different snippets of data. For instance, on the off chance that the price is noticeably in a longer-term [uptrend](/uptrend) a trader might think about just taking long trades on bullish crossovers. They might sell when there is a bearish crossover, yet they wouldn't enter a short position since that would conflict with the longer-term uptrend.

Different snippets of data that signal line crossovers are many times utilized related to incorporate different forms of technical analysis, for example, technical indicators, chart designs, or [candlestick](/candlestick) designs that give confirmation. As another model, traders might utilize [pivot points](/pivotpoint) to distinguish potential defining moments and afterward seek MACD crossovers for confirmation of a reversal.

## The Difference Between a Signal Line and a Moving Average

A [moving average](/movingaverage) can be the average of anything, however in technical analysis a great many people believe a moving average to be founded on price or sometimes volume, for example, the 200-day moving average of price. As a rule, a signal line is a moving average however is called a signal line rather than a moving average to assist keep away from confusion with the price-based moving averages. Signal lines are a moving average of an indicator calculation and are subsequently used to produce trade signals for that indicator as it were.

## Limitations of Signal Lines

Signal lines are generally just a moving average of an indicator. Along these lines, the signal line [lags](/laggingindicator) the developments of the indicator. As the indicator responds to price changes it moves faster than the signal line and this produces a crossover.

While signal lines can create great signals now and again, which bring about large trend changes and price moves, numerous crossovers will be [false signals](/false-signal). A false signal is the point at which the indicator crosses the signal line however the price neglects to move toward the path expected. The price may likewise crisscross the signal line, bringing about different signals which lose the trader money assuming the trade signals are traded.

Consequently, signal line crossovers are rarely utilized in separation. Different forms of technical or [fundamental analysis](/fundamentalanalysis) are utilized to affirm trade signals or rule out taking certain signal line trades.

## Features
- It is normally a moving average of an indicator that is applied to the indicator so the signal line and indicator can cross to produce trade signals.
- Signal lines might be utilized in various ways for various indicators, yet regularly when the indicator crosses over the signal line it is deciphered as [bullish](/bull) at the cost and when the indicator crosses below the signal line it is [bearish](/bear) for price.
- A signal line is certainly not a technical indicator all by itself.
