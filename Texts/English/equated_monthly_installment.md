To demonstrate how EMI functions, we should walk through a calculation of it, utilizing the two methods. Expect an individual takes out a mortgage to buy another home. The principal amount is $500,000, and the loan terms incorporate an interest rate of 3.5% for a very long time.

Utilizing the level rate method to work out the EMI, the property holder's regularly scheduled payments emerged to $5,625, or ($500,000 + ($500,000 x 10 x 0.035))/(10 x 12).

Utilizing the EMI decreasing balance method, regularly scheduled payments would be roughly $4,944.29, or $500,000 * [(0.0029 * (1 + 0.0029)^120)/((1 + 0.0029)^120 - 1)].

Note that in the EMI level rate calculation, the principal loan amount stays consistent all through the 10-year mortgage period. This proposes that the EMI lessening balance method might be a better option in light of the fact that the decreasing loan principal likewise [shrinks the amount of interest due.](/acceleratedpayments) In the level rate method, each interest charge is calculated in view of the original loan amount, even however the loan balance outstanding is bit by bit being paid down.
