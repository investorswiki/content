## What Is a Robo-Advisor?

Robo-advisors are digital platforms that give automated, calculation driven financial planning services with next to zero human supervision. A regular robo-advisor poses inquiries about your financial situation and future goals through an online survey; it then, at that point, utilizes the data to offer guidance and automatically invest for you.

The best robo-advisors offer simple account setup, robust goal planning, account services, and portfolio management. Moreover, they offer security highlights, mindful customer service, exhaustive education, and low fees.

## Figuring out Robo-Advisors

The first robo-advisor, Betterment, sent off in 2008, with the initial purpose of rebalancing assets inside [target-date funds](/target-date_fund). It looked to assist with overseeing passive, buy-and-hold investments through a simple online interface. In 2022, Betterment acquired Makara, a robo-advisor platform that builds and keeps up with cryptocurrency portfolios to extend its offerings to investors.

The technology itself was the same old thing. Human wealth managers have been utilizing automated [portfolio allocation](/assetallocation) software since the mid 2000s. Yet, until Betterment sent off, they were the ones in particular who could buy the technology, so clients needed to utilize a financial advisor to benefit from the innovation.

Today, most robo-advisors utilize passive indexing strategies optimized utilizing some variation of [modern portfolio theory](/modernportfoliotheory) (MPT). Some robo-advisors offer optimized portfolios for socially responsible investing (SRI), Halal investing, or tactical strategies that copy hedge funds. Furthermore, they can handle significantly more sophisticated tasks, for example, [tax-loss harvesting](/taxgainlossharvesting), investment selection, and [retirement planning](/retirement-planning).

## Portfolio Rebalancing

The majority of robo-advisors use modern portfolio theory (or some variation) to build passive, indexed portfolios for their users. Once settled, robo-advisors keep on monitoring those portfolios to guarantee that the optimal asset class weightings are kept up with even post-retail marketplaces move. Robo-advisors accomplish this by utilizing rebalancing bands.

Each [asset class](/assetclasses), or individual security, is given a target weight and a comparing tolerance range. For instance, an allocation strategy could incorporate the requirement to hold 30% in emerging market values, 30% in domestic blue chips, and 40% in [government bonds](/government-security) with a corridor of \u00b15% for every asset class.

> In the past, this type of rebalancing has been disliked in light of the fact that it very well may be tedious and produce transaction fees. Be that as it may, robo-advisors are intended to do this automatically with low fees.

Utilizing rebalancing bands means that emerging market and domestic blue-chip holdings can vary somewhere in the range of 25% and 35%, while 35% to 45% of the portfolio ought to be allocated to government bonds. At the point when the weight of a holding hops outside of the allowable band, the whole portfolio is rebalanced to mirror the initial target sythesis.

One more type of rebalancing commonly found in robo-advisors — and which is made cost-viable through calculations — is tax-loss harvesting. Tax-loss harvesting is a strategy that includes selling securities at a loss to offset a capital gains tax liability in a comparable security.

This strategy is typically employed to limit the recognition of short-term capital gains. Robo-advisors do this by keeping at least two stable exchange-traded funds (ETFs) for every asset class. Thus, in the event that the S&P 500 ETF loses value, it will automatically sell it to lock in a capital loss; all the while, it buys an alternate S&P 500 ETF.
