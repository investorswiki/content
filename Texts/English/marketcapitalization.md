Before an IPO, the company that desires to open up to the world enrolls an investment bank to utilize valuation strategies to infer a company's value and to decide the number of shares that will be offered to the public and at what price.

In the event that there is a high demand for its shares due to favorable factors, the price would increase.

The market cap then, at that point, turns into a real-time estimate of the company's value.

The formula for market capitalization is:

>
> Market cap = share price x # shares outstanding
>
> One company's share price might be $50. Another company's share price might be $100. This doesn't mean the subsequent company is two times as large as the main company. Continuously make sure to factor in the number of shares issued (and in this way break down the company's total market cap) while examining securities.
