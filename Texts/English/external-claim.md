# Outer Claim
## What Is an External Claim?

An outside claim is a claim against an individual that emerges out of no relationship one might have to a business wherein the individual has a [ownership](/beneficialowner) interest. Contingent upon how the business is owned, the [creditor](/creditor) might have the option to legally pursue assets of the business to fulfill the outside claim against the individual business owner/debtor. Limited liability and limited partnership agreements help shield the business resource's from outer claims expecting the individual's debt is in incurred outside the business.

## Grasping an External Claim

Basically setting up a business in an entity, for example, a [corporation](/corporation), may not shield it from the owner's personal creditors. Outside claims against a business owner might be fulfilled by their interest in the business entity.

Be that as it may, a few elements, for example, [limited partnerships](/limitedpartnership) (LP) and [limited liability companies](/llc) (LLC), give their partners/individuals with protection from claims emerging outside of the entity. Many states just give outside creditors the right to append or embellish distributions produced using the business to the [debtor](/debtor) (business owner or partner) and don't permit the creditor to connect or sell the debtor's interest in the entity. Under this legal scenario, management control of the entity stays in salvageable shape and the debtor's interest in the entity is protected.

## Outer Claim Example

Expect the owner of a corporation [negligently](/contributory-carelessness) drives a company vehicle into the side of a customer's building. The customer might sue the corporation, and possibly the individual (business owner driving the vehicle). To settle any judgment against the business and the individual, corporate assets **and** personal assets might be remembered for the settlement in the event that the accident was not totally covered by insurance.

In the event that a business owner carelessly drives their own vehicle into a building while they are not working, then the building owner would have no claim against the business owner's corporate assets, yet they could positively sue the individual (driver).

## Features
- The individual and corporation might need to pay a debtor on the off chance that the individual was acting carelessly in the interest of a company when the episode happen.
- Limited liability companies and limited partnerships help shield business assets from claims against an individual coming about because of incidents happening outside the business.
- An outer claim is the potential for business assets to be remembered for a claim against an individual.
