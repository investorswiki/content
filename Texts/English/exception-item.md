# Exception Item
## What Is an Exception Item?

An exception thing is a banking term used to depict a check or other payment that can't be handled or which is interfered. Purposes behind this hindrance might incorporate the way that a [stop payment](/stop-payment) order has been made, a client's account has been closed, there are deficient funds in the payor's account, or the check is fragmented or missing a signature.

Quite, an exception thing ought not be mistaken for the accounting term "[exceptional item](/exceptionalitem)," which is a rare charge incurred by a company that must be noted separately in its financial reporting.

## Exception Items Explained

As verified above, particular purposes behind exception things incorporate stop payments (a request with respect to the account holder to cancel a check or payment that has not yet been handled.), a closed account, or a check not being completely filled out. A [bounced check](/bouncedcheck), for instance, is an illustration of an exception thing for a check that can't be handled in light of the fact that the account holder has [nonsufficient funds](/nsf) (NSF) available for use.

Banks return, or "skip," these checks, otherwise called [rubber checks](/rubbercheck), as opposed to respecting them, and banks may in this way charge the check journalists NSF fees.

In recent years, computer software programs have been developed to assist with banking staff spot and resolve exception things in a more efficient way.

## Exception Items and Stop Payments

To request a stop payment, an account holder gives specific data (e.g., the check number, payable to, date, and so on) to the bank. This data is for a check in-progress that the payer wishes to respite or cancel. The bank then, at that point, signals the check and keeps it from clearing. A banks offer account holders the chance to broaden or invigorate the stop payment, by means of a verbal or written request. This is particularly valuable in the event that the bank can't find the specific check. In the event that the bank can't find the check following a period of six months, the stop payment will generally lapse.

Giving stop payments generally costs the account holder a small fee of about $30 (despite the fact that bank policies contrast in such manner). An account holder can issue a stop payment for some reasons, including sending a check for an erroneous amount, or canceling a purchase in the wake of having put the check in the mail. Just on certain events can a financial institution not honor a stop payment.

## Illustration of Automated Handling of Exception Items

Many companies currently computerize the method involved with taking care of exception things. For instance, the company Blackline offers a complete "Finance Controls and Automation platform," delivered securely through the cloud. The software permits organizations to streamline the whole accounting and finance lifecycle in a centralized and secure way.

Moreover, the company Digital Check has developed its own "Special Document Handling (SDH)," a specific cycle for smoothing out recurring exception things. SDH recognizes exception things by means of their [routing/transit number](/routing_transit_number) (as well as their domestic account number or [IBAN](/iban) number). Digital Check then, at that point, applies special edge settings, which assists the picture with finishing quality analysis assessments. This includes eliminating the foundation picture from the check while holding the important data (e.g., to whom the thing is written and the signature).
