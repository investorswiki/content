# Annuitization
## What Is Annuitization?

Annuitization is the method involved with changing over a [annuity](/annuity) investment into a series of periodic income payments. Annuities might be annuitized for a specific period or for the life of the [annuitant](/annuitant). Annuity payments may simply be made to the annuitant or to the annuitant and an enduring spouse in a joint life arrangement. Annuitants can sort out for beneficiaries to receive a portion of the annuity balance upon their death.

## Figuring out Annuitization

The concept of annuitization goes back hundreds of years, however [life insurance](/lifeinsurance) companies formalized it into a contract offered to the public during the 1800s.

Individuals can go into a contract with a life insurance company that includes the exchange of a lump sum of capital for a guarantee to make periodic payments for a predetermined period or for the lifetime of the individual who is the annuitant.

## How Annuitization Works

After getting the lump sum of capital, the life insurer makes calculations to decide the annuity payout amount. The key factors utilized in the calculation are the annuitant's current age, [life expectancy](/lifeexpectancy), and the projected interest rate the insurer will credit to the annuity balance. The subsequent payout rate lays out the amount of income that the insurer will pay by which the insurer will have returned the whole annuity balance plus interest to the annuitant toward the finish of the payment period.

The payment period might be a predefined period or the life expectancy of the investor. In the event that the insurer discovers that the investor's life expectancy is 25 years, that turns into the payment period. The tremendous difference between utilizing a predetermined period versus a lifetime period is that, on the off chance that the annuitant carries on with past their life expectancy, the life insurer must proceed with the payments until the annuitant's death. This is the insurance part of an annuity in which the life insurer assumes the risk of extended longevity.

## Annuity Payments Based on a Single Life

Annuity payments in view of a single life cease when the annuitant bites the dust, and the insurer holds the leftover annuity balance. At the point when payments depend on joint lives, the payments go on until the death of the subsequent annuitant. At the point when an insurer covers joint lives, the amount of the annuity payment is decreased to cover the [longevity risk](/longevityrisk) of the extra life.

Annuitants might assign a beneficiary to receive the annuity balance through a refund option. Annuitants can choose refund options for fluctuating periods of time during which, assuming death happens, the beneficiary will receive the proceeds. For example, in the event that an annuitant chooses a refund option for a [period certain](/periodcertain) of 10 years, death must happen inside that 10-year period for the insurer to pay the refund to the beneficiary. An annuitant might choose a lifetime refund option, however the length of the refund period will influence the payout rate. The more drawn out the refund period is, the lower the payout rate.

## Changes to Annuities in Retirement Accounts

In 2019, the U.S. Congress passed the SECURE Act, which made changes to retirement plans, including those containing annuities. Fortunately the new ruling makes annuities more portable. For instance, assuming that you change jobs, your 401(k) annuity from your old job can be turned over into the 401(k) plan at your new position.

Nonetheless, the SECURE Act eliminated a portion of the legal risks for retirement plans. The ruling limits the ability for account holders to sue the retirement plan on the off chance that it doesn't pay the annuity payments-as on account of bankruptcy. Note that a safe harbor provision of the SECURE Act forestalls retirement plans (and not annuity suppliers) from being sued.

The SECURE Act additionally dispensed with the stretch provision for those beneficiaries who acquire an IRA. In years past, a beneficiary of an IRA could **stretch out** the [required least distributions](/requiredminimumdistribution) from the IRA over their lifetime, which assisted with stretching out the tax burden.

With the new ruling, non-spousal beneficiaries must convey each of the funds from the inherited IRA in something like 10 years of the death of the owner. Be that as it may, there are special cases for the new law. In no way, shape or form is this article an extensive survey of the SECURE Act. Thus, investors really should counsel a financial professional to survey the new changes to retirement accounts, annuities, and their designated beneficiaries.
