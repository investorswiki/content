# General Obligation (GO) Bond
## What Is a General Obligation Bond?

An overall obligation bond (GO bond) is a [municipal bond](/municipalbond) backed exclusively by the credit and taxing power of the responsible jurisdiction as opposed to the revenue from a given project. General obligation bonds are issued with the conviction that a municipality will actually want to repay its debt obligation through taxation or revenue from projects. No assets are utilized as [collateral](/collateral).

A GO bond might be diverged from a [revenue bond ](/revenuebond)in the setting of munis.

## Understanding General Obligation Bonds

An overall obligation (GO) bond is secured by a responsible government's pledge to utilize every available asset — even tax revenues — to repay holders of the bond.

At the neighborhood government level, pledges might incorporate a pledge to levy property taxes to meet the nearby government's obligation on the bondholders. For instance, since property owners try not to lose their stake on their particular properties in light of unpaid property tax bills, [credit rating agencies](/creditrating) rate general obligation pledges with strong credit characteristics and assign them high venture grade ratings. In the event that the property owners are not able to pay their property taxes prior to the designated due date, the government is legally permitted to increase the property tax rate to compensate for any delinquencies. On the designated due date, the overall obligation pledge requires the nearby government to cover the debt with its available resources.

General obligation bonds likewise act as a way for nearby governments to raise funds for projects that make floods of income for things like streets, parks, equipment, and scaffolds. General obligation bonds are normally used to fund government projects that will serve the public community.

## Types of General Obligation Pledges

State law sets the grounds on which nearby governments can give and issue general obligation bonds. An overall obligation bond may either be a limited-tax general obligation pledge or an unlimited-tax general obligation pledge.

A limited-tax general obligation pledge asks the responsible neighborhood government to raise property taxes if important to meet existing debt service obligations. Nonetheless, this increase is limited by a statutory limit. With limited-tax general obligation pledges, governments can in any case utilize a part of as of now imposed [property taxes](/propertytax), utilize one more stream of income, or raise property taxes to an amount comparing to existing debt service payments to answer its debt obligations.

An unlimited-tax general obligation pledge is like the limited-tax pledge. The main difference is that the nearby government is approached to increase property tax rates to important levels — up to a maximum of 100% — to cover delinquencies from taxpayers. Inhabitants must initially consent to increase property taxes to the vital amounts required for the bonds.
