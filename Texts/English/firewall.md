## What Is a Firewall?

A firewall is a legal barrier forestalling the transaction of [inside information](/insiderinformation) and the performance of financial transactions among commercial and investment banks. Limitations placed on joint efforts among banks and brokerage firms under the Glass-Steagall Act of 1933 acted as a form of firewall. One purpose of a firewall is to guarantee banks don't utilize standard investors' money to fund highly [speculative activities](/hypothesis) that could put the bank and contributors at risk.

## Grasping Firewalls

A firewall alludes to the severe separation of banking and brokerage activities in full-service banks and between [depository](/depository) and brokerage institutions. Under the Glass-Steagall Act of 1933, a distinct line was drawn between the banking and the investment industry, denying a [financial institution](/financialinstitution) (FI) to operate as both a bank and a brokerage.

In the mid 1930s, almost 8,000 U.S. banks failed or suspended operations. To reestablish public confidence in the system, it was considered significant to cut off the linkages among banking and investing activities, which were accepted to play had an important impact in the [1929 market crash](/stock-market-crash-1929) and the resulting depression.

Policymakers recognized the need to get rid of the [conflict of interest](/conflict-of-interest) that emerged when banks invested in [securities](/security) with their record holders' assets. Defenders of the bill contended that banks ought to be protecting their client's savings and checking accounts, not utilizing them to take part in unnecessarily speculative activity.

Acting on these perceptions, a firewall, named after the resistant walls utilized in construction to keep fires from spreading in a building, was put in place to separate banking and investing activities. The goal was to foil banks from giving loans that supported the prices of securities in which they had a stake and utilizing contributors' funds to [underwrite](/endorsing) stock [offerings](/offering).

## Illustration of Firewall

Before the [Great Depression](/great_depression), investors borrowed on [margin](/margin) from commercial banks to buy stocks. Following twenty years of fast growth, individuals were confident that share prices would proceed to rise and that [capital appreciation](/capitalappreciation) would empower them to repay the loan.

In effect, banks utilized customary contributors' money to fund the loans, presenting them to high levels of [risk](/risk). At the point when the Great Depression arose in late 1929 and stocks got pounded, this accepted practice went under examination. The government was forced to make a move, introducing new reforms in the financial industry that effectively put a finish to brokerage activities risking contributors' money.

## History of Firewalls

In spite of facing a few resistance, the Glass-Steagall Act and its firewall went essentially unchallenged for a long time. Notwithstanding, by the 1980s, several of its provisions started being disregarded, in the midst of a rise of goliath financial services firms, a thundering [stock market](/stockmarket), and an enemy of administrative position inside the [Federal Reserve](/federalreservesystem) and the White House.

Yet again finally, in 1999, the [Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act](/glba) (GLBA) was presented, empowering commercial banks to take part in investment banking and securities trading. Section 16 from the Glass-Steagall Act stayed in force, confining the types of assets banks could invest contributors' funds in, despite the fact that by then a ton of different parts of the act had been canceled, basically allowing banks to act as stockbrokers, and vice versa.

A few legislators and financial specialists claim this [deregulation](/deregulate) contributed to the 2008 [financial crisis](/financial-crisis), bringing up that a lack of a firewall drove U.S. financial institutions to become [too big to fail](/too-big-to-fail) and too crazy with client funds. In the midst of this discussion, legislators consistently started calling for the Glass-Steagall Act to be restored.

In 2015, a group of legislators — John McCain (R-Ariz.), Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), Maria Cantwell (D-Wash.), and Angus King (I-Maine) — started a draft for a bill for the 21st ^^Century Glass-Steagall Act, calling for a separation of traditional banking from investment banks, [hedge funds](/hedgefund), insurance, and [private equity](/privateequity) activities inside a five-year change period. The bill was added something extra to the Congressional record and was alluded to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs, however no other action was recorded. In April 2017, similar legislators once again introduced the bill, this time with extra bipartisan support from policymakers, including former President Donald Trump, then Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin, and former National Economic Council Director Gary Cohn. The bill, be that as it may, failed to go through Congress.
