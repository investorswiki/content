# Judgment Lien
## What Is a Judgment Lien?

A judgment lien is a court ruling that gives a [creditor](/creditor) the right to claim a [debtor's](/debtor) real or personal property assuming that the debtor neglects to satisfy their contractual obligations. This lien might be made against an individual or business and permits the creditor to access assets like the debtor's business, personal property, and real estate to fulfill the judgment.

An offended party who gets a monetary judgment is depicted as a judgment creditor, while the respondent turns into a judgment debtor.

## Figuring out Judgment Liens

On the off chance that you owe money to a creditor and don't pay, that party might sue you for the balance. In the event that the court rules against you, the creditor can file a judgment lien against you. A judgment lien is considered a nonconsensual [lien](/lien). That is on the grounds that it is joined to a piece of property without the proprietor's consent or agreement.

In many states, the judgment creditor — the champ of the claim — must record the lien by means of a region or state filing. In a couple of states, assuming a court enters a judgment against a debtor, a lien is naturally made on any real estate the debtor claims in that district.

When a judgment lien is filed with the suitable authority, it becomes joined to any personal or real property. [Personal property](/personalproperty) alludes to assets like cars, apparatuses, or furniture. [Real property](/real-property), then again, alludes to things like homes and different structures, or land. The property must be registered in your name, so on the off chance that you have a debt that goes unpaid, the judgment lien can't be connected to your mate's property. In the event that you own no property at the time the lien is filed, it very well may be appended to any future acquisitions — gave the lien doesn't terminate.

One destruction to liens on personal property is that a large portion of personal property has no title. Hence, liens are not formally recorded, and personal property could be sold off to an unaware outsider of the lien's presence.

## Special Considerations

There are a couple of ways you can fulfill or keep away from a lien by and large. The first — and generally self-evident — choice is to repay the [debt](/debt). Assuming you pay off your obligation, the creditor will eliminate the lien. This is finished by filing a release through a similar place the lien was recorded — the district or state.

It is feasible for you to stay away from a nonconsensual judgment lien on a property or vehicle in [bankruptcy](/bankruptcy) — considered lien avoidance — on the off chance that the accompanying conditions hold true:

- The lien must have been derived from a court-issued money judgment.
- The judgment debtor must be entitled to claim an exemption in any event a portion of their equity in the property.
- The lien would bring about a loss of some or the entirety of this exempt equity on the off chance that the real estate or vehicle was sold.

Utilizing lien avoidance can be an advantage if and when accessible. This can be especially beneficial on the off chance that a lien can be completely cleared out, albeit still supportive on account of partial lien avoidance.

## Judgment Liens versus Property Liens

While judgment liens are granted by courts without the consent of the debtor, [property liens](/property-lien) are somewhat unique. These liens are permitted by the debtor, who deliberately surrenders the right to their property. On the off chance that you borrow a large sum of money — say for a mortgage or a vehicle — the lender might require a form of security or [collateral](/collateral). That is on the grounds that the financial risk is too high. To complete and fund the loan, the creditor might put a lien on your property. Thusly, the creditor guarantees it can [foreclose](/dispossession) on that piece of property assuming you default on your financial obligation.

## Instances of Judgment Liens

Assuming one person harms one more in an accident through negligence, the harmed person might choose to sue for damages. On the off chance that the person influencing the accident's insurance doesn't cover the harmed party's required reparations, a judgment lien might be placed against the careless person's property. The creation of this judgment lien gets payment of the claim. In the event that the debt isn't paid, the judgment creditor has the authority to make extra strides. These could incorporate looking for enforcement of the judgment by [garnishing wages](/garnishment) and possibly holding onto a bank account.

Here is another model. A judge might place a lien on a debtor's vehicle for nonpayment of a vehicle loan. In this scenario, on the off chance that the debtor doesn't pay their creditor inside a certain time span, the vehicle would be utilized to pay off the excess debt. In the event that there's a balance left finished, the debtor is on the hook for that. This model reaches out to trucks, motorcycles, or other motor vehicles.
