# Theta
## What Is Theta?

The term theta alludes to the rate of decline in the [value](/value) of an option due to the progression of time. It can likewise be alluded to as the [time decay](/timedecay) of an option. This means an option loses value as time draws nearer to its [maturity](/maturitydate), for however long everything is held consistent. Theta is generally communicated as a negative number and can be considered the amount by which an option's value declines consistently.

## Figuring out Theta

Theta is part of the group of measures known as the [Greeks](/greeks), which are utilized in options evaluating. Recall — options give the buyer the right to buy or sell an underlying asset at the [strike price](/strikeprice) before the option lapses. The strike price, which is additionally called a [exercise price](/exerciseprice), is set when the contract is first written, illuminating the investor regarding the price at which the underlying asset must arrive at before the option can be exercised.

The measure of theta evaluates the risk that time postures to option buyers since options are just [exercisable](/exercise) for a certain period of time. This is known as time decay or the erosion of the value of an option over the long haul. An option's profitability diminishes over the long haul. In any case, what happens when two options are comparative yet one lapses over a longer period of time? The value of the longer-term option is higher since there is a greater chance or additional time that the option could move past the strike price.

Since theta addresses the [risk](/risk) of time and the loss of value of an option, it is constantly communicated as a negative figure. The value of the option reduces over the long haul until the expiration date. Since theta is generally negative for long options, there will constantly be a zero time value when the option lapses. For this reason theta is something beneficial for sellers however not really for buyers — value diminishes from the buyer's side as time passes by, yet increases for the seller. That is the reason selling an option is otherwise called a positive theta exchange — as theta accelerates, the seller's earnings on their options increase.

## Special Considerations

In the event that all else stays equivalent, the time decay makes an option lose [extrinsic value](/extrinsicvalue) as it moves toward its expiration date. Hence, theta is one of the fundamental Greeks that option buyers ought to worry about since time neutralizes [long](/long) option holders.

Then again, time decay is good for an investor who [writes](/composing an-option) options. Option essayists benefit from time decay in light of the fact that the options written become less significant as the chance to expiration draws near. Thus, it is less expensive for option scholars to buy back the options to close out the short position.

Put an alternate way, option values are, if applicable, made out of both extrinsic and [intrinsic value](/intrinsicvalue). At option expiration, all that remains is intrinsic value, if any, in light of the fact that time is a huge part of the extrinsic value.

## Theta versus Different Greeks

The Greeks measure the sensitivity of options prices to their individual factors. For example, the [delta](/delta) of an option demonstrates the sensitivity of an option's price corresponding to a $1 change in the underlying security while the [gamma](/gamma) of an option shows the sensitivity of an option's delta comparable to a $1 change in the underlying security.

[Vega](/vega) demonstrates how an option's price theoretically changes for every one percentage point move in implied volatility.

> Drawn from the Greek alphabet, theta has various implications across various fields — in economics, it likewise alludes to the reserve ratio of banks in economic models.

## Illustration of Theta

We should expect a [investor](/investor) purchases a [call option](/calloption) with a strike price of $1,150 for $5. The underlying stock is trading at $1,125. The option has five days until expiration and theta is $1. In theory, the value of the option drops $1 each day until it arrives at the expiration date. This is unfavorable to the option holder.

Expect the underlying stock remaining parts at $1,125 and two days have passed. The option will be worth roughly $3. The main way the option becomes worth more than $5 again is assuming the price transcends $1,155. This would give the option something like $5 in intrinsic value ($1,155 - $1,150 strike price), offsetting the loss due to theta or time decay.

## Features
- Theta, generally communicated as a negative number, demonstrates how much the option's value will decline consistently up to maturity.
- Theta alludes to the rate of decline in the value of an option over the long haul.
- In the event that any remaining factors are consistent, an option will lose value as time moves closer to its maturity.
