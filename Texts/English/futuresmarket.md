For example, on the off chance that a coffee farm sells green coffee beans at $4 per pound to a roaster, and the roaster sells that cooked pound at $10 per pound and both are creating a gain costing that much, they'll need to keep those costs at a [fixed rate](/fixedcost). That's what the investor concurs assuming the price for coffee goes below a set rate, the investor consents to pay the difference to the coffee farmer.

In the event that the price of coffee goes higher than a certain price, the investor will keep profits. For the roaster, on the off chance that the price of green coffee goes over an agreed rate, the investor pays the difference and the roaster gets the coffee at an anticipated rate. Assuming that the price of green coffee is lower than an agreed-upon rate, the roaster pays a similar price and the investor gets the profit.
