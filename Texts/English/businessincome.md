# Business Income
## What Is Business Income?

Business income is a type of [earned income](/earnedincome) and is classified as [ordinary income](/ordinaryincome) for tax purposes. It encompasses any income realized as a result of an entity's operations. In its simplest form, it is a business entity's net profit or loss, which is calculated as its revenue from all sources minus the costs of carrying on with work.

## Understanding Business Income

Business income is a term commonly used in [tax](/taxation) reporting. As per the [Internal Revenue Service (IRS)](/irs), business income "may incorporate income received from the sale of products or services," such as "fees received by a person from the standard practice of a profession...[and] rents received by a person in the real estate business."

[Business expenses](/businessexpenses) and business losses can offset business income, which can be either positive or negative at whatever year. The profit motive behind business income is universal to most business entities. Be that as it may, the manner by which business [income is taxed](/incometax) differs for every one of the most common types of businesses: sole proprietorships, partnerships, and corporations.

## How Business Income Is Taxed

How a business is formed determines the way in which it reports its income to the IRS.

- A [sole proprietorship](/soleproprietorship) is not a legally separate entity from its owner. Subsequently, business income from a sole proprietorship is reported on that individual's [Form 1040](/1040) tax return using Schedule C: Profit or Loss from Business.
- A [partnership](/partnership) is a unincorporated business that is jointly owned by at least two individuals. It reports business income on [Form 1065](/form-1065). Be that as it may, the partnership itself does not pay income tax. All partners receive a [Schedule K-1](/schedule-k-1) and report their share of the partnership's income on their own individual income tax returns.
- A [limited liability company (LLC)](/llc) is a hybrid between a corporation and a sole proprietorship or partnership. Single-member LLCs report business income on Form 1040, Schedule C. LLCs with more than one member, then again, use the same form used by partnerships: Form 1065. A LLC also can opt to be taxed as a [C corporation (C-corp)](/c-corporation) or a S corporation (S-corp).
- A [corporation](/corporation) is a legally separate entity from any individual who owns it. Corporations are each generally taxed as a C-corp, and that means they are taxed separately from their owners. Business income from a corporation is reported on Form 1120.
- A S-corp is a corporation that elects to be taxed as a [pass-through business](/course through). Business income for a S-corp is reported on [Form 1120-S](/form-1120s). Like a partnership, the S-corp does not pay income tax. Shareholders receive a Schedule K-1 and report their share of the company's income on their individual tax returns. Note that a S-corp is not a type of business entity; it is a tax filing election that a LLC or a C-corp can choose in the wake of forming.

> Business income coverage (BIC) offers companies the possibility to get [insurance](/insurance) against a loss of business income caused by damage to physical property.

## Insurance Coverage for Business Income

A [business income coverage form](/business-income-coverage-form) is a type of [property insurance](/property-insurance) policy that covers a company's loss of income due to a slowdown or an impermanent suspension of normal operations stemming from damage to its physical property.

Suppose a doctor's office in Florida is damaged by a hurricane. The doctor can't see patients in that frame of mind until the building is considered to be structurally sound once more. The business income coverage would kick in during the time span when the doctor's business is intruded.
