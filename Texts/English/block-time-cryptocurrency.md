# Block Time
## What Is Block Time?

Block time is the measure of the time it takes the miners or validators inside a network to confirm transactions inside one block and produce another block in that [blockchain](/blockchain).

Blockchains were first advocated by Bitcoin when it was presented in 2009. The technology has developed as more cryptocurrencies are made, every one of which can utilize unique or the equivalent blockchain, validation methods, and strategies for making new blocks.

## Understanding Block Time

A blockchain is a distributed database that records all transactions inside a cryptocurrency network. You can think of a block inside the database as a cell in a bookkeeping sheet where transaction data is stored. Miners check the transactions, which takes time since finding the solution to the block requires the PCs to make an immense amount of trial and mistake computations.

This is [called hashing](/hash) — utilizing an algorithm to confirm every one of the transactions inside a block, which approves the credibility of the transactions and stored data. At the point when the block solution is found, another block is made. The amount of opportunity to track down the solution and make another block is the block time.

The following are a couple of key points to recollect whether you're attempting to comprehend block time:

- A block is a file that records a number of the latest cryptocurrency transactions.
- Each block contains a reference to the block that went before it (that is the reason modifying cryptocurrency is hypothetically unthinkable).
- Cryptocurrency "miners" race against one another to tackle the hash, which is the hexadecimal number produced that confirms the transactions. The champ receives a crypto coin.

## How Is Bitcoin's Block Time Different Than Ethereum's?

Every cryptocurrency has an alternate block time — Bitcoin requires around 10 minutes, while Ethereum just requires around 14 seconds. The specific amount of time it takes for block generation shifts and relies upon the difficulty of the hash (the hexadecimal number produced by the hashing algorithm). As such, block times won't be the equivalent 100% of the time.

Consensus mechanisms exist to permit a network to concur that a transaction is substantial. Cryptocurrencies can utilize different consensus mechanisms, which, among different factors, influence the time it takes to confirm transactions and make new blocks. Proof-of-work and proof-of-stake are two types of consensus mechanisms that utilization various methods for confirming a transaction. Ethereum is progressing to a proof-of-stake consensus mechanism all through 2022, while Bitcoin stays on the more well known and energy-escalated proof-of-work mechanism.

## Features
- A block is confirmed by miners, who contend with one another to check the transactions and tackle the hash, which makes another block.
- Under the proof-of-work consensus mechanism, cryptocurrency is compensated for tackling a block's hash and making another block.
- Block time is the time allotment it takes to make another block in a cryptocurrency blockchain.
## FAQ
### How Do I Get a Bitcoin Block?
You never really receive a Bitcoin block since it is part of Bitcoin's system. All things considered, you receive a Bitcoin when your miner settles the hash and makes another block.
### What number of Bitcoins Will Ever Be Created?
Bitcoin has a limit of 21 million. There are almost 19 million Bitcoins in circulation, and the number of Bitcoins made each year parts like clockwork. This dials back Bitcoin creation.
### What number of Ethereum Will Ever Be Created?
Ethereum, in contrast to Bitcoin, doesn't have an upper limit on the number of coins that will be made.
