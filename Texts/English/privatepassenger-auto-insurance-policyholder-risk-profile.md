# Private-Passenger Auto Insurance Policyholder Risk Profile
## What Is a Private-Passenger Auto Insurance Policyholder Risk Profile?

A private-passenger collision protection policyholder risk profile is an estimate of the risk an insurance company will take on by covering a specific [automobile operator with an insurance policy](/accident coverage). The private-passenger collision protection policyholder risk profile allows an insurance company to estimate the probability that a specific driver will get into an accident, making a claim be made against a policy. Insurance companies sort policyholders into bunches in view of their risk profiles.

## Understanding a Private-Passenger Auto Insurance Policyholder Risk Profile

At its heart insurance is tied in with accounting for risk, a cycle known as [underwriting](/underwriting). The private-passenger accident coverage policyholder risk profile is intended to work with underwriting by measuring that risk. The more probable a claim is to be made, the higher the premium an insurance company will charge. Automobile drivers who have a history of accidents, live in areas where claims are bound to be made, or have different characteristics associated with higher accident rates, should pay a higher premium to get coverage.

The private-passenger collision protection policyholder risk profile is ordinarily broken into three sections: [preferred](/preferred-auto-coverage), [standard](/standard-accident protection), and [nonstandard](/nonstandard-accident protection). Preferred policyholders are the least risky and most desirable in light of the fact that they are least liable to have a claim filed against them. Standard drivers are viewed as average, in that they don't have a perfect driving record yet don't have many flaws. On the furthest edge of the range is the nonstandard profile, which is ascribed to the riskiest drivers. Since they are the probably going to be associated with an accident, risky drivers need to pay the highest installments and at times may not even have the option to get insurance.

Insurance companies are probably going to have policyholders in every one of the three risk profiles. They need to balance the low premiums (and subsequently low revenue) associated with the preferred profile drivers with the greater premiums associated with additional risky drivers. The goal is to limit the risk across a portfolio of policies relative to the amount of premiums that every one of the policies get.

## Special Considerations

Drivers have a great deal of motivation to try to improve or safeguard their risk profile. The following are two techniques for making it happen.

1. **Build the best conceivable driving record.** The initial step to a better risk profile is to keep away from foolish driving practices, infringement, and major damages. Beside that, drivers can take classes to work on their driving skills or, specifically, defensive driving skills. This will assist with showing your insurer that you are committed to safe driving.
1. **Avoid filing claims, if possible.** Filed claims develop a claims history, and most companies would have zero desire to have policyholders who file claims frequently. In the event that you must file a claim, ensure it is for greater damages and losses. (Note: This could mean that it's a good idea to opt for a higher deductible on your policy, which ought to reduce its cost.)
