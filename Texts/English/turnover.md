## What Is Turnover?

Turnover is an accounting concept that computes how quickly a business directs its operations. Most frequently, turnover is utilized to comprehend how quickly a company gathers cash from accounts receivable or how fast the company sells its [inventory.](/inventoryturnover)

In the investment industry, turnover is defined as the percentage of a portfolio that is sold in a specific month or year. A quick turnover rate generates more commissions for trades set by a broker.

"[Overall turnover](/overall-turnover)" is an equivalent for a company's total [revenues](/income). It is commonly utilized in Europe and Asia.

## The Basics of Turnover

Two of the largest assets owned by a business are [accounts receivable](/accountsreceivable) and inventory. Both of these accounts require a large cash investment, and it is important to measure how quickly a business gathers cash.

[Turnover ratios](/turnoverratio) compute how quickly a business gathers cash from its accounts receivable and inventory investments. These ratios are utilized by fundamental analysts and investors to determine on the off chance that a company is considered a wise investment.

## Accounts Receivable Turnover

Accounts receivable addresses the total dollar amount of unpaid customer solicitations anytime. Expecting that credit sales are sales not quickly paid in cash, the [accounts receivable turnover](/receivableturnoverratio) formula is credit sales separated by average accounts receivable. The average accounts receivable is essentially the average of the beginning and ending accounts receivable balances for a specific time frame period, like a month or year.

The accounts receivable turnover formula lets you know how quickly you are gathering payments, as compared to your credit sales. On the off chance that credit sales for the month total $300,000 and the account receivable balance is $50,000, for instance, the turnover rate is six. The goal is to boost sales, limit the receivable balance, and generate a large turnover rate.

## Inventory Turnover

The inventory turnover formula, which is stated as the [cost of goods sold](/cogs) (COGS) separated by average inventory, is like the accounts receivable formula. At the point when you sell inventory, the balance is moved to the cost of sales, which is an expense account. The goal as a business owner is to boost the amount of inventory sold while limiting the inventory that is kept close by. For instance, assuming the cost of sales for the month totals $400,000 and you carry $100,000 in inventory, the turnover rate is four, which shows that a company sells its whole inventory four times consistently.

The inventory turnover, otherwise called sales turnover, assists investors with determining the level of risk they will face if giving operating capital to a company. For instance, a company with a $5 million inventory that requires seven months to sell will be viewed as less productive than a company with a $2 million inventory that is sold in two months or less.

## Portfolio Turnover

Turnover is a term that is likewise utilized for investments. Expect that a [mutual fund ](/mutualfund)has $100 million in assets under management, and the portfolio manager sells $20 million in securities during the year. The rate of turnover is $20 million separated by $100 million, or 20%. A 20% [portfolio turnover](/portfolioturnover) ratio could be perceived to mean the value of the trades addressed one-fifth of the assets in the fund.

Portfolios that are actively managed ought to have a higher rate of turnover, while an inactively managed portfolio might have less trades during the year.
