# Heckscher-Ohlin Model
## What Is the Heckscher-Ohlin Model?

The Heckscher-Ohlin model is an economic theory that recommends that countries [export](/export) what they can most effectively and amply produce. Additionally alluded to as the H-O model or 2x2x2 model, it's utilized to assess trade and, all the more explicitly, the equilibrium of trade between two countries that have changing claims to fame and natural resources.

The model underscores the export of goods requiring [factors of production](/factors-production) that a country has in overflow. It likewise stresses the import of goods that a nation can't deliver as productively. It takes the position that countries ought to in a perfect world export materials and resources of which they have an excess, while proportionately importing those resources they need.

## The Basics of the Heckscher-Ohlin Model

The primary work behind the Heckscher-Ohlin model was a 1919 Swedish paper written by Eli Heckscher at the Stockholm School of Economics. His student, Bertil Ohlin, added to it in 1933. Economist [Paul Samuelson](/paul-samuelson) expanded the original model through articles written in 1949 and 1953. Some allude to it as the Heckscher-Ohlin-Samuelson model consequently.

The Heckscher-Ohlin model makes sense of numerically the way in which a country ought to operate and [trade](/trade) when resources are imbalanced all through the world. It pinpoints a preferred balance between two countries, each with its resources.

The model isn't limited to tradable [commodities](/ware). It likewise consolidates other production factors like labor. The costs of labor shift starting with one nation then onto the next, so countries with cheap labor powers ought to zero in basically on delivering [labor-intensive](/laborintensive) goods, as per the model.

## Evidence Supporting the Heckscher-Ohlin Model

Albeit the Heckscher-Ohlin model seems reasonable, most economists have experienced issues finding evidence to help it. Various different models have been utilized to make sense of why industrialized and developed countries customarily lean toward trading with each other and depend less intensely on trade with creating markets.

The [Linder hypothesis](/linder-hypothesis) frames and makes sense of this theory. It states that countries with comparative wages require comparably valued products and that this leads them to trade with one another.

## Genuine Example of the Heckscher-Ohlin Model

Certain countries have broad [oil reserves](/oil-reserves) however have next to no iron metal. In the mean time, different countries can without much of a stretch access and store [precious metals](/preciousmetal), however they have minimal in the method of agriculture.

For instance, the Netherlands exported nearly $577 million in U.S. dollars in 2019, compared to imports that extended period of roughly $515 million. Its top import-export partner was Germany. Importing on a close to rise to basis permitted it to all the more proficiently and economically make and give its exports.

The model accentuates the benefits of international trade and the global benefits to everybody when every country puts the most exertion into exporting resources that are locally naturally plentiful. All countries benefit when they import the resources they naturally lack. Since a nation doesn't need to depend exclusively on internal markets, it can exploit [elastic](/flexible) demand. The [cost of labor](/cost-of-labor) increments and minimal productivity declines as additional countries and emerging markets create. Trading internationally permits countries to conform to capital-concentrated goods production, which wouldn't be imaginable on the off chance that every country just sold goods internally.
