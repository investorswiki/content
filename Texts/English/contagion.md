# Contagion
## What Is Contagion?

A contagion is the spread of an economic crisis starting with one market or region then onto the next and can happen at both a domestic or international level. Contagion can happen on the grounds that a large number of similar goods and services, particularly labor and [capital goods](/capitalgoods), can be utilized across a wide range of [markets](/market) and on the grounds that basically all markets are associated through monetary and financial systems.

The real and [nominal](/nominal) interconnections of markets can act as a buffer for the economy against [economic shocks](/economic-shock), or as a mechanism to proliferate and even amplify shocks. The last option case is ordinarily what financial specialists and different pundits allude to as contagion, with a negative implication comparing the effect to the spread of a disease.

## Grasping Contagion

Contagions are regularly associated with the diffusion of economic emergencies all through a market, [asset class](/assetclasses), or geographic region; a comparative effect can happen with the diffusion of economic [booms](/blast). Contagions happen both globally and domestically, yet they have become more unmistakable peculiarities as the global economy has developed, economies inside certain geographic regions have become more associated with each other, and economies have become more [financialized](/financialization).

> Numerous scholastics and analysts view contagions as being fundamentally suggestive of global financial market relationship.

Generally associated with [financial crises](/financial-crisis), contagions can be appeared as negative [externalities](/externality) diffuse starting with one crashing market then onto the next. In a domestic market, it can happen on the off chance that one large bank sells the greater part of its assets rapidly and confidence in other large banks drops as needs be. In principle, a similar cycle happens when international markets crash, with cross-border investment and trade adding to a cascading type of influence of closely connected regional currencies, as in the [1997 crisis](/asian-financial-crisis) when the Thai baht imploded.

This turning point, the underlying foundations of which lay in gross excess of dollar-designated debt in the region, immediately spread to local East Asian countries, bringing about widespread currency and market emergencies in the region. The fallout from the crisis likewise struck [emerging markets](/emergingmarketeconomy) in Latin America and Eastern Europe, which is indicative of the capacity of contagions to spread rapidly past regional markets.

## For what reason Does Contagion Happen?

All markets in an economy are interconnected here and there. From the consumer side, numerous consumer goods are [substitutes](/substitute) or supplements to each other. From the producer side, the contributions for any business can be substitutes and supplements for each other, and the labor and capital that a business needs may pretty much be [useful in various types of industries](/asset-specificity) and markets. From a financial perspective, the different markets in an economy generally all utilization a similar type of money and depend on for the most part similar types of financial institutions to work with the flow of goods and services through the economy.

This means that any modern economy is a tremendous and complex web of interdependent relations between producers, consumers, and lenders across all markets. Changes to the underlying conditions that determine [supply and demand](/law-of-supply-demand) in any one market will have effects that overflow into other related markets. Contingent upon the structure and conditions of the economy, this can either make it pretty much versatile to economic shocks.

### What Makes Economies More Susceptible to Contagion

At the point when markets are robust and flexible, the effects of a negative economic shock to one market can be spread out across many related markets in a manner that diminishes the impact of participants in any one market. Envision dropping a steel ball bearing onto a trampoline. The impact gets spread out by the entwined strings of the trampoline and hosed by the springs to which it is appended, without making damage the material.

Then again, when markets are delicate or unbending, a sufficiently strong negative shock in one market can make that market fail, however spread serious damage to different markets, and maybe the whole [economy](/economy). In this case, envision dropping a similar steel ball bearing onto a large sheet of window glass. It could not just break the glass at the point of impact at any point yet spread breaks or even break the whole window. This occurs in an economic contagion, where a large shock to one market spreads breaks or breaks a whole economy.

This means that the major factor driving economic contagion between markets is the robustness (or delicacy) and flexibility of those markets. Markets that are intensely dependent on [debt](/debt); where participants are dependent on some specific commodity or other info; or where conditions prevent the smooth adjustment of prices and amounts, entry and exit of participants, and adjustments to [business models](/businessmodel) or operations will be more delicate and less flexible.

The more delicate and inflexible any given market is, the more it will experience the ill effects of a negative shock. Besides, the more delicate and inflexible markets are as a rule, the more probable that a negative shock in one market will form into a contagion between markets.

Past the robustness (or delicacy) of the individual markets themselves, the scale and intensity of associations between various markets likewise matters. Markets that are not, or are just feebly, interconnected to each other won't send shocks among each other as effectively.

Utilizing the relationship from a higher place, envision dropping a steel ball bearing onto twelve eggs. It will totally break a couple of eggs, however leave the rest totally sound. This is a blade that cuts both ways, in any case; keeping away from interconnection among markets likewise means diminishing the size and scope of the division of labor across an economy and the subsequent gains from [trade](/trade).

## A Brief History of Financial Contagion

The term was first authored during the [1997 Asian financial markets crisis](/asian-financial-crisis), yet the phenomenon had been practically apparent significantly sooner. The global [Great Depression](/great_depression), set off by the 1929 U.S. stock market crash, stays a particularly striking illustration of the effects of contagion in a vigorously indebted, economically integrated global economy.

After the Asian financial crisis, researchers began to investigate how previous financial emergencies spread across national borders, and they presumed that the "nineteenth-century had periodic international financial emergencies in practically consistently starting around 1825." In that year, a banking crisis that originated in London spread to the remainder of Europe and eventually Latin America. In a pattern that has been rehashed from that point onward, the underlying foundations of the crisis were in the expansion of debt through the global financial system.

After a lot of Latin America had been liberated from Spain in the early part of the nineteenth century, [speculators](/examiner) in Europe emptied credit into the landmass. Investment in Latin America turned into a speculative [bubble](/bubble) and, in 1825, the Bank of England (BoE), dreading enormous gold outflows, raised its discount rate, which thus ignited a stock market crash. The resulting panic spread to mainland Europe.

## Features
- At the point when markets are robust, this can buffer negative economic shocks; when markets are delicate, it can amplify negative shocks, similar to the spread of a disease.
- A contagion is the spread of an economic crisis starting with one market or region then onto the next and can happen at both a domestic or international level.
- Since markets are interdependent, events in a single market can impact different markets.
- Typically associated with credit bubbles and financial emergencies, contagions can be appeared as a crash in one market leading to a crash in different markets.
