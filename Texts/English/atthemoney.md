# At The Money (ATM)
## What Is At The Money (ATM)?

At the money (ATM) is a situation where an option's [strike price](/strikeprice) is indistinguishable from the current market price of the [underlying security](/underlying-security). An ATM option has a delta of \u00b10.50, positive in the event that it is a call, negative for a put.

Both call and put options can be all the while ATM. For instance, on the off chance that XYZ stock is trading at $75, the XYZ 75 [call option](/calloption) is ATM as is the XYZ 75 [put option](/putoption). ATM options have no intrinsic value, however will in any case have extrinsic or time value preceding expiration, and might be appeared differently in relation to either in the money (ITM) or out of the money (OTM) options.

## Figuring out At The Money (ATM)

At the money (ATM), now and again alluded to as "on the money", is one of three terms used to depict the relationship between an option's strike price and the underlying security's price, likewise called the option's [moneyness](/moneyness).

Options can be [in the money](/inthemoney) (ITM), [out of the money](/outofthemoney) (OTM), or ATM. ITM means the option has intrinsic value and OTM means it doesn't. Basically, ATM options are not in that frame of mind to profit whenever worked out, but rather still have value â€” there is still time before they terminate so they may yet wind up ITM.

The [intrinsic value](/intrinsicvalue) for a call option is calculated by deducting the strike price from the underlying security's current price. The intrinsic value for a put option, then again, is calculated by deducting the underlying resource's current price from its strike price.

A call option is ITM when the option's strike price is not exactly the underlying security's current price. On the other hand, a put option is ITM when the option's strike price is greater than the underlying security's stock price. In the interim, a call option is OTM when its strike price is greater than the current underlying security's price and a put option is OTM when its strike price is not exactly the underlying resource's current price.

## Special Considerations

Options that are ATM are frequently utilized by traders to build spreads and mixes. [Straddles](/ride), for example, will typically include buying (or selling) both an ATM call and put.

ATM options are the most sensitive to different risk factors, known as an option's "[Greeks](/greeks)". ATM options have a \u00b10.50 [delta](/delta), however have the best amount of gamma, really intending that as the underlying moves its delta will create some distance from \u00b10.50 quickly, and most quickly as time to expiration approaches.

ATM options are the most sensitive to [time decay,](/timedecay) as addressed by an option's [theta](/theta). Also, their prices are generally receptive to changes in volatility, especially for farther maturities, and is communicated by an option's [vega](/vega). At long last, ATM options are likewise generally sensitive to changes in interest rates, as estimated by the [rho](/rho).

## At The Money (ATM) and Near The Money

The term "[near the money](/close the-money)" is now and again used to depict an option that is inside 50 pennies of being ATM. For instance, expect an investor purchases a call option with a strike price of $50.50 and the underlying stock price is trading at $50. In this case, the call option is supposed to be close to the money.

In the above model, the option would be close to the money assuming the underlying stock price was trading between about $49.50 and $50.50. Close to the money and ATM options are appealing when traders anticipate a big movement. Options that are even further OTM may likewise see a leap while a swing is anticipated.

## Options Pricing for At The Money (ATM) Options

An option's price is comprised of intrinsic and [extrinsic value](/extrinsicvalue). Extrinsic value is some of the time called time value, yet time isn't the possibly factor to consider while trading options. [Implied volatility](/iv) likewise assumes a critical part in options pricing.

Like OTM options, ATM options just have extrinsic value since they have no intrinsic value. For instance, expect an investor purchases an ATM call option with a strike price of $25 at a cost of 50 pennies. The extrinsic value is equivalent to 50 pennies and is largely impacted by the progression of time and changes in implied volatility.

Expecting volatility and the price remain predictable, the nearer the option gets to expiry the less extrinsic value it has. Assuming the price of the underlying moves over the strike price to $27, the option currently has $2 of intrinsic value, plus anything that extrinsic value remains.
