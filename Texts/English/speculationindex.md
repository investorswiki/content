# Speculation Index
## What Is the Speculation Index?

The Speculation Index is computed as the ratio of the trading volume on the NYSE American (formerly the [American Stock Exchange](/amex) or AMEX) to that of the [New York Stock Exchange](/nyse) (NYSE). A high level in the index might signal increased [speculation](/speculation) among traders since the NYSE American will in general rundown smaller, more hazardous stocks than the NYSE.

As high levels of speculation happen during bull markets, the Speculation Index is many times seen as a [leading indicator](/leadingindicator) of market activity and sentiment.

## Understanding the Speculation Index

The Speculation Index is calculated by partitioning the total [trading volume](/volumeoftrade) of the NYSE American exchange by the total trading volume of the NYSE. It's not unexpected communicated as a percentage. The higher the percentage, the greater the speculative activity.

The essential assumption behind the Speculation Index is that the NYSE comprises of generally mature [blue-chip](/bluechipstock) companies, while the NYSE American contains smaller companies that are ventured to be more hazardous for investors. Hence, defenders of the Speculation Index contend that increased investment in NYSE American companies as compared to NYSE ones implies more aggressive danger taking by investors, and is, consequently, a proxy for the level of speculative trading activity in U.S. [equity markets](/equitymarket),

Speculation activity is important in light of the fact that it's typically associated with a hopeful inclination among traders and investors — which drives stock prices higher. A few analysts accept that a high Speculation Index means [bullishness](/bull) by investors. In the event that the index gets too high, in any case, it might signal that the market is approaching its pinnacle — and the beginning of the finish of a bull run.

## Analysis of the Speculation Index

Pundits of the Speculation Index point out that since the constituents of the NYSE and NYSE American change after some time, determining just how speculative the parts of each index are at some random time is troublesome.

Likewise, the Speculation Index neglects to account for the way that a developing percentage of trading activity on the two exchanges comprises of [high-frequency trading](/high-frequency-trading) (HFT) strategies. Since these strategies look to take advantage of moment price variances as opposed to investing in view of perceived medium-or long-term misevaluations, the logic that NYSE American investors are on average more speculative than those of the NYSE might have less legitimacy than it did in the past.

## True Example of the Speculation Index

A few investors have developed alternative procedures for checking market sentiment, which dodge the limitations of the Speculation Index. One eminent model is the variant put forward by financial author/podcaster Jesse Felder on his website, The Felder Report.

In a report distributed in February 2018, Felder introduced what he named an alternate "index of the volume of speculation." He offered series of charts exhibiting how the utilization of [margin debt](/margin) by investors has detonated in recent years, even marvellous the level came to at the pinnacle of the now-notorious [dotcom bubble](/dotcom-bubble). His data likewise revealed a negative correlation between levels of margin-based trading and subsequent three-year stock market returns.

Albeit this methodology contrasts from the traditional approach of the Speculation Index, it confirms the regularly held view that high amounts of speculative trading show that the stock market might be approaching its pinnacle.
