# Open Offer

An open offer is a [secondary market](/secondarymarket) offering, like a rights issue. In an open offer, a shareholder is permitted to purchase stock at a price that is lower than the current [market price](/market-price). The purpose of such an offer is to proficiently raise cash for the company.

## Grasping Open Offer

An open offer contrasts from a [rights issue (offering)](/rightsoffering) in that investors can't sell the rights that accompany their purchases to different gatherings. In a traditional rights issue, the trading of transferable rights, associated with shares, happens on the exchange that currently records the issuer's common stock (e.g., NYSE or Nasdaq). These can likewise be listed over the counter (OTC). A few investors see a secondary market offering as a harbinger of terrible news as it causes stock [dilution](/dilution). Additionally, the open offer could signal that the company stock is currently overvalued.

In both a rights issue and open offer, a company permits existing shareholders to purchase extra shares directly from the company in relation to what they currently own. This is to forestall dilution to existing shareholders. Given the lack of dilution, interestingly, with traditional equity issues and secondary offerings, such an issue doesn't need shareholder endorsement. This is in the event that the issue is under 20% of the total shares outstanding.

## Similitudes Between a Rights Issue and an Open Offer

Both a rights issue and open offer opportunity generally last for a fixed time frame period, frequently 16-30 days. This starts on the day the issuer's registration statement for the rights offering becomes effective. No federal securities laws command a specific time span for a rights issue, be that as it may. With the two rights issues and open offers, assuming that an investor lets the time span for the opportunity terminate, she won't receive any cash.

While rights issues are frequently likewise priced at a [subscription](/subscription-price) below the current market price - similarly as with an open offer - these rights are transferable to outer investors. Different types of traditional rights issues incorporate a direct rights issue and insured rights offering (likewise called a standby rights offering). To prepare for any rights offering an issuer must give official documentation to shareholders, alongside marketing materials. The issuer must acquire the exercise certificates and payment from shareholders and file the required Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and exchange documentation. (These are key advances however not a thorough set as all issues contrast.)
