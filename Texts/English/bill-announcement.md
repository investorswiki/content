A bill announcement is delivered several days before a [bill auction](/bill-auction) to launch the interaction. A bill auction is a public auction for Treasury bills that is held week after week by the U.S. Treasury. This is how all U.S. Treasury bills are issued. Starting around 2020, there are 24 authorized primary dealers that are required to bid directly upon each issue. A [primary dealer](/primarydealer) is a pre-endorsed bank, broker-dealer or other financial institution that can make business manages the U.S. Federal Reserve, for example, underwriting new government debt.

All auctions are available to the public through [Treasury Direct](/treasurydirect) or the [Treasury Automated Auction Processing System](/taaps) (TAAPS). Treasury Direct is the online platform through which investors can purchase federal government securities directly from the U.S. Treasury.

## Bill Auction Participants

The base non-competitive tender for a Treasury bill is $10,000. The non-competitive closing time for bills is ordinarily 11:00 a.m. Eastern Time on auction day.
