# Joint Supply
## What Is Joint Supply?

Joint supply is an economic term alluding to a product or handle that can yield at least two results. Common models happen inside the domesticated animals industry: cows can be used for milk, hamburger, and stow away. Sheep can be used for meat, milk products, fleece, and sheepskin. In the event that the [supply](/supply) of cows increases, so will the joint supply of dairy and hamburger products.

## Grasping Joint Supply

Where joint supply exists, the [supply and demand](/law-of-supply-demand) for every product is linked to the others starting from a similar source. For instance, in the event that demand increases for fleece and sheep farmers, in this way, raise more animals for fleece, there will be a connected increase in sheep meat production. This increased production will lead to greater meat supply and possibly lower prices.

Now and again, the extents of the joint products are almost fixed, for example, with cotton and cottonseed. In such cases, extents can't be differed. In different cases, the extent can be variable. For instance, through cross-breeding, it is feasible to breed sheep either for fleece or for meat. So the quantity of one can be increased to the detriment of the other to a degree. Analysts keep a close eye on products in joint supply in light of the fact that [investments](/interest) in one can be essentially affected by what occurs with the other.

One more important issue with joint supply products is the allocation of [expenses](/expense). Since the two products are derived from a similar source, it is frequently challenging to figure out how to split expenses.

It isn't generally plausible to just split the expenses down the middle on account of two products since one product ordinarily sells at a premium to the next. An equivalent split will artificially collapse or expand profits on one product or the other. Moreover, arbitrarily assigning expenses will deliver artificial outcomes. To handle this on the business side, there are generally pricing lattices that work in reverse from the final results to lay out costing for the end goal of reporting.

## Joint Supply versus Joint Demand

Joint demand isn't really connected with joint supply. Rather, joint demand happens when [demand](/demand) for two goods is associated. For instance, printers need ink to function. Essentially, ink cartridges are of no utilization without a printer. Another model could be razors and extremely sharp edges, or gas and motor oil.

Fundamentally, joint demand is the point at which you really want two goods since they cooperate to give a benefit to the consumer. In the event that two goods are in joint demand, they will have a high and negative cross [elasticity of demand](/priceelasticity). All in all, a fall in the price of ink might provoke an increase in demand for printers.

## Highlights
- Joint demand is the point at which you really want two goods since they cooperate to give a benefit, like razors and extremely sharp steels.
- Joint supply isn't really connected with joint demand.
- Dairy cattle is an illustration of joint supply where cows supply different results like milk, hamburger, and stow away.
- Joint supply is the point at which a product or cycle can yield at least two results.
