# Shout Option
## What Is a Shout Option?

A shout option is a [exotic options](/exoticoption) contract that permits the holder to lock in [intrinsic value](/intrinsicvalue) at defined intervals while maintaining the right to continue participating in gains without a loss of locked-in monies.

## Understanding Shout Options

The shout option buyer "shouts" at the option [writer](/writing-an-option) to lock in the gain, yet the contract actually remains open. The shout guarantees a minimum of profit, even on the off chance that the intrinsic value diminishes after the shout. Assuming the option increases in value after the shout, the option buyer can in any case take part in that.

Shout options permit one, or numerous points, where the holder can lock in gains. For instance, if a [call](/calloption) shout option has a [strike price](/strikeprice) is $50 and the underlying asset trades to $60 before expiration, the holder may "shout," or lock in the $10 the option is trading [in the money](/inthemoney) (ITM). The holder actually keeps the call option and can create an extra gain assuming the underlying moves even higher before expiration.

In any case, assuming that the underlying asset dips under $60 before expiration, the holder actually gets to [exercise](/exercise) at $60. The shout is helpful for locking in gains in the event that the buyer thinks the option might lose its intrinsic value, or basically to lock in profit as the option is increasing in value.

Basically, after each shout, the profit floor moves higher for calls options. Just paper profits made after a shout are subject to reversal should the underlying asset decline in price.

A shout [put option](/putoption) works the same way. As the price of the underlying drops, the option buyer can shout to lock in the intrinsic value of the option. Assuming the price of the underlying rises from that point onward, the buyer is as yet guaranteed the intrinsic value they locked in.

> As exotic options that trade OTC, these contracts can have flexible terms, including various shout edges.

## Pricing Shout Options

Similarly as with all options, the holder has the right, however not the obligation to buy, in the case of calls, or sell, in the case of puts, the underlying asset at a defined price by a certain date. Shout options are among the option types that permit the holder to change the terms, according to a predefined schedule, during the life of the options contract.

Due to the uncertainty of what the holder will do, the pricing of these options is convoluted. In any case, in light of the fact that the holder has the opportunity to lock in periodic profits, they are more costly than standard options. Shout options are way reliant options and exceptionally sensitive to [volatility](/volatility). The more unpredictable the underlying asset the more probable the option holder will get the opportunity to shout. The more "shout" opportunities, the more costly the option.

The [writer](/writing-an-option) of the option will demand the [premium](/premium), or cost of the option, be sufficiently large to cover reasonable developments in the underlying. In pricing the option they might involve a comparative standard option as a reference point, and afterward add extra premium to account for the shout feature.

## Illustration of a Shout Option

Shout options are not actively traded, yet think about the following speculative scenario to figure out the way this functions.

A trader buys a shout call option on Apple Inc. (AAPL). The option [expires](/expirationdate) in 90 days, has a strike price of $185, and the buyer is permitted to shout once during the term of the option.

The stock is presently trading at $180. The option premium is $11, or $1,100 for one contract ($11 x 100 shares).

The buyer's breakeven point for the trade is $196 ($185 strike + $11 premium), in spite of the fact that they can shout to lock in intrinsic value anytime when the price of Apple rises above $185.

Expect the buyer is expecting a positive [earnings](/earnings) release which will push the price more than $200 in the coming months.

One month after purchase the stock is trading $193. While this is still not exactly the buyer's breakeven point, they choose to shout. This locks in the intrinsic value of $8 ($193 - $185 strike). This guarantees that they will not lose their whole premium ($11), and will get somewhere around $8 worth of it back.

Presently think about two distinct scenarios after the shout:

1. Assuming the price drops back below $193 and stays there until expiry, the trader actually gets the $8 in intrinsic value they locked in. In this case, they actually lose $3 ($11 - $8) or $300 per contract yet essentially they didn't lose the whole premium which could occur assuming Apple stock is below $185 when the option lapses.
1. Presently accept the price of Apple continues to rise and is trading at $205 when the option terminates. The option has $20 in intrinsic value ($205 - $185 strike). The buyer is as yet able to collect the $20 (or $2,000 per contract) even however they shouted to lock in $8 in intrinsic value. They actually get the higher value since the option expired with greater value than the shout. In this case, the buyer makes $9 or $900 per contract ($2,000 - $1,100).

## Features
- A shout option permits the buyer to lock in the intrinsic value of an option by "shouting" at the writer to do as such.
- Shout options are more costly than standard options due to their flexibility to lock in profit while as yet participating in future profit.
- Shout options are exotic options, and hence their terms can be negotiated.
