For instance, a stock fund with 1,000,000 shares as of now has assets that are worth a total of $100 million. Six months prior, the assets were just worth $50 million, the fund actually has $10 million worth of losses that can be carried forward. In this case, the capital gains exposure is 40% or, all in all, on the off chance that the fund manager realizes the gains, every investor should pay taxes on a $40 capital gain.

## Capital Gain

Capital gain is a rise in the value of a [capital asset](/capitalasset) (investment or real estate) that gives it a higher worth than the purchase price. The gain isn't realized until the asset is sold. A capital gain might be short term (one year or less) or long term (over one year) and must be guaranteed on income taxes.

While capital gains are generally associated with stocks and funds due to their inherent price volatility, a capital gain can happen on any security that is sold at a cost higher than the [purchase price](/purchaseprice) that was paid for it. Realized capital gains and losses happen when an asset is sold, which sets off a taxable event. Unrealized gains and losses, at times alluded to as paper gains and losses, mirror an increase or lessening in an investment's value however have not yet set off a taxable event.

A [capital loss](/capitalloss) is incurred when there is a decline in the capital asset value compared with an asset's purchase price.

## Capital Gains Tax

A [capital gains](/capitalgain) tax is a tax on the profit realized on the sale of a non-stock asset that was greater than the amount realized on the sale. The most common capital gains are realized from the sale of stocks, bonds, precious metals, and property. Not all countries execute a capital gains tax, and most have various rates of taxation for people and corporations.

Taxes are charged by the state over the transactions, dividends and capital gains on the stock market. Nonetheless, these fiscal obligations might shift from one jurisdiction to another.

In the United States, with certain exemptions, people and corporations pay income tax on the net total of all their capital gains. Short-term capital gains are taxed at a higher rate: the ordinary income tax rate. The tax rate for people on "long-term capital gains," which are gains on assets that have been held for over one year before being sold, is lower than the ordinary income tax rate, and in some tax brackets, there is no tax due on such gains.
