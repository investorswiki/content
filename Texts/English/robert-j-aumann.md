# Robert J. Aumann
## Who Is Robert J. Aumann?

Robert J. Aumann is a mathematician who received the 2005 [Nobel Prize in Economics](/nobel-dedication prize-in-financial sciences) along with his co-beneficiary, [Thomas Schelling](/thomas-c-schelling). Aumann's most commended contributions to the fields of math and economics have been in the domain of [game theory](/gametheory).

## Grasping Robert J. Aumann

Aumann was brought into the world in Germany in 1930. In 1938, his family escaped to the U.S. to escape the Nazis. He in the long run moved to Jerusalem, where he has resided and worked from that point onward.

Aumann earned his PhD from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1955, zeroing in on the mathematical theory of rope hitches. From that point, he proceeded to work for the Analytical Research Group at Princeton, where his figure out zeroed in on the hypothetical problem of guarding a city from elevated attack. Around then he started to zero in on game theory, a device he had experienced through the mathematician [John Nash](/john-f-nash-jr) while at MIT. In 1956, Aumann took a position as teacher of mathematics at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem.

### Strict Work

Aumann is a strict Jew and has acquired consideration outside of the fields of math and economics for utilizing game theory to dissect problems in the Talmud, or Jewish sacred writing. He likewise momentarily mixed contention for his interest in book of scriptures or Torah codes. Notwithstanding, in the wake of digging into trial and error and research with peers, Aumann established that the analysis failed to affirm the presence of any definitive code.

Aumann has given addresses inside Israel on the significance of keeping up with strict confidence to keep the state alive. He has long been a vocal defender of Israel as a Jewish state and refered to game theory as he contended against the Israeli withdrawal from Gaza in 2005.

## Contributions

Aumann's most noted contributions lie in the field of game theory.

### Rehashed Games and the Folk Theorem

Robert Aumann originally got the notice of the mathematics world with his work on rehashed games, which he distributed as a set of speculations in 1959. He later developed and distributed his Folk Theorem. Taken together, these publications portray the relationship between equilibrium behavior in rehashed games and cooperative behavior, the basis for the concept of associated equilibrium.

### Connected Equilibrium

Aumann was the main person to explain related equilibrium as a phenomenon. Connected equilibrium is like [Nash's Equilibrium](/nash-equilibrium), however thought to be more flexible. In a related equilibrium, the players in a game pick in view of some piece of public data accessible to every player and expecting that different players won't digress from their best strategy given a similar data. A rehashed game where every player knows the past decisions of different players can merge to a related equilibrium.

### Deficient Information

As a team with Michael Maschler, Aumann investigated the theory of games with fragmented data. This includes games where the players don't have a similar data, and the data that they have might be dependent or independent of the other players' decisions and data. Aumann's work in this area would proceed to assist with forming U.S. arms control negotiation strategy during the Cold War.

## Features
- Robert Aumann is a mathematician who has made important contributions to the field of game theory.
- Aumann's work centers around the theory of rehashed games under different conditions of data and information accessible to the players.
- He was awarded the 2005 Nobel Prize in Economics for his contribution to the comprehension of rehashed cooperative and competitive games.
