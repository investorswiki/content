# Income Exclusion Rule
## What Is the Income Exclusion Rule?

The income exclusion rule sets to the side certain types of income as non-taxable.

There are many types of income that qualify under this rule, for example, life insurance death benefit proceeds, [child support](/divorce settlement payment), welfare, and [municipal bond](/municipalbond) income. Income that is excluded isn't reported anyplace on Form 1040.

Generally, there is no restriction to the amount of this type of income that can be received. One exception is municipal bond interest, which might be considered back an alternative least [tax preference item](/tax-preference-thing).

Income that is excluded from [taxation](/taxation) is generally concurred this status as a measure of relief for the beneficiary (or, in all likelihood as the consequence of strong campaigning, similarly as with life insurance).

## Income Exclusion Rules and Social Security

For Social Security purposes, not all that an individual gets is viewed as income. Generally, on the off chance that a thing received can't be utilized as, or to acquire, food or shelter, it won't be considered as income.

For instance, assuming that somebody pays an individual's medical or automobile repair bills, or offers free medical care, or on the other hand on the off chance that the individual gets money from a social services agency that is a repayment of an amount he/she recently spent, that value isn't viewed as income to the individual.

What's more, a few things viewed as income are excluded while deciding the amount of an individual's benefit. A nitty gritty rundown of social security income exclusions can be found in segment V.B of the SSI Annual Report.
