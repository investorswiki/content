# Help-Wanted Index (HWI)
## What Is the Help-Wanted Index?

The Conference Board's Help-Wanted Index (HWI) measures how efficiently employers are matching jobs to the accessible labor force (the jobless) and is an important check on the economy.

The Conference Board, searching for a method for enlarging the portfolio of employment statistics, made the Help-Wanted Advertising Index in 1951. The clearest contribution made by the HWI is its measure of the changes in employment demand as addressed on the classified pages of papers, which is viewed as a [leading indicator](/leadingindicator) of unemployment. The apparently more significant contribution is the HWI's indirect measure of the slack in the job market â€” that is, the number of jobs that are going unfilled, or how efficient the job-matching cycle is.

## Understanding the Help-Wanted Index (HWI)

At the point when the Help-Wanted Index (HWI) is rising, it means there are a somewhat large amount of positions waiting be filled. This can be deciphered as a shortage of workers. Since employers might need to raise wages to draw in workers, wage inflation could result, which could adversely affect bond and [equity markets](/equitymarket).

Made first in 1951, the index added up to the lines of help-wanted classified ads from 51 leading papers, each from an alternate metropolitan statistical area around the United States.

The HWI was rebuilt to rise to 100 of every 1987 and is released to the public in a month to month press release. The Conference Board releases a national number for the HWI, alongside regional numbers addressing nine sections of the country, and a percentage number addressing the extent of the labor market with rising need promotion volume. The current HWI report can be found on the Conference Board's website.

The Conference Board is made out of a board of executives and trustees and its voting individuals. Most as of late, these positions were filled by some high-positioning executives from corporations including Deutsche Bank, BBVA, Deere and Company, Johnson and Johnson, Monsanto, MasterCard, General Electric, Novartis, and State Farm Insurance.
