# Block Height
Block level addresses the number of blocks that were confirmed in the whole history of a specific blockchain network - from the [genesis block](/genesis-block) (or block zero) until the latest one. Not at all like the genesis block, any remaining blocks contain a reference (hash) to the block that came preceding it, and the block level is the number of each block in that sequence. So the block level of the genesis block is #0, and the block level of the primary block mined is #1.
Since blockchains are comprised of blocks, a similarity that is now and again used to depict them is envisioning blockchains as stacks of legos. It is basically impossible to eliminate a lego from the middle of the stack without wrecking the whole structure - it isn't like Jenga where you can slip out a block without compromising the others.
Accordingly, the block level can be calculated when since the blockchain has sent off partitioned by the average block season of the chain. As such, the block level comprises of the number of blocks mined (or approved) starting from the creation of a specific blockchain network.
Hypothetically, the average block time ought to be generally the target block time, in view of the level of mining difficulty. Mining difficulty for some blockchains changes in light of the amount of aggregate hashrate that the network has so the block period can remain generally consistent. On account of Bitcoin, the block time is 10 minutes, on average. If not, the expected block period might vacillate in response to the amount of computational resources that excavators committed to that specific network.
Block level ought not be compared straightforwardly between various blockchains, as their average block period and hash rates are unique. Nonetheless, a copy of a blockchain might be thought of "somewhat off" in the event that the block level of the neighborhood copy contrasts from what the universally accepted block level is. In this way, block level is a helpful detail to take a gander at whether the copy of the given blockchain is exceptional or not.

## Features
- The current block level of a blockchain is an indication of its current size or time in presence.
- Block level alludes to a specific location in a blockchain, estimated by the number of confirmed blocks that go before it.
- Decentralized consensus calculations ordinarily function by consenting to mine the chain with the longest block level.
