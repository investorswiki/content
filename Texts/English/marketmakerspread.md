# Market-Maker Spread
## What Is the Market-Maker Spread?

The market-maker spread is the difference between the price at which a [market-maker](/marketmaker) (MM) will buy a security and the price at which selling the security is willing. The market-maker spread is successfully the [bid-ask spread](/bid-askspread) that market makers will focus on. It is the difference between the [bid](/bid) and the [ask](/ask) price posted by the market maker for security.

This spread addresses the potential profit that the market maker can make from this activity, and it's intended to remunerate it for the risk of market-production. The risk inherent in a given market can influence the width of the market-maker spread: High volatility or a lack of [liquidity](/liquidity) in a security will quite often increase the size of the market-maker spread.

## Understanding the Market-Maker Spread

Market makers' job is to add liquidity to markets by being ready to buy and sell designated [securities](/security) whenever during the trading day. While the spread between the bid and ask is a couple of pennies, market makers can profit by executing huge number of [trades](/trade) in a day and skillfully trading their "book." However, these profits can be cleared out by unpredictable markets in the event that the market maker is gotten on some unacceptable side of the trade.

Market makers, who might be either independent or an employee of financial firms, offer to sell securities at a given price (the ask price) and will likewise bid to purchase securities at a given price (the bid price). MMs earn a living by having market participants buy at their offer and sell to their bid again and again, every day of the week.

The market-maker spread can be viewed as a measure of the liquidity (for example the supply and demand) of a specific asset. As market makers are more able to bid or offer, there are bigger sizes on the spread, and bigger volumes can execute without moving the market too a lot. Market-maker spreads will generally be tighter in additional actively traded names, and in those that have more market makers accessible to make markets.

## Special Considerations

As opposed to tracking the price of each and every trade in Alpha, MM's [traders](/trader) will take a gander at the [average price](/averageprice) of the stock north of thousands of trades. Assuming MM is long Alpha shares in its inventory, its traders will endeavor to guarantee that Alpha's average price in its inventory is below the current [market price](/market-price) so that its market-production in Alpha is profitable. Assuming MM is short Alpha, the average price ought to be over the current market price, so that the [net short](/netshort) position can be closed out at a profit by buying back Alpha shares at a less expensive price.

Market-maker spreads augment during unstable market periods due to the increased risk of loss. They likewise extend for stocks that have a low trading volume, poor price visibility, or low liquidity.

## Illustration of Market-Maker Spread

For instance, envision that a market maker MM in a stock - we should call it Alpha - shows a bid and ask price with a quote of $10.00 - 10.05. This means that this MM is able to both buy Alpha shares for $10 and sell it at $10.05. The spread of 5 pennies is the potential profit per share traded to the market maker. In the event that MM can trade 10,000 shares at the posted bid and ask, its profit from the spread would consequently be $500.

## Highlights

- Market makers earn a residing by having investors or traders buy securities where MMs offer them available to be purchased and having them sell securities where MMs will buy.
- The market-maker spread is the difference in bid and ask price set by the market makers in a specific security.
- High volatility or increased risk can lead to MMs extending their spreads to redress.
