# Asset Management and Disposition Agreement (AMDA)
## What Was an Asset Management and Disposition Agreement (AMDA)?

An asset management and disposition agreement (AMDA) was a type of contract between the [Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.](/fdic) (FDIC) and an independent contractor that directed and sold the assets of failed [savings and loan](/federal-savings-and-loan) (S&L) institutions during the S&L crisis of the 1980s and 1990s.

Asset management and disposition agreements (AMDAs) became vital when the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp. (FSLIC) assumed control over various failed S&Ls (likewise called "frugalities") during the crisis, procuring billions of dollars' worth of assets simultaneously. At the point when the FSLIC (which was to the S&L industry what the FDIC is to the banking industry) failed during the crisis, it was canceled in 1989, and the FDIC turned into the head of the FSLIC Resolution Fund.

## Figuring out an Asset Management and Disposition Agreement (AMDA)

The [savings and loan financial crisis](/sl-crisis) was a consequence of the closure of 1,617 banks and 1,295 savings and loan institutions from 1980 to 1994 that brought about a loss or assistance of $303 billion in bank assets and $621 billion savings and loan assets. The majority of these banks were small with their establishments worked in the energy and agriculture sector. At the point when the U.S. energy sector endured a shot during the late 1970s, which came about in [stagflation](/stagflation) and an unpredictable interest rate environment, these banks were hit hard.

Since there were a bigger number of assets of failed S&Ls than the FDIC could handle all alone, the government made the [Resolution Trust Corp. ](/resolution-trust-corporation)(RTC), whose purpose was to determine all frugalities set under conservatorship or receivership between Jan. 1, 1989, and Aug. 8, 1992.

The RTC didn't have the capacity to determine all the failed S&Ls and was required to contract the work out to the [private sector](/private-sector) where viable. Asset management and disposition agreements (AMDAs) were the partnership agreements that shaped the legal structure for the work. 91 contractors worked under these agreements in the mid 1990s to handle $48.5 billion in assets.

[Asset specialists](/asset-trained professional) who worked for the FDIC or RTC handled or managed the transactions. The contractors received management fees, disposition fees, and incentive fees in exchange for their work in overseeing performing assets and discarding nonperforming ones. A portion of the funds received through AMDAs were put toward additional settling the crisis.

### Overseeing Failed Assets

AMDAs were one of many apparatuses the government employed in settling the S&L crisis. A portion of different instruments for overseeing and [liquidating](/liquidation) assets during the crisis incorporated the Federal Asset Disposition Association, the FSLIC-possessed and recently made S&L asset liquidation agreements (ALAs), which were utilized to discard pools of [distressed](/distressedsecurities) assets worth no less than $1 billion, and regional ALAs for smaller pools of under $500 million.

Altogether, the RTC liquidated 747 indebted S&Ls during the crisis. These elements had $402.6 billion in assets and the cost to the RTC was $87.5 billion. The failed banks that the FDIC handled had $302.6 billion in assets and it cost the FDIC $36.3 billion to deal with these failed substances.

The FDIC settled these bank disappointments in four primary ways: (1) purchase and presumptions, (2) insured deposit transfers, (3) open bank assistance, and (4) straight deposit adjustments. The percentage each was utilized was 73.5%, 10.9%, 8.2%, and 7.4%, individually.
