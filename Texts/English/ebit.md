# Earnings Before Interest and Taxes (EBIT)
## What Is EBIT?
EBIT is an abbreviation for earnings before interest and taxes, and estimating a company's management of profitability is utilized. Just as its name infers, it is the amount of profit before interest expenses and tax payments are deducted. EBIT is additionally called profit before interest and taxes (PBIT), and is utilized in lieu of [operating income](/operatingincome) by certain investors and analysts.
For companies that have more debt than equity in which interest costs can be high and for those that carry a high corporate tax rate, making sense of income on an EBIT basis can be helpful in light of the fact that it rejects those expenses. Executive management will in some cases express that in spite of their net income being low or at a loss, profit was high or the loss was smaller on an EBIT basis.
## The most effective method to Calculate EBIT
EBIT can be calculated by utilizing details found in a company's [income statement](/incomestatement). For publicly traded companies, the income statement is part of the financial statement recorded quarterly and every year with the Securities and Exchange Commission. EBIT, however, is definitely not a normalized measure under generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP).
While operating income is calculated top-down along a company's income statement ([revenue](/revenue) minus [cost of goods sold](/cogs) and [operating expenses](/operating_expense)), EBIT adopts the bottom-up strategy. From net income, which is alluded to as the bottom line, the details that seem higher — arrangements for tax and interest costs — are added, and the sum ought to be equivalent to the company's operating income.
There are occurrences in which a company's EBIT isn't equivalent to operating income due to costs or income that aren't part of its normal, everyday operations. Non-operating expenses incorporate former representatives' post-retirement benefits like life insurance and medical plans, and gains and losses from foreign currency transactions. Or on the other hand the company might have briefly been engaged with a deal that was outside of its normal business and expected to record that trade.
