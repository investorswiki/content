# Paper Wallet
As the name proposes, a paper [wallet ](/bitcoin-wallet)consists of a piece of paper on which the public and private keys of a cryptocurrency address are physically printed out. These keys are frequently shown as QR codes, alongside their individual alphanumeric strings.

Alice could physically set the outputs of her transaction to incorporate both Bob's address and one more address that she controls (to send the change back to her) - however this would require some technical information. Assuming Alice neglects to make a change output for herself, the excess 7 BTC could be taken by the miner that approves that transaction's block.
