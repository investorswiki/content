## What is a trustee?
A person or firm that oversees assets for the benefit of an outsider is called a trustee. Trustees regulate several distinct types of financial circumstances, including trusts, liquidations and certain types of pensions or [retirement ](/investing)plans. Trustee must go with the best potential choices for beneficiaries, the people who benefit from the property or assets over which the trustee is in charge.
## More profound definition
To comprehend the job of a trustee, it assists with surveying what a trust is. A trust is a legal document that acts as its very own entity. It can hold property and assets, and it incorporates directions with respect to whom you need to manage your affairs and where you believe your assets should go when you pass on.
The trustee is the person or firm that deals with the resources in the trust. Many individuals act as their own trustee however long they are intellectually able, and on the off chance that they are married they will regularly hand off the job to their spouse when they can never again oversee it. In the event that there is no spouse or the spouse is unable to act as a trustee, a replacement trustee will be named to deal with the trust.
A trustee is committed to follow certain rules. The trustee must:
- Invest trust assets in a conservative way that will lead to growth.
- Keep accurate records, file taxes, and make reports to beneficiaries.
- Not favor any beneficiary over another, except if the trust demands they do as such.
- Not use assets for his own motivations, except if it is authorized by the trust.
- Not mix trust assets with his own.

There is a bankruptcy trustee named in essentially every individual bankruptcy case. Trustee duties shift contingent upon whether the bankruptcy case falls under Chapter 7 or Chapter 13, the two most common types of personal bankruptcy.
There is a bankruptcy estate made at whatever point somebody files for bankruptcy. Like a trust, the estate acts similar to claim legal entity and involves the debtor's property. A trustee regulates the estate, does duties as illustrated by bankruptcy law, and acts to the greatest advantage of creditors.
## Trustee model
Chapter 7 bankruptcy is thought of as a "liquidation" due to the fact that a debtor's assets can be sold to assist with recovering creditors' losses. Hence, a trustee in a Chapter 7 case must:
- Gather property remembered for the bankruptcy estate.
- Sell the estate's property.
- Survey and challenge claims made by creditors.
- Apportion proceeds of the sale to creditors.
- Go against the discharge of bankruptcy in the event debtors didn't as expected go along.

Frequently alluded to as "redesign," Chapter 13 bankruptcy expects that debtors think of a plan to repay their creditors inside three to five years. A trustee as indicated by Chapter 13 will:
- Assess the repayment plan as proposed by the debtor.
- Go against the plan as the need might arise.
- Collect payments from the debtor.
- Assign payments to creditors.

While directing a qualified retirement plan, a trustee must:
- Manage the plan as indicated by administering documents.
- Work solely in the interest of plan participants.
- Act in a prudent way.
- Enhance the plan to limit loss.
- Follow all rules set forward by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA).
- Value qualified assets at least fair market value.

No matter what the type of estate the person in question supervises, a trustee's primary duty is to the beneficiaries of the trust. Inability to stick to this primary duty can lead to a trustee being taken out and swapped for bungle.
