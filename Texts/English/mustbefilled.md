# Must Be Filled (MBF) Order
## What Is a Must Be Filled (MBF) Order?

A must be filled (MBF) order is a trade that must be executed due to lapsing [options](/option) or [futures](/futurescontract) contracts on those exchanges. Numerous MBF orders are filled on the third Friday of every month, at the market open, on the grounds that many types of options and futures contracts lapse on that day every month.

## Understanding a Must Be Filled (MBF) Order

Must be filled orders should be put into the system by 5 pm (may shift by exchange) on the day preceding the expiration date. These orders are then filled at the [opening](/openingprice) price of [options](/cboe) or [futures exchange](/futuresexchange) on the next day, which is the expiration Friday. Options and futures contracts are [derivatives](/subsidiary), meaning they get their value from an underlying security, stock, or [commodity](/commodity), like wheat.

Options give the holder the right to buy or sell an underlying security at a predetermined price — called the [strike price](/strikeprice) — and [expiration date](/expiration-date). Futures contracts are more normalized than options, meaning they have set maturity dates and amounts for each contract, yet additionally permit an investor to buy or sell the underlying asset at a set price and expiration date. Futures contracts can likewise bring about the delivery of the [underlying asset](/underlying-asset) at the contract's maturity, like on account of a commodity.

Nonetheless, an options contracts could likewise require the delivery of the underlying security, like the shares of a stock.

The two futures and options can likewise be utilized to guess on the price of the underlying and permit an offsetting contract to be reserved against the initial contract at its maturity. The investor would understand a gain or loss between the buy and sale contracts.

### Futures Contracts

The MBF order lets the exchange realize that the order needs to satisfy the obligation of a futures contract for a buyer or seller. In a futures contract, there's a buyer and a seller to every transaction, meaning somebody must satisfy the contract at its preset price and by the expiration date. In the event that, for instance, two parties are engaged with a futures contract for wheat, one of the parties must deliver on that obligation (delivering the wheat), while the other party must deliver on the settled upon price for purchasing the wheat.

### Selling Options

Options contracts have an upfront [premium](/option-premium) joined to them. The buyer of a [call option](/calloption), who maintains that the right should buy a stock, will pay the premium upfront for the right to buy the stock at the preset strike price for the contract. The buyer has the privilege to walk away from the contract and let it terminate assuming incidentally, the market price of the stock is a lot of lower than the strike price of the option. The buyer would only purchase the shares at the prevailing price, which is lower than the strike.

Be that as it may, sellers or [writers](/writer) of options can't walk away from the [obligation](/obligation) of an options contract. Since options have a premium joined to them, the option seller gets compensated the premium upfront yet surrenders the right to [exercise](/exercise) the option. The holder of the option or the buyer will exercise the option on the off chance that the underlying stock price moves in the buyer's approval. The seller believes that the stock price should move very little or in the seller's approval.

On the off chance that the option moves in the buyer's approval and it's exercised, the seller is committed to satisfy the contract by either selling their shares or buying shares from the buyer at the preset strike price of the contract. In return for this risk, the seller keeps the premium regardless of the situation.

The must be filled order is part of the option selling process and is the realization that the contract's obligation should be fulfilled by the seller. The MBF order tells the exchange that the order should be filled to satisfy the obligation of the option seller. Additionally, the MBF order expects that the whole amount of the order be filled.

## Must be Filled Orders and Price Changes

MBF orders are treated as [pre-market](/premarket) orders, which are set the night before and afterward executed at the opening price. The actual orders influence the opening price, just as any order that is executed on the open does. Buy and sell orders that come into the exchange to be executed on the open must be matched.

For instance, assuming there are undeniably more buy orders than sell orders (in terms of share [volume](/volume)), this will push the opening price up until there is adequate sell volume to fulfill the buy orders. On the flip side, a bigger amount of sell volume will push the opening price lower. Imbalances between opening buy and sell orders are plugged to market participants who can then pick assuming they wish to [add liquidity](/liquidity) to reduce the imbalance.

The third Friday in March, June, September, and December is alluded to as [triple witching](/triplewitchinghour) on the grounds that stock [index options](/indexoption), stock [index futures](/indexfutures), and stock options all terminate on nowadays. With the presentation of individual stock futures, which additionally lapse on nowadays, the term [quadruple witching](/quadruplewitching) is likewise utilized.

## Illustration of a Must be Filled (MBF) Order

For instance, in the event that a trader composes (or sells) 10 [call](/revealed option) option contracts on XYZ stock at $20, and XYZ stock is right now trading at $24, the buyer or owner of the option has a profit — called [in the money](/inthemoney). At the end of the day, the buyer can exercise the option and force the option writer to sell their shares of stock at the $20 strike price. The buyer would probably sell those shares in the market at the prevailing price of $24 and understand a profit.

The writer will put out a MBF order for 1,000 shares (10 contracts x 100 shares) in which the writer is committed to have 1,000 shares to deliver to the option buyer. Thus, a MBF order is utilized to ensure they have the shares on the expiration day.
