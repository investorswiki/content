# Closed Economy
## What Is a Closed Economy?

A closed economy is one that has no trading activity with outside economies. The closed economy is in this way altogether independent, and that implies no imports come into the country and no exports leave the country. The goal of a closed economy is to furnish domestic consumers with all that they need from inside the country's boundaries.

## Why There Are No Real Closed Economies

Keeping a closed economy is troublesome in modern society in light of the fact that [raw materials](/rawmaterials, for example, [crude oil](/crude-oil), play a fundamental job as contributions to definite goods. Numerous countries don't have raw materials normally and are forced to import these resources. Closed economies are outlandish to modern, liberal economic theory, which advances the kickoff of domestic markets to international markets to capitalize on [comparative advantages](/comparativeadvantage) and trade.

By work in labor and apportioning resources to their most productive, efficient operations, companies and people can increase their riches.

## The Proliferation of Open Trade

Recent[ globalization](/globalization) suggests that economies are having a tendency to turn out to be more open to exploit international trade. A genuine illustration of a raw material that is traded internationally is petroleum. For example, in 2017, as per **World'sTopExport.com**, an independent research and instructive firm, the five greatest crude oil exporters represented over USD$841.1 billion worth of exports.

- Saudi Arabia at $133.6 billion
- Russia at $93.3 billion
- Iraq at $61.5 billion
- Canada at $54 billion
- The United Arab Emirates at $49.3 billion.

As per the U.S. Energy Information Administration, even the United States, the biggest producer of oil in the world, imported generally 10.4 million barrels each day in 2017, the majority of which comes from Canada, Saudi Arabia, Mexico, Venezuela, and Iraq.

## Why Close Off an Economy?

A totally open economy runs the risk of turning out to be excessively dependent on imports. Likewise, domestic producers might endure on the grounds that they can't contend at low international prices. Thusly, governments might utilize trade controls like [tariffs](/duty), endowments, and [quotas](/quantity) to support domestic undertakings.

Albeit closed economies are rare, a government might close off a specific industry from international competition. Some oil-creating countries have a history of forbidding foreign petroleum firms from carrying on with work inside their nation.

## Illustration of a Closed Economy

In practice, there are no totally closed economies. Brazil imports the least amount of goods — when estimated as a portion of the gross domestic product (GDP) — in the world and is the world's most closed economy. Brazilian companies face difficulties in terms of seriousness, including exchange rate appreciation and defensive trade policies. In Brazil, simply the biggest and most efficient companies with critical economies of scale can defeat barriers to export.
