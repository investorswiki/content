# Inherited IRA
## What Is an Inherited IRA?

An inherited IRA is an account that is opened when an individual inherits an IRA or employer-sponsored retirement plan after the original owner bites the dust. The individual inheriting the [Individual Retirement Account](/ira) (IRA) (the beneficiary) might be anybody — a spouse, relative, or unrelated party or entity (estate or trust). Rules on the best way to handle an inherited IRA differ for spouses and non-spouses, however.

An inherited IRA is otherwise called a "beneficiary IRA." Many of the top brokers for IRAs provide support in resolving these matters related to the inheritance of IRA assets, taxation issues, and continuation of retirement account status.

Tax laws surrounding inherited IRAs are very confounded, and they turned out to be even more so with the Setting Every Community Up For Retirement Enhancement (SECURE) Act of 2019, which rolled out a few critical improvements to the regulations — basically for heirs other than spouses.

## Understanding the Inherited IRA

A beneficiary might open an inherited IRA utilizing the proceeds from an IRA, including traditional, Roth, rollover, SEP, and SIMPLE IRAs. Generally, assets held in the deceased individual's IRA must be transferred into another inherited IRA in the beneficiary's name.

This transfer must be made even if a lump-sum distribution is planned. Extra contributions may not be made to an inherited IRA.

The Internal Revenue Service provides rules for inherited IRA beneficiaries. IRS forms 1099-R and 5498 are required for reporting inherited IRAs and their distributions for tax purposes.

Inherited IRAs are treated something very similar, whether they are traditional IRAs or Roth IRAs. The tax treatment of withdrawals differs — steady with the type of IRA (funded with pre-tax dollars, similar to the traditional type, or post-tax dollars, similar to the Roth).

## Inherited IRAs: Rules for Spouses

Spouses have more flexibility in how to handle an inherited IRA. For one, they can roll over the IRA, or a part of the IRA, into their own existing individual retirement accounts; the big advantage of this is the ability to defer [required least distributions](/requiredminimumdistribution) (RMDs) of the funds until they reach the age of 72.

> RMDs previously started at 70\u00bd, yet the age was raised to 72 following the December 2019 passage of the Setting Every Community Up For Retirement Enhancement (SECURE) Act.
>

They have 60 days from receiving a distribution to roll it over into their own IRAs as long as the distribution is certainly not a required least distribution.

Spousal heirs can likewise set up a separate inherited IRA account, as described previously. How they deal with this IRA relies upon the age of the deceased account holder.

If the original owner had already started receiving RMDs at the hour of death, the spousal beneficiary must keep on receiving the distributions as determined or present another schedule in light of their own life expectancy. On the off chance that the owner had not yet committed to a RMD schedule or reached their [required beginning date](/requiredbeginningdate) (RBD) — the age at which they needed to start RMDs — the beneficiary of the IRA has a five-year window to withdraw the funds, which would then be subject to income taxes.

## Inherited IRAs: Rules for Non-Spouses

Non-spouse beneficiaries may not treat an inherited IRA as their own. That is, they may not make extra contributions to the account, nor might they at any point transfer funds into an existing IRA account they have in their own names. Non-spouses may not leave assets in the original IRA. They must set up another inherited IRA account except if they have any desire to distribute the assets promptly through a lump-sum payment.

It is in the realm of distributions that the SECURE Act most drastically influences non-spouse inheritors of IRAs. Previously, these beneficiaries could handle RMDs pretty much as spousal heirs could; in particular, they could recalculate them in light of their own life expectancy — which frequently fundamentally decreased the annual amount that must be withdrawn and the tax due on them (on account of traditional IRAs).

> The people who inherit Roth IRAs are required to take distributions (in contrast to the original account owners), however the funds remain tax-free and furthermore free of any early-withdrawal penalty, even assuming that the beneficiary is under 59\u00bd.

No more. That's what the SECURE Act directs, for accounts inherited after Dec. 31, 2019, non-spouse beneficiaries regularly must cash out the account in somewhere around 10 years of the original owner's death. A few heirs are excluded: those whose age is in something like a decade of the deceased's, disabled or chronically ill individuals, or minor children. However, these minors must be direct relatives (no grandchildren, in other words), and, when they reach majority age, the 10-year rule kicks in for them too. There's no particular schedule for the withdrawals; they can be taken annually or at the same time.

For beneficiaries in these categories and those already in possession of inherited IRAs, the old distribution rules and schedules remain in effect.
