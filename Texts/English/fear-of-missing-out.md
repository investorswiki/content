# Fear Of Missing Out (FOMO)
FOMO is the abbreviation for "Fear Of Missing Out." The concept was first portrayed in 2000 by Dr. Dan Herman in a scholarly paper named "The Journal of Brand Management." However, the abbreviation FOMO was begat several years after the fact by Patrick McGinnis in an assessment piece distributed in 2004 on the American magazine "The Harbus."
The concept alludes to the sensation of tension or the possibility that others are sharing in a positive or unique experience while you are missing out. A phenomenon is very common in social media, with the feeds from others frequently featuring and underscoring the positive and compensating parts of their lives, leading the reader to feel miserable or lacking with their own experiences.
With regards to financial markets and trading, FOMO alludes to the fear that a trader or investor feel by missing out on a possibly lucrative investment or trading opportunity. The FOMO feeling is especially pervasive when an asset ascends in value fundamentally throughout a generally short time. This has the potential for an individual (and the market community as a whole) to pursue market choices in light of feeling (the fear of missing out) rather than logic and thinking. It is particularly dangerous for the unrestrained retail investor, as it can frequently lead to a situation where trades are made for an asset that is overrated, causing in a lot greater risks of financial losses.
