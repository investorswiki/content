## What Is the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT)?

The General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), endorsed on October 30, 1947, by 23 countries, was a legal agreement limiting barriers to international trade by disposing of or decreasing [quotas](/share), [tariffs](/tariff), and [subsidies](/sponsorship) while saving critical regulations. The GATT was planned to support economic recovery after World War II through recreating and changing global trade.

The GATT came full circle on January 1, 1948. Since that beginning it has been refined, in the long run leading to the creation of the [World Trade Organization (WTO)](/wto) on January 1, 1995, which absorbed and extended it. At this point 125 nations were signatories to its agreements, which covered around 90% of global trade.

The Council for Trade in Goods (Goods Council) is responsible for the GATT and comprises of agents from all WTO member countries. As of September 2020, the chair of the Goods Council is Swedish Ambassador Mikael Anz\u00e9n. The council has 10 committees that address subjects including market access, agriculture, endowments, and anti-dumping measures.

## Grasping the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT)

The GATT was made to form rules to end or confine the most expensive and unwanted elements of the prewar protectionist period, to be specific quantitative trade barriers, for example, trade controls and shares. The agreement likewise gave a system to arbitrate commercial debates among nations, and the structure empowered a number of multilateral exchanges for the reduction of tariff barriers. The GATT was viewed as a critical outcome in the postwar years.

One of the key accomplishments of the GATT was that of trade without discrimination. Each signatory member of the GATT was to be treated as equivalent to some other. This is known as the [most-favored-nation principle](/mostfavorednation), and it has been carried through into the WTO. A functional outcome of this was that once a country had negotiated a tariff cut for certain different countries (typically its most important trading partners), this equivalent cut would consequently apply to all GATT signatories. Escape statements existed, by which countries could arrange special cases assuming their domestic producers would be especially hurt by tariff cuts.

Most nations adopted the most-favored-nation principle in setting tariffs, which generally supplanted quantities. Tariffs (desirable over portions yet a trade barrier) were thus cut consistently in rounds of successive talks.
