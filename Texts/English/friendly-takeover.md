## What Is Friendly Takeover?

A friendly takeover is the act of target company's management and board of directors consenting to be absorbed by a getting company.

## Grasping Friendly Takeover

A friendly takeover is ordinarily subject to endorsement by both the target company's shareholders and the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ). In circumstances where the DOJ neglects to grant endorsement for a friendly takeover, it's regularly in light of the fact that the deal disregards antitrust (hostile to imposing business model) laws.

In a friendly [takeover](/takeover), a public offer of stock or cash is made by the gaining firm. The board of the target firm will publicly endorse the buyout terms, which hence must be greenlit by shareholders and regulators, to push ahead. Friendly takeovers stand as an unmistakable difference to [hostile takeovers](/hostiletakeover), where the company being acquired doesn't support the buyout, and frequently battles against the acquisition.

In a majority of cases, in the event that the board endorses a buyout offer from a getting firm, the shareholders follow suit, by similarly voting for the deal's entry. In most prospective friendly takeovers, the price per share that is being offered is the chief consideration, at last deciding if a deal is approved.

Hence, the securing company as a rule tries to offer fair buyout terms, for example, buying shares at a premium to the current market price. The size of this premium, given the company's growth possibilities, will decide the target company's support for the buyout.
