## What Is a Wedge?

A wedge is a price pattern set apart by meeting trend lines on a price chart. The two trend lines are drawn to interface the separate ups and downs of a price series throughout 10 to 50 periods. The lines show that the ups and the downs are either rising or falling at varying rates, giving the presence of a wedge as the lines approach a convergence. Wedge molded trend lines are viewed as helpful indicators of a possible reversal in price action by [technical analysts](/technical-analyst).

## Understanding the Wedge Pattern

A wedge pattern can signal either bullish or bearish price reversals. Regardless, this pattern holds three common qualities: first, the combining trend lines; second, a pattern of declining volume as the price advances through the pattern; third, a breakout from one of the trend lines. The two forms of the wedge pattern are a rising wedge (which signals a bearish reversal) or a falling wedge (which signals a bullish reversal).

## Rising Wedge

This typically happens when a security's price has been rising after some time, yet it can likewise happen amidst a downward trend too.

The trend lines drawn above and below the price chart pattern can converge to assist a trader or analyst with expecting a breakout [reversal](/reversal). While price can be out of either trend line, wedge patterns tend to break the other way from the trend lines.

Hence, rising wedge patterns demonstrate the more probable capability of falling prices after a breakout of the lower trend line. Traders can make bearish trades after the breakout by selling the security short or utilizing derivatives, for example, futures or options, it being charted to rely upon the security. These trades would try to profit on the potential that prices will fall.

## Falling Wedge

At the point when a security's price has been falling after some time, a wedge pattern can happen just as the trend takes its last downward action. The trend lines drawn over the ups and below the downs on the price chart pattern can converge as the price slide loses momentum and purchasers step in to slow the rate of decline. Before the lines converge, the price may breakout over the upper trend line.

At the point when the price breaks the upper trend line, the security is expected to reverse and trend higher. Traders recognizing bullish reversal signals would need to search for trades that benefit from the security's rise in price.

## Trading Advantages for Wedge Patterns

When in doubt, price pattern strategies for trading systems rarely yield returns that outperform purchase and-hold strategies after some time, yet a few patterns really do give off an impression of being helpful in forecasting general price trends in any case. A few studies recommend that a wedge pattern will breakout towards a reversal (a bullish breakout for falling wedges and a bearish breakout for rising wedges) more frequently than 66% of the time, with a falling wedge being a more dependable indicator than a rising wedge.

Since wedge patterns converge to a more modest price channel, the distance between the price on entry of the trade and the price for a stop loss, is somewhat more modest than the beginning of the pattern. This means that a stop loss can be put close by at the time the trade starts, and in the event that the trade is fruitful, the outcome can yield a greater return than the amount gambled on the trade in any case.
