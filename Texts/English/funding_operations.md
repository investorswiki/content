# Funding Operations
## What Are Funding Operations?

The term funding operations alludes to the conversion of [short-term debt](/shorttermdebt) into [long-term debt](/longtermdebt). This cycle is frequently utilized by corporations along with states to switch short-term bonds over completely to long-term bond holdings.

Funding operations are basically one method for making a more stable [repayment](/repayment) forecast by moving debts with floating interest rates to more predictable, fixed-interest vehicles.

## Figuring out Funding Operations

Funding operations give legislatures and business elements an opportunity to consolidate short-term debt obligations into long-term debt instruments, for example, [bonds](/bond), that carry a fixed rate. Most investors consider debt instruments with repayment dates of a year or less to be short-term in nature, while long-term debt commonly doesn't need full repayment for a year or more.

Albeit the interest rate on short-term debt commonly runs lower than the interest rate on long-term debt, the variability of [interest rates](/interestrate) issued over a shorter period of time presents downside [risk](/risk) for companies or states that need debt funding over the longer term.

At the point when states or businesses embrace funding operations, they search for a long-term debt vehicle that can give suitable funding to their expected [operational expenses](/operating_expense) over the long term, while likewise supplanting short-term debt right now on the [balance sheet](/balancesheet). Holding short-term obligations gives an opportunity to purchase long-term debt all the more strategically and less every now and again, as the possibilities of large interest rate developments remain generally low over the shorter term.

## Short-versus Long-Term Debt

While companies and legislatures are able to get short-term debt on [fixed-rate](/fixedinterestrate) or [variable-rate](/variableinterestrate) terms, any funds that aren't reimbursed in no less than a year become subject to rate changes by definition, as need might arise to refinance the debt here and there when it comes due.

The interest rate on variable-rate debt vehicles resets periodically at an interval set by the debt [issuer](/issuer). Interest rates on any short-term debt with a fixed rate successfully resets as companies or legislatures refinance into new instruments at winning rates.

Issuers offer higher interest rates on long-term debt to match the higher risk of [default](/default2) over a longer [maturity](/maturity) period. Simultaneously, the fixed idea of the rates furnishes the entity taking the loan with greater stability, since interest accumulates all the more typically throughout repayment. Fixed rates likewise give protection in a rising interest rate environment, as short-term interest rates rise and [floating rates](/floatinginterestrate) reset to higher levels.

## Special Considerations

Short-term debt might incorporate both bank [loans](/loan) or corporate debt issuances with maturity dates that are short of what one year. Companies believe long-term debt to be [funded debt](/fundeddebt) for [balance sheet](/balancesheet) purposes.

A company's net [working capital](/workingcapital) ratio views at long-term debt as an extent of the company's existing capital. Much of the time, investors like to see net working capital ratios under 1:1.
