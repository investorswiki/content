## What Is Numeraire?

Numeraire is an economic term of French beginning, which acts as a benchmark in looking at the value of comparable products or financial instruments. The word numeraire interprets as "cash," "money," or "presumptive worth."

## Figuring out Numeraire

Numeraire is an economic term that addresses a unit where prices are estimated. A numeraire is generally applied to a single decent, which turns into the base value for the whole index or market. Having a numeraire, or base value, considers the comparison of the value of goods against each other. Generally, the numeraire acts as a set standard of value across a trade.

An illustration of a numeraire emerges when we take a gander at how [currencies](/currency) were valued under the [Bretton Woods](/brettonwoodsagreement) system during the mid-twentieth century. The U.S. dollar ([USD](/usd-US dollar)) was priced at one-thirty-fifth (1/35^th^) the price of an ounce of gold. Any remaining currencies were then priced as either a different or a small part of the dollar. In this situation, the USD went about as the **de facto** benchmark, or numeraire, on the grounds that it was fixed to the price of gold.

Today, the U.S. dollar stays the numeraire at most commodity costs. Naming commodity prices in U.S. dollars standardizes the price as the USD is the most-exchanged and liquid currency the world. For instance, companies that participate in oil transactions can undoubtedly change over payments or receipts sooner rather than later since the price of oil is designated in USD.

Likewise, by setting oil prices in USD, it permits a country to compare the value of oil prices in its own currency. For instance, on the off chance that a country that is a net importer of oil has a currency that is debilitating against the U.S. dollar, it will be paying something else for its oil (in neighborhood currency terms) than it did in the past.
