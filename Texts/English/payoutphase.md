# Payout Phase
## What Is the Payout Phase?

The payout phase in a [annuity](/annuity) is the phase when payments are made to the [annuitant](/annuitant). These normally circulate consistently and last for the lifetime of the annuitant. An annuity is a financial product that pays an investor or beneficiary a flood of payments eventually.

The investor deposits money into the annuity, which is called the [accumulation phase](/accumulationphase). At the point when the investor starts getting payments, which is ordinarily in retirement, the annuity has entered the payout phase. The size and frequency of the payouts can change, contingent upon the type of annuity the investor has purchased. The payout phase is likewise called the [annuitization phase](/annuitizationphase).

## Understanding the Payout Phase

The payout phase comes after the [accumulation](/accumulation) phase when an annuitant builds assets for retirement through their annuity portfolios. When withdrawn, the income received by a retired investor is available income as well as any of the earnings or investment from throughout the long term. As such, any payouts are burdened as ordinary income.

Most annuities have a base age at which an annuitant can start the payout phase without causing an early [withdrawal penalty](/withdrawal-penalty). The investor can likewise incorporate provisions to proceed with the payments until both the annuitant and their spouse are deceased. Notwithstanding, the annuitization interaction is irreversible whenever it has entered the payout phase, meaning the annuitant can't keep on building assets and increase the value of their annuity portfolio.

At the point when annuitants are ready to start getting payments from their annuities, they tell the insurance company of their decision to do as such. Toward the beginning of the payout phase, the investor might receive a [lump-sum payment](/lump-sum-payment) or may decide to receive the payout as a flood of payments at standard stretches. Actuaries utilize mathematical models and life expectancy tables to process payment amounts, which will last for the life of the annuitant: the more one pauses, the bigger one's payments will be.

## Types of Payout Phases

On the off chance that the investor picks a flood of payments versus a one-time payout, they might decide to receive payments that are fixed or payments that fluctuate in view of the performance of different investment options, for example, a [mutual fund](/mutualfund). The amount of each periodic payment will depend, in part, on the time period chose for getting payments.

At the point when the investor chooses to annuitize the contract, a specific payment option, which for the most part can't be changed in any capacity, is locked into the annuity. The value of the account can either be drawn in a lump sum or annuitized over the investor's lifetime.

There are several annuity payout options accessible, including the accompanying:

### Life Annuity

A [life annuity](/lifeoption) option typically gives the biggest periodic payments since the payments are spread out over the life of the beneficiary. The life annuity is useful since it helps the retired person from outlasting their savings, meaning they don't run out of money.

### Life Annuity with Period Certain

Life annuity with period certain guarantees the payments over a certain period of time notwithstanding lifetime payments. Likewise, the beneficiary will receive payments until the end of a certain period in the event that the annuitant passes on. This option helps in case the annuitant kicks the bucket before the guaranteed period has passed. The annuity payments would go on for the guaranteed period, like 10 years, with the beneficiaries as the beneficiaries.

### Joint Life with the Last Survivor

Joint life with the last survivor covers at least two individuals, which is normally a couple. The annuity proceeds with payments to the survivor after the death of the main person.

### Life Contingency

Life contingency is an annuity with a joined [death benefit](/deathbenefit), which is a payout like a life insurance policy.
