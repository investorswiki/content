# Month to month Income Preferred Securities (MIPS)
## Definition of Monthly Income Preferred Securities (MIPS)

Shares that are an interest in a limited partnership existing exclusively to give preferred securities and lending the proceeds of the sales to its parent company. MIPS typically have a $25 par value, [NYSE](/nyse) listing, and cumulative month to month distributions.

## Seeing Monthly Income Preferred Securities (MIPS)

MIPS are hybrid securities, joining elements of preferred stock and corporate bonds. Hybrids can pay a higher rate of return than preferred stock in light of the fact that [dividends](/profit) are paid with pretax dollars, generating a sizable tax break for corporations. In any case, one of the greatest draws for corporations that execute MIPS programs is that the tax-related savings they appreciate are acquired without raising the corporation's debt ratio. Thus, major companies have embraced preferred stock exchange offers with expanding frequency. The exchanges permit the issuer to reclaim their existing preferred stock and supplant it with tax-deductible MIPS.

According to an investor's viewpoint, MIPS offer a large group of benefits. Chief among them, the securities will generally offer higher yields than those associated with money market funds, certificates of deposit and other alternative investments. MIPS is generally seen as a helpful method for which investors can invest in instruments that are like long-term corporate debt. Prior to the creation of MIPS, individual investors with somewhat small adds up to invest didn't have this opportunity on the grounds that corporate debt is regularly sold in heaps of $5,000 or more, requiring a base purchase of five $1,000 bonds. Conversely, MIPS' common $25 per unit cost makes the fixed-income market substantially more promptly available to individual investors. Likewise, there is a robust liquid secondary market for these [securities](/security), on the grounds that these hybrid preferred securities offer higher yields than corporate bonds and conventional preferred stock.

## MIPS must comply with a severe set of procedural rules. A couple of the essential procedural rules are as per the following:
- The proceeds from the sale of the MIPS are moved to the parent entity as a loan by the limited partnership or limited liability company.
- Dividends on the MIPS must be made to security holders on the last day of each and every calendar month.
- The funds used to pay the dividends are generated from interest payments made by the parent to the LLC for the loan.
- At the maturity of the loan between the parent corporation and the LLC, the MIPS are recovered.
- MIPS are commonly listed for trading on the New York Stock Exchange like standard preferred stock.
