# Fixed-Rate Mortgage
Not all mortgages are made equivalent. While certain borrowers pick adjustable-rate mortgages (ARMs), the most regular loan type by a long shot is the fixed-rate mortgage. Yet even with fixed-rate loans, there are a scope of options. Peruse on to realize all you really want to realize about fixed-rate mortgages and which kind may be best for you.
## What is a fixed-rate mortgage?
A fixed-rate mortgage has an interest rate that continues as before for the life of the loan. Fixed-rate loans are the most famous type of financing since they offer predictability and stability — you won't ever be surprised by the principal and interest charges in your month to month mortgage payment, since they'll remain something similar for the whole loan term. (Your total regularly scheduled payment, which incorporates homeowners insurance and property taxes, could have small vacillations due to changes in those costs.) The most common type of fixed-rate mortgage is a 30-year loan, however you'll habitually see offerings for 20-year, 15-year and 10-year loans, too.
## How fixed-rate mortgages work
The rates mortgage lenders publicize are continuously moving all over due to extensive variety of factors. In this way, you could see an offer for a 5 percent interest rate today and a 5.2 percent interest rate tomorrow. With a fixed-rate mortgage, that movement doesn't impact you. Regardless of what occurs after you secure your loan, the rate at which you locked in your loan continues as before.
Your payment amount likewise remains something similar, yet the breakdown of where those funds go — how much is paying down the principal versus how much is paying interest charges — varies based on the amortization schedule.
Let's say you make a 20 percent down payment on a $375,300 home, and you borrow $300,240 with a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage at 4.83 percent interest. You'd have a $1,646 payment every month, excluding insurance and taxes, for the next 30 years.
In the first month of your term, just about $371 of your payment would go toward the genuine principal, with the remainder going toward interest. After twenty years, more than $970 of your payment would be going toward the principal. As the balance of those payments leans more toward your principal, you're speeding up the equity you have in the property.
## How long do I repay a fixed-rate mortgage?
You'll pay back your fixed-rate mortgage over a predetermined term. The most common offering is a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage, which permits you to pay off your home loan north of thirty years. That could seem like a long time, yet the extended timeline permits you to reduce the size of your regularly scheduled payment and free up room in your budget.
Another widely available option is a 15-year fixed-rate mortgage. This regularly accompanies a lower interest rate, yet you'll have to pay back the loan in half the time. A 15-year fixed-rate mortgage is great for borrowers who have the cash flow and need to pay off their home quicker at less interest.
Some mortgage lenders let you customize the term, too, somewhere in the range of eight and 30 years.
While the term connected to a fixed-rate mortgage is the maximum amount of time you need to repay it, you can likewise opt to contribute extra money toward the principal to shorten your pay-back period. Just ensure your loan doesn't have a [prepayment penalty](/prepaymentpenalty) (most don't), and that the extra payments are paying down the principal. You can contact your lender to affirm this.

## Illustration of a fixed-rate mortgage
Meet Jill, a first-time homebuyer who needs to stop renting. She's done the math and realizes she can manage around $1,200 each month for mortgage principal and interest costs.

<tr>
<td>$240,000</td><td>5%</td><td>30 years</td><td>$1,288</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>$152,000</td><td>4.5%</td><td>15 years</td><td>$1,162</td></tr>
</tbody>
</table>
For basically a similar regularly scheduled payment, Jill can borrow $88,000 more with a 30-year fixed loan.
Presently, let's say Jill's budget and strong credit permits her to opt for the $240,000 loan, paying little mind to loan term. In the event that she picks a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage, she'll pay a higher interest rate however partake in the ability to stretch out the payback period. However, that convenience of a longer term accompanies a major drawback: a lot greater price tag for overall interest charges:
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>

</tbody>
</table>
On the off chance that Jill can manage the cost of the higher regularly scheduled payments of a 15-year mortgage, she'll save more than $166,000 in interest.
