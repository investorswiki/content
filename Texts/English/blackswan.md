# Black Swan
A Black Swan event in its easiest form is an event that comes as a shock and makes a tremendous difference.
The history of the Black Swan Theory - or the Theory of Black Swan Events - traces all the way back to a Latin articulation of the second hundred years by Roman poet Juvenal, when he would describe something as:
> "rara avis in terris nigroque simillima cygno"
This Latin articulation means "a rare bird in the grounds and particularly like a black swan". Initially when this phrase was first utilized, it was believed that black swans didn't exist.

The Black Swan theory was additionally developed by analyst and trader Nassim Nicholas Taleb. In 2007, he distributed a book entitled The Black Swan: The Impact of Highly Improbable, which made sense of and formalized the Black Swan theory.

As per Taleb, Black Swan events generally follow three credits:
1. A Black Swan is an exception. It is past that of normal expectations and thus, nothing in the past might have anticipated it.
1. It generally conveys an extreme or huge impact.
1. A Black Swan event, in spite of being an exception and eccentric, will positively have a rational clarification prepared after its most memorable occurrence, making that type of event reasonable and unsurprising.

Instances of previous Black Swan events as portrayed by Taleb, are the rise of the internet, the personal computer, the disintegration of the Soviet Union, and the September 11, 2001 assaults.
