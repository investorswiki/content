# Debt Security
## What Is a Debt Security?

A debt security is a [debt instrument](/debtinstrument) that can be bought or sold between two gatherings and has essential terms defined, like the notional amount (the amount borrowed), interest rate, and [maturity](/maturitydate) and renewal date.

Instances of debt securities incorporate a government bond, corporate bond, certificate of deposit (CD), municipal bond, or preferred stock. Debt securities can likewise come as collateralized securities, for example, [collateralized debt obligations](/cdo) (CDOs), collateralized mortgage obligations (CMOs), mortgage-backed securities issued by the Government National Mortgage Association (GNMA), and [zero-coupon securities](/zero-couponbond).

## How Debt Securities Work

A debt security is a type of [financial asset](/financialasset) that is made when one party loans money to another. For instance, [corporate bonds](/corporatebond) are debt securities issued by corporations and sold to investors. Investors loan money to corporations in return for a pre-laid out number of interest payments, alongside the return of their principal upon the bond's maturity date.

[Government bonds](/government-bond), then again, are debt securities issued by governments and sold to investors. Investors loan money to the government in return for interest payments (called [coupon payments](/coupon-rate)) and a return of their principal upon the bond's maturity.

Debt securities are otherwise called [fixed-income securities](/fixedincome) on the grounds that they generate a fixed stream of income from their interest payments. Not at all like equity investments, in which the return earned by the investor is dependent on the market performance of the equity issuer, debt instruments guarantee that the investor will receive repayment of their initial [principal](/principal), plus a foreordained stream of interest payments.

Of course, this contractual guarantee doesn't mean that debt securities are without risk, since the issuer of the debt security could declare [bankruptcy](/bankruptcy) or [default](/default2) on their agreements.

## Risk of Debt Securities

Since the borrower is legally required to make these payments, debt securities are generally viewed as a safer form of investment compared to [equity investments](/equity) like stocks. Of course, as is generally the case in investing, the true [risk](/risk) of a specific security will rely upon its specific qualities.

For example, a company with a strong [balance sheet](/balancesheet) operating in a mature marketplace might be less inclined to default on its debts than a startup company operating in an emerging marketplace. In this case, the mature company would probably be given a better credit rating by the three major [credit rating agencies](/creditrating): Standard and Poor's (S&P), Moody's Corporation (MCO), and Fitch Ratings.

In keeping with the overall tradeoff among risk and return, companies with higher credit ratings will normally offer lower interest rates on their debt securities and vice versa. For instance, as of July 29, 2020, the Bloomberg Barclays Indices of U.S. corporate bond yields showed that twofold A-rated corporate bonds had a [average annual yield](/average-annual-yield) of 1.34%, compared to 2.31% for their triple-B-rated partners.

Since the twofold A rating signifies a lower perceived risk of credit default, it's a good idea that market participants will acknowledge a lower [yield](/yield) in exchange for these safer securities.

## Debt Securities versus Equity Securities

Equity securities address a claim on the [earnings](/earnings) and assets of a corporation, while debt securities are investments in debt instruments. For instance, [a stock](/stock) is an equity security, while a bond is a debt security. At the point when an investor buys a corporate bond, they are basically loaning the corporation money, and reserve the privilege to be reimbursed the principal and interest on the bond.

Conversely, when somebody buys stock from a corporation, they basically buy a piece of the company. On the off chance that the company profits, the investor profits too, yet assuming the company loses money, the stock additionally loses money.
