# Regular-Way Trade (RW)
## What Is a Regular-Way Trade (RW)?

A regular-way trade (RW) is settled within the standard settlement cycle, which, contingent upon the transaction type, can go from one to five days.

## Understanding a Regular-Way Trade (RW)

A regular-way trade (RW) has the typical and defined settlement cycle required for that particular [asset](/asset). In contrast, a non-regular settlement would have a shorter or longer settlement cycle, considering a speedier, or delayed, transfer of funds and the asset between the [seller](/seller) and the buyer.

The settlement cycle is a defined period, preset by regulators of that market, for the buyer to complete payment or for the seller to deliver the assets traded. The settlement cycle contrasts for different assets. Most trades are regular-way trades.

The justification for the [settlement period](/settlement_period) time lag from a trader to a settlement is to permit both parties to gather the required resources to complete the [transaction](/transaction). While working with different currencies, it could take time for funds deposited in the buyer's account to open up for disbursement. Moreover for physical certificates or assets expected to move from the seller to the middle or [clearing](/clearing) agent.

Changes in technology and digital recording could consider faster, in the event that not instant, settlement of both funds and assets. It would likewise reduce credit, market, and [liquidity risk](/liquidityrisk). Nonetheless, it takes time to change such procedures, even assuming the longing to do there is as well.

As a first step, in 2017, the [Securities and Exchange Commission](/sec) (SEC) approved a new, and shorter, settlement rule called "[T+2](/tplus1)." Securities transactions in the U.S. presently "trade plus two" days, instead of three days. This change was in direct acknowledgment of the improvements in technology and a trading environment that makes shorter settlements both possible and important to all market participants.

## Settlement by Asset Class

[Equities](/equity) trading got the most significant boost from T+2 as settlements were typically three days. In any case, other asset classes as of now settle in two days, and some purpose in one day, otherwise called "next day". Ends of the week and holidays can cause the time between transaction and settlement dates to increase substantially, particularly during holiday seasons like Christmas, Easter, and others.

Here are the settlement cycles for a few well known assets that, whenever stuck to, would fall under a regular-way trade (RW).

- Equities settle T+2.
- Government bills, bonds, and [options](/option) settle T+1.
- Spot foreign exchange transactions ordinarily settle two business days after the [execution](/execution) date. A primary exception is the U.S. dollar versus the Canadian dollar, which settle the next business day. The [foreign exchange market](/foreign-exchange-markets) expects that the settlement date be a substantial business day in both countries.
- Forward foreign exchange transactions settle on any business day that is past the [spot value date](/spot-date). There is no absolute limit in the market to restrict how far in the future a forward exchange transaction can settle, but credit lines are often limited to one year.
