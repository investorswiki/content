# Deferred Interest Mortgage
## What Is a Deferred Interest Mortgage?

A deferred interest mortgage is a mortgage that allows the borrower to postpone making interest payments on the loan for a predefined period of time. This type of mortgage can mean lower payments in the short term yet paying more altogether over the life of the loan. It additionally has different risks.

## How a Deferred Interest Mortgage Works

Lenders can tailor [mortgage](/mortgage) loans to allow for deferred interest payments by adding those terms to the contract. Deferred interest provisions can be complex for both the borrower and the lender since they require customization of the payment schedule. They can likewise be hazardous for the borrower, as we'll make sense of.

## Types of Deferred Interest Mortgages

Deferred interest mortgages can be structured in different ways, contingent upon what the lender and borrower consent to. The major types available today are:

### Deferred Interest Loans

Basically, deferred interest mortgage loans allow borrowers to make payments that are not exactly the total payment they owe. [Lenders](/lender) can fluctuate this provision in various ways, yet they will typically expect that the borrower make essentially a base payment of a certain amount.

In the event that a borrower decides to make not exactly their full regularly scheduled payment, the decreased payment will go toward the loan's [principal](/principal) and some interest. The unpaid interest is then added to the balance of the loan. This increases the amount of [interest](/interest) that the borrower will eventually need to pay. Furthermore, the unpaid interest will presently begin gathering interest, so the borrower should pay interest on interest.

Conceding interest ordinarily results in [negative amortization](/negativeamortization), meaning that as opposed to diminish with every regularly scheduled payment, the borrower's debt keeps on developing. Thus, these loans are once in a while alluded to as negative amortization mortgages.

Dissimilar to most credit cards, which allow for debt to build up with no fixed end point, deferred interest loans have a definitive [maturity](/maturity) date that will require the borrower to make a [lump-sum payment](/lump-sum-payment) of any unpaid interest around then. Some deferred interest mortgages provide options for getting an extension, for example, through a [loan modification](/loan_modification) or [forbearance](/forbearance).

> ### Note
> Flexible payment adjustable-rate mortgages, or option ARMs, which likewise allowed borrowers to concede interest payments, were successfully disposed of by the [Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB)](/consumer-financial-protection-bureau-cfpb) in 2014 as a result of the risks implied.

### Graduated Payment Loans

[Graduated payment mortgages](/graduatedpaymentmortgage) are fixed-rate loans that begin with low regularly scheduled payments that rise by a certain amount every year. In theory, they are really great for homeowners who anticipate that their wages should develop sufficiently fast to keep up with the rising payments and who couldn't bear to buy a home in any case.

In any case, the interest and principal that are deferred to make those lower payments conceivable can likewise bring about negative amortization.

## Pros and Cons of Deferred Interest Mortgages

Deferred interest mortgages can help a few homeowners, especially novices, get homes with affordable mortgage payments, basically at the beginning. That is their major pro.

Notwithstanding, the rundown of cons is lengthier. First off, the homeowner will be unable to manage the cost of the regularly scheduled payments when they eventually increase or to make a critical lump-sump payment toward the finish of the mortgage. That could mean [defaulting](/default2) on the loan and losing the home through [foreclosure](/foreclosure). Defaulting on a mortgage can likewise cause serious harm to the borrower's [credit score](/credit_score).

In light of negative amortization, the homeowner may at last owe more on their mortgage than their house is worth. Assuming they wish to sell the home, they might find that the money they could receive from the sale is short of what they should repay their lender.
