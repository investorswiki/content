# Operating Revenue
## What Is Operating Revenue?

Operating revenue is the revenue that a company creates from its primary business activities.

For instance, a retailer creates its operating revenue through merchandise sales; a physician gets their operating revenue from the medical services that they give. What comprises operating revenue differs in light of the business or the industry.

## Grasping Operating Revenue

Recognizing operating revenue from total [revenue](/revenue) is important in light of the fact that it gives significant data about the productivity and profitability of a company's primary business operations.

In spite of the way that operating revenue is recorded separately on financial statements, a few firms might endeavor to veil diminishes in operating revenue by joining it with non-operating revenue. Understanding and recognizing the wellsprings of revenue is useful in surveying the strength of a firm and its operations.

## Operating Revenue versus Non-Operating Revenue

[Non-operating](/non-operating-income) revenue will be revenue created by activities outside of a company's primary operations. This type of revenue will in general be rare and oftentimes unusual. Instances of non-operating income incorporate interest income, gains from the sale of assets, claim proceeds, and revenues from different sources not associated with operations.

For instance, a private university might order tuition received as operating revenue, while gifts from graduated class are viewed as non-operating revenue (since they are not expected nor are they part of ordinary university operations).

In this model, the university's [income statement](/incomestatement) records operating revenue and profit from operations first, then it posts non-operating revenue and profit, for example, revenue received from gifts and legacy donations. This show of data illuminates those evaluating the company's financial records that the gift is certainly not an ordinary part of the university's business. It is important to recognize the difference on the grounds that non-operating revenue can change definitely from one year to another.

## Special Considerations
### Cash Flow

Non-operating revenue and income don't create [cash inflows](/cashflow) that are reliable over time, which is one more justification for why the activity is separately distinguished in the income statement. For a company to fund company operations, the business must create operating revenue. Firms that drive operating revenue can fund the business consistently without the need to look for extra financing, and these companies can operate with a lower cash balance.

For instance, a company might sell a [fixed asset](/fixedasset), like a building, in the current year. In the event that the building is sold at a gain, the gain will be treated as non-operating revenue in the year it was sold. This revenue isn't expected as a normal course of carrying on with work, and the one-time revenue ought not be utilized to evaluate the progress of the company's primary operations year over year.

### Stock Prices

For an effective company, operating revenue and income are the primary wellsprings of [earnings per share (EPS)](/eps); this ratio is a key statistic for assessing a firm's stock price.

EPS is defined as earnings accessible to common shareholders partitioned by [common shares](/commonstock) outstanding. A very much oversaw business can develop operating revenue and income by finding more customers and moving into new markets that produce higher earnings. As EPS increments, numerous investors and analysts believe the stock to be more significant and the stock price increments.
