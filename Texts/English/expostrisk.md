## Examples of Ex-Post Risk

On one side, you'd have any gains experienced by the ETF while the opposite side would be populated by daily losses. Suppose the best 5% of daily losses range from 4% to 8%. Since these are the most obviously awful 5% of every single daily return, we can say with 95% confidence that the most horrendously terrible daily loss won't exceed 4%. Put another way, we expect with 95% confidence that our gain will exceed - 4%, ex-post.
