## What Is the Indian Rupee (INR)?

The Indian rupee (INR) is the currency of India. INR is the [International Organization for Standardization](/international-organization-for-standardization-iso) currency code for the Indian rupee, for which the currency symbol is \u20b9.

## Figuring out the Indian Rupee (INR)

The Indian rupee gets its name from the rupiya, a silver coin previously issued by Sultan Sher Shah Suri in the 16th century.

### Coins

Coins in India are issued in divisions of 50 paise, one rupee, two rupees, five rupees, and ten rupees. A paise is 1/100th of a rupee. Coins worth 50 paise are called small coins, while coins equivalent or over one rupee are known as rupee coins.

### Banknotes

Paper currency or banknotes are issued in groups of 5, 10, 20, 50, 100, 500, and 2,000 rupees. On the reverse side of paper rupees, divisions are imprinted in 15 dialects, while groups are imprinted in Hindi and English on the front side.

The banknotes are refreshed much of the time with new plans, including distinct differences from old Mahatma Gandhi Series of banknotes to the new ones of a similar name. The notes incorporate different subjects of India's rich heritage.

## Security and Counterfeiting of the Rupee

India is a cash-based economy, which has brought about fake currency being flowed by those took part in illegal behavior. The [Reserve Bank of India (RBI)](/rbi) has needed to change and refresh rupee notes with new security highlights throughout the long term. Fake notes, which could seem like legal notes, are duplicated by [money launderers](/moneylaundering) and fear based oppressors. Normally, the high sections are typically the most duplicated notes.

In 2016, the Indian government announced the demonetization of all \u20b9500 and \u20b91,000 banknotes of the Mahatma Gandhi Series, claiming it would hamstring the [underground economy](/underground-economy), utilizing illegal and fake cash in funding illegal activity and terrorism considerably more troublesome. The 500 note has been supplanted by one in the new Mahatma Gandhi Series with enhanced security highlights.

## Special Considerations: Capital and Convertibility Controls

The rupee has been subject to different [capital controls](/capital_conrol) and convertibility limitations throughout the long term. For instance, it is illegal for foreign nationals to import or export rupees, and Indian nationals may just import and export rupees in limited sums.

The [current account](/currentaccount), which is comprised of the country's savings, investment flows, and the net trade in goods and services has no currency conversion limitations (beside trade barriers).

The [capital account](/capitalaccount) measures foreign reserves, business, and institutional flows. The Indian government unwinds and fixes limitations on foreign investment, putting covers or eliminating them intermittently to keep a sound and balanced capital account.

In recent years, the government loose [foreign investment](/foreign-investment) flow limitations to help the debilitating currency exchange rate and support business investment in the country. Foreign institutional investors and nearby companies can acquire money and remove money from the country yet need to check with the Reserve Bank of India for the current rules and regulations.

## The Rupee's Value in Modern Times

In the nineteenth century, large expansions in the quantity of silver production caused a sharp drop in silver's value, leading to a lofty decline in the rupee's value. From 1927 to 1946, the rupee was pegged to the [British pound](/quid). It was then pegged to the U.S. dollar until 1975. Currently, it generally drifts on the [foreign exchange market](/foreign-exchange-markets), with the Reserve Bank of India actively trading the currency to deal with its value.

Different factors can impact the exchange rate of the currency, including trade flows, investment flows, and oil prices. India imports oil and a rise in prices can cause [inflation](/inflation) and force the RBI to mediate to support the economy.
