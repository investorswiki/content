# Secured Debt
## What Is Secured Debt?

Secured debt will be debt backed or secured by [collateral](/collateral) to reduce the risk associated with lending. In the event that the borrower on a loan [defaults](/default2) on repayment, the bank holds onto the collateral, sells it, and utilizations the proceeds to pay back the debt. Assets backing debt or a debt instrument are considered as a form of security, which is the reason [unsecured debt](/unsecureddebt) is viewed as a riskier investment than secured debt.

## Grasping Secured Debt

Secured debt will be debt that will constantly be backed by collateral, which the lender has a [lien](/lien) on. It gives a lender added security while lending out money. Secured debt is frequently associated with borrowers that have poor [creditworthiness](/credit-value). Since the risk of lending to an individual or company with a low credit rating is high, protecting the loan with collateral fundamentally reduces that risk.

For instance, suppose Bank ABC makes a loan to two individuals with poor [credit ratings](/creditrating). The main loan is backed by collateral while the subsequent loan isn't. Following three months, the two borrowers can't make payments on their loans and default. With the primary loan, backed by collateral, the bank is legally allowed to hold onto that collateral. After they do, they sell it, generally at [auction](/auction), and utilize the proceeds to pay back the outstanding portion of the loan.

In the subsequent loan, where there is no collateral backing it, the bank has no collateral to seize to pay back the outstanding debt. In this case, they should [write-off](/write-off) the loan as a loss on their financial statements.

At the point when a loan is secured, the interest rate that is offered to the borrower is many times a lot of lower than if the loan was not secured. At times, when a loan doesn't be guaranteed to require collateral, for example, a personal loan, it very well may be in the interest of a borrower to put up a form of collateral to receive a lower interest rate. They ought to possibly do this assuming they are certain that they can keep on paying back the loan or will lose the collateral on the off chance that they can't.

## Priority of Secured Debt

In the event that a company documents for [bankruptcy](/bankruptcy), its assets are listed available to be purchased to pay back its creditors. In the payback scheme, secured lenders generally have priority over unsecured lenders. The assets are sold off until all secured lenders are completely paid back, really at that time are unsecured lenders paid back.

In the event that the assets are sold and there are insufficient proceeds passed on to pay back unsecured lenders, they are confused. In the event that there are insufficient proceeds to pay back the secured lenders, contingent upon the situation, secured lenders can pursue different assets of the company or individual.

## Instances of Secured Debt

The two most common instances of secured debt are [mortgages](/mortgage) and car loans. This is so in light of the fact that their inherent structure makes collateral. Assuming an individual defaults on their mortgage payments, the bank can hold onto their home. Likewise, on the off chance that an individual defaults on their vehicle loan, the lender can hold onto their vehicle. In the two cases, the collateral (the home or the vehicle) will be sold to recover the outstanding debt.

For instance, Mike takes out a $15,000 vehicle loan from a bank. The loan is a secured debt in light of the fact that the vehicle acts as the collateral that the bank can seize assuming that Mike defaults on his loan repayments. Following two years, there is still $10,000 left to pay on the loan, and Mike out of nowhere loses his job. He can never again make the loan payments thus the bank holds onto his vehicle.

If the current [market value](/marketvalue) of the vehicle is $10,000 or more, when the bank sells it and gathers the proceeds, covering the leftover debt will be able. Assuming that the market value of the vehicle is under $10,000, say, $8,000, the bank will cover $8,000 of the outstanding debt however will in any case have $2,000 of the debt remaining. Contingent upon the situation, the bank can pursue Mike for this excess $2,000 in debt.
