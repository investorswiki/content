1. The initial two candles (or bars) of the pattern are of declining size. These are alluded to as a [inside-day](/inside_day) pattern or a [harami](/bullishharami) candlestick pattern. It doesn't make any difference whether both of nowadays closes higher or lower than it opened, inasmuch as the body of the first totally eclipses the body of the second.
1. The third candle closes below the low in the principal setup (or over the high in the subsequent setup) of the subsequent candle.
1. The next at least one candles will drift below (or above in the subsequent setup) the third candle and may start to reverse heading.
1. The last candle will close over the high of the subsequent candle (or below the low of the second candle in the subsequent setup).

In the event that the price pattern reverses, the traders' stop-loss orders kick in and may give a lift to the price as it reverses past the boundary of the second candle in the formation (where the stop orders are probably going to be).
