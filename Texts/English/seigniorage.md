## What Is Seigniorage?

Seigniorage is the difference between the face value of money, for example, a $10 bill or a quarter coin, and the cost to deliver it. At the end of the day, the economic cost of creating a currency inside a given economy or country is lower than the genuine exchange value, which generally gathers to governments who mint the money.

In the event that the seigniorage is positive, the government will make a [economic profit](/economicprofit); while a negative seigniorage will bring about an economic loss.

## Seigniorage Explained

Seigniorage might be considered revenue for a government when the money it makes is worth more than it costs to deliver. This revenue is frequently utilized by governments to finance bits of their expenditures without gathering taxes. On the off chance that, for instance, it costs the U.S. government 5 pennies to create $1, the seigniorage is 95 pennies or the difference between the two sums. Seigniorage gives a country the possibility to make money when it produces money.

While the definition of seigniorage is most frequently the difference between the cost of printing new [currency](/currency) and the face value of that equivalent currency, it is likewise the number of goods or services a government can obtain through the printing of new notes.

## Seigniorage and Losses

In certain circumstances, the production of currency can bring about a loss rather than a gain for the government making the currency. This loss is all the more usually knowledgeable about the production of coins on the grounds that the metal used to create the coin has inherent value. This value, frequently called the liquefy value, might be higher than the denomination it originally addressed; or, when combined with production costs, may bring about a loss. For instance, the U.S. penny was displayed to cost 1.5 pennies in 2016 with a face value of 1 penny.

Over the long haul, the liquefy value may likewise change as market demands shift, and it might possibly lead to the value of the metal being worth more than the face value of the currency. A model happens in silver coins, like the U.S. silver quarter and the silver dime.

## Seigniorage and the Federal Reserve

While the fundamental principle behind seigniorage recommends that a country can profit from the production of new bills, there can be different factors influencing the whole transaction. If the [Federal Reserve](/federalreservebank) consents to increase the number of dollars accessible inside the U.S. economy, it will purchase a [Treasury Bill](/treasurybill) in exchange for allowing the production of additional dollars. While the government might seem to profit when the cost of production is lower than the face value of the bills, it is important to note that Treasury Bills require interest payments to the Federal Reserve notwithstanding the original investment set when the Treasury Bill was purchased.

[Gresham's law](/greshams-law) is a monetary principle expressing that "terrible money drives out great." Gresham's law was originally founded on the piece of minted coins and the value of the precious metals utilized in them. As such, in the event that a gold coin is worth $5 and a silver coin is worth $0.50, individuals will store the gold coin and on second thought exchange 10 silver coins. Thus, the gold coins drop out of circulation and the terrible money (the silver) drives out the upside (the gold). This turns into a form of effective seignorage since the gold becomes worth all the more even however its face value is equivalent to 10 silver coins. In any case, since the abandonment of metallic currency standards, the theory has been applied to the relative stability of various monetary forms' value in global markets.

## Real World Example

In view of anticipated demand for new currency, the Federal Reserve puts in a request yearly with the Department of the Treasury's Bureau of Engraving and Printing and pays for production costs. The Fed gives definite information on every currency denomination and the cost to create it. In 2019, for instance, it cost 11.5 pennies to deliver a $20 note, and 14.2 pennies to create a $100 bill.

The U.S. mint is responsible for coin production, which is affected by the number of mentioned Federal Reserve Bank orders. The Federal Reserve then purchases the coins at face value.
