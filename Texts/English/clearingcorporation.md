# Clearing Corporation
## What Is a Clearing Corporation?

A clearing corporation is an organization associated with an exchange to handle the confirmation, settlement, and delivery of transactions. Clearing corporations satisfy the primary obligation of guaranteeing transactions are made in a brief and efficient way. Clearing corporations are additionally alluded to as "clearing firms" or "clearing houses."

## Figuring out Clearing Corporations

To verify that transactions run without a hitch, clearing corporations become the buyer to each seller and the seller to each buyer. All in all, they take the [offsetting position](/offset) with a client in each transaction. For instance, in the event that two investors consent to the terms of a financial transaction, for example, the purchase or sale of a corporate security, a clearing corporation will act as a middle man, facilitating the purchase toward one side and the sale on the opposite finish of the transaction.

Such transactions include futures, [options contracts](/optionscontract), stock and bond trades, and [margin](/margin) money. What's more, clearing corporations have a scope of tasks including managing the delivery of securities and reporting trading data.

## Clearing Corporation and Futures Contracts

While clearing corporations might work with all forms of transactions, they are most useful in additional complex transactions, for example, [futures contracts](/futurescontract). Futures are financial contracts that commit a buyer to purchase an asset, for example, a physical commodity like wheat, or a [seller](/seller) to sell an asset, at a foreordained future date and price.

For instance, we should assume that in October the current price for wheat is $4.00 per bushel and the futures price is $4.25. A wheat rancher is attempting to secure a selling price for their next crop, while Domino's Pizza is attempting to secure a buying price to decide the amount to charge for a large pizza next year. The rancher and the corporation can go into a futures contract requiring the delivery of five million bushels of wheat to Domino's in December at a price of $4.25 per bushel. The contract secures in a price for the two players. It is this contract, and not the actual, physical wheat, that can be thusly bought and sold in the futures market.

Every futures exchange, (for example, the [Chicago Mercantile Exchange](/cme)) has its own clearing corporation. Individuals from these exchanges must clear their trades through the clearing corporation toward the finish of each trading session and deposit a sum of money in light of the clearing corporation's margin requirements to cover their debit balance. The clearing corporations help to keep markets operating in a convenient and orderly way. This, thusly, gives more elements confidence in entering futures trades to hedge their different openings.
