# Qualified Annuity
## What Is a Qualified Annuity?

A qualified annuity is a retirement savings plan that is funded with pre-tax dollars. A non-qualified annuity is funded with post-tax dollars. Honestly, the phrasing comes from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS).

Contributions to qualified annuities are deducted from an investor's gross earnings and, along with investments, develop tax-free. Nor is subject to federal taxes until after retirement when distributions are made. Contributions to a non-qualified plan are made with after-tax dollars.

## Figuring out the Qualified Annuity

A deposit into a qualified annuity is made without taxes being held back. That really diminishes the taxpayer's income, and taxes owed, for that year. No taxes will be owed on the money that builds in the qualified account a large number of years as long as no withdrawals are made.

Taxes on both the investor's contribution and the investment gains that have accrued will be owed after the investor resigns and starts taking an annuity or any withdrawal from the account.

While distributions from a qualified annuity are taxed as ordinary income, distributions from a non-qualified annuity are not subject to any income tax on the contributions. Taxes might be owed on the investment gains, which generally are a more modest portion of the account.

It involves banter which is better. The non-qualified plan offers the prospect of tax-free income after retirement. Nonetheless, the qualified plan offers immediate tax savings and a more modest hit on take-home pay during the individual's working years.

## Types of Qualified Annuities

Qualified annuities are many times set up by employers as part of a company-supported retirement plan. Varieties incorporate the defined benefit plan, the 401(k) and 403(b) retirement plan, and the individual retirement account (IRA).

- The defined benefit plan is a savings vehicle that commits the company to a specific payment, whether in a lump sum or in regularly scheduled payments, in light of the worker's earnings history.
- A 401(k) is set-up by a revenue driven company to reward its employees. The SECURE Act of 2019 now permits annuities to be remembered for 401(k) plans.
- The 403(b) is accessible basically to teachers and a few other public employees as well as workers at tax-exempt organizations.
- The IRA is the recognizable savings plan that permits a pre-tax contribution up to a yearly limit.

An annuity can be qualified assuming it meets certain IRS criteria and observes its regulatory rules. Generally, an annuity that isn't utilized to fund a tax-advantaged retirement plan is a non-qualified annuity.

### Different IRS Rules on Annuities

Non-qualified annuities purchased after Aug. 13, 1982, are taxed under a "rearward in-first-out" protocol. This means that the first withdrawals made by the investor will be taken from accrued interest, which will be taxed as ordinary income. When that interest has been completely taxed, the leftover principal or premium will be free of taxes. The rules overseeing qualified annuities are all covered in IRS Publication 575: Pension and Annuity Income.

## Features
- Contributions to a qualified annuity are in pre-tax dollars. (Taxes are delayed until withdrawals are made after retirement.)
- Contributions to a non-qualified annuity are in post-tax dollars since taxes on the contributions have proactively been paid.
- "Qualified" and "non-qualified" are IRS terms. A qualified plan has an immediate tax benefit.
