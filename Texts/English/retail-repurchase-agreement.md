# Retail Repurchase Agreement
## What Is a Retail Repurchase Agreement?

A retail repurchase agreement, otherwise called a "retail repo agreement," is a financial product that fills in as an alternative to traditional savings accounts. At the point when an investor goes into a retail repurchase agreement with a bank, that investor purchases a share of a pool of securities, typically comprising of U.S. government or agency debt with a term of less than 90 days. When the 90-day period has expired, the bank repurchases that share from the investor at a premium.

## How Retail Repurchase Agreements Work

According to the investor's point of view, this transaction's profit is undifferentiated from the interest they would somehow gain on a traditional savings account. This type of transaction is essentially a downsized rendition of the wholesale [repurchase agreements](/repurchaseagreement) went into between banks, albeit these wholesale agreements regularly happen in least groups of $1 million and are frequently extended for short periods, for example, overnight.

Dissimilar to their wholesale counterparts, retail repurchase agreements are sold in small sections of $1,000 or less. The assets contained in the pool are sold and afterward repurchased as long as after 90 days by the bank. Beside their size, one more major difference between retail repurchase agreements and wholesale repurchase agreements is that the assets act as [collateral](/collateral) for wholesale transactions and don't change hands. The most common assets utilized as collateral in wholesale repurchase agreements are U.S. Treasury securities, albeit other collateral might incorporate agency debt, corporate securities, or even [mortgage-backed securities (MBSs)](/mbs).

The history of the retail and wholesale repurchase markets traces all the way back to the 1970s and 1980s when they emerged as a way for large securities firms and banks to raise short-term capital. Around then, interest rates were consistently rising, making it hard to bring capital up on time through traditional means. From that point forward, the repo market has developed to turn into a necessary part of the U.S. financial system and is essential for meeting the country's banks' daily [liquidy](/liquidity).

In 1979, U.S. banking regulators absolved retail repurchase agreements from interest rate covers. This drove banks and savings and loan institutions to start offering retail repurchase agreements to their customers at premium rates. These new products were situated to rival supposed [money market funds](/money-marketfund), which are in many cases sold as mutual funds to depositors. Critically, these retail repurchase agreements are not subject to [Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC)](/fdic) protection.

## Genuine Example of a Retail Repurchase Agreement

Michael has been a normal customer at XYZ Financial for a long time. During one of his visits to the bank, the teller illuminates him that he could earn a higher interest rate assuming he changes over his savings account into a retail repurchase agreement. Under the terms of this agreement, Michael would purchase a share of a pool of assets, which the bank would then repurchase from him at a [premium](/premium) in 90 days or less. The teller makes sense of for Michael that the assets being referred to are great U.S. government debts.

Before going with his choice, Michael investigates retail repurchase agreements to better grasp their possible risks. That's what michael affirms albeit the proposed transaction would offer him higher interest than a traditional savings account, he wouldn't be subject to the protection of the FDIC. Additionally, that's what michael learns assuming XYZ Financial were to become bankrupt during the 90-day term, he might experience issues laying out his specific claim to the agreement's underlying assets.

Assume Michael doesn't wish to continue with the proposed transaction. In that case, he could alternatively put his money into a money market mutual fund, which is a famous alternative to retail repurchase agreements.
