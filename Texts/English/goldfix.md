## What is the London Gold Fix

The London Gold Fix was a method to fix the price of gold per troy ounce in US dollars. It was supplanted in 2015 by The London Bullion Market Association, or LBMA, Gold Price. The price continues to be set twice daily at 10:30 and 15:00 London GMT in US dollars.

## Grasping the London Gold Fix

The fundamental job of the London Gold Fix was to fix the price of gold by the five greatest bullion bankers, traders and purifiers in the precious metal in the mid 1900s. They were known as the London Gold Market Fixing Ltd., and consisted of N.M. Rothschild, Mocatta and Goldsmid, Pixley and Abell, Samuel Montagu and Co. what's more, Sharps Wilkins, when the practice began in 1919. The banks thought about orders from their clients and their own profits while proposing a price for gold. They were basically market-producers for gold.

The interaction generally started with the chair proposing a price that was close to the spot market price for gold. Subsequently, each participating entity disclosed their limit orders — buy and sell — and gauges the amount of gold that they can buy or sell at the current position.

Presently the LBMA keeps up with and distributes the Good Delivery Lists for gold and silver, which sets the [benchmark](/benchmark) for gold and silver metal bars worldwide.

LBMA was laid out in 1987 by the Bank of England, which around then was the [bullion](/bullion) market's regulator. The LBMA sets and screens refining standards, makes trading documentation and encourages the development of good trading practices. ICE Benchmark Administration, or IBA, gives the auction platform, methodology as well as overall independent administration and governance for the LBMA Gold Price, with the LBMA holding the intellectual property rights.

LBMA comprises and addresses key market participants and their clients in the London Bullion Market. Its individuals incorporate purifiers, fabricators, traders, storage and security transporters. LBMA addresses them through the maintenance of and publication of the Good Delivery List. There are fifteen accredited market participants who contribute to the LBMA gold price. The rundown of participants comprises a different set, including national banks and trading firms.

## Bullion trading

World trade in bullion is based in London with a global enrollment and [client base](/client-base). The primary gold surge of 1697 brought gold from Brazil into London, with the subsequent setting up of a purpose constructed vault by the Bank of England, or [BoE](/boe). Further gold surges continued in California, Australia and South Africa, which added to the stocks of gold in London.

Treatment facilities were set up to deal with this gold and were normally found close to the BoE. In 1750 the BoE set up the London Good Delivery List for gold, which officially recognized those processing plants that created gold bars to the required standard. LBMA assumed control over the jobs recently carried out by the London Gold Market and Silver Market, whose beginnings date back to the mid-nineteenth century. Today, the LBMA possesses and deals with the Good Delivery Lists for gold and silver.

Trading in spot, advances and wholesale deposits in the bullion market is supported by the Global Precious Metals Code.
