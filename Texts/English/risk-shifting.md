## How Risk Shifting Works

Risk shifting for a troubled company with critical debt happens in light of the fact that just like [shareholders' equity](/shareholdersequity) diminishes, the stake of debt holders in the enterprise increments. Accordingly, on the off chance that the company faces more risk, challenges potential extra profits [accrue](/accrue) to the shareholders, while the downside risk tumbles to the debt holders.
