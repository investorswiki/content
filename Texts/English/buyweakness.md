# Buy Weakness
## What Is Buy Weakness?

Buy weakness is a proactive trading strategy where a trader goes into [long positions](/long) ahead of the anticipated [reversal](/reversal) in a security's price. This strategy is derived from the essential concept of buy low, sell high, and may likewise be alluded to as buy a retracement or buy at support.

## Figuring out Buy Weakness

Buy weakness trades center around recognizing a stock whose price decline is exaggerated. When recognized, the trader starts to collect situations to profit from potential gains once that stock's price bounce back. Traders will generally either go long a security or buy [call options](/calloption) in a preemptive move to capture the whole expected [upside](/upside).

Buy weakness and the inverse "[selling into strength](/sellingintostrength)" strategy are two strategies derived from the fundamental concept of buy low, sell high, and are frequently recognized from following a trading channel.

## Trading Channels

Envelope channels draw upper resistance lines and lower support lines to assist an investor with distinguishing the scope of prices a stock price is probably going to trade inside.

These price points are at or close to a pricing channel's support [trendline](/trendline). When arriving at support, the security is expected to have a low likelihood of falling lower. Consequently, traders hop in to take trading places that will benefit from rising prices.

Buying the security at its support market price and allowing it to rise to a predefined level is one method for benefitting in a buy weakness trade. Traders can likewise buy call options. The call option can be executed whenever up until expiration. For instance, the owner of a [in the money](/inthemoney) (ITM) call option can exercise their option, then quickly sell the security on the open market to produce an immediate profit.
