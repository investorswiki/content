## What Is the Vancouver Stock Exchange (VAN)?

The Vancouver Stock Exchange (VAN/VSE) is a now-defunct stock exchange formerly situated in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. It was incorporated in 1907 as the third-biggest marketplace in Canada behind the [Toronto Stock Exchange](/toronto-stock-exchange-tsx) (TSX) and [Montreal Stock Exchange](/montrealexchange). Stocks listed on this exchange were denoted by a .V following the ticker symbol.

## Understanding the Vancouver Stock Exchange (VAN)

The Vancouver exchange initially included basically little capitalization mining, oil, and gas exploration stocks. By the mid 1990s, in any case, the Vancouver exchange had developed into a specialty market for venture capital securities. Today, the Vancouver Stock Exchange falls under the [TSX Venture Exchange](/tsxventureexchange) umbrella after a merger with the Canadian Venture Exchange in 1999.

The Vancouver Stock Exchange was recognized as the home for venture capital arrangements yet many saw through the facade and immediately named it the "trick capital of the world." At one point the VAN listed around 2,300 stocks, a significant number of which were considered total disappointments or frauds. The exchange provides a common case of how errors in drifting point estimations can lead to tremendous disparities in the rightness of the index perusing. At last, in any case, the VAN is an illustration of one of the world's least fruitful stock exchanges as it was for the most part known for low volumes and speculative postings.

In any case, the Vancouver Stock Exchange managed to reappear all through the market turmoil of the [dotcom bubble](/dotcom-bubble), and in 1999 it converged with the Alberta Stock Exchange and Bourse de Montreal to turn out to be part of the Canadian Venture Exchange, presently known as the TSX Venture Exchange.

The trading floor of the Vancouver exchange stayed the center of the new venture division, however that just gone on for two years. In 2001, TMX Group — the parent company of the Toronto Stock Exchange — bought the recently framed marketplace and immediately renamed it. Today, the TSX Venture Exchange is settled in Calgary, Alberta, with offices in other major urban areas all through Canada. All trading is executed electronically so a trading floor does not exist anymore.
