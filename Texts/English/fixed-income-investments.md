## What Is a Fixed-Income Security?
A fixed-income investment is an asset or security that furnishes its owner with income payments at standard spans, generally as interest or dividends. Common models incorporate bonds, shares of preferred stock, and certificates of deposit.
Fixed-income securities are valued by investors for the income streams they give as opposed to their ability to see the value in value.
## What Is Fixed-Income Investing?
Fixed-income investing is basically what it seems like — investing specifically in fixed-income securities like bonds and real estate investment trusts.
Fixed-income investors don't look for monstrous returns from speculative investments like growth stocks. All things considered, they purchase investments that are less inclined to see the value in value yet are probably going to basically keep a stable value while likewise turning out passive revenue payments after some time.
The goal of fixed-income investing is to keep up with wealth, generate income through interest and [dividends](/dividend), and stay away from the losses that can accompany investing in more unpredictable [securities](/security) like customary stocks.
## 5 Examples of Fixed-Income Investments
There are various types of securities that turn out passive revenue payments to their holders. Below are a couple of instances of securities leaned toward by fixed-income investors.
### Interest-Paying Bonds
A [bond](/bond) is basically a loan an investor makes to one more entity in exchange for interest payments. Whether [municipal](/municipalbond), [federal](/treasury-securities), or [corporate](/corporatebond), bonds pay interest consistently until they mature, when the principal investment is returned to the investor. Treasury bonds issued by the federal government are generally viewed as the safest, and corporate bonds rated BB or lower are thought of as the riskiest.
### Certificates of Deposit
Certificates of deposit, or CDs, are special accounts offered by banks and other financial institutions that permit customers to set aside an installment and leave it immaculate for a specific amount of time — like 12 or 18 months — in exchange for interest payments. CDs normally offer higher rates of interest than traditional savings accounts, and [interest rates ](/interestrate)vary altogether between banks.
### Preferred Stock
[Preferred stock](/preferredstock), like common stock, addresses partial ownership in a company, however dissimilar to common stock, preference shares quite often accompany a guaranteed dividend. Since a lot of their value comes from this "secured in" dividend payment, preference shares don't will generally go all over in price as much of the time or definitely as common shares. Since preferred stock is equity, it is riskier than bonds or CDs.
### Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs)
[REITs](/reit) are companies that buy real estate, finance real estate purchases, or do some mix of the two. They are required to circulate no less than 90% of their income to shareholders as dividends, so they are especially well known with fixed-income investors.
### Dividend-Paying Stocks
A few companies have a history of paying dividends to common stockholders — not just preferred shareholders — consistently. [Common stock](/commonstock) is riskier than preferred stock, bonds, and CDs yet in addition can possibly increase in value.
## What Are the Advantages of Fixed-Income Investments?
Fixed income investments are a great way for an investor to keep up with their existing wealth while earning passively through interest payments and dividends. They are relatively safe compared to different types of investments, and they are less inclined to [volatility](/volatility) than stocks and commodities. Some fixed income securities, similar to bonds and CDs, will generally be financial safe sanctuaries during periods of [recession](/recession).
## What Are the Disadvantages of Fixed-Income Investments?
While fixed income securities are safe and offer stability, they don't have anywhere close to the upside capability of riskier securities like growth stocks and options. With lower risk come lower possible gains.
Also, some fixed-income securities like bonds are inclined to [interest rate risk](/interestraterisk). On the off chance that an investor purchases a bond and, interest rates go up, that bond loses resale value. Inflation risk works in basically the same manner. On the off chance that [inflation](/inflation) dominates a bond's interest during its term, its relative return can be diminished. Consequently, the more extended a bond's term, the more it stands to become devalued by inflation.
## The most effective method to Invest in Fixed-Income Securities
Those interested in fixed-income investing can physically make a portfolio made out of bonds of different issuers and terms, shares of preferred stock and REITs, and other fixed-income securities, or they can invest in [exchange-traded funds (ETFs)](/indexfund) or mutual funds pointed toward turning out standard passive revenue payments. By picking an ETF or [mutual fund](/mutualfund), an investor can gain exposure to an expertly curated portfolio of fixed-income vehicles with a single investment.
