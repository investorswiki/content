## Who Is Spoofy?

Spoofy is a puzzling trader who's supposedly engaged with controlling cryptocurrency exchanges. Spoofy is named after [spoofing](/spoofing), a strategy considered unlawful in equity exchanges.

## Figuring out Spoofy

In 2017, a trader (or group of traders) was associated with controlling prices on the Bitfinex trading platform. The name "Spoofy" was assigned to this obscure trader in view of one of his go-to strategies: spoofing. Spoofing is a form of market manipulation where a trader places at least one highly-noticeable orders however has zero desire to keep them (the orders are not considered bona fide). While the trader's farce order is as yet active (or not long after it is canceled), a second order is placed of the contrary type.

For instance, an investor places a large buy order, just to cancel it and place a sell order. The buy order drives up the price of the cryptocurrency, while the sell order exploits the higher price. The farce buy order allowed the trader to execute the sell trade at a better price than if the parody buy order had not been placed. For Spoofy, this strategy works on the grounds that the trader can place large buy and sell orders (commonly for bitcoins worth huge number of dollars).

It has additionally been suggested that Spoofy has been associated with [wash trading](/washtrading). This includes making offsetting trades, which gives different traders the impression that a market is worth getting into. Whenever traders are drawn into the market, Spoofy may then return to parody trading.

> Equity markets consider spoofing and wash trades to be unlawful. Cryptocurrency trading, in any case, isn't regulated by organizations like the [Securities and Exchange Commission](/sec) (SEC), so it is more helpless to this type of trading strategy and gives less options to recourse.

Spoofy explicitly centered around the Bitfinex platform since it was an exchange where they had the option to place larger trades than some other investors. It was, in short, an exchange where Spoofy would be the largest whale. While different traders could try to counter Spoofy's trades, this would require a large number of bitcoins. Saving a great many bitcoins in a single exchange is exceptionally unsafe, as the exchange could fail and leave the trader without access to a digital wallet.

## Special Considerations

Buying and selling a [cryptocurrency](/cryptocurrency) has a portion of the signs of trading official currencies, like the U.S. dollar, Japanese yen, and the euro. Trading platforms utilize a quotation and pricing structure where the price of a cryptocurrency is listed as a comparison to another currency, like the U.S. dollar. This is called a [currency pair](/currencypair).

Platforms additionally show market capitalization, the day's high and low price statements, and the supply. In contrast to trading a non-digital currency, in any case, the market for cryptocurrencies isn't close to as liquid, and trades may not be executed as fast. This can make volatility and can make the market for cryptocurrencies ready for manipulation.

People who own a large number of [Bitcoin](/bitcoin), Ether, or other virtual currencies are alluded to as "[whales](/bitcoin-whale)." This is on the grounds that they can outsizedly affect how cryptocurrencies are priced. Whales might lean toward specific exchanges, frequently in light of the fact that they comprehend the underlying mechanics better than more modest investors, and are in a better position to take advantage of shortcomings in how orders are handled.
