# Solow Residual
## What Is the Solow Residual?

The Solow residual depends on crafted by Nobel prize-winning economist [Robert Solow](/robert-solow), whose growth model defined productivity growth as rising output with consistent capital and labor. It lets you know whether an economy is developing a direct result of increases in capital or labor, or on the grounds that those data sources are being utilized all the more proficiently. Solow found that only one-eighth of the increase in labor productivity in the United States somewhere in the range of 1909 and 1949 could be ascribed to increased capital. America, as such, became great as a result of American innovation and skill.

The Solow residual is the portion of an economy's output growth that can't be credited to the accumulation of capital and labor, the [factors of production](/factors-production). The Solow residual addresses output growth that occurs past the simple growth of information sources. Thusly, the Solow residual is in many cases depicted as a measure of productivity growth due to mechanical innovation. The Solow residual is additionally alluded to as total factor productivity (TFP).

## Grasping the Solow Residual

The Solow residual is impacted by an enormous assortment of innovative, economic, and social factors. Innovation, investment in additional useful sectors, and economic policies focused on liberalization and competition all lift total factor productivity. On the other hand, the Solow residual can be brought down by restrictive labor rehearses, excessive regulations, immature financial markets that fail to designate capital productively, or whatever else that influences the aggregate productivity of the economy. Be that as it may, total factor productivity is many times utilized as a proxy for mechanical progress and innovation. Differences in nations' TFP levels are now and then used to make sense of differences in economic development.

It is important to note that Solow didn't utilize the term total factor productivity and didn't consider his growth model or the residual bearing his name as having any sort of predictive function. Solow just brought up that growth was unaccounted for in a standard model and that the growth was logical owing to innovations that prodded extra productivity. The Solow residual prodded improvements to economic models and measures, bringing about a better comprehension of the significance of innovation — and investment in innovation — in working on a country's economic performance.

## Certifiable Uses for the Solow Residual

As referenced, the Solow residual has frequently been utilized as a clarification for the changing economic fortunes of national economies. For instance, easing back growth in China has frequently been made sense of as an underlying productivity problem. In this interpretation, China's growth 'wonder' was the consequence of fast capital accumulation and shifting underutilized labor into a modern capitalist economy, as opposed to a rise in productivity. China's TFP has been reliably negative starting around 2015, as per the [Conference Board](/conferenceboard), in light of the fact that it has squandered tremendous measures of financial resources on inefficient [state-owned enterprises](/soe) in industries like steel, coal, and concrete, and excess infrastructure.

Seen from the perspective of total factor productivity, China has managed to turn into an economic superpower through its sheer size as opposed to through gains in productivity. This lack of productivity is, be that as it may, turning out to be a greater amount of an issue as China has apparently arrived at the limits of its hunger for market changes. China may likewise see less access to possibly important advances as the EU and U.S. have taken a firmer position on sharing important intellectual property — something that can impact its Solow residual. As China's labor force contracts, due to its long term "one-youngster" policy, China's economic growth rate looks impractical.

Given the significance of China to the global economy, investors ought to hope to catch wind of Chinese total factor productivity much more before long.

## Features
- The Solow residual is the residual growth rate of output that can't be credited to the growth in inputs.
- The Solow residual is likewise regularly alluded to as total factor productivity (TFP).
- The Solow residual caused to notice the lack of recognition for the job of innovation in economic growth, leading to further developed economic analysis pointed toward catching the job of productivity growth.
