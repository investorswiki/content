# Bias
## What Is Bias?

Bias is a silly or irrational preference or bias held by an individual, which may likewise be subconscious. It's an interestingly human flaw, and since investors are human, they can be impacted by it too. Clinicians have distinguished in excess of twelve sorts of biases, and any or every one of them can cloud the judgment of an investor.

## Figuring out Bias

Other than twisting the ability to pursue a choice in view of realities and evidence, bias is likewise a propensity to overlook evidence that doesn't agree with that assumption.

A bias can be a conscious or unconscious outlook. At the point when investors make a biased move, they fail to recognize evidence that goes against their assumptions.

Smart investors keep away from two major types of bias: emotional and cognitive. Controlling them can permit the investor to arrive at a decision in light of accessible data.

## Common Biases in Investing

Clinicians have distinguished a number of types of bias that are pertinent to investors:

- The [endowment effect](/endowment-effect) makes individuals over-value the things they own just in light of the fact that they own them.
- Business as usual bias is resistance to change.
- Reference point bias and anchoring bias are propensities to value a thing in comparison to something else as opposed to freely.

- Media bias and Internet data bias address careless acceptance of generally revealed assessments and assumptions.

## Illustration of Bias

Bias should be visible in the manner individuals invest. For instance, endowment bias can lead investors to misjudge the value of an investment essentially in light of the fact that they bought it. Assuming the investment is losing money, they demand they're right and that the market will without a doubt address its blunder. They might build up this conviction by surveying the reasons it was all worth what they paid, overlooking the reasons its value fell. The rational investor would audit the entirety of the data, positive and negative, and conclude whether now is the right time to assume the loss and continue on.
