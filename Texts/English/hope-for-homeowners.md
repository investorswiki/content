# HOPE for Homeowners
## What Was HOPE for Homeowners?

HOPE for Homeowners alludes to a federal aid program intended to help homeowners in financial distress because of the collapse of the [subprime mortgage market](/subprime_market) in 2008. Backed by the [Federal Housing Administration (FHA)](/federal-housing-administration), the HOPE for Homeowners Act was one of the means taken by the U.S. government to assist with balancing out the housing market and shield qualified homeowners from loan default and foreclosure. The program was active for around three years and ended in September 2011.

## Figuring out HOPE for Homeowners

After the [tech bubble](/tech_bubble) burst, the American [economy](/economy) started to experience growth. [Interest rates](/interestrate) were at historic lows, and [real estate](/realestate) prices were dropping. This prompted an increase in demand for homes and [mortgages](/mortgage), causing a boom in the housing market. Lenders started loosening up their lending requirements, permitting consumers who in any case wouldn't fit the bill for mortgages to face out high-challenge loans.

In any case, when the market declined, it prompted one of the greatest [recessions](/downturn) ever. A rise in interest rates and real estate values made numerous homeowners default on their month to month mortgage payments. That is the point at which the federal government stepped in to help.

The HOPE for Homeowners program was part of the [Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008](/emergency-economic-strength act), which became law as the [subprime mortgage crisis](/subprime-meltdown) topped in October of that year. Part of the law required the government to give federal loan guarantees and credit upgrades for homeowners who found themselves in [financial distress](/financial_distress). The program aimed to permit homeowners to refinance into affordable, 30-year [fixed-rate mortgage](/fixed-rate_mortgage) loans.

## What Did the HOPE Loan Program Do?

The HOPE Loan program was intended to make homeownership affordable and sustainable for borrowers who were experiencing issues paying their mortgages during the financial crisis. In particular, this aim was to be accomplished by refinancing existing loans, including subprime mortgages, into FHA-backed loans. The FHA vowed to guarantee new mortgage loans up to $300 billion as part of the program.

For borrowers who refinanced under HOPE for Homeowners rules, lenders were required to record the size of the mortgage to a maximum of 90% of the home's new [appraised value](/appraised_value). The ultimate goal in doing so was to permit borrowers to keep away from [foreclosure](/foreclosure) and remain in their homes.

Qualification for the HOPE Loan program was limited to certain borrowers. To fit the bill for the program, homeowners needed to meet the accompanying requirements:

- Properties were required to be proprietor occupied and the proprietor's [primary residence](/principalresidence); second homes and vacation properties didn't count.
- The original mortgage must be dated prior to Jan. 1, 2008.
- They could never have [defaulted](/default2) on the original loan intentionally.
- They couldn't be invested in different home loans.
- All data on the original mortgage was true and checked, including [income](/income) sources and job subtleties.
- They could never have been indicted for [fraud](/fraud).

Participation in the program was voluntary, so homeowners expected to apply to partake. Essentially, not all [lenders](/lender) took part in HOPE for Homeowners, however those that did were FHA-endorsed.

## HOPE for Homeowners Mortgage Terms

The HOPE for Homeowners program issued certain rules for the terms and conditions of mortgage [write-downs](/writedown). That's what in particular, the program directed:

- Loan amounts for eligible borrowers couldn't surpass a cross country maximum of $550,440.
- The new mortgage could be something like 90% of the new appraised value, including any financed [up-front mortgage insurance (UFMI)](/up-front-mortgage-insurance-ufmi) premium, with the lender recording the current mortgage to that amount.
- The UFMI premium was capped at 3%, and the month to month mortgage insurance premium (MIP) was capped at 1.5%
- Holders of existing mortgage [liens](/lien) were required to defer [prepayment penalties](/prepaymentpenalty) and late-payment fees.
- The existing [first mortgage](/first_mortgage) was committed to acknowledge the proceeds of the new loan as full settlement of all outstanding indebtedness.
- Existing subordinate lenders were required to release outstanding mortgage liens.
- Borrowers needed to pay [closing costs](/closingcosts) in accordance with standard FHA rules, however they had the option to finance them into the loan, pay them from their own assets, request payment of these costs by the servicing lender or an outsider, or request payment of them by the beginning lender.
- Borrowers were denied from taking out a [second mortgage](/secondmortgage) for the first five years of the loan, besides in specific situations for emergency repairs.

## Special Considerations

As referenced above, program participants received a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage. At times, that 30-year loan was eligible for an extension. Reaching out to 40 years was useful in cases where the homeowner needed to carry a particularly large amount of [debt](/debt), which was an issue for some homeowners. Subsequently, the 40-year option took into consideration a lower month to month mortgage payment.

### Equity Sharing

Homeowners likewise needed to consent to an equity-sharing program. In this case, equity was the difference between the amount of the original loan and the [actual value](/actual-cash-value) of the home. In the event that the house was sold or [refinanced](/refinance) after the homeowner accepted assistance from the HOPE for Homeowners program, any equity acquired must be shared with the FHA. How much the government received was contingent on how long the homeowner stood by to sell or refinance.

On the off chance that a sale happened in the first year of participation in HOPE for Homeowners, the government received 100% of the [equity](/equity). Any equity earned after year two was isolated on a sliding scale. Thus, on the off chance that a homeowner sold their [property](/property) in the subsequent year in the wake of refinancing, they were permitted to keep 10% of the equity, while the FHA got 90%. In the third year, the split was 20% for the homeowner and 80% for the FHA, etc. After the fifth year, the homeowner and the FHA split the equity 50/50.
