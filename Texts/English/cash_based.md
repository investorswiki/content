# Cash-Based Option
## What Is a Cash-Based Option?

A cash-based option is an option that is constantly settled in cash. Upon exercise, the net value to the elaborate gatherings is calculated and a cash payment is made to accommodate the difference.

## Understanding Cash-Based Options

A cash-based option is advantageous to investors who need to capture movements in stock prices just yet don't have any desire to be required to enter a position after the exercise of an option. At the end of the day, the holder isn't required to purchase the underlying asset in cash-based options. Assuming that the price of the underlying asset surpasses the strike price of the option, the holder is paid the difference at settlement.

For instance, suppose you purchase a cash-based call option contract with a strike price of $55. You exercise the option when the underlying stock price comes to $60 per share. Since one contract is for 100 shares, the net value to you is $500 ([60 - 55] x 100). In this case, you will receive $500 in cash, rather than being required to purchase 100 shares of stock for $55.

Since numerous investors accept it is more straightforward to foresee the movement of the market, as opposed to the course of any individual stock, cash-based options have subsequently risen dramatically, in prevalence.

Of course, there are a large group of indices that underlie cash-based options. These incorporate the New York Stock Exchange, the S&P 500 Index, and the S&P 100 Index. Yet, as indicated by the book "Options as a Strategic Investment," by Lawrence G. McMillan, these exchanges recognize the way that cash-based options aren't an optimal investment solution for everybody.

For example, on the off chance that an investor stood by to perceive how the money supply numbers looked on a given evening, before practicing the trade, they would certainly hold an advantage over the journalists of those equivalent options. Why? Since the authors may as of now not have the option to hedge their positions after the closing bell rings.

To deter this from occurring, cash-based option exercise sees are just a brief time after the options close trading on that specific exchange, on some random trading day, with an end goal to put holders and scholars on neutral ground.
