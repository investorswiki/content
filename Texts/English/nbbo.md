# National Best Bid and Offer (NBBO)
## What Is the National Best Bid and Offer (NBBO)?

The National Best Bid and Offer (NBBO) is a quote that reports the highest [bid price](/bidprice) and least [ask (offered) price](/bestask) in a security, obtained from among every single accessible exchange or trading scenes. The NBBO, thusly, addresses the most impenetrable composite [bid-ask spread](/bid-askspread) in a security.

The Securities Exchange Commission's (SEC) [Regulation NMS](/regulation-nms) expects brokers to trade at the best accessible ask and bid price while buying and selling securities for customers and guarantee basically the NBBO quoted price to its customers at the hour of a trade.

## Figuring out the National Best Bid and Offer (NBBO)

The NBBO is calculated and scattered by Security Information Processors (SIP) as part of the [National Market System Plan](/national-market-system-plan) (NMSP), which is utilized to deal with security prices. There are two SIPs responsible for this task. The Consolidated Quotation System (CQS) gives the NBBO for securities listed on the [New York Stock Exchange](/nyse) (NYSE), NY-ARCA, and NY-MKT, while the Unlisted Trading Privileges (UTP) Quote Data Feed gives the NBBO for securities listed on the Nasdaq.

The NBBO refreshes over the course of the day with the highest and most reduced offers for a security among all exchanges and [market makers](/marketmaker). The most reduced ask price and the highest bid price are shown in the NBBO and are not required to come from a similar exchange â€” the best bid and ask price from a single exchange or market maker is called the "best bid and offer," as opposed to the NBBO. Dark pools and other [alternative trading systems](/alternative-trading-system) may not necessarily in every case show up in these outcomes, given the less transparent nature of their organizations.

Traders that need to execute orders bigger than those accessible through the NBBO ought to utilize an exchange or market maker's "[depth of book](/depth-of-market)" data or [Level II](/level2) market maker screens to distinguish the other expected bid and ask prices that they could use to execute their order.

## Advantages and Disadvantages of the NBBO

The NBBO guarantees that all investors receive the best conceivable price while executing trades through their broker without stressing over conglomerating [quotes](/quote) from numerous exchanges or market makers before putting a trade. This assists level the playing with fielding for [retail traders](/retailinvestor), who might not have the resources to constantly search out the best prices across various exchanges.

The drawback is that the NBBO system may not mirror the most state-of-the-art data, and that means that investors may not get the prices they were guessing when trades are really executed. This is a major concern for [high-frequency traders](/high-frequency-trading) (HFT), who depend on quotes to make their strategies work since they profit from very small price changes at volume.

Regulation NMS is likewise challenging to uphold as a result of the fast pace of trading and the lack of recorded NBBO prices. This makes it challenging for a trader to demonstrate whether they received the NBBO price on a given trade.

Investors ought to keep as a main priority that the prices might be old at times and that not all prices might be reflected, since [dark pools](/dark-pool) and other alternative trading systems might not have listed bid/ask prices.

## NBBO and High-Frequency Trading (HFT)

High-frequency traders generally invest in particular infrastructure to straightforwardly associate with exchanges and cycle orders faster than different brokerages. In effect, they don't depend on SIP data for their purchase/offer bids and exploit the latency between calculation of the NBBO and its distributing to mint profits. Research has zeroed in on whether this empowers them to [front-run others](/frontrunning).

As per a 2013 University of Michigan study, traders profited by as much as $21 billion by exploiting this latency. "By expecting future NBBO, a HFT algorithm can capitalize on cross-market variations before they are reflected in the public price quote, in effect getting out ahead of approaching orders to pocket a small yet certain pro\ufb01t. Normally, this accelerates an arms race, as an even faster trader can work out a NBBO to see the fate of NBBO, etc," the study's creators composed.

## Illustration of the NBBO

Assume a broker receives the accompanying orders to offer to sell stock for company ABC:

- 200 shares for $1,000
- 300 shares for $1,500
- 100 shares for $1800
- 350 shares for $1,600

Simultaneously, coming up next are accessible bid prices for a similar company's stock:

- 100 shares for $900
- 200 shares for $800
- 150 shares for $950

The NBBO for ABC is $950/$1,000 in light of the fact that they are the best bid/offer prices that anyone could hope to find to traders inside the given reach.

## Highlights
- The SEC's Regulation NMS expects brokers to guarantee essentially the NBBO quoted price to its customers at the hour of a trade.
- While it guarantees that all investors receive the best potential prices while executing trades, NBBO may not necessarily in every case mirror the most cutting-edge data, bringing about trades that may not match investor price expectations.
- The NBBO shows the best accessible (most minimal) ask price and best accessible (highest) bid price that anyone could hope to find to customers from numerous exchanges.
- The NBBO is calculated and spread by Security Information Processors (SIP).
