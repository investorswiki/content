# Chikou Span (Lagging Span)
## What Is the Chikou Span (Lagging Span)?

The Chikou span is a part of the [Ichimoku Kinko Hyo](/ichimokuchart), or Ichimoku Cloud indicator. Otherwise called the "lagging span," it is made by plotting [closing prices](/closingprice) 26 periods behind the most recent closing price of an asset. The Chikou span is intended to permit traders to visualize the relationship among current and prior trends, as well as spot potential trend reversals.

A [trend](/trendtrading) is considered to be up when the Chikou span shows up over the price, and descending when the indicator shows up below the price. Numerous traders watch for the Chikou span to cross with prior prices to signal a potential trend change.

## Instructions to Calculate the Chikou Span (Lagging Span)
1. Note the last closing price and afterward plot this value 26-periods back in time.
1. Repeat the interaction with each new closing price.
1. Interface every one of the values to make a single line.

> Albeit the default setting is 26 periods, this number can be altered to increase or diminish the distance between the span and the price.

## Understanding the Chikou Span (Lagging Span)

The Chikou Span is one of the five key lines of the Ichimoku Kinko Hyo, otherwise called the [Ichimoku Cloud](/ichimoku-cloud). The Ichimoku Cloud, developed by Japanese writer Goichi Hosoda in 1969, is a technical indicator that traders use to measure the trend and [momentum](/momentum) of an asset. Different components are the tenkan-sen, kijun-sen, senkou span A, and senkou span B.

> "Chikou" means "crack valley" in Japanese.

One of the key ways of utilizing the indicator is to see its relationship to the current price. At the point when the price shows up over the line, that is many times an indication there is weakness in the price. At the point when the price is below the Chikou span, that is generally an indication there is strength in the price and it is moving higher.

This isn't valuable when the price is crossing to and fro with the Chikou span. A trend might in any case be present, or the price action might be [choppy](/choppymarket), however different components of the Ichimoku Cloud indicator might give better understanding into the trend heading.

Given the abovementioned, when the Chikou span crosses the price this may some of the time signal a trend [reversal](/reversal). Preferably, the price and Chikou span have had some distance between them for quite a while — as indicated above, when price and the Chikou are interwoven signals are not dependable.

At the point when the Chikou span crosses up through the price that could signal a [uptrend](/uptrend) has started in price. The price will have proactively begun to move higher, since that is the main way the Chikou can move above price. Essentially, assuming that the Chikou falls below the price (in the wake of being isolated for a period), that could show that the price has begun to drop and could be going lower.

Most Ichimoku Kinko Hyo strategies utilize the Chikou span as a momentum indicator and as a secondary [confirmation](/confirmation) instrument in view of its relationship with the other four Ichimoku lines.

One more utilization of the Chikou span is to assist with affirming points of [resistance](/resistance) or [support](/support). This is more visual confirmation than whatever else, since the Chikou span will match the closing ups and downs in price, yet will be offset from them.

## The Chikou Span (Lagging Span) versus a Simple Moving Average (SMA)

Both are [lagging indicators](/laggingindicator) yet in various ways.

The Chikou span is definitely not an average. It is closing prices plotted back in time. A [simple moving average](/sma) (SMA), then again, is an average price over a number of periods. It lags since it is an average and accordingly can't respond right away and completely to price changes.

The latest SMA value will be lined up with the right half of the chart and the latest price, while the Chikou span is 26-periods to the left of the latest price.

## Limitations of Using the Chikou Span (Lagging Span)

The lagging span is closing prices plotted in the past. There isn't anything innately predictive in this formula.

While [crossovers](/crossover) can signal trend changes, there are numerous [false signals](/false-signal). The price and Chikou span will frequently cross with next to no significant price move or trend change to follow. For this reason the indicator must be utilized related to different components of the Ichimoku Cloud indicator.

At the point when a crossover brings about a trend change, the price will have currently fundamentally moved that way, as for this reason the crossover happened. In the event that the price has proactively moved essentially when the signal shows up, it may not generally be a beneficial to trade opportunity.

Traders may likewise wish to consolidate [price action](/price-action) and [trend analysis](/trendanalysis), as well as fundamental analysis and other technical indicators, into their trading.

## Features
- It is utilized related to different components in the Ichimoku indicator, and isn't customarily utilized all alone to produce trade signals.
- It is made by plotting closing prices 26 periods behind the last candle/bar.
- It is utilized to measure the momentum of an asset and to assist with distinguishing potential trend changes.
