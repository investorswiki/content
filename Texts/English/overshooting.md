## What Is Overshooting?

In economics, overshooting, otherwise called the exchange rate overshooting hypothesis, is a method for thinking about and make sense of high levels of volatility in currency [exchange rates](/exchangerate) utilizing the concept of [price stickiness](/price_stickiness).

## Understanding Overshooting

Overshooting was acquainted with the world by R\u00fcdiger Dornbusch, a prestigious German [economist](/economist) zeroing in on international economics, including monetary policy, macroeconomic development, growth, and international trade. Dornbusch originally presented the model, presently widely known as the Dornbusch Overshooting Model, in the popular paper "Expectations and Exchange Rate Dynamics," which was distributed in 1976 in the **Journal of Political Economy**.

Before Dornbusch, economists generally accepted that markets ought to, preferably, show up at [equilibrium](/equilibrium) and remain there. A few economists had contended that volatility was simply the consequence of [speculators](/examiner) and shortcomings in the [foreign exchange market](/foreign-exchange-markets), like asymmetric data or adjustment deterrents.

Dornbusch dismissed this view. All things being equal, he contended that [volatility](/volatility) was more fundamental to the market than this, a lot nearer to inherent in the market than to being essentially and only the consequence of shortcomings. All the more essentially, Dornbusch was contending that in the short run, equilibrium is arrived at in the financial markets, and over the long haul, the price of goods answers these changes in the financial markets.

### The Overshooting Model

The overshooting model contends that the foreign exchange rate will briefly go overboard to changes in [monetary policy](/monetarypolicy) to make up at sticky costs of goods in the economy. This means that, in the short run, the equilibrium level will be arrived at through shifts in [financial market](/financial-market) prices, as opposed to through shifts in the prices of goods themselves. Slowly, as the prices of goods unstick and conform to the reality of these financial market prices, the financial market, including the foreign exchange market, additionally acclimates to this financial reality.

In this way, initially, foreign exchange markets blow up to changes in monetary policy, which makes equilibrium in the short term. Then, as the prices of goods slowly answer these financial market prices, the foreign exchange markets temper their reaction and make long-term equilibrium. Consequently, there will be greater volatility in the exchange rate due to overshooting and subsequent [corrections](/amendment) than would somehow be expected.

## Special Considerations

In spite of the fact that Dornbusch's model was convincing, initially it was likewise viewed as to some degree extremist due to its assumption of sticky prices. Today, sticky prices are accepted as fitting with empirical economic perceptions, and Dornbusch's Overshooting Model is widely viewed as the forerunner to modern international economics. As a matter of fact, some have said it "denotes the introduction of modern international macroeconomics."

The overshooting model is considered especially critical in light of the fact that it made sense of exchange rate volatility during when the world was moving from fixed to [floating rate exchanges](/floatingexchangerate). Kenneth Rogoff, during his spell as economic counselor and director of the research department at the [International Monetary Fund](/imf) (IMF), said Dornbusch's paper forced "objective expectations" on private entertainers about exchange rates. "Reasonable expectations is an approach to forcing overall consistency on one's hypothetical analysis," Rogoff composed on the paper's 25th anniversary.

## Highlights
- All things being equal, a cascading type of influence first effects different variables —, for example, financial markets, money markets, derivatives markets, and bond markets — which then transfers its influence onto the prices of goods.
- The model's principal thesis is that prices of goods in an economy don't quickly respond to a change in foreign exchange rates.
- The overshooting model lays out a relationship between sticky prices and unstable exchange rates.
