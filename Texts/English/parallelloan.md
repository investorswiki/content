# Parallel Loan
## What Is a Parallel Loan?

A parallel loan is a four-party agreement where two parent companies in various countries borrow money in their nearby currencies, then, at that point, loan that money to the next's neighborhood subsidiary.

The purpose of a parallel loan is to try not to borrow money across country lines with potential limitations and fees. Each company can positively go straightforwardly to the [foreign exchange market](/foreign-exchange-markets) (forex) to secure their funds in the legitimate currency, however they then would face [exchange risk](/foreignexchangerisk).

The primary parallel loans were executed during the 1970s in the United Kingdom to sidestep taxes that were forced to make foreign investments more costly. These days, [currency swaps](/currencyswap) have for the most part supplanted this strategy, which is like a [back-to-back loan](/backtobackloan).

## How a Parallel Loan Works

For instance, say an Indian company has a subsidiary in the United Kingdom and a U.K. firm has a subsidiary in India. Each firm's subsidiary necessities the equivalent of 10 million British pounds to finance its operations and investments. As opposed to each company borrowing in its home currency and afterward changing over the funds into the other currency, the two parent firms go into a parallel loan agreement.

The Indian company borrows 909,758,269 rupees (the equivalent of 10 million pounds) from a neighborhood bank. Simultaneously, the British company borrows 10 million pounds from its neighborhood bank. They every then loan the money to different's auxiliaries, settling on a defined period of time and interest rate (most loans of this type come due in 10 years or less). Toward the finish of the term of the loans, the money is reimbursed with interest, and the parent companies repay that money to their home banks. No exchange from one currency to the next was required and, hence, neither the two auxiliaries nor their parent firms were presented to currency risk due to vacillations in the rupee/pound exchange rate.

Companies could likewise straightforwardly make loans to one another, avoiding the utilization of banks altogether. At the point when the loan term closes, the company repays the loan at the fixed rate agreed upon toward the beginning of the loan term, in this manner guaranteeing against [currency risk](/currencyrisk) during the term of the loan.

## Upsides and downsides of a Parallel Loan

As referenced, parallel loans keep away from currency risk and perhaps legal limitations of cross-border lending. They likewise consider lower interest rates as every nearby company would enjoy a benefit in borrowing on its home turf, rather than borrowing as the neighborhood subsidiary of a foreign company. The credit rating of the subsidiary may not be as high and as a foreign company, it very well might be viewed as riskier.

In chasing after parallel loans, the most concerning issue companies face is finding counterparties with comparative funding needs. Furthermore, even assuming they truly do find proper partners, the terms and conditions wanted by both may not match. A few gatherings will enroll the services of a broker, however at that point brokerage fees must be added to the cost of the financing.

Default risk is likewise a problem, as a disappointment by one party to pay back the loan as soon a possible doesn't release the obligations of the other party. Normally, this risk is offset by another financial agreement, or by a contingency clause covered in the original loan agreement.
