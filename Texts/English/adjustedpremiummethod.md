# Adjusted Premium Method
## What Is the Adjusted Premium Method?

The adjusted premium method is utilized by [insurance](/insurance) companies to work out the amount owed to a customer who chooses to rashly cancel their insurance policy. In particular, it is utilized to compute the [cash surrender value](/cashsurrendervalue) (CSV) of a life insurance policy.

## How the Adjusted Premium Method Works

At the point when a policyholder pays standard insurance premiums on their life insurance policy, a portion of those [premiums](/premium) is applied toward savings while the remainder is applied toward a reserve fund. This reserve fund is then used to finance the [death benefit](/guaranteeddeathbenefit) of the policy, which is the amount paid to the policyholder's beneficiaries upon their death.

Initially, a bigger portion of the premiums is directed toward the reserve fund rather than the savings portion, implying that the amount of accumulated savings inside the policy will be somewhat low inside the early years.

The CSV is drawn from the savings portion of that policy, instead of the portion that is set to the side for payment of death benefits. As a rule, the surrender value won't ever approach the death benefit of the policy. Hence, a policyholder ought to just consider canceling a policy under extreme financial hardship or when they are sure that they are moving assets to a predominant investment. This is particularly true thinking about that insurance companies frequently integrate [surrender fees](/surrenderfee), some of the time amounting to as much as 10% of an arrangement's CSV, which would additionally reduce the amount of money acquired from surrendering the policy.

As a general rule, method computes the CSV by taking the total premiums paid up to the surrender date and deducting all expenses or fees accumulated up to that point. In doing as such, the insurer will reduce the CSV in two unique ways. To begin with, it will designate a portion of the costs incurred to gain and service the contract. Then, it will evaluate surrender fees which will be bigger assuming that the contract was surrendered moderately right off the bat in its life.
