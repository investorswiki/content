## Types of Financial Markets
### Stock Markets

Maybe the most ubiquitous of financial markets are stock markets. These are settings where companies list their shares and they are bought and sold by traders and investors. Stock markets, or equities markets, are utilized by companies to raise capital through an initial public offering (IPO), with shares subsequently traded among different buyers and sellers in what is known as a secondary market.

Stocks might be traded on listed exchanges, for example, the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) or [Nasdaq](/nasdaq), or, in all likelihood over-the-counter (OTC). Most trading in stocks is done by means of regulated exchanges, and these play an important job in the economy as both a check of the overall soundness of the economy as well as giving capital gains and dividend income to investors, incorporating those with retirement accounts like IRAs and 401(k) plans.

Run of the mill participants in a stock market incorporate (both retail and institutional) investors and traders, as well as [market producers (MMs)](/marketmaker) and experts who keep up with liquidity and give two-sided markets. [Brokers](/stockbroker) are outsiders that work with trades among buyers and sellers yet who don't take an actual position in a stock.

### Over-the-Counter Markets

A [over-the-counter (OTC)](/otc) market is a decentralized market — meaning it doesn't have physical areas, and trading is led electronically — in which market participants trade securities directly between two parties without a broker.

### Derivatives Markets

A derivative is a contract between at least two parties whose value depends on a settled after underlying financial asset (like a security) or set of assets (like an index). Derivatives are secondary securities whose value is exclusively derived from the value of the primary security that they are linked to. All by itself a derivative is worthless. Rather than trading stocks directly, a derivatives market trades in futures and [options](/optionscontract) contracts, and other advanced financial products, that get their value from underlying instruments like bonds, commodities, currencies, interest rates, market indexes, and stocks.

Futures markets are where futures contracts are listed and traded. Not at all like advances, which trade OTC, futures markets use normalized contract particulars, are all around regulated, and use clearinghouses to settle and confirm trades. Options markets, for example, the [Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE)](/cboe), comparably list and control options contracts. The two futures and options exchanges might list contracts on different asset classes, like equities, fixed-income securities, commodities, etc.

### Forex Market

These are known as [spot commodity](/spotcommodity) markets, where physical goods are exchanged for money.

The bulk of trading in these commodities, nonetheless, happens on derivatives markets that use spot commodities as the underlying assets. Advances, futures, and options on commodities are exchanged both OTC and on listed [exchanges](/commoditiesexchange) around the world like the [Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME)](/cme) and the [Intercontinental Exchange (ICE)](/intercontinentalexchange).

## Instances of Financial Markets

The above segments clarify that the "financial markets" are broad in scope and scale. To give two additional substantial models, we will think about the job of stock markets in carrying a company to IPO, and the job of the OTC derivatives market in the 2008-09 financial crisis.

### Stock Markets and IPOs

At the point when a company lays down a good foundation for itself, it will require access to capital from investors. As the company develops it frequently ends up needing access to a lot bigger amounts of capital than it can get from progressing operations or a traditional bank loan. Firms can raise this size of capital by selling shares to the public through an initial public offering (IPO). This changes the situation with the company from a "private" firm whose shares are held by a couple of shareholders to a [publicly-traded](/publiccompany) company whose shares will be subsequently held by various individuals from the overall population.

The IPO additionally offers early investors in the company an opportunity to cash out part of their stake, frequently receiving exceptionally attractive benefits all the while. Initially, the price of the IPO is generally set by the [underwriters](/financier) through their pre-marketing process.

When the company's shares are listed on a [stock exchange](/stockmarket) and trading in it starts, the price of these shares will change as investors and traders survey and rethink their intrinsic value and the supply and demand for those shares at any moment in time.

### OTC Derivatives and the 2008 Financial Crisis: MBS and CDOs

While the 2008-09 financial crisis was caused and exacerbated by several factors, one factor that has been widely recognized is the market for [mortgage-backed securities (MBS)](/mbs). These are a type of OTC derivatives where cash flows from individual mortgages are packaged, sliced up, and sold to investors. The crisis was the consequence of a sequence of occasions, each with its own trigger and finishing in the close breakdown of the banking system. It has been contended that the seeds of the crisis were planted as far back as the 1970s with the Community Development Act, which required banks to loosen their credit requirements for lower-income consumers, making a market for [subprime mortgages](/subprime_mortgage).

The amount of subprime mortgage debt, which was guaranteed by [Freddie Mac](/freddiemac) and Fannie Mae, kept on venturing into the mid 2000s, when the Federal Reserve Board started to cut interest rates definitely to keep away from a recession. The combination of loose credit requirements and cheap money prodded a housing boom, which drove speculation, pushing up housing prices and making a real estate bubble. Meanwhile, the investment banks, searching for simple profits in the wake of the [dotcom bust](/dotcom-bubble) and the 2001 recession, made a type of MBS called [collateralized debt obligations (CDOs)](/cdo) from the mortgages purchased on the secondary market.

Since subprime mortgages were packaged with prime mortgages, there was not a chance for investors to comprehend the risks associated with the product. At the point when the market for CDOs started to warm up, the housing bubble that had been building for quite some time had at long last burst. As housing prices fell, subprime borrowers started to default on loans that were worth more than their homes, speeding up the decline in prices.

At the point when investors realized the MBS and CDOs were worthless due to the toxic debt they addressed, they endeavored to empty the obligations. In any case, there was no market for the CDOs. The subsequent cascade of subprime lender failures made liquidity [contagion](/contagion) that arrived at the upper tiers of the banking system. Two major investment banks, Lehman Brothers and Bear Stearns, imploded under the weight of their exposure to subprime debt, and in excess of 450 banks failed over the next five years. Several of the major banks were near the precarious edge of failure and were safeguarded by a citizen financed bailout.
