# Deferred Payment Annuity
## What Is a Deferred Payment Annuity?

The term deferred payment annuity alludes to a [insurance](/insurance) product that gives future payments to the buyer as opposed to an immediate stream of income. It permits the investment's principal balance to become both by contributions or [premiums](/premium) and interest before payments are initiated to the owner of the annuity.

Annuity owners can pick how frequently they receive income and for how long. A portion of these annuities likewise pay death benefits to survivors or different beneficiaries if the owner passes on during or after the accumulation phase.

## How a Deferred Payment Annuity Works

A [annuity](/annuity) is a financial contract that permits the buyer to make a lump-sum payment, or a series of payments, in exchange for getting future periodic distributions. Annuities range from fixed to variable and immediate to deferred. A deferred payment annuity, which is otherwise called a [deferred annuity](/deferredannuity) or a [delayed annuity](/delayed-annuity), is not quite the same as different annuities in how premiums are paid and with regards to withdrawals.

This sort of annuity might be funded through month to month contributions. A few investors might favor making a lump sum contribution, potentially even a very long time before payments start. Withdrawals don't start not long after it is funded, as with a [immediate annuity](/immediatepaymentannuity). A deferred payment annuity develops during the accumulation (or deferral) phase and apportions benefit payments in the distribution (or income) phase.

These annuities normally offer tax-deferred growth at a fixed or variable rate of return, just like customary annuities. [Earnings](/earnings) are taxed as ordinary income upon [withdrawal](/withdrawal). They might be purchased for minor children who start getting benefits payments when they turn 18 or one more age determined by the annuity buyer.

A deferred payment annuity buyer need not at any point transform the money in the annuity into a series of income payments. Money might be removed on a case by case basis, in a [lump-sum payment](/lump-sum-payment), or moved to another account or annuity. At the point when a deferred payment annuity is utilized along these lines, the annuity buyer holds control of their money, as opposed to being locked into payments by starting a withdrawal in a distribution or [annuitization](/annuitization) phase.
