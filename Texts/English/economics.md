The principles of neoclassical economics are in many cases utilized as a system to outline the ideals of capitalism, including the propensity of market prices to arrive at equilibrium as the volume of supply and demand changes. The optimal valuation of resources rises up out of the powers of individual craving and scarcity.
John Maynard Keynes developed the theory of Keynesian economics during the Great Depression. Contending against neoclassical theory, Keynes showed that the controlled markets and government intervention in markets make a stable and equitable economic system and upheld for a monetary policy intended to support demand and investor certainty during economic slumps.

Marxian economics is defined in Karl Marx's work **Das Kapital**. Marxian economics is a dismissal of the classical perspective on economics contending against the possibility that the free market, an economic system determined by supply and demand with practically no government control, benefits society. He upheld that capitalism just benefits a limited handful and that the ruling class becomes more extravagant by separating value out of cheap labor given by the working class.
