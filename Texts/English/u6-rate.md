# The U-6 (Unemployment) Rate
## What Is the U-6 (Unemployment) Rate?

The U-6 (Unemployment) rate measures the percentage of the U.S. labor force that is unemployed, plus the individuals who are underemployed, imperceptibly appended to the workforce, and have given up searching for work. The U-6 rate is viewed as by numerous business analysts to be the most noteworthy measure of the true state of the country's employment situation.

By and by, the more widely-reported unemployment number is the U-3, frequently alluded to just as the unemployment report. The U3 uncovers just the number of individuals who are out of work and have sought work in the past about a month.

The two numbers are published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS).

## Understanding the U-6 (Unemployment) Rate

The official unemployment rate used by the U.S. government and published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) is the U-3 rate. This is the percentage of the total labor force that is unemployed and has effectively sought employment inside the past about a month.

The piece of the unemployed that has not searched for a job in the past about a month is defined as "imperceptibly joined" and as of now not counted as unemployed.

That barely joined group includes unemployed individuals who have unsuccessfully searched for work sometime in the past twelve months. It additionally includes individuals who have returned to school or become disabled, in which case they could conceivably return to the labor force sooner or later.

### Composition of the U-6 Rate

The U-6 rate, then again, factors in this hardly appended percentage of the labor force in its unemployment calculation.

The U-6 rate additionally includes the underemployed in its metrics. These are individuals who need full-time jobs but have settled for part-time jobs due to economic conditions. While the U-3 rate believes this category of workers to be employed, the U-6 counts this group as unemployed.

At long last, the U-6 rate includes the "discouraged": Those who need a job but have given up looking.

> The BLS publishes six month to month unemployment numbers. The U-3 is the official rate and is generally widely quoted. The U-6 is a more complete gander at the state of American workers.

## Factors of the U-6 (Unemployment) Rate

Gallup, the data analytics firm, believes the U-6 rate to be "the real unemployment rate," and keeps up with that the widely-quoted U-3 rate doesn't accurately address the reality of joblessness in America.

Gallup notes that an engineer or some other skilled professional who takes a low-paying part-time job to survive would not be counted in the official unemployment rate, even assuming that the person in question makes just $20 every week.

Furthermore, the U-3 rate includes no workers who are employed but have had their work hours reduced.

The above are all named "underemployed," and are included in the U-6 rate.

The U-3 likewise omits the people who are unemployed but have not searched for work in the past about a month. These are the "discouraged" workers that the U-6 reflects.

### Tracking the U-6

The St. Louis Fed (FRED) tracks the U-6 rate over the long run on its website.

Its chart, in light of BLS numbers, shows a frightening U-6 rate of 22.9% in April 2020, during the primary national COVID-19 shutdown. The official U-3 rate at that time was 14.7%. In January 2020, it had been just 6.9%. The official U-3 rate was 3.5%.

## Illustration of the U-6 (Unemployment) Rate

To calculate the official unemployment rate, the U-3, the BLS partitions the total number of unemployed individuals by the total number of labor force participants, then multiplies that number by 100.

For instance, the June 2019 month to month rate report indicated that the total number of individuals that were unemployed was 6.5 million and the civilian labor force comprised of 163.9 million individuals. The U-3 unemployment rate was 4%.

In similar January 2022 report, the number of individuals that were hardly appended to the labor force totaled 1.5 million, while the total number of workers with part-time jobs for economic reasons was 3.7 million. The U-6 unemployment rate was 7.1%.

While calculating the U-6 rate, the imperceptibly joined group is added to both the numerator (total unemployed) and denominator (total labor force). What's more, part-time workers are added to the numerator just, since they have proactively been included as part of the labor force.

The U-6 rate is significantly higher than the U-3 figure and is arguably a better impression of the strength of the American workforce at that point.

### The COVID-19 Effect

Since March 2020, the Bureau of Labor Statistics has added several questions to its Household Survey to measure the impact of the coronavirus pandemic on jobs.

Here is some of what it found in January 2022:

- 15.4% of Americans with jobs teleworked to some degree part of the time.
- 6 million individuals were unable to work because their employer closed or lost business due to the pandemic.
- 1.8 million were unable to search for work due to the pandemic.

## The Bottom Line

The U-3 unemployment rate is reported month to month and is watched and followed carefully as a key indicator of the soundness of the U.S. economy.

The U-6 rate offers a more extensive understanding of the true wellbeing of the economy.

What number of individuals are scrambling for part-time jobs because they can't get a full-time position? What number of individuals have given up even attempting to find a new line of work? What number of have left the workforce, expecting to return when the situation gets to the next level?

The U-3 number doesn't include any of those individuals, but the U-6 rate does.
