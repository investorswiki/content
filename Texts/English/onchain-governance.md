# On-Chain Governance
## What Is On-Chain Governance?

On-chain governance is a system for overseeing and carrying out changes to [cryptocurrency](/cryptocurrency) blockchains. In this type of governance, rules for establishing changes are encoded into the [blockchain](/blockchain) protocol. Designers propose changes through code refreshes and every node votes on whether to acknowledge or dismiss the proposed change.

## Figuring out On-Chain Governance

A blockchain network is a system that contains a distributed ledger like a shared database. Transactions are recorded on the blockchain and shared with the participants as a whole. Whenever another transaction is conducted, another block should be added to the blockchain. Notwithstanding, there are [consensus](/consensus-mechanism-cryptocurrency) protocols, which should be followed for the transaction to be considered legitimate. [Miners](/bitcoin-mining), who are additionally called nodes, check the data to ensure it's accurate and that the boundaries in regards to the transaction have been fulfilled.

Once excavators have completed their verification cycle, the outcomes are submitted to the network. After survey by different nodes or participants and consensus has been accomplished, another block is added to the network. Excavators generally receive some sort of compensation for their efforts, which is called a [Proof of Work](/proof-work) (PoW) system or interaction.

## Participants in On-Chain Governance

Dissimilar to informal governance systems, which utilize a combination of offline coordination and online code modifications to effect changes, on-chain governance systems work only online. Changes to a blockchain are proposed through code refreshes. Improvement proposals to make changes to the blockchain must be presented by engineers. A core group, consisting generally of designers, is responsible for planning and achieving consensus between partners. Regularly, on-chain governance includes the following partners:

- Diggers — who operate the nodes, which approve the transactions
- Designers — who are responsible for core blockchain calculations
- Users or participants — who use and invest in different cryptocurrencies

Partners in the process are given economic incentives to participate. For instance, every node can earn a cut of overall transaction fees for voting, while engineers are rewarded through alternate funding mechanisms.

The participants or nodes can vote to acknowledge or decline the proposed change. Nonetheless, not all nodes have equivalent voting power. Nodes with greater holdings of coins have more votes as compared to nodes that have a generally lesser number of holdings. Assuming the change is accepted, it is remembered for the blockchain and baselined. In certain occurrences of on-chain governance implementation, the refreshed code might be moved back to its version before a baseline, in the event that the proposed change is fruitless.

## Types of On-Chain Governance

Implementation of on-chain governance contrasts between different blockchains. For instance, [Tezos](/tezos) utilizes a form of self-revising ledger. Proposed changes are carried out to the coin's blockchain and carried out onto a test version of the chain. In the event that the planned changes are fruitful, they are settled into a production version of the blockchain. If not, they are moved back.

DFinity, a startup that is utilizing blockchain to build what it claims will be the world's greatest virtual computer, revealed a plan to take on a hardcoded constitution on its network. The constitution triggers passive and active actions. An illustration of the former may be an increase in reward size for blocks while the last option could include isolating certain parts of the network for updates or rollbacks.

Current governance systems in [Bitcoin](/bitcoin) and [Ethereum](/ethereum) are informal. They were planned with a decentralized ethos, first declared by Satoshi Nakamoto in quite a while original paper.

## Concerns About On-Chain Governance

Pundits of the system claim that this form of informal governance is, truth be told, centralized among excavators and engineers. They point to two noticeable forks in the cryptocurrency ecosystem as proof.

### Ethereum Fork

The first is a split of the original Ethereum blockchain into [Ethereum Classic](/ethereum-classic) (ETC) and Ethereum (ETH) in 2016 because of a hack into the system where $50 million worth of funds were taken. A [hard fork](/hard-fork) was performed to secure the network and to return the taken funds to their original owners. A hard fork is a major change to a blockchain protocol that could make previous blocks or transactions legitimate or invalid. A hard fork requires the designers and nodes to consent to the upgrade or change to the protocols. Sometimes a hard fork isn't agreed upon by all participants, which can make concern, discussion, and analysis.

The Ethereum fork was widely bantered by the community as was whether to support Ethereum Classic or Ethereum following the fork. Pundits contended that this was a contravention of the widely-held "Code is Law" principle, in which the overseeing boundaries for software are set down in the original code. Others have contended that the fork demonstrates that malicious assaults on the system can be managed effectively reestablishing the funds of those included.

### Bitcoin Fork

In 2017, Bitcoin likewise went through a hard fork, which brought about two separate blockchains; the original Bitcoin and [Bitcoin Cash](/bitcoin-cash). At that point, the Bitcoin community was attempting to decide how to work on the network's scalability or the ability to handle more transactions simultaneously. As new transactions are added to a network, only so many can be handled all the while. For instance, Bitcoin could only handle one megabyte of transactions all at once, which prompted postpones in transactions being completed.

During the fork, a proposal to increase the average block size in bitcoin's blockchain was dismissed by the cryptocurrency's core development team. They dismissed the change, in spite of the way that high transaction fees made bitcoin's utilization as a medium for daily transactions unreasonable. The only constituency that profited from high transaction fees were diggers. Eventually, a rebel group of engineers and excavators moved away to make their own cryptocurrency with variable block sizes. The hard fork among Bitcoin and Bitcoin cash was done, in part, to increase the processing limit from one to eight megabytes.

## Fate of On-Chain Governance

On-chain governance arose as an alternative to informal systems of governance. It claims to take care of the problems of the centralization of bitcoin by integrating all nodes inside a blockchain network into the decision-production process.

Blockchain technology offers a comprehensive approach to technology in which all participants can share the benefits. As the blockchain community and their networks hope to work on their scalability allowing them to handle more transactions and contend with traditional electronic payment systems, for example, Visa, updates to the technology are probably going to continue.

These changes will continue to be carried out with an end goal to improve blockchain technology and the shared benefits of the community. On-chain governance will probably center around upgrading transparency and trust during the time spent a distributed ledger as these changes and improvements are carried out.

Nonetheless, the blockchain community should guarantee that on-chain governance isn't generally controlled by a small group of designers and excavators who can Implement changes as they see fit. With developmental changes to the blockchain networks, there is the risk of future conflicts and hard forks, which could separate the blockchain community.

## Benefits of On-Chain Governance

As indicated by its proponents, the upsides of on-chain governance are as follows:

### It Is a Decentralized Form of Governance

Changes to a blockchain are not steered through a core development community, which assesses its merits and demerits. All things considered, every node is allowed to vote on the proposed change and can learn about or examine its benefits and disadvantages. It is decentralized in light of the fact that it depends on the community for collective decision-production.

### It Offers Quicker Turnaround Times for Changes

Informal governance systems demand investment and exertion between partners to accomplish consensus. On-chain governance accomplishes consensus in regards to proposed changes in moderately less time among partners. For instance, the bitcoin cash fork and Ethereum classic fork required months to build up and execute.
Also, off-chain moving can bring about muddled situations where certain nodes can settle on a truce and not run the proposed changes. Algorithmic voting mechanisms are generally quicker on the grounds that test results for their implementation should be visible by means of a code update. Running the code change on a test net, as on account of Tezos, likewise empowers partners to see the effects of that change in practice.

### The Possibility of a Hard Fork Is Reduced Significantly

Since each proposed change requires consensus from all nodes, this means that the possibility of a hard fork is diminished fundamentally. Using rewards, on-chain governance proposes economic incentives for nodes to participate in the voting system.

The informal governance process doesn't give economic incentives to end-users, who use cryptocurrencies for daily transactions or invest in them for long periods. All things being equal, economic incentives rest with diggers and designers. Once voting is concluded, all node administrators are required to follow the decision.

## Hindrances of On-Chain Governance

In light of initial examinations conducted with on-chain protocols, the detriments of this type of governance are as follows:

### It Has a Low-Voter Turnout

Likewise with genuine elections, low voter turnout might turn into a problem for on-chain governance. The DAO Carbonvote, which at one time had recorded participation rates of 4.5%, is proof of this problem. Low-voter turnout is likewise undemocratic in light of the fact that it could bring about a single node with huge holdings controlling the overall future direction of the protocol.

### Users With Greater Stakes Can Manipulate Votes

Nodes with additional coins get more votes. Once more, this means that users with additional stakes can assume command over the voting system and steer future development in their ideal direction. All the more significantly, it slants the dynamic away from diggers and engineers towards users and investors, who might be basically keen on boosting future profits instead of fostering the protocol towards imaginative use cases.

## Critiques of On-Chain versus Off-Chain Governance

The question of blockchain governance isn't unique or extraordinary. Legal philosophy and theory have wrestled with this issue for many years, and the issues there have direct importance to the question of on-chain versus off-chain governance.

Central to the discussion between governance that incorporates human decision making (off-chain) and rule-based decision making that can be conducted completely through automated processes (on-chain), is the question of "whether existing rules and decision-production processes overseeing a blockchain-based system ought to be changed from the inside or the outside by the reference community, and whether the system ought to accommodate a mechanism to change the governance structure itself. This functional question prompts the more hypothetical and normative question of whether an existing set of code-based rules could and ought to surpass the exercise of human judgment in decision-production, and what are the ethical and political considerations this would involve."

On-chain governance depends on a version of positivist legal order that empowers serene and genuine resolutions of debates in a pluralist society, without recourse to outside sources (moral or political) to legitimize its authenticity. On account of crypto governance, this means the contending interests of partners don't need to boil down to a parleying authority (like "how might Satoshi respond?") or a fight over moral needs, similar to "it's unfair that excavators get to pursue choices on fees when coin holders are abandoned."

The critique inquires as to whether this is conceivable, or on the other hand if, as conservative legal scholar (and one-time German Nazi party member) Carl Schmidt contended, such positivist orders are helpless against capture by private interests. As per Schmitt, positivist systems break down during situations where exceptions emerge outside the standards of governance that are written into the rules — in this case, the code that runs the blockchain.

In such a situation, the rule system itself begins to typify unreasonable contradictions. For instance, on the off chance that one set of users of the blockchain demand that blocks must be modified to increase the liquidity and supply of its tokens, which could deliver inflation, and one more set demands that the financial pain of less-fluid currency is important to guard against the disasters of inflation.

In these situations, Schmitt contends one person or one group will step in to go with a choice that breaks the unresolvable tie — someone over the rules. This is, of course, an abomination to the profoundly decentralized ethos of blockchain philosophy.
