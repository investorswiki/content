# Fixed Debenture
## What Is a Fixed Debenture?

A fixed debenture, otherwise called a fixed-charge debenture, is a loan that is issued against specific assets. A fixed debenture typically conveys a fixed rate of interest on the debt. Companies generally utilize fixed-charge debentures to fund-raise for short-term operations, signing specific assets, like real estate or equipment, over to the [creditor](/creditor) as [collateral](/collateral) for the loan. The collateral is fundamental in light of the fact that the loan has no other form of backing.

## Figuring out Fixed Debentures

A [debenture](/debenture) is a debt instrument that is typically not secured by anything. At the end of the day, debentures are just backed by the backer's creditworthiness. Notwithstanding, a **fixed** debenture **is** backed by collateral. Fixed debentures permit the creditor to place limitations on the [mortgaged](/contract) assets that back the loan.

For instance, a real estate development company could give one of its high rises up as collateral for a loan. The creditor would, thus, limit the company from selling the property, or even leasing units inside it, however long the note might last. The creditor could make these limitations to prevent the borrower company from settling on unsafe or poor financial choices.

At the point when the borrower fulfills the loan, they recapture full control of their assets. Meanwhile, the borrower repays the loan in predetermined increases. These payments incorporate principal and interest payments at a preset rate. If the company [defaults](/default2) — meaning it neglects to make its payments — the creditor could permit the borrower to sell or [liquidate](/liquidation) the building to raise the capital expected to pay back the loan. The creditor could likewise take command and sell the actual asset.

## Fixed Debentures versus Floating Debentures

A fixed debenture is an alternative to a [floating debenture](/floating_charge), which requires a borrower to give a whole class of assets up to the creditor as collateral. In any case, the creditor generally doesn't have control over the sold assets with floating debentures on the grounds that the assets vary in quantity.

For instance, suppose a manufacturing company is hoping to borrow money from a bank. The company could involve its inventory as collateral through a floating debenture. The inventory would be persistently in motion yet have value. With a floating debenture, the company would in any case have the option to create its products, utilize its inventory, and sell its stock even however the inventory was given up to the creditor. The company would recover control over its inventory with the full repayment of the note.

On the other hand, in the event that the manufacturing company borrowed through a fixed debenture, they would need to secure the loan with [fixed assets](/fixedasset) like property, buildings, or equipment. Until the company repays the loan in full, the creditor could confine it from selling or subleasing that piece of property.

Floating debentures can likewise change into fixed debentures. Likewise, the lender could determine conditions that would make the debenture abandon a floating debenture to a fixed debenture. A floating to fixed debenture typically happens in a situation including default and liquidation.

## U.S. versus U.K. Debentures

Debentures allude to somewhat various instruments in the American and British financial universes.

In the U.S., a debenture is a medium-to long-term debt instrument, issued to a company that is seeking an investor's funds. It is generally not backed by the borrowing company's assets or collateral. In the U.K., a debenture is likewise a debt instrument a capital-broadening investor or lender utilizes — yet it is backed up by the company's assets, frequently specifically designated assets. In the U.S., a debenture works more like an unsecured loan; in the U.K., it's more much the same as what Americans call a [corporate bond](/corporatebond).

Thus, fixed debentures in the U.S. are the equivalent of essential debentures in the U.K.
