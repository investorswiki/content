# Continuity Of Business Enterprise Doctrine
## DEFINITION of Continuity Of Business Enterprise Doctrine

The continuity of business enterprise doctrine is a taxation principle applicable to corporate [mergers and acquisitions](/mergersandacquisitions). That's what the doctrine holds, to qualify as a tax-deferred [reorganization](/reorganization), the gaining entity must either proceed with the target company's historic business or ought to utilize a substantial portion of the target's business assets while directing business.

In summary, the doctrine applies to how taxes are dealt with when a firm changes hands. The purchasing entity must keep up with the business functionally or hold a large portion of the assets when two substances converge to get tax-deferred status. It is fundamental to numerous mergers, including the [reverse triangle merger](/rtm).

## BREAKING DOWN Continuity Of Business Enterprise Doctrine

The continuity of business enterprise doctrine applies just to the business and business assets of the target company, and not to the gaining company. Hence, in a situation where the vast majority of the assets of a company are tried to be discarded (stripped), one approach to guaranteeing compliance with the continuity doctrine is by making this company the acquirer as opposed to the target. This is a technique that has been approved by the [IRS](/irs).

Under U.S. [federal tax code](/tax-code), corporate reorganizations have frequently delighted in particular treatment. In any case, taxes can get precarious relying upon whether a transaction is a reorganization or the sale of an ownership interest. For a transaction to qualify as a reorganization, hence treated well tax-wise, the continuity of business enterprise doctrine looks at whether a target's shareholders, before the reorganization, have kept on holding a proprietary interest in the rearranged firm. Basically, it expects that the shareholders of a target entity receive a huge share of their consideration in the purchasing entity's stock. Moreover, the doctrine expects that the obtaining corporation either proceed with the target's operations or utilize a huge portion of the target's assets in a business form. On the off chance that these conditions can't be met, the tax code sees the target's shareholders as having discarded, as opposed to proceeded, their interest in the target's business and assets. Hence, the transaction would fail to qualify as a reorganization and would be taxed at both the corporate and shareholder levels.

For the majority business transactions, tax treatment can be a large inspiration for a proposed transaction; albeit an exceptionally technical matter, the continuity of business enterprise doctrine conveys critical consideration.
