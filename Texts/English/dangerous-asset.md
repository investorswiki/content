# Dangerous Asset
## What Is a Dangerous Asset?

A dangerous asset is a piece of property or investment, which represents a risk of [liability](/liability) to its owner. Liability means that the owner of the dangerous asset could be sued or found legally responsible for somebody getting injured. The term dangerous asset for the most part applies to a physical asset, like a building, vehicle, or equipment.

## Grasping Dangerous Assets

A dangerous asset is an asset that represents a threat to the physical safety of another individual, in this way making a likely liability to the asset's owner. In spite of the fact that accidents can happen with many types of assets, dangerous assets represent an additional risk, especially assuming the owner knows about the risk. The outcome can be a financial payout by the company in the event that they're sued by the individual harmed by the asset.

For instance, a bike rental company that possesses a bike with a shaky tire and leases it to a customer is presenting itself to the risk that the customer has an accident brought about by that defective equipment. Expecting that this causation can be proved, the rental company will probably be held obligated for the tenant's wounds and will owe [damages](/compensatory-damages) to the harmed party.

Albeit the shaky tire in the above model can cause injury, the dangerous asset is the bike itself. The risk of liability and injury from a flawed asset can be limited with improved equipment checks and investing in resources to further develop maintenance and safety standards.

There is additionally an element of haphazardness to the risk an asset presents, which is at times alluded to as a [act of God](/act-god). A dangerous asset can be innately dangerous even while working as originally planned. A leased bike, a chair lift, or a heavy piece of equipment could be in every way viewed as dangerous assets since they could cause injury even when they function appropriately.

## Lessening the Liability from Dangerous Assets

Despite the fact that business owners have the risk of serious financial repercussions for the assets they own, there are methods in which the financial liability can be reduced.

### Liability Insurance

Since dangerous assets represent a risk of injury to individuals and liability risk to the business, company owners can purchase [liability insurance](/liability_insurance). Liability [insurance](/insurance) shields a company or its owner from [insurance claims](/insurance_claim) recorded against them because of wounds to individuals or damage to property.

Liability insurance pays for any financial costs that could emerge from being sued in which the insured is found obligated or legally responsible. Instances of liability insurance incorporate laborers' compensation, as well as commercial and personal liability insurance.

### Asset Protection Trust

A [asset protection trust](/asset-protection-trust) (APT) is a [trust](/trust) agreement in which the assets put inside the trust give protection from creditors, lawsuits, or decisions. Regularly, trusts are utilized during the [estate planning](/estateplanning) process, which assists with determining how an individual's assets will be distributed upon death.

An APT can hold cash, securities, real estate, equipment, and [intellectual property](/intellectualproperty, for example, a [patent](/patent). An APT can be held by a financial institution inside the owner's country or inside an international institution without offices in the insured company's jurisdiction or residence. Since an asset protection trust (APT) is a complex financial vehicle, a financial planner is typically engaged with laying out the trust.

### Limited Liability Corporation (LLC)

One more common measure taken to safeguard owners of dangerous assets is the foundation of a separate entity, for example, a [limited liability corporation](/llc) (LLC) to possess those dangerous things. Doing so safeguards the original purchasing entity from liability since the asset being referred to is technically owned by the LLC.
