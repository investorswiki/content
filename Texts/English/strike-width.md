## What Is Strike Width?

Strike width is the normal distance between the [strike prices](/strikeprice) of the options listed on different securities. For example, options might be listed on a stock with a strike width of $2.50 between strikes, while another may have a strike width of $1.00, and others $10.00 (for example, on account of a large stock index).

Strike width is generally usually associated with options strategies that incorporate spreads, for example, [credit spreads](/creditspread), butterflies, or [iron condors](/ironcondor).

## How Strike Width Works

Strike width matters in options [trading strategies](/trading-system) that depend on a spread, for example, credit spreads or iron condors. The larger the strike width, the more risk that the option [seller](/seller) is taking on. For a buyer however, the potential for greater profits exists with a larger strike width compared to one with a more modest strike width. Expanding the strike width can further develop an investor's upside potential, however generally, this means there is a greater amount of an upfront cost to the spread.

The price of an option relies upon several factors, including the price of the [underlying asset](/underlying-asset), the [implied volatility](/iv) of the option, the period of time until expiration, and [interest rates](/interestrate). [The strike price](/strikeprice) of the option addresses the price at which a put or [call option](/calloption) can be exercised. Investors selling options need to guarantee that the strike price they pick will maximize their likelihood for profit.

## Strike Width Example

Suppose an investor needs to sell a call spread in MSFT, which is trading at $100. The trader chooses to sell 1 MSFT March 100 strike [call](/call) and buy 1 MSFT March 110 strike call. The strike width is 10, which is calculated as 110 - 100. For this trade, the investor will receive credit since the call being sold is [at the money](/atthemoney) and subsequently has more value than the [out-of-the-money](/outofthemoney) (OTM) option being bought.

Presently, consider in the event that the trader sold the 100 call and buys a 130 call. The strike width is 30. Accepting similar number of options are traded (as in scenario one), the credit received will increase substantially, since the bought call is even farther of the money and costs not exactly the 110 strike option. The risk on the trade has additionally increased substantially for the seller in the subsequent scenario. The max risk in the two scenarios is the width of the spread minus the credit received.

In the subsequent scenario, the [premium](/option-premium) received is greater, so the potential profit is larger than the first, yet the risk is larger assuming that the stock continues to head higher. The main scenario has a more modest premium received than the second, however the risk is lower on the off chance that the trade doesn't work out.

> While trading option spreads, traders need to find a balance between the credit received and the risk they are taking on.
