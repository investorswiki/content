The Currency Pair EUR/USD is the abbreviated term for the euro against U.S. dollar pair, or cross for the currencies of the European Union (EU) and the United States (USD). The currency pair shows the number of U.S. dollars (the quote currency) are expected to purchase one euro (the base currency). Trading the EUR/USD currency pair is otherwise called trading the "euro." The value of the EUR/USD pair is quoted as 1 euro for each x U.S. dollars.

## Rudiments of Currency Pair: EUR/USD (Euro/U.S. Dollar)

The EUR/USD pair has turned into the most generally traded pair in the world since it addresses a combination of two of the greatest economies in the world. It is impacted by factors that influence the value of the euro as well as the U.S. dollar comparable to one another and to different currencies. Consequently, the [interest rate differential](/interest-rate-differential) between the European Central Bank (ECB) and the Federal Reserve (Fed) influences the value of these currencies when compared to one another. For instance, when the Fed mediates in open market activities to make the U.S. dollar more grounded, the value of the EUR/USD cross could decline due to a strengthening of the U.S. dollar compared to the euro. Along similar lines, terrible news from the EU economy unfavorably affects prices for the EUR/USD pair. Fresh insight about the government debt crisis and immigrant convergence in Italy and Greece brought about an euro selloff, provoking the pair's exchange rate to plunge.

## Brief History of the Euro Currency

The euro currency originated on 1992 because of the [Maastricht Treaty](/maastricht-treaty). It was initially presented as an accounting currency in 1999. On Jan. 1, 2002, the euro started circulating in member countries of the EU, and throughout several years, it turned into the accepted currency of the European Union and eventually supplanted the currencies of large numbers of its members. Thusly, the euro integrates and addresses a large number of European economies. This balances out currency exchange rates and volatility for all members of the European Union.

## Perusing an EUR/USD Price Chart

Not at all like a price chart for a stock in which the indicated price straightforwardly addresses a price for the stock, the price listed on a price chart for a currency pair addresses the [exchange rate](/exchangerate) of the two currencies. Subsequently, the directional indication of a chart compares to the base currency. Utilizing the previous model, when a trader takes a long position in the EUR/USD currency at 1.50, as the rate increases to 1.70, the euro increases in strength (as indicated in the price chart) and the U.S. dollar debilitates. Presently it takes $1.70 (more dollars) to purchase a similar euro, making the dollar more fragile or potentially the euro more grounded.

In any case, it is important to comprehend that the base currency of the pair is fixed and consistently addresses one unit. Hence, the source of the strengthening and additionally debilitating isn't reflected in the rate. The EUR/USD rate can increase on the grounds that the euro is getting more grounded or the U.S. dollar is getting more vulnerable. Either condition brings about a vertical movement in the rate (price) and a relating up movement in a price chart.
