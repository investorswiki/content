## What Is a Winner-Takes-All Market?

A winner-takes-all market alludes to an economy where the best entertainers are able to capture an extremely large share of the available rewards, while the excess contenders are left with very little.

Models incorporate countries with robust social welfare systems like the Scandinavian countries. The potential downside is that those systems give less overall expected benefit to winners since wealth is all the more equally rearranged among all.
