## Volume

[Volume](/volume) is one market factor that can influence the price of a security. Volume is defined by the number of shares of a security traded over a predetermined period of time. Generally, traders will watch the volume of a security from one day to another, alluding to days when a price diminishes as down volume days.

There are several factors that can influence volume. Down volume days are commonly influenced by negative news about a stock straightforwardly or news impacting the stock by implication. Lower than expected earnings reports or negative news about a company's sales, management, or management choices can cause a high volume of trades in what might be known as a [selloff](/auction).

In a selloff, the majority of volume trading is to the downside, meaning investors are quickly selling versus buying which adversely affects price. Generally, high-volume days can be intensely influenced by noise traders who are non-proficient traders that will quite often trade all the more frequently when high profile news about a company is delivered. Trading from noise traders can cause more uncommon negative effects on the stock than needed, which can on occasion set out a buy freedom from overselling.

There are several indicators traders can watch to decipher volume and grasp its effects on a security's price. Three of the most well known indicators are [volume weighted average price](/vwap) (VWAP), [Positive Volume Index](/pvi) (PVI) and [Negative Volume Index](/nvi) (NVI).

The volume weighted average price is a trendline drawn from a moving average of the following calculation:

VWAP = (Security Shares Bought x Security Share Price)/Security Shares Bought

Traders monitoring volume's influence on price will normally look for a VWAP cross. At the point when a VWAP cross spikes to the downside and crosses over a security's [candlestick](/candlestick) pattern it is an indication of down volume selling. In the event that this pattern is recognized it very well may be an early indicator of a bearish trend in a security's price. Traders normally look to benefit from this signal by selling to exploit a falling price.

## PVI and NVI

The Positive and Negative Volume Indexes (PVI and NVI) were first developed by Paul Dysart in 1936 to assist investors with knowing a portion of the effects of market trading volume. PVI and NVI then turned out to be more well known during the 1970s after the calculations were expanded to individual securities.

PVI: If current volume is greater than the previous day's volume, PVI = Previous PVI + {[(Today's Closing Price-Yesterday's Closing Price)/Yesterday's Closing Price)] x Previous PVI}. In the event that current volume is lower than the previous day's volume, PVI is unchanged.

NVI: If current volume is not exactly the previous day's volume, NVI = Previous NVI + {[(Today's Closing Price-Yesterday's Closing Price)/Yesterday's Closing Price)] x Previous NVI}. Assuming current volume is higher than the previous day's volume, NVI is unchanged.

These index values give understanding on how prices are fluctuating with trading volume. In an up volume trend, PVI would trend higher as volume increased. In this way, investors seeking to profit on bullish up volume trading could involve the PVI as one indicator for potential price signals.
