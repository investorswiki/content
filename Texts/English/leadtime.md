# Lead Time
## What Is Lead Time?

Lead time is the amount of time that elapses from the very beginning of an interaction until its decision. Companies survey lead time in [manufacturing,](/manufacturing) [supply chain management](/scm), and [project management](/project-management) during pre-processing, processing, and post-processing stages. By comparing results against laid out benchmarks, they can determine where inefficiencies exist.

Reducing lead time can [streamline operations](/operations-management) and further develop productivity, increasing output and [revenue](/revenue). On the other hand, longer lead times negatively influence sales and manufacturing processes.

## Understanding Lead Time

Production processes and [inventory management](/inventory-management) can influence lead time. With respect to production, building all components of a finished product on location might take more time than completing a few things offsite. Transportation issues can defer delivery of essential parts, halting or slowing production and reducing output and [return on investment](/returnoninvestment) (ROI).

Using privately obtained parts and labor can abbreviate lead time and speed production, and offsite sub-gatherings can save extra time. Reducing production time permits companies to increase production during periods of high demand. Speedier production can increase sales, customer satisfaction, and the company's [bottom line](/bottomline).

Efficient inventory management is important to maintain production timetables and fulfill consumer need. Stockouts happen when inventory, or stock, is inaccessible preventing the satisfaction of a customer's order or product assembly. Production stops in the event that an organization misjudges the amount of stock required or neglects to place a recharging order and providers can't renew materials right away. This can be exorbitant for a company's main concern.

One solution is to utilize a vendor-oversaw inventory (VMI) program, which gives automated stock recharging. These programs frequently come from an off-site provider, using [just-in-time](/jit) (JIT) inventory management for ordering and delivering parts in view of utilization.

## Special Considerations

The lead time fluctuates among [supply chain](/supplychain) sources, causing difficulty in predicting when to anticipate the delivery of things and coordinating production. Much of the time the outcome is overabundance inventory, which places a strain on a company's budget.

Lead time scheduling considers the receipt of essential parts to show up together, and diminishes shipping and receiving costs. Some lead time delays can't be anticipated. Shipping checks due to [raw material shortages](/rawmaterials), natural fiascos, human mistake, and other wild issues will influence lead time. For critical parts, a company might utilize a backup provider to maintain production. Working with a provider who keeps inventory close by while continuously monitoring a company's use mitigates the issues resulting from unanticipated occasions.

Stockpiling important parts might be cost-restrictive, however reducing the number of [surplus](/surplus) parts likewise helps place a ceiling on production costs. One solution is for companies to utilize kitting services to arrange their inventory. With kitting services, inventory things are gathered in light of their specific use in the project. Workers save time choosing from more modest heaps of parts, keeping production more organized and efficient.

## Illustration of Lead Time

Imagine a large celebration that happens during the principal seven day stretch of August each year that draws in 100,000 individuals on average and ordinarily sells 15,000 celebration T-shirts. The [vendor](/vendor) that supplies the T-shirts needs one business day to complete the shirt design, one business day to have it sealed and make any essential fixes, one business day to print the shirts, and two business days to ship the things. The lead time in this model would be five business days. At the end of the day, the celebration coordinators need to place their order with the T-shirt provider no less than five business days before the opening of the celebration in order to get the shirts on time.

Of course, that lead time can be abbreviated in a few extreme circumstances assuming the buyer is willing to pay a [premium](/premium). On the off chance that T-shirt sales on the primary day of the celebration surpass expectations, celebration coordinators might conclude to order extra shirts on the second day with the hope that they can be delivered by the third day. Since the shirts have previously been designed and approved, that means five days of lead time can be diminished to three. To meet that abbreviated lead time, the vendor would have to print the extra shirts as fast as conceivable in order to ship them overnight for delivery the following morning.

Extra factors can influence lead time in this model. On the off chance that celebration coordinators need a certain percentage of the T-shirts to be fuchsia and the vendor doesn't routinely keep fuchsia T-shirts in stock, that can increase the lead time in light of the fact that the vendor should order shirts in that tone.

## Highlights
- Lead time measures what amount of time it requires to complete an interaction from beginning to end.
- Now and again, companies can further develop lead times by implementing automated stock renewal and just-in-time (JIT) strategies.
- Factors that can impact lead time include lack of raw materials, breakdown of transportation, labor deficiencies, natural catastrophes, and human errors.
- In manufacturing, lead time frequently addresses the time it takes to make a product and deliver it to a consumer.
