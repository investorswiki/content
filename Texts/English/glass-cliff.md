## What Is a Glass Cliff?

The term "glass cliff" alludes to a situation where ladies are elevated to higher positions during times of crisis or duress, or during a [recession](/recession) whenever the chance of failure is more probable. Put essentially, ladies in these situations are set up for failure. The term was authored by researchers at the University of Exeter, United Kingdom who distributed research on the 100 companies remembered for the [Financial Times Stock Exchange](/ftse) (FTSE) 100 Index. These researchers found that elevating ladies to higher positions frequently accompanies negative ramifications. furthermore, that being set up for failure is the equivalent of standing on the edge of a cliff. Assuming they fail, they fall off.

## Understanding a Glass Cliff

The glass cliff happens in various fields, including [finance](/finance), politics, technology, and the scholarly world. it tends to the inclination to advance ladies into problematic situations, whether that is organizational or situational. This makes it more probable that their performance will vacillate. The representation of the glass cliff is that ladies in this position are at risk of falling off a cliff and failing.

There are many motivations behind why ladies are elevated to more unsafe leadership jobs than men. One is the thought that a striving company will probably result in a more limited [upper management](/upper-management) tenure so the position itself is risky. Putting a lady in that position gives the company somebody to fault in the event that she fails to pull the company out of its downward spiral.

"In times of crisis, companies would rather not risk the loss of who they accept to be their most valuable, high-expected ability — white men. In difficult stretches, they are bound to sacrifice employees who they see as not so much valued but rather more dispensable — ladies and racial minorities," as per [chief executive officer](/ceo) (CEO) of Pinsight and creator Martin Lanik, CEO of Pinsight.

It likewise does right by the company. On the off chance that the lady fails, the company is marked as being progressive and is free to replace her with a man. On the off chance that she succeeds, the company is better off and may even assume praise for appointing the right person to make it happen. Even with the high chance of failure, a glass cliff position can be hard to turn down since leadership jobs are so rarely offered to ladies.

However, ladies aren't generally welcome in these casual [social networks](/social-networking) so they pass up these associations.

> Albeit the glass cliff normally alludes to the deterrents that ladies face, the term is likewise commonly used to depict the difficulties minorities and other minimized bunches face when they are elevated to leadership jobs in the workplace.

## History of the Glass Cliff

In 2004, University of Exeter researchers Michelle K. Ryan, Julie S. Ashby, and Alexander Haslam concentrated on the 100 companies remembered for the FTSE 100 Index, which comprises of the 100 companies listed on the [London Stock Exchange](/lse) (LSE) with the highest [market capitalizations](/marketcapitalization).

As per the researchers, companies that appointed ladies to their boards were bound to perform ineffectively in the previous five months. They guaranteed that sexism roused people with great influence to appoint ladies to these unstable positions since they would rather not risk discoloring a conspicuous man's reputation with failure.

Ryan, Ashby, and Haslam followed up their research with one more study including law understudies, which was distributed in an article called, "Legitimate Work and the Glass Cliff: Evidence that Women are Preferentially Selected to Lead Problematic Cases." That's what they found:

- Male up-and-comers were just basically as possible as females to be chosen as lead counsel for okay cases

These investors explicitly buy shares determined to coordinate management choices and must register with the [Securities and Exchange Commission](/sec) (SEC), as per Vishal K. Gupta, Sandra Mortal, and Daniel B. Turban. That's what their discoveries revealed:

>
> "...firms in our sample drove by male CEOs were targeted by an activist 6% of the time during the study period, versus 9.4% when the CEO was female. Wolf pack assaults happened for male and female CEOs at 1% and 1.6%, individually. Even however these differences show up small, this means that organizations with female CEOs were half bound to be targeted by activists and roughly 60% bound to be targeted by different activists."

## Impact of a Glass Cliff

Ladies as of now face numerous barriers when they are attempting to scale the [corporate ladder](/corporate-ladder) and enter leadership jobs. A similar scenario is likewise true for different minorities, like minorities.

Assuming that an individual is advanced with next to no sort of organizational support or development, it might bring about the illusion of progressiveness or inclusivity for the company when, in reality, that individual is being tokenized as a minority.

At the point when a female leader or a person of variety at last doesn't save a failing company, they generally leave the company and make more disruption. What's more, assuming these individuals fail, it further reinforces the generalizations that exist about ladies and minorities in leadership.
