# Lock-Up Period
## What is a Lock-Up Period?

A lock-up period is a window of time when investors are not allowed to reclaim or sell shares of a specific investment. There are two principal utilizes for lock-up periods, those for [hedge funds](/hedgefund) and those for new companies/Ipo's.

For hedge funds, the lock-up period is planned to give the hedge fund manager time to exit investments that might be illiquid or in any case unbalance their portfolio of investments too quickly. Hedge fund lock-ups are regularly 30-90 days, giving the hedge fund manager time to exit investments without driving prices against their overall portfolio.

It likewise allows the IPO issuer to hold more cash for continuing growth.

## How a Lock-Up Period Works

The lock-up period for hedge funds corresponds with the underlying investments of each fund. For instance, a [long/shortfund](/long-shortequity) invested for the most part in liquid stocks might have a one-month lock-up period. Notwithstanding, in light of the fact that event-driven or hedge funds frequently invest in additional thinly traded securities like distressed loans or other debt, they will generally have drawn out lock-up periods. In any case, other hedge funds might have no lockup period at all relying upon the structure of the fund's investments.

At the point when the lock-up period closes, investors might recover their shares according to a set schedule, frequently quarterly. They typically must give a 30-to 90-day notice so the fund manager might liquidate underlying securities that allow for payment to the investors.

During the lock-up period, a hedge fund manager might invest in securities according to the fund's objectives without concern for share redemption. The manager possesses energy for building strong situations in different assets and boosting expected gains while keeping less cash close by. Without a lock-up period and scheduled redemption schedule, a hedge fund manager would require a great amount of cash or cash equivalents accessible consistently. Less money would be invested, and returns might be lower. Likewise, in light of the fact that every investor's lock-up period fluctuates by his personal investment date, enormous liquidation can't happen for some random fund at one time.

Assuming business insiders sold their shares to the public, apparently the business isn't worth investing in, and stock prices and demand would go down.

At the point when a privately held company starts the most common way of opening up to the world, key employees may received decreased cash compensation in exchange for shares of the company's stock. A significant number of these employees might need to cash in their shares as fast as conceivable after the company opens up to the world. The lock-up period prevents stock from being sold following the IPO when share prices might be falsely high and helpless to extreme price volatility.
