# Diluted Earnings per Share (Diluted EPS)
## What Are Diluted Earnings Per Share?
Diluted earnings per share alludes to a company's per-share profit in view of the number of common shares outstanding and the common shares that might be changed over from different securities assuming that those securities were worked out.
## What Is the Difference Between Basic and Diluted Earnings Per Share?
Fundamental [earnings per share](/essential earnings-per-share) just accounts for the number of [outstanding common shares](/outstandingshares) for the period, while diluted earnings accounts for all common shares including those that may possibly be changed over from different securities.
## The most effective method to Calculate Diluted Earnings Per Share
Diluted earnings per share can be calculated by partitioning [net income](/netincome) by the number of common shares assuming all warrants and stock options were practiced and all convertible bonds and [preferred stock](/preferredstock) were changed over. In the event that a company reported a loss for the period, the loss would be isolated by all common shares, including those possibly dilutive securities that are outstanding.

### Diluted Earnings Per Share Formula
Diluted Earnings Per Share = Net Income Attributable to Common Stockholders/(Weighted Average of Common Shares Outstanding in the Period + [Warrants + Stock Options + Convertible Bonds + Preferred Stock That Can Potentially Converted Into Common Shares])
## Diluted Earnings Per Share Example: Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL)
In the model below for Apple, the diluted earnings per share isn't vastly different in price from the essential figure. Apple's calculation for diluted earnings shows a marginally higher number of common shares outstanding, including those that can be changed over from securities, even however it didn't give a breakdown.

## Why Are Diluted Earnings Per Share Important?
Diluted earnings per share is important in light of the fact that it is the accepted earnings number on which analysts would distribute gauges and with which investors and analysts compute earnings ratios, including [price-to-earnings ratios](/price-earningsratio).
It shows up at the bottom of the [income statement](/incomestatement) and is probably going to be the last thing, following fundamental earnings per share. For publicly traded companies, the income statement can be found in the financial statement recorded quarterly and yearly with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

## Features
- Changing over these securities diminishes EPS, consequently, diluted EPS will in general forever be lower than EPS.
- Dilutive securities aren't common stock, however rather securities that can be switched over completely to common stock.
- Dilutive EPS is viewed as a conservative metric since it shows a most dire outcome imaginable in terms of EPS.
- Diluted earnings per share (diluted EPS) computes a company's earnings per share in the event that all convertible securities were changed over.
