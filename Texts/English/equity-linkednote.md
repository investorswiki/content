# Equity-Linked Note (ELN)
## What Is an Equity-Linked Note (ELN)?

An equity-linked note (ELN) is an investment product that joins a fixed-income investment with extra potential returns that are tied to the performance of equities. Equity-linked notes are normally structured to return the initial investment with a variable interest portion that relies upon the performance of the linked equity. ELNs can be structured in a wide range of ways, however the vanilla form works like a [strip bond](/stripbond) combined with a [call option](/calloption) on a specific security, a basket of securities or an index like the S&P 500 or [DJIA](/djia). On account of a note linked to an equity index, the security would typically be called an equity index-linked note.

## Understanding Equity-Linked Notes

Equity-linked notes give a way to investors to safeguard their capital while likewise getting the potential for a better than expected return compared to standard bonds. In theory, the upside potential for returns in an equity-linked note is unlimited, while the downside risk is capped. Even in the worst situation imaginable, most equity-linked notes offer full principal protection. That makes this type of a structured product interesting to [risk-averse](/riskaverse) investors who by and by have a bullish outlook on the market. All things considered, equity-linked notes just pay on maturity, so there is a [opportunity cost](/opportunitycost) for securing in that money if by some stroke of good luck the principal is returned eventually.

## How ELN Work

In the least difficult form, a $1,000 5-year equity-linked note could be structured to utilize $800 of the fund to buy a 5-year strip bond with a 4.5% respect maturity and afterward invest and reinvest the other $200 in call options for the S&P 500 over the 5-year life of the note. Quite possibly the options will terminate worthless, in which case the investor gets back the $1,000 initially put in. On the off chance that, nonetheless, the options value in value with the S&P 500, those returns are added to the $1,000 that will eventually be returned to the investor.

## Equity Linked Note Caps, Participation Rates, and Leverage

In practice, an equity-linked note will have a [participation rate](/participationrate), which is the percentage amount that the investor in the note partakes in the appreciation of the underlying equity. On the off chance that the participation rate is 100%, a 5% increase in the underlying is a 5% increase for the eventual payout on the note. Be that as it may, the cost of organizing the ELN and overseeing it can bring down the participation rate. On account of a 75% participation rate, for instance, a 5% appreciation in the underlying is simply worth 3.75% to the investor.

Equity-linked notes can likewise utilize various designs and highlights. Some will utilize an averaging formula to streamline returns on the equity-linked portion or a periodic cap that limits the ELN's upside by acknowledging returns at a specific level consistently. There are likewise types of equity-linked notes that utilization dynamic hedging rather than options, conveying leverage to increase returns from the underlying equity. Overall, equity-linked notes can be an amazing asset for investors who need to safeguard their principle while as yet having the likely upside of an equity investment.
