## What Is a Dark Pool?

A dark pool is a privately organized financial forum or exchange for trading securities. Dark pools permit institutional investors to trade without exposure until after the trade has been executed and reported. Dark pools are a type of [alternative trading system](/alternative-trading-system) (ATS) that offers certain investors the chance to place large orders and make trades without publicly uncovering their intentions during the quest for a buyer or seller.

## Figuring out the Dark Pool

Dark pools arose during the 1980s when the [Securities and Exchange Commission](/sec) (SEC) permitted brokers to execute large blocks of shares. Electronic trading and a SEC ruling in 2005 that was intended to increase competition and cut transaction costs have animated an increase in the number of dark pools. Dark pools can charge lower fees than exchanges since they are in many cases housed inside a large firm and not really a bank.

For instance, Bloomberg LP possesses the dark pool Bloomberg Tradebook, which is registered with the SEC. Dark pools were initially for the most part involved by institutional investors for [block trades](/blocktrade) including a large number of securities. Be that as it may, dark pools are not generally utilized exclusively for large orders. A 2013 report by Celent found that because of block orders moving to dark pools, the average order size dropped around half, from 430 shares in 2009 to roughly 200 shares in four years.

The primary advantage of dark pool trading is that institutional investors making large trades can do as such without exposure while tracking down buyers and sellers. This forestalls heavy price devaluation, which would somehow happen. Assuming that it were public information, for instance, that an investment bank was attempting to sell 500,000 shares of a security, the security would very likely have diminished in value when the bank found buyers for their shares in general. Devaluation has turned into an inexorably logical risk, and electronic trading platforms are making prices answer significantly more rapidly to market pressures. Assuming that the new data is reported solely after the trade has been executed, in any case, the news an affects the market.

## Dark Pools and High-Frequency Trading

With the approach of supercomputers capable of executing algorithmic-based programs throughout just milliseconds, [high-frequency trading](/high-frequency-trading) (HFT) has come to rule daily trading volume. HFT technology permits institutional traders to execute their orders of multimillion-share blocks ahead of different investors, exploiting fractional upticks or downticks in share prices. At the point when subsequent orders are executed, profits are quickly gotten by HFT traders who then, at that point, close out their positions. This form of legal piracy can happen many times a day, harvesting gigantic gains for HFT traders.

In the end, HFT turned out to be unavoidable to the point that it became progressively challenging to execute large trades through a single exchange. Since large HFT orders must be spread among various exchanges, it cautioned trading contenders who could then get in front of the order and grab up the inventory, driving up share prices. All of this happened inside milliseconds of the initial order being placed.

To keep away from the transparency of public exchanges and guarantee liquidity for large block trades, several of the investment banks laid out private exchanges, which came to be known as dark pools. For traders with large orders who are unable to place them on the public exchanges, or need to try not to broadcast their intent, dark pools give a market of buyers and sellers with the liquidity to execute the trade. As of Feb. 28, 2022, there were 64 dark pools operating in the United States, run generally by investment banks.

## Investigates of Dark Pools

Albeit considered legal, dark pools are able to operate with little transparency. The people who have reproved HFT as an unfair advantage over different investors have likewise denounced the lack of transparency in dark pools, which can conceal irreconcilable situations. Due to grumblings, the SEC directed research and introduced their 2015 report, examining dark pools for illegal front-running when institutional traders place their order in front of a client's order to capitalize on the uptick in share prices. Supporters of dark pools demand they give essential liquidity, permitting the markets to operate all the more productively.

## Instances of Dark Pools

There are several unique types of dark pools: broker or seller owned exchanges, for example, Morgan Stanley's MS Pool and Goldman Sachs' Sigma X; autonomously owned exchanges offering private trading to their clients; and private exchange markets operated by public exchanges, for example, the [New York Stock Exchange's](/nyse) Euronext. A privately-owned market will have [price discovery](/pricediscovery) inside their own markets, however a dark pool operated by a broker gets its prices from public exchanges.

In light of their evil name and lack of transparency, dark pools are many times considered by the public to be questionable ventures. In reality, dark pools are firmly regulated by the SEC. Notwithstanding, there is a real concern that in light of the sheer volume of trades directed on dark markets, the public values of certain securities are progressively unreliable or erroneous. There is additionally mounting concern that dark pool exchanges give incredible grain to predatory high-frequency trading.

## Highlights
