Government leaders of these countries meet intermittently to address international economic and monetary issues, with every member taking over the administration on a rotating basis.

The G-7 was, for some time, known as the [Group of Eight](/g8) (G-8), until 2014 when former member Russia was eliminated in the wake of annexing the region of Crimea illegally from Ukraine. The [European Union](/europeanunion) (EU) is some of the time viewed as a true eighth member of the G-7 since it holds every one of the rights and obligations of full members but to chair or host meetings.

## How the Group of Seven (G-7) Works

The major purpose of the G-7 is to examine and some of the time act in show to help resolve [global problems](/un-global-compact), with a special spotlight on economic issues.

## History of the Group of Seven (G-7)

The origins of the group date back to the mid 1970s, when leaders of the U.S., U.K., France, West Germany, and Japan met casually in Paris to examine the then [recession](/recession) and oil crisis. That, thusly, propelled French President Val\u00e9ry Giscard d'Estaing to welcome the leaders of those countries, plus Italy, to Rambouillet in 1975 for additional conversations on global oil, this time with the country's leaders joining the finance priests — an attendance program that has persevered. The next year, Canada was welcome to join the group.

The host of the G7 highest point, otherwise called the administration, turns every year among member countries in the following order: France, United States, United Kingdom, Germany, Japan, Italy, and Canada.

### Expansion to G-8

The G-7 has answered as the global economy has developed, including when the Soviet Union pledged to make an economy with [freer markets](/freemarket) and held its most memorable direct presidential election in 1991. Following a 1994 G-7 meeting in Naples, President Boris Yeltsin held meetings with G-7 member countries, in what became known as the P-8 (Political 8). In 1998, in the wake of urging from leaders including U.S. President Bill Clinton, Russia was added to the G-7 as a full member, creating a proper Group of Eight, or G-8.

The G-8 ended up being brief. In 2014, Russia was suspended from the group after the addition of Crimea and pressures in Ukraine. Starting around 2021, Russia has not been welcomed back to the G-7.

## The Group of Seven (G-7) versus the Group of 20 (G-20)

In response, the [Group of 20](/g-20) (G-20) was made in 1999, comprising every one of the members of the G-7, plus 12 extra countries and the EU. As the economies and trade activity of markets like China, Brazil, India, Mexico, and South Africa — all G-20 members — surge, numerous onlookers currently view the G-20 as usurping a large part of the job and distinction once held by the G-7.
