# Target-Risk Fund
## What Is a Target-Risk Fund?

A target-risk fund is a type of investment fund with a portfolio [asset allocation](/aaf) that holds a diversified mix of stocks, bonds, and different investments to make an ideal [risk profile](/risk-profile). The fund manager of a target-risk fund is responsible for supervising every one of the securities owned inside the fund to guarantee that the level of risk isn't greater or not exactly the fund's target-risk exposure.

## Understanding Target-Risk Funds

Target-risk funds regularly label themselves as, for example, "conservative," "moderate risk" or "aggressive" in terms of their risk exposure so investors can make heads or tails of the target risk level. No matter what the label applied, the intent is to offer a moderately consistent level of risk exposure to investors.

Target-risk funds permit investors to change their level of risk exposure all through their lives. These funds can have a [glide path](/glide-path) that changes the target risk exposure after some time. Frequently, investors target more risk or volatility when they are youthful yet look to reduce their risk exposure as they progress in years and nearer to retirement.

Ordinarily, investors put their money into more aggressive target risk funds from the get-go in their investing lifecycles and center around developing their assets, while more established investors will generally push toward additional conservative allocations to safeguard their assets as retirement develops nearer.
