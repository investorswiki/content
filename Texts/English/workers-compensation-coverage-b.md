# Workers' Compensation Coverage B
## What Is Workers' Compensation Coverage B?

Workers' Compensation Coverage B is an insurance policy that covers medical care, lost income, and rehabilitation costs for employees who are harmed at work. It gives coverage to employees when the employer is at risk.

## How Workers' Compensation Coverage B Works

Workers' Compensation Coverage B is likewise called employers' liability coverage. Employers are required by state and federal statutes to give coverage to their employees. Corporate insurance buyers get [workers' compensation insurance](/workers-compensation) to safeguard their workers and meet state insurance requirements. Part B incorporates the two distinct parts of most standard Workers' Compensation contracts: [parts A](/workers-compensation-coverage-a) and B.

Part A fulfills state insurance requirements, and Part B will answer pay extra damages. The policy will fund employees' medical bills, related expenses and lost wages on account of a covered workers' compensation loss. Payments are made normally founded on foreordained plans on account of defined wounds. Expenses are paid appropriately as the adjuster computes them. It covers:

- Real injury by accident: $100,000 every accident.
- Real injury by disease: $500,000 policy limit.
- Real injury by disease: $100,000 for every employee.

Under Workers' Compensation Coverage B, workers who are harmed at work can be given 100% coverage of all [medical expenses](/medical-expenses), a percentage of lost wages (which changes by state and policy), a lump sum for disability and deformation, and a [death benefit](/deathbenefit). This coverage is required in many states in the event that a company has at least three employees, including the owners of uninsured subcontractors, plus their employees for one year.

## Special Considerations

There are important things to recollect while investigating Workers' Compensation coverage. It's important to ensure that Part B employers' liability is fittingly scheduled on your corporate umbrella. As referenced before, employer negligence claims can be large, in this way the umbrella policy can sit on top of a normal $1,000,000 primary limit. Furthermore, in the event that a business dwells in a monopolistic state like Ohio (WC given by the state), you should buy the employers' liability normally from your overall liability provider as an endorsement.

## Illustration of Workers' Compensation Coverage B

On account of an employee injury and potential employer negligence, Part B will answer pay extra damages. These payments are normally contested and set off by a serious injury proven to be brought about by employer negligence. For Instance, an employee sees a flawed or uncovered wire on a production machine and tells their employer. The employer (for reasons unknown) doesn't fix the wire and the employee is shocked. Employers' liability would answer on account of the employee (or their family) to pay a claim far in excess of the normal Part A statutory amount. It is normally sanctioned by a claim.
