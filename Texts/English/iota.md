# IOTA (MIOTA)
## What Is IOTA?

IOTA (MIOTA) is a [distributed ledger](/distributed-ledgers) designed to record and execute transactions among machines and gadgets in the Internet of Things (IoT) ecosystem. The ledger utilizes a [cryptocurrency](/cryptocurrency) called MIOTA to account for transactions in its network. IOTA's key innovation is [Tangle](/tangle-cryptocurrency), a system of nodes utilized for affirming transactions. IOTA claims that Tangle is quicker and more efficient than run of the mill blockchains utilized in cryptocurrencies.

The IOTA Foundation, the nonprofit foundation responsible for the ledger, has inked agreements with conspicuous companies, like Bosch and Volkswagen, to broaden the stage's utility among associated gadgets.

## Figuring out IOTA

Billions of gadgets were associated with the Internet by 2020. Inside this Internet of Things ([IoT](/internet-things)) ecosystem, gadgets can exchange data and payment data with multiple different gadgets in transactions led over the course of the day.

IOTA expects to turn into the standard mode of managing transactions on gadgets. Its founders have depicted the ledger as a "public consent less spine for the Internet of Things that enables interoperability between multiple gadgets." In simple terms, this means that it will enable transactions between associated gadgets, and anybody will actually want to access it.

IOTA's founders claim that it takes care of multiple problems tormenting cryptocurrencies that are developed on standard blockchains. These problems incorporate the centralization of [mining](/bitcoin-mining) to a specific group, low network speeds, and [scalability](/scalability). For cryptocurrencies, scalability alludes to the problem of expanding the number of transactions handled by a blockchain without influencing different metrics.

Those problems are fundamentally caused due to a backlog of transactions on Bitcoin's blockchain. The backlog itself is due to various reasons, from small block sizes to the difficulty of riddles that excavators must tackle to earn the cryptocurrency as a reward. IOTA takes care of these problems by reconfiguring the blockchain architecture into Tangle, a better approach for sorting out data and affirming transactions.

## History of IOTA

Sergey Ivancheglo, Serguei Popov, David S\u00f8nsteb\u00f8, and Dominik Schiener, who joined later, together helped to establish IOTA.

The project was announced in October 2015 through a post declaring a token sale in an online bitcoin forum. The underlying foundations of IOTA return to the Jinn project. That project planned to foster ternary hardware or low-cost and energy-efficient hardware, principally broadly useful processors, for use in the IoT ecosystem. Jinn held a crowd sale for its tokens in September 2014. Roughly 100,000 tokens were sold during the crowd sale, amounting to collections of $250,000.

The Jinn tokens were soon in serious trouble since they were marketed as profit-sharing tokens, which may be viewed as security tokens. [Initial coin offerings](/initial-coin-offering-ico) (ICOs) were all the while gaining foothold around then, and there was no lucidity about their regulatory status. In 2015, Jinn was rebranded as IOTA, and another token sale was held. The tokens were marketed as utility tokens this time around. Jinn token holders could exchange their tokens at equivalency in the new system. As per David S\u00f8nsteb\u00f8, IOTA was "generated" due to the Jinn project, "so it just checks out first to present IOTA and afterward Jinn a while later," he said.

The genesis transaction for IOTA was an address with a balance that contained all MIOTA, its cryptocurrency, that will at any point be mined. However, reports state that a snapshot of the genesis transaction is yet to be found online. These tokens were spread to other "founder" addresses. The total number of MIOTAs planned to be in presence is 27 quadrillion. As per IOTA's founders, the total number of MIOTAs fits in "pleasantly" with the maximum allowable integer value in JavaScript, a programming language. In something like three months of its presentation on cryptocurrency markets, mIOTA arrived at a pinnacle valuation of $14.5 billion during the 2016-2017 bull market. Notwithstanding, its value later crashed alongside most other cryptocurrencies.

## Worries About IOTA

Analysis of IOTA has primarily based on its technical blemishes. Similarly as with most cryptocurrencies, IOTA's system is incipient and problematic. A phishing attack on its network brought about the theft of MIOTA worth $3.94 million. In response to the attack, the IOTA development team composed a blog entry framing steps to produce a strong seed for utilizing its cryptocurrency.

IOTA's designers should have "rolled" their crypto. All in all, they made their encryption method without any preparation, renouncing the broadly utilized SHA-256 hash function utilized in Bitcoin. The team at MIT's Digital Currency Initiative found serious weaknesses with IOTA's hash function, which is called Curl. The function delivered a similar output when it was given two unique data sources. This property is known as collision and signifies a broken hash function. In their analysis of the vulnerability, the MIT team stated that a troublemaker might have obliterated or taken client funds from Tangle with their technique. IOTA's team has revised the vulnerability.

There are possible issues with IOTA's claims to kill scalability problems for blockchains using DAGs. Vitalik Buterin, the fellow benefactor of Ethereum, feels quite doubtful on the ability of hashgraphs (the underlying data structures for DAG) to settle scalability issues. As he makes sense of it, current variants of hashgraphs don't tackle for a blockchain's dependency on computer memory and processing power. The scalability of a system utilizing hashgraphs still relies upon the capacity and speed of individual computers inside its network.

Starting around 2020, IOTA's network utilized a central server known as a Coordinator to guarantee transaction security. This practice has diluted its claims of being a decentralized system starting from the presentation of a Coordinator has brought about the presentation of a single point of disappointment. It has likewise slowed down the network's speed since parallel processing doesn't happen in a Coordinator-based system. In any case, the IOTA Foundation had a plan called "The Coordicide" to eliminate the Coordinator later on.

## Eventual fate of IOTA

In spite of the fact that IOTA's [market capitalization](/marketcapitalization) was still down substantially from its 2017 highs, this cryptocurrency's fortunes gave indications of working on by late 2020. It began 2020 with a market capitalization of $446 million and was above $900 million as of Dec. 19, 2020. That is a gain of more than 100%, however it was a rough road. IOTA's proceeded with partnership with large corporations and spotlight on the developing Internet of Things (IoT) likewise help to set it separated from other cryptocurrencies and produce investor interest. It is by all accounts working in light of the fact that as of Sept. 28, 2021, IOTA's market cap is around $3.2 billion.

## How Is IOTA Different From Bitcoin?

IOTA's solution to Bitcoin's problems is to get rid of several key concepts and topographical imperatives of a blockchain. MIOTA, IOTA's cryptocurrency, is [premined](/premining) and consensus of transactions happens diversely compared to a blockchain. IOTA engineers have proposed another data structure (a method for coordinating numeric portrayals inside a computer's memory) known as Tangle.

Tangle is a Decentralized Acyclic Graph (DAG), a system of nodes that isn't sequential. In this manner, every node can be associated with multiple different nodes in a Tangle. In any case, they are associated exclusively in a specific bearing, implying that a node can't allude back to itself. A standard blockchain is likewise a DAG since it is a sequential linked set. However, IOTA's Tangle is a parallel system wherein transactions can be handled at the same time rather than sequentially. As additional systems are joined to it, the Tangle turns out to be safer and efficient at processing transactions.

In Bitcoin, a group of systems running full nodes that contain the whole history of transactions for a ledger are required for affirmations and consensus. This interaction is energy — and calculation — escalated.

Full node excavators are not required in Tangle. Each new transaction is confirmed by referring to two previous transactions, lessening the amount of time and memory expected to check a transaction. An effectively solvable and clear Proof of Work ([PoW](/proof-work)) puzzle is added to the transaction as a last step. The two transactions that are picked are alluded to as tips. IOTA's system utilizes a tip selection algorithm with "confidence" as a measure to endorse the transaction. Assume a transaction has been approved 97 times in the past. Then, at that point, there is 97% confidence that a node will support it later on.
Related to the concept of "confidence" is a transaction's weight. As it travels through Tangle, a transaction assembles weight. A transaction's weight increments with the number of endorsements. When a transaction is confirmed, it is broadcast to the whole network. Then, another unconfirmed transaction can pick the recently confirmed transaction as one of the tips to affirm itself.

This method of affirming a transaction brings about no fees and low power consumption, empowering MIOTA to be utilized across a wide assortment of gadgets and machines with various power requirements.
