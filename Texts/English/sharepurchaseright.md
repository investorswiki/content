# Share Purchase Rights
## What Are Share Purchase Rights?

A [share](/shares) repurchase right in a financial contract gives the right holder the option, yet not the obligation, to purchase (or repurchase) a foreordained number of shares at a foreordained price.

## Understanding Share Purchase Rights

A share purchase right is like a [stock option](/stockoption) or warrant on a stock. These rights are typically distributed to existing shareholders, who can trade these rights on a [exchange](/exchange). Share purchase rights just give [shareholders](/shareholder) the ability to purchase the shares, yet they must in any case pay for the shares to recover the rights.

Like a [preemptive right](/preemptiveright), a share repurchase right might carry a certain amount of weight with investors who don't need their equity investment in an entity [diluted](/dilution) by the expansion of a company's equity base. Investors possessing a series of share repurchase rights successfully have a call option to re-merge their proportional stake in a business. This can be important for investors wanting a control position.

Share repurchase rights are typically tied to an equity valuation incentive program. For example, to spur central or establishing management teams, a certain number of [common shares](/commonstock) that have been distributed to outer shareholders may be packaged as part of a repurchase plan. Here, a company's establishing management team may be boosted to outperform so they can repurchase (or [clawback](/clawback)) equity shares sold during a financing round.

On the off chance that a company has critical debt, it might issue out share purchase rights and utilize the funds to pay part of the debt. On account of startups, profits are delayed to understand, and acquiring funding from banks can be troublesome. Companies can issue out share purchase rights to create the funding they need.

## Share Purchase Right versus Share Purchase Plan

Albeit comparable in name, a share repurchase right ought not be mistaken for a [share repurchase plan](/sharerepurchase) or what is much of the time basically called stock buybacks. A share repurchase plan is a dedicated program a corporation uses to buy back its own shares in the [open market](/open-market). This generally happens when a company feels its shares are undervalued in the market.

All the more as of late, these programs have experienced harsh criticism for possibly engineering unnecessary executive compensation schemes.

## Illustration of Share Purchase Right Application

Company XYZ is a startup with another product. The company offers its stakeholders purchasing rights for shares in the product to raise required financing. The shareholders who utilize their rights to buy extra shares profit when the product goes to market and is fruitful and the share price goes up. Be that as it may, assuming the product goes to market and falls flat, the shareholder brings about losses.

Before practicing share purchase rights, investors ought to research the company's true capacity and comprehend the ramifications of not practicing share purchase rights in terms of dilution of control.
