## A Brief History of the Interbank Forex Market

The interbank forex market developed after the collapse of the [Bretton Woods agreement](/brettonwoodsagreement) and following the decision by former U.S. President Richard Nixon to take the country off the [gold standard](/goldstandard) in 1971.

Currency rates of most of the large industrialized nations were allowed to [float freely](/floatingexchangerate) at that point, with just incidental government intervention. There is no centralized location for the market, as trading takes place simultaneously around the world, and stops just for ends of the week and occasions.

The advent of the floating rate system concurred with the development of low-cost computer systems that allowed progressively quick trading on a global basis. Voice brokers over telephone systems matched purchasers and venders in the beginning of interbank forex trading, but were progressively replaced by computerized systems that could examine large numbers of traders at the best costs.

To reduce [settlement risk](/settlementrisk), most banks have netting agreements that require the offset of transactions in a similar [currency pair](/currencypair) that settle on a similar date with a similar counterpart.
