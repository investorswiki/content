# Hedging Transaction
## What Is a Hedging Transaction?

A hedging transaction is a tactical action that an investor takes with the intent of lessening the risk of losing money (or encountering a [shortfall](/shortfall)) while executing their investment strategy.

## Figuring out Hedging Transactions

A hedging transaction as a rule includes [derivatives](/derivative, for example, options or futures contracts, yet it tends to be finished with contrarily [correlated](/correlation) assets too and can take various forms. While they are generally used to limit the losses that a position faces assuming the initial investing thesis is erroneous, they can likewise be utilized to secure in a specific amount of profit. Thusly, they are a common instrument for businesses as well as portfolio managers hoping to lower their overall portfolio risk.

Hedging transactions can be connected with an investment or they can be connected with customary business transactions, however the actual hedge is normally market-based. An investment-based hedging transaction can utilize derivatives, for example, [put options](/putoption), [futures](/futurescontract), or [forward contracts.](/forwardcontract)

These derivatives function much the same way to the dynamics of an insurance policy. The people who purchase a derivative to hedge pay a premium. On the off chance that something turns out badly with the strategic investment, the insurance policy — a tactical hedge — pays off, yet in the event that nothing turns out badly, the hedge is a [sunk cost](/sunkcost). These costs are in many cases a lot of lower than the potential losses facing these investors on the off chance that their investment turns out badly, and assuming the investment pays off as trusted, these sunk costs are much of the time thought about acceptable by the investor.

One problem with considering hedging transactions stringently as insurance is that, not normal for insurance, there exists a third possibility frequently unaccounted for by unpracticed investors, in particular, that the investment ascends in value, just barely. In that scenario, the investor might find that the small gain has turned into a loss when the cost of the hedging transaction is considered.

Investors can likewise utilize the purchase of contrarily connected assets to act as a hedge against overall portfolio risks introduced from one asset or the other. For instance, investors search for stocks that have a low correlation with the S&P 500 to get some level of protection from dips in the value of the widely held stocks that make up the index. These types of hedging transactions are frequently alluded to as [diversification](/diversification) as they don't offer the direct protection that derivatives do.

## Hedging Transactions in Global Business

Hedging transactions are critical for the global economy. For instance, if domestic company An is selling goods to foreign company B, the principal transaction is the sale. Suppose the sale will be settled in the currency of company B. If company An is stressed over currency variances influencing the value of the contract when the money actually comes in and is changed over completely to company A's domestic currency, they can enter a hedging transaction through the [foreign trade market](/foreign-trade markets), taking up offsetting positions that limit the [currency risk](/currencyrisk).

Worth taking note of hedging transactions don't be guaranteed to cover the total value of the sale or asset position. While a [perfect hedge](/perfecthedge) is numerically potential, they are never employed in light of the fact that such a transaction demonstrates more costly than wanted. This can be for one of two reasons:

1. Disposing of all the risk removes a ton of the reward. In hedging transactions, investors are attempting to limit the downside risk, however not dispense with the upside gains.
1. It might cost additional time and expense to compute, monitor, and execute a perfect hedge than the cost of accepting limited losses.
