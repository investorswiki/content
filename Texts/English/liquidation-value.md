# Liquidation Value
## What Is Liquidation Value?

Liquidation value is the net value of a company's physical assets if it somehow happened to leave business and the assets sold. The liquidation value is the value of company real estate, fixtures, equipment, and inventory. Theoretical assets are excluded from a company's liquidation value.

## Understanding Liquidation Value

There are generally four levels of valuation for business assets: market value, book value, liquidation value, and [salvage value](/salvagevalue). Each level of value gives a way to accountants and analysts to characterize the aggregate value of assets. Liquidation value is particularly important on account of insolvencies and [workouts](/exercise understanding).

Liquidation value does exclude [intangible assets](/intangibleasset) like a company's intellectual property, goodwill, and brand recognition. Notwithstanding, in the event that a company is sold as opposed to liquidated, both the liquidation value and elusive assets decide the company's going-concern value. Value investors take a gander at the difference between a company's market capitalization and its going-concern value to decide if the company's stock is as of now a decent buy.

## Market versus Book versus Liquidation versus Salvage

Market value commonly gives the highest valuation of assets albeit the measure could be lower than book value assuming that the value of the assets has diminished due to market demand as opposed to business use.

The book value is the value of the asset as listed on the balance sheet. The balance sheet records assets at the historical cost, so the value of assets might be higher or lower than market prices. In an economic environment with rising prices, the book value of assets is lower than the market value. The liquidation value is the expected value of the asset whenever it has been liquidated or sold, probably at a loss to historical cost.

At last, the salvage value is the value given to an asset toward the finish of its [useful life](/usefullife); as such, this is the scrap value.

Liquidation value is generally lower than book value yet greater than salvage value. The assets keep on having value, however they are sold at a loss since they must be sold rapidly.
