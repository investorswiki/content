# Counterparty
## What is a Counterparty?

A counterparty is the other party that takes part in a financial transaction, and each transaction must have a counterparty for the transaction to go through. All the more explicitly, every buyer of an asset must be paired up with a willing seller to sell and vice versa. For instance, the counterparty to a [option](/option) buyer would be an option [writer](/composing an-option). For any complete trade, several counterparties might be involved (for example a buy of 1,000 shares is filled by ten sellers of 100 shares each).

## Making sense of Counterparties

The term counterparty can allude to any entity on the other side of a financial transaction. This can incorporate deals between individuals, businesses, governments, or some other organization. Also, the two players don't need to be on equivalent standing with respect to the type of elements included. This means an individual can be a counterparty to a business and vice versa. In any occasions where a general contract is met or an exchange agreement happens, one party would be considered the counterparty, or the gatherings are counterparties to one another. This likewise applies to [forward contracts](/forwardcontract) and other contract types.

A counterparty presents [counterparty risk](/counterpartyrisk) into the equation. This is the risk that the counterparty will not be able to satisfy their finish of the transaction. Be that as it may, in numerous financial transactions, the counterparty is obscure and the counterparty risk is moderated using [clearing firms](/clearinghouse). In fact, with run of the mill exchange trading, we never know who our counterparty is on any trade, and generally there will be several counterparties each making up a piece of the trade.

## Types of Counterparties

Counterparties on a trade can be classified in more than one way. Having a thought of your potential counterparty in a given environment can give bits of knowledge into how the market is probably going to act in light of your presence/orders/transactions and other comparable style traders. Here are just a couple of prime models:

- **Retail**: these are ordinary individual investors or other non-proficient traders. They might be trading through an online broker like E-Trade or a voice broker like Charles Schwab. Frequently, retail traders are viewed as advantageous counterparties since they are assumed to be less educated, have less sophisticated trading devices, and will buy at the offer and sell at the bid.
- **Market Makers (MM):** These members' primary function is to give liquidity to the market, yet they likewise endeavor to the profit from the market. They have enormous market clout, and will frequently be a substantial portion of the noticeable bids and offers showed on the books. Profits are made by giving liquidity and gathering [ECN](/ecn)rebates, too moving the market for capital gains when conditions direct a profit might be capturable.
- **Liquidity Traders:** These are non-market creators who generally have exceptionally low fees and capture daily profits by adding liquidity and catching the ECN credits. Similarly as with market creators they may likewise make capital gains by being filled on the [bid](/bid) (offer) and afterward posting orders on the offer (bid) at the inside price or outside the current market price. These traders might in any case have market clout, however less so than market producers.
- **Technical Traders:** In practically any market, there will be traders who trade in light of chart levels, whether from market indicators, support and resistance, trendlines or chart designs. These traders watch for certain conditions to emerge before venturing into a position; along these lines, it is reasonable they can all the more precisely characterize the risks and rewards of a specific trade. At generally known technical levels, the liquidity traders and DMM might become technical traders. Albeit not generally in the manner expected - DMM may erroneously trigger technical levels knowing large gatherings of traders will be impacted, subsequently churning large measures of shares. (Learn more in our Technical Analysis Strategies for Beginners.)
- **Momentum Traders:** There are various types of [momentum](/momentum) traders. Some will remain with a momentum stock for several days (even however they just trade it intraday) while others will screen for "stocks moving," continually endeavoring to capture quick sharp movements in stocks during news events, volume or price spikes. These traders regularly exit when the movement is making it clear that things are pulling back. (This type of strategy requests controlled decision making, requiring a ceaseless refinement of entry and exit procedures, read Momentum Trading with Discipline.)
- **Arbitragers:** Using different assets, markets and statistical devices, these traders endeavor to take advantage of shortcomings in the market or across markets. These traders might be small or large, albeit certain types of arbitrage trading will require large measures of buying power to capitalize on shortcomings completely. Other types of "arbitrage" might be available to smaller traders, for example, while dealing with exceptionally connected instruments and short-term deviations from the correlation threshold.

## Counterparties in Financial Transactions

On account of a purchase of goods from a retail store, the buyer and retailer are counterparties in the transaction. In terms of financial markets, the [bond](/bond) seller and bond buyer are counterparties.

In certain circumstances, various counterparties might exist as a transaction advances. Each exchange of funds, goods or services to complete a transaction can be considered as a series of counterparties. For instance, on the off chance that a buyer purchases a retail product online to be transported to their home, the buyer and retailer are counterparties, similar to the buyer and the delivery service.

From an overall perspective, any time one party supplies funds, or things of value, in exchange for something from a subsequent party, counterparties exist. Counterparties mirror the double sided nature of transactions.

## Counterparty Risk

In dealings with a counterparty, there is a natural risk that one individuals or substances included won't satisfy their obligation. This is particularly true for over-the-counter (OTC) transactions. Instances of this incorporate the risk that a vendor won't give a decent or service after the payment is handled, or that a buyer won't pay an obligation in the event that the goods are given first. It can likewise incorporate the risk that one party will retreat from the deal prior to the transaction happening however after an initial agreement is reached.

For structured markets, like the stock or [futures](/futures) markets, financial counterparty risk is alleviated by the clearing houses and [exchanges](/exchange). At the point when you buy a stock, you don't have to worry about the financial feasibility of the person on the other side of the transaction. The clearing house or exchange moves forward as the counterparty, ensuring the stocks you bought or the funds you anticipate from a sale.

Counterparty risk acquired greater visibility in the wake of the 2008 worldwide financial crisis. AIG broadly leveraged its AAA [credit rating](/creditrating) to sell (compose) credit default swaps (CDS) to counterparties who wanted default protection (as a rule, on [CDO](/cdo) tranches). At the point when AIG couldn't post extra collateral and was required to give funds to counterparties in the face of deteriorating [reference obligations](/reference-obligation), the U.S. government rescued them.
