# Arrears Swap
## What Is an Arrears Swap?

An arrears swap is a [interest rate swap](/interestrateswap) that is like a customary, or [plain vanilla swap](/plain-vanilla-swap), however the floating payment is based on the interest rate toward the finish of the reset period, instead of the beginning, and is then applied retroactively.

## Understanding Arrears Swaps

A quick method for differentiating between a vanilla swap and an arrears swap is that the former sets the interest rate in advance and pays later (in arrears) while the last the two sets the interest rate and pays later (in arrears). An arrears swap has several different names, including reset swap, back-set swap, and delayed reset swap. In the event that the floating rate is based on [London Interbank Offered Rate](/libor) (LIBOR), then, at that point, it is called a [LIBOR-in-arrears swap](/libor-in-arrears-swap).

The definition of "arrears" is money that is owed and ought to have been paid before. In the case of an arrears swap, the definition slants more towards the calculation of the payment as opposed to the actual payment. The "in-arrears" structure was introduced during the 1980s to empower investors to exploit possibly falling interest rates.

An arrears swap is a strategy utilized by investors and borrowers who are directional on interest rates and accept they will fall. A key point is that the steepness of the [yield curve](/yieldcurve) assumes a large part in pricing an arrears swap. Accordingly, it is frequently utilized by examiners who endeavor to anticipate the yield curve. It is better appropriate for speculating than a normal interest rate swap since it rewards (pays out) examiners based on the timeliness and precision of their expectations.

Swap transactions exchange the cash flows of fixed-rate investments for those of floating-rate investments. The floating rate is generally based on an index, like LIBOR plus a predetermined amount. LIBOR is the interest rate at which banks can borrow funds from different banks in the [euro-cash market](/eurocurrencymarket). Commonly, all rates are predetermined before entering the swap agreement and, if applicable, toward the beginning of subsequent reset periods until the swap develops.

In a normal, or plain vanilla swap, the floating rate is set toward the beginning of the reset period and paid toward the finish of that period. For an arrears swap, the major difference is the point at which the swap contract tests the floating rate and determines what the payment ought to be. In a vanilla swap, the floating rate toward the beginning of the reset period is the base rate. In an arrears swap, the floating rate toward the finish of the reset period is the base rate.

## Using an Arrears Swap

The floating rate side of a vanilla swap, LIBOR, or another short-term rate, resets on each reset date. On the off chance that the three-month LIBOR is the base rate, the floating rate payment under the swap happens in 90 days, and afterward the then-current three-month LIBOR will determine the rate for the next period, 90 days in this model. For an arrears swap, the current period's rate sets in 90 days to cover the period just ended. The rate for the second three-month period sets six months into the contract, etc.

For instance, assuming that an investor has a strong view that the LIBOR will fall throughout the next couple of years and accepts that it will be lower toward the finish of each reset period than toward the beginning, then they can enter an arrears swap agreement to receive LIBOR and pay LIBOR-in-arrears over the life of the contract. On the off chance that their view is right, they will have benefitted from this transaction. It must be noticed that, in this instance, the two rates are floating.
