## What Is a Dog?

In business, a canine (otherwise called a "pet") is one of the four categories or quadrants of the BCG Growth-Share matrix developed by Boston Consulting Group during the 1970s to oversee different business units inside a company. A canine is a business unit that has a small [market share](/marketshare) in a mature industry. A canine hence neither produces the strong cash flow nor requires the heavy investment that a [cash cow](/cashcow) or star unit would (two different categories in the BCG matrix). A canine measures low on both market share and growth.

For investors, "[Dogs of the Dow](/dogsofthedow)" is an investment strategy that endeavors to beat the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) every year by inclining portfolios in the direction of high-yield investments. The overall concept is to designate money to the 10 highest dividend-yielding, blue-chip stocks among the 30 parts of the DJIA.

## Grasping Dogs

Since a canine ties up significant [capital](/capital) and resources that can be all the more successfully sent somewhere else in the company, it is a coherent candidate available to be purchased or divestment.

Notwithstanding, a canine may some of the time play a more extensive part to play inside a company. For example, it might offer products that supplement those offered by other business units in the company, or it could be a portal that gets customers keen on the company's different products. In such cases, management would need to choose whether the [synergies](/cooperative energy) and elusive gains offered by this business unit justify the capital tied up in it.

On the off chance that the unit's long-term possibilities are dreary, the best course of action may be to sell or strip the business at the earliest opportunity, since its weakening possibilities would make it harder to sell with time. In the business world, a canine is probably not going to at any point return to its brilliance days as a star or cash cow.

> In the majority of cases, since a canine commonly operates in a mature industry, management wouldn't be justified in distributing more capital to it in a bid to extend market share.
