# Bilateral Netting
## What is Bilateral Netting?

Bilateral netting is the method involved with uniting all [swap](/swap) agreements between two gatherings into one single, or master, agreement. Thus, rather than each swap agreement leading to a flood of individual payments by one or the other party, the swaps are all netted together with the goal that only one net payment stream is made to one party in view of the flows of the combined swaps.

The term bilateral itself means "having or connecting with different sides; influencing the two sides." Net or [netting](/netting) alludes to finding the difference between all the swap payments, creating one (net) total.

## Grasping Bilateral Netting

Bilateral netting reduces the overall number of transactions between the two [counterparties](/counterparty). In this manner, real transaction [volume](/volume) between the two abatements. So does the amount of accounting activity and different costs and fees associated with an increased number of trades.

While the convenience of reduced transactions is a benefit, the primary explanation two gatherings take part in netting is to reduce risk. Bilateral netting adds extra security in the event of [bankruptcy](/bankruptcy) to one or the other party. By netting, in the event of bankruptcy, the swaps are all executed rather than just the beneficial ones for the company going through the bankruptcy. For instance, assuming there was no bilateral netting, the company going into bankruptcy could collect on all [in-the-money](/inthemoney) swaps while saying they can't make payments on the [out-of-the-money](/outofthemoney) swaps due to the bankruptcy.

Netting combines all swaps into one so the bankrupt company could collect on in-the-cash swaps after completely out-of-the-cash swaps are paid in full. Fundamentally, it means that the value of the in-the-cash swaps must be greater than the value of the out-of-the-cash swaps for the bankrupt company to get any payments.

## Types of Netting

There are several methods for achieving netting.

Payment netting is the point at which each counterparty aggregates the amount owed to the next on the payment date and just the difference in the amounts will be delivered by the party with the payable. This is additionally called settlement netting. Payment netting reduces [settlement risk](/settlementrisk), however since all original swaps remain, it doesn't accomplish netting for regulatory capital or [balance sheet](/balancesheet) purposes.

[Novation](/novation) netting drops offsetting swaps and replaces them with the new [master agreement](/master-swap-agreement).

Close-Out Netting: After a [default](/default2), existing transactions are terminated and the values of each are calculated to distil a single amount for one party to pay the other.

[Multilateral Netting](/multilateral-netting) includes multiple gatherings, probable utilizing a [clearing house](/clearinghouse) or central exchange, while bilateral netting is between two gatherings.

## Illustration of Bilateral Netting Between Companies

Expect that Company A has agreed to go into two swaps with Company B.

- For the primary swap, Company An agreed to pay a 3% fixed rate on $1 million, while Company B pays a [floating rate](/floatinginterestrate) of LIBOR plus 2%. Expect that [LIBOR](/libor) is presently 2%, so the floating rate Company B pays is 4%.
- For the subsequent swap, Company An agreed to pay a 4% fixed rate on $3 million, while Company B pays a floating rate of LIBOR plus 2.5%. LIBOR is 2%, so the floating rate is 4.5%.

On the off chance that these swaps were bilaterally netted, rather than Company B sending two payments to Company A they could just send one bigger payment.

- For the main swap, Company B owes Company A 1% on $1 million. Assuming paid yearly, that is $10,000 or $833.33 month to month.
- On the subsequent swap, Company B owes Company A 0.5% on $3 million. Assuming paid yearly, that is $15,000 or $1,250 month to month.

Rather than sending two payments, with bilateral netting Company B would send $2,083.33 ($833.33 + $1,250) month to month or $25,000 ($10,000 + $15,000) yearly.

As LIBOR changes so will the payment amounts. Assuming more swaps are taken between the gatherings, these too can be netted out similarly.

## Features
- Bilateral netting reduces accounting activity, complexity, and fees associated with additional trades and payments.
- In the event of a bankruptcy, bilateral netting guarantees that the bankrupt company can't take payments while picking not to payout on out-of-the-cash swaps.
- Bilateral netting is when two gatherings consolidate every one of their swaps into one master swap, making one net payment, rather than many, between the gatherings.
