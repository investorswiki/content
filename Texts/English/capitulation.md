# Capitulation
## What's the significance here in Simple Terms?
Customarily, **capitulate** means "give up." When applied to investing, it alludes to selling a stock for a loss — typically during a phase of extended decline. At the end of the day, when an investor capitulates, they "give up" by deciding to realize a formerly unrealized capital loss by selling a stock as opposed to continuing to hold onto it due to fear of extra loss.
Capitulation is to some degree self-supporting and can cause a cascade during which the price of a stock falls strongly throughout an exceptionally short time. In the event that a stock's price has been in a steady decline for, say, five months, then a frustrating earnings forecast or some other negative news causes an observable selloff that drops the stock's price a couple of percentage points in a day, this can make extra investors sell, pushing a stock's price even lower. This flowing effect can make a stock's price crash through recently settled [support levels](/support), making its new floor price muddled.
When a stock's all's panic sellers have capitulated (i.e., when the stock's price stops falling pointedly and starts to balance out), investors who are as yet bullish on the stock might think it has hit another base and may consider this to be a buying opportunity, trusting the stock will rebound and start to appreciate.
This depends on the assumption that those who planned to sell have sold, so just buyers remain, and they will push the stock's price up. Nonetheless, distinguishing the "end" of a period of capitulation is difficult to do until it has previously worked out.
## What Is Market Capitulation?
Market capitulation happens while panic selling turns into a far reaching phenomenon that influences most stocks. This most frequently happens during [bear markets](/bearmarket) and [corrections](/market-revision) when the greater part of the market starts to lose value.
On the off chance that most stocks have been in a slow decline, more honed declines start to happen, investors might start to sell off their stocks and move their excess money into more stable investment vehicles like [preferred stock](/preferredstock), precious metals, [corporate bonds](/corporatebond), or government bonds.
This can cause more quick price drops, which can rouse fear in extra investors, causing extra selling, etc. At the point when the mental effects of unrealized capital loss become sufficiently strong and sufficiently pervasive, a vast [recession](/recession) may even happen, albeit this is rare.
## What Causes Capitulation?
Far reaching capitulation can sometimes occur in response to a specific macroeconomic event. The blasting of the housing [bubble](/bubble) and subsequent banking crisis in 2008 prompted broad panic selling that transformed into a serious recession. The onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in mid 2020 likewise set off a cascade of capitulation, despite the fact that it was less serious and shorter-lived than the selloff of the late 2000s.
With regards to a specific stock as opposed to the market overall, capitulation can happen because of frustrating news (e.g., dropping sales or missed earnings gauges) being delivered during an existing period of decline, expecting the stock's subsequent price drop is sufficiently substantial to startle a huge number of investors into selling.
## The most effective method to Spot Capitulation in a Stock
Capitulation is a lot more straightforward to recognize in hindsight than in real-time, yet investors who need to buy in at a stock's base frequently try to distinguish the finish of a period of capitulation so they can buy a stock just before it rebounds. One way traders endeavor to do this is by examining a stock's candlestick chart to check whether they can recognize a "hammer candlestick" following a period of decline.

### What Is a Hammer Candlestick?
Every candlestick on a [candlestick chart](/candlestick-chart) shows a stock's open, close, high, and low prices over a specific period. A hammer candlestick is one in which the open and close are close to each other (indicated by a short thick), the top shadow is short, and the base shadow is extremely long, demonstrating that a stock traded exceptionally low during a significant part of the period being referred to before rallying and closing exceptionally close to (above or below) its open price.
By and large, hammer candlesticks are many times present at a stock's base toward the finish of a period of decline and capitulation and just before a rebound in price. That being said, this isn't generally the case, and past trends don't guarantee future outcomes. Endeavoring to recognize a stock's post-capitulation base utilizing candlestick charts — like some other investing procedure — implies risk.
## How Long Does Capitulation Usually Last?
There is no set rule regarding how long capitulation can last, and, surprisingly, by and large, various investors might have various feelings concerning when a certain period of capitulation started or ended, precisely.
The period of market capitulation that followed the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic seems to have started around mid to late February 2020 and lasted until mid to late March, so in that case, the cycle required about a month. Each situation is unique, notwithstanding, and single-stock panic selling can happen significantly more rapidly than far reaching capitulation.

## Highlights
- Capitulation denotes a short-term low in the price and is followed by basically a relief rally.
- Capitulation causes heavy turnover among investors, empowering a rebound by supplanting risk-disinclined sellers with risk-lenient buyers, yet it can't guarantee those buyers will not eventually sell even lower.
- Capitulation happens when a huge extent of investors surrenders to fear and sells over a short period of time, prompting the price of a security or a market to drop pointedly amid high trading volume.
- Until the price rebounds essentially, there can be no assurance the apparent "capitulation" will not be followed by extra emotional drops.
