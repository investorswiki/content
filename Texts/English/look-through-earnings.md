This wonderful outcome has happened on the grounds that the vast majority of our investees are participated in genuinely outstanding businesses that can frequently utilize incremental capital to great advantage, either by giving it something to do in their businesses or by repurchasing their shares. Clearly, every capital decision that our investees have made has not benefited us as shareholders, but rather overall we have collected definitely in excess of a dollar of value for every dollar they have retained. We thus view look-through earnings as reasonably depicting our yearly gain from operations."**

Assuming an investor were to just respect the dividends he received from his shares as his return, he would overlook the greater part of the funds — and the stock value — that was gathering to his benefit.

The look-through earnings concept, Buffett has said, powers investors to assess stocks as long as possible. "We keep on getting more cash while wheezing than when active," he cleared up for investors in 1996. "Our look-through earnings have developed at a decent clasp throughout the long term, and our stock price has risen correspondingly. Had those gains in earnings not appeared, there would have been little increase in Berkshire's value."
