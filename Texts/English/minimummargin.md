# Least Margin
## What Is Minimum Margin?

Least margin is the initial amount investors are required to deposit into a [margin account](/marginaccount) before trading on margin or selling short. Different margin trading accounts have their own base margins, however regulations lay out the bare least. A margin account permits an investor to buy securities long or sell securities short on a credit extension extended to the investor by the broker.

The investor must put aside an initial installment into the account to cover a certain percentage of the value of the securities the investor wishes to buy long or sell short. That base value must be kept up with in the account while the long or short position is open.

For instance, the [New York Stock Exchange (NYSE)](/nyse) and [Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA)](/finra) expect investors to deposit at least $2,000 in cash or securities to open a margin account. Keep as a main priority that this amount is just a base — a few brokerages might expect you to deposit more than $2,000.

## Grasping Minimum Margin

At the point when an investor buys on margin, there are key levels — as represented by the Federal Reserve Board's [Regulation T](/regulationt) — that must be kept up with over the lifetime of a trade.

The base margin, which states that a broker can't stretch out any credit to accounts with under $2,000 in cash (or securities) is the primary requirement. Second, an initial margin of half is required for a trade to be placed. Third, the maintenance margin says that you must keep up with equity of something like 25% or be hit with a margin call.

## Illustration of Minimum Margin

For instance, assuming that Bob wishes to trade on margin to buy shares of ABC stock, he will probably have to ensure he has something like 25% of the value of the purchase price of ABC stock in his margin account.

He can borrow the remainder of the purchase price from the broker. On the off chance that Bob involved different securities in his account as the [collateral](/collateral), he should watch the value of those securities in his account. On the off chance that the market falls and the value of different securities in his account endures, he could be hit with a [margin call](/margincall), which would expect him to deposit more money into his margin account.
