Absolute priority, otherwise called "liquidation preference," is a rule overseeing the order of payment among creditors and shareholders in the event of a corporate [liquidation](/liquidation). The absolute priority rule is utilized in corporate [bankruptcies](/bankruptcy) to conclude the portion of payment that will be made to every participant.

Concerning estate of a deceased person, the absolute priority rule guarantees the payment of outstanding debts before the distribution of assets to beneficiaries.

## How Absolute Priority Works

Under Section 1129(b)(2) of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, a liquidation plan must be "fair and equitable" to creditors. Setting to the side certain provisions to handle back wages, benefits, and tax claims, absolute priority indicates the payment hierarchy to satisfy the directive for fair and equitable treatment. Senior creditors are paid in full before junior creditors are paid except if the senior creditors consent to subordinate a portion of their claims to those unsecured creditors. After the claims of junior creditors are fulfilled, any excess funds are given over to equity holders.
