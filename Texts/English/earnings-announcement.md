# Earnings Announcement
## What Is an Earnings Announcement?

An earnings announcement is an official public statement of a company's profitability for a specific period, normally a quarter or a year. An earnings announcement happens on a specific date during [earnings season](/earningsseason) and is gone before by [earnings estimates](/earningsestimate) issued by equity analysts. On the off chance that a company has been productive leading up to the announcement, its share price will typically increase up to and somewhat after the data is delivered. Since earnings announcements can affect the market, they are many times thought about while foreseeing the next day's open.

## Grasping Earnings Announcements

The data in the announcements must be accurate, as per [Securities and Exchange Commission](/sec) regulations. Since the earnings announcement is the official statement of a company's profitability, the days leading up to the announcement are frequently filled with speculation among investors.

Analyst estimates can be famously misguided and can quickly change up or down in the days leading up to the announcement, falsely blowing up the share price and influencing [speculative trading](/speculation).

### Earnings Announcements and Analyst Estimates

For analysts esteeming a company's future [earnings for every share](/eps) (EPS), estimates are seemingly the main information. Analysts use forecasting models, management guidance, and other fundamental data on a company to infer an EPS estimate. For instance, they could utilize a [discounted cash flows model ](/dcf)or DCF.

DCF investigations utilize future [free cash flow](/freecashflow) projections and discount them. This is finished utilizing a required annual rate to show up at [present value](/presentvalue) estimates, which, thus, is utilized to assess the potential for investment. On the off chance that the value showed up at through DCF analysis is higher than the current cost of the investment, the opportunity could be a decent one.

**Determined as:**

DCF = [CF1/(1+r)1] + [CF2/(1+r)2] + ... + [CFn/(1+r)n]

CF = Cash Flow

r= discount rate (WACC)

Analysts may likewise depend on fundamental factors framed in the [management discussion and analysis](/mdanalysis) (MD&A) section of a company's financial reports. This section gives an outline of the previous year or quarter's operations and the way that the company performed financially. It frames the explanations for certain parts of growth or decline in the company's income statement, balance sheet, and statement of cash flows. The MD&A talks about growth drivers, risks, and, surprisingly, pending litigation. Management likewise frequently utilizes this section to talk about the forthcoming year by framing future objectives and ways to deal with new activities alongside any changes in the executive suite or potentially key recruits.

At long last, analysts might consider outside factors, for example, industry trends (e.g., large [mergers](/mergersandacquisitions), acquisitions, liquidations, and so on), the macroeconomic climate, pending [U.S Federal Reserve](/federalreservebank) gatherings and potential [interest rate](/interestrate) hikes.
