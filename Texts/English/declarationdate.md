# Declaration Date
## What Is the Declaration Date?

The declaration date is the date on which the board of directors of a company reports the next [dividend](/dividend) payment. This statement incorporates the dividend's size, ex-dividend date, and payment date. The declaration date is additionally alluded to as the "announcement date."

In addition to being the date on which the next dividend payment is announced, the declaration date is likewise the last day on which the holder of a [option](/option) must indicate whether they will exercise the option. This is otherwise called the "expiration date."

## Understanding the Declaration Date

Most investors consider the declaration date to be the least important of all the dividend dates, which incorporate the ex-dividend date, the payment date, and the record date. It is viewed as the least important in light of the fact that it is just a communication of information rather than a date where any impact will take place.

For example, the payment date is the point at which the dividend is received, the ex-dividend date is the last date an investor must hold a share to be eligible for a dividend, and the record date is the date by which a [shareholder](/shareholder) must be registered with the company. When a dividend is authorized, it turns into a declared dividend. It turns into the company's legal liability to pay it.

Concerning options, the declaration date of all listed [stock options](/stockoption) in the U.S. is on the third Friday of the listed month. In the event that a holiday falls on a Friday, the declaration date falls on the third Thursday.

## Dividend Dates

Following the declaration date, the company establishes a [record date](/recorddate) to determine which shareholders are eligible to receive a dividend or distribution relying upon their registration status. The ex-dividend date is the date on which the seller is still entitled to the dividend even on the off chance that they have proactively sold their shares to a buyer. A person who claims the security on the ex-dividend date will receive payment, paying little heed to who currently holds the stock.

The ex-dividend date is typically set for two business days prior to the record date, due to the T+3 system of settlement that financial markets presently use in the United States. At last, the [payment date](/paymentdate) happens when the company sends dividend checks or credits them to investor accounts.

Investors pay close attention to records of dividend payments; getting dividends is an important component of numerous income-centered investment strategies. These can be standalone ways to deal with maintaining a steady income without much risk or potentially an addition to a more extensive portfolio strategy.

## Declaration Dates and Options

Declaration dates are likewise associated with stock options as it is the last date an option holder might exercise their stock options. A stock option contract between two consenting parties generally consists of 100 shares of an underlying stock. [Put](/putoption) and [call](/calloption) options are the two major types of options. In a call, a buyer enters into a contract to purchase a stock at a specific price by a specific date. In a put, the option buyer takes out a contract to sell a stock at a settled on price at the latest a specific date.
