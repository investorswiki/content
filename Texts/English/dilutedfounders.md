# Diluted Founders
## What Are Diluted Founders?

"Diluted founders" is a term utilized by [venture capitalists](/venturecapitalist) (VCs) to depict the course of a startup's founders step by step losing ownership of the company they made. [Startup](/startup) founders who depend on [venture capital](/venturecapital) to develop their business must surrender increasingly more ownership of the company in return for the [capital](/capital) received. In short, the founders [dilute](/dilution) their ownership in the company in exchange for funding.

## Figuring out Diluted Founders

When a [entrepreneur](/entrepreneur) or team of founders dispatches a startup, the ownership of the company (or its [equity](/equity)) is evenly divided among the founders, adding up to 100%. This allocation might be an equivalent split or distributed by perceived contributions to the new venture, duties and jobs, or some other criteria.

Company founders may likewise contribute (bootstrap) their own [startup capital](/startup-capital) as cash or [sweat equity](/sweatequity). In doing as such, they could possibly buy greater equity stakes from their fellow benefactors.

Eventually, developing startups will require more capital than founders can invest themselves, inciting them to look for outside funding. When [investors](/investor) consent to put money towards a startup, they receive equity shares in return — which must emerge from that 100% total pie. This means that as additional investors contribute capital, the percentage of the company owned by the founders is decreased.

> As additional funding rounds happen, early investors become diluted as well — not just initial founders.
>

Sometimes, founders will cut out in advance an equity cut expected for future investors. For instance, three prime supporters might take a 25% equity cut each and leave 25% as a pool for VCs. In any case, even this percentage will become diluted over the long run as [seed rounds](/seedcapital) transform into [Series A](/seriesa) and [Series B](/series-b-financing) capital raises.

## Illustration of Diluted Founders

Company ABC has a [pre-money valuation](/premoneyvaluation) of $3 million before tapping VCs for funding. Series An investors consent to invest $1 million, supporting the [post-money valuation](/postmoneyvaluation) to $4 million.

In exchange, the VCs currently own 25% of the company, leaving the original founders with 75%. That portion may be diluted even more should the VCs demand a further percentage be put to the side for future employees.

In this case, the VCs need 10% of the organizer's stake to be put into a [option pool](/option-pool). Such measures could assist with drawing in a gifted and steadfast labor force. Be that as it may, it likewise means the founders are left with 65% of the company they made after just one funding round. Eventually, Series A financing diluted their stake by 35 percentage points.

### Genuine Example

Instances of founders getting vigorously diluted before making it to the [initial public offering](/ipo) (IPO) stage are genuinely common. For instance, Pandora Media fellow benefactor Tim Westergren held just 2.39% of the music streaming company before it opened up to the world in 2011.

This heavy dilution was in part due to appalling timing. Westergren and his friends began the company at the level of the [dotcom bubble](/dotcom-bubble). When the [bubble](/bubble) burst, [sentiment](/marketsentiment) turned and it became challenging to raise funds. Pandora was apparently dismissed in excess of 300 times by VCs. Eventually, the company had the option to secure capital solely after surrendering genuinely big stakes.

## Special Considerations

Which percentage of the company should an organizer hold onto, in a perfect world, after the VCs take their slice of the pie? There is no standard, yet generally anything between or above 15%-25% ownership for the founders is viewed as a triumph.

By and by, the trade of ownership for capital is beneficial to both VCs and founders. Diluted ownership of a $500 million company is worth more than sole ownership of a $5 million company.
