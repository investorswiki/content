# Echo Bubble
## What Is an Echo Bubble?

An echo bubble is a post-bubble market rally that outcomes in another, more modest bubble. The echo bubble happens in the sector or market in which the previous bubble was most unmistakable, however the echo bubble is less inflated and hence, assuming that it likewise bursts or deflates, will leave somewhat less damage behind.

An echo bubble may likewise be seen during a false base or a [dead-cat bounce](/deadcatbounce).

## Understanding Echo Bubbles

An echo bubble happens when prices go through a transitory, premature rally before the correction has completely run its course and cleaned out the [overexuberant](/irrationalexuberance) or over the top support at costs in the original bubble. It very well may be considered a sort of false base to the bust, which gives way to a stronger, longer-term descending trend. An echo bubble may likewise conversationally be alluded to as a dead-cat bounce, since even a dead cat will bounce on the off chance that you drop it from sufficiently high.

Echo bubbles might result from the equivalent speculative, mental, or economic factors that drove the initial bubble. Investors may erroneously accept that the bust is just a brief respite and try to buy the dip. [Expansionary monetary policy](/expansionary_policy) could give a transitory shock to prices however not be able to prevent the ultimate liquidation of investments not grounded in sound economic fundamentals. In spite of their more modest size, echo bubbles can greatly heighten negative [sentiment](/marketsentiment) and cynicism in markets as they burst and uncover greater damage than market participants might have originally perceived.

## Distinguishing Echo Bubbles

Nobel Prize beneficiary Vernon Smith distinguished the occurrence of echo bubbles in [laboratory experiments](/exploratory economics) where guineas pigs bid on the price of an asset. He found that his analyses could dependably duplicate asset price bubbles, with participants regularly bidding prices up essentially higher than the fundamental values implied by the design of the trial. At the point when he rehashed the analysis with similar subjects, another, more vulnerable bubble would frequently happen. This secondary bubble was named an echo bubble. Since Smith's research, economists have archived echo bubbles in various market episodes from the beginning of time.

One of the principal realized echo bubbles was the rally that happened after the [Great Crash of 1929](/stock-market-crash-1929). Following the market crash in the fall of 1929, the U.S. stock market mobilized in the initial two fourth of 1930, recovering half of its total value. Be that as it may, just like its more important ancestor, the more modest echo bubble burst in short order, giving way to the [Great Depression](/great_depression).

## Special Considerations

There is right now much discussion encompassing two potential echo bubbles underway today. There are market onlookers who accept that an echo bubble has shaped in the housing market. Others contend that technology companies are being allowed bubble valuations along with truly productive innovations in new advancements. In any case, the timing proposes that technically these are not echo bubbles by any means, give it's been above and beyond a decade since the [housing bubble](/housing_bubble) of the mid-2000s and 20 years since the [Dotcom bubble](/dotcom-bubble) of the late 1990s.

Notwithstanding publicity in the business media and analysis, these can barely be considered echoes, however they might be bubbles by their own doing.

## Highlights
- Echo bubbles were first distinguished in quite a while and have since been reported in several historic market bubbles.
- An echo bubble is a follow-on price bubble that happens after a bigger market bubble bursts.
- Echo bubbles can result from the very powers that drove the initial bubble or as an effect of policy responses that try to re-inflate the initial bubble.
