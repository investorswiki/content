In doing as such, the investor would acknowledge income from the premiums earned on the options they sell, in this manner making a "synthetic dividend" out of their portfolio.

## How Synthetic Dividends Work

Numerous investors could want income from their portfolios, regardless of the inclination that the best investments that anyone could hope to find to them are not dividend-paying companies. For instance, numerous [growth companies](/growthstock) don't pay dividends since they forcefully reinvest their earnings into extra expansion efforts. Growth investors could wish to acknowledge income from their portfolios, in spite of not having any desire to go amiss from their growth-investment strategy.
