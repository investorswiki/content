# Aggregate Hours
## What Are Aggregate Hours?

Aggregate hours is a statistic that is assembled by the U.S. Department of Labor (DOL). Aggregate hours addresses the sum of hours worked by completely employed individuals, either full-or part-time, throughout a year.

Aggregate hours can likewise allude to the total hours worked by one [sector](/sector) or group of workers.

## Grasping Aggregate Hours

The DOL is a U.S. bureau level agency responsible for implementing federal labor standards and advancing workers' prosperity. The DOL distributes heaps of various economic data and data connected with the U.S. [labor market](/labor-market). Among the different things it archives are the sum of the entire hours worked by full-and part-time workers across or inside all industries.

The department registers average week after week hours by taking reported worker hours from every foundation and afterward isolating this number by the total number of all employees every one of these foundations has on its payroll.

One of the DOL's most closely observed releases is its [indexes](/list) of aggregate week by week hours. These are calculated by separating the current month's appraisals of aggregate hours by the average 12 month to month figures for the [base year](/base-year), which is 2007.

As you can find in the above table, data is broken down to summarize aggregate hours for the country as a whole, as well according to [industry](/industry).

## Special Considerations
### Applications of Aggregate Hours

Measuring how long individuals are working is valuable because of multiple factors. It shows how much labor input is required to create the current level of production output. It likewise gives policymakers and other closely involved individuals, including investors, a thought of whether the [economy](/economy) is possibly easing back or speeding up.

Aggregate hours statistics play a key job in measuring [real Gross Domestic Product (GDP)](/realgdp): a macroeconomic, inflation-adjusted measure that mirrors the value of all goods and services created by an economy in a given year. Not at all like [nominal GDP](/nominalgdp), real GDP can account for changes in price level and give a more accurate figure of economic growth.

Aggregate hours are part of total labor computations required to decide real GDP. For instance, quicker [payroll](/payroll) growth and an increase in average week by week hours can drive aggregate hours up. Assuming stable [productivity](/productivity), more hours worked would mean more output. Hence, assuming workers are delivering similar amount of goods or services each hour, and are working more hours, than real GDP is higher.

The media sometimes overplays the number of occupations that were added to the economy in some random period. In reality, aggregate hours generally give a better measure to total labor than the number of individuals employed. That is on the grounds that not every person works a similar amount. Between the overtime hours, part-time and full-time positions, the number of individuals employed can't give as accurate a quantifiable measure of total labor as aggregate hours can.
