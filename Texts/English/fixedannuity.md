# Fixed Annuity
## What Is a Fixed Annuity?

A fixed [annuity](/annuity) is a type of insurance contract that vows to pay the buyer a specific, guaranteed interest rate on their contributions to the account. Paradoxically, a [variable annuity](/variableannuity) pays interest that can vary in light of the performance of an investment portfolio picked by the account's owner. Fixed annuities are in many cases utilized in retirement planning.

## How a Fixed Annuity Works

Investors can buy a fixed annuity with either a lump sum of money or a series of payments over the long haul. The insurance company, thusly, guarantees that the account will earn a certain rate of interest. This period is known as the [accumulation phase](/accumulationphase).

At the point when the annuity owner, or [annuitant](/annuitant), chooses for start getting normal income from the annuity, the insurance company ascertains those payments in light of the amount of money in the account, the owner's age, how long the payments are to proceed, and different factors. This starts the [payout phase](/payoutphase). The payout phase might go on for a predefined number of years or until the end of the owner's life.

During the accumulation phase, the account develops tax-deferred. Then the account holder annuitizes the contract, distributions are taxed in light of an exclusion ratio. This is the ratio of the account holder's premium payments to the to the amount accumulated in the account that depends on gains from the interest earned during the accumulation phase. The premiums paid are excluded and the portion owing to gains is taxed. This is in many cases communicated as a percentage.

This situation applies to non-qualified annuities, which are those not held in a qualified retirement plan. On account of a qualified annuity, the whole payment would be subject to taxes.

## Benefits of a Fixed Annuity

Owners of fixed annuities can benefit from these contracts in different ways.

### Unsurprising investment returns

This tax deferral can have a massive effect in how the account develops over the long run, especially for individuals in higher tax brackets. The equivalent is true of qualified retirement accounts, like IRAs and 401(k) plans, which additionally develop tax deferred.

### Guaranteed income payments

Fixed annuities might be changed over into a [immediate annuity](/immediatepaymentannuity) whenever the owner chooses. The annuity will then generate a guaranteed income payout for a predefined period of time or for the life of the annuitant.

The life insurance company is responsible for the security of the money invested in the annuity and for satisfying any commitments made in the contract. Not at all like most bank accounts, annuities are not federally insured.

Annuity owners who are under age 59\u00bd may likewise need to pay a 10% tax penalty, notwithstanding ordinary income taxes.

At long last, annuities frequently carry high fees, compared to different types of investments.
