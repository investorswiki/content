## What Is the Piotroski Score?

The Piotroski score is a discrete score somewhere in the range of zero and nine that reflects nine criteria used to determine the strength of a company's financial position. The Piotroski score is utilized to determine the best [value stocks](/valuestock), with nine being the best and zero being awful.

The Piotroski score was named after Chicago Accounting Professor Joseph Piotroski, who conceived the scale, as per specific parts of company [financial statements](/financial-statements). Viewpoints are centered around the company's accounting brings about recent time spans (years). For each criterion met (noted below), one point is granted; in any case, no points are granted. The points are then amounted to determine the best value stocks.

## Understanding the Piotroski Score

The Piotroski score is broken down into the accompanying categories:

1. Profitability
1. Leverage, liquidity, and source of funds
1. Operating effectiveness

### Profitability Criteria Include:
- Positive net income (1 point)
- Positive [return on assets](/returnonassets) (ROA) in the current year (1 point)
- Positive [operating cash flow](/operatingcashflow) in the current year (1 point)
- Cash flow from operations being more noteworthy than [net Income](/netincome) (quality of earnings) (1 point)

### Leverage, Liquidity, and Source of Funds Criteria Include:

- Higher [current ratio](/currentratio) this year compared to the previous year (greater liquidity) (1 point)
- No new shares were issued in the last year (lack of dilution) (1 point).

### Operating Efficiency Criteria Include:

## Perusing the Score

On the off chance that a company has a score of 8 or 9, it is viewed as a decent value. On the off chance that the score amounts to between 0-2 points, the stock is viewed as weak. Piotroski's April 2000 paper "Value Investing: The Use of Historical Financial Statement Information to Separate Winners from Losers," exhibited that the Piotroski score method would have seen a 23% annual return somewhere in the range of 1976 and 1996 assuming that the expected champs were bought and expected washouts shorted. As a starting point, Piotroski suggested [investors](/investor) start with a sample of the bottom 20% of the market in terms of [price-to-book](/price-to-bookratio) value.

Of course, with any investment system, seeing past outcomes doesn't mean it will work the same way from here on out.
