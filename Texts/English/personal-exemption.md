# Personal Exemption
## What Is a Personal Exemption?

The personal exemption was a federal income tax break up until 2017. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 disposed of the personal exemption for tax years 2018 to 2025. The exemption was reserved for a resource level of income, which was untaxed and gave an exemption for every person the taxpayer-supported. The taxpayer could claim the personal exemption for themselves, their spouse, and qualifying dependents.

For the 2017 tax year, the personal exemption was $4,050 per person. Dissimilar to deductions, the personal exemption was available to all taxpayers, no matter what their expenses.

Somewhere in the range of 2018 and 2025, there is no personal exemption due to new tax legislation. Notwithstanding, the standard deduction for most taxpayers has multiplied for that period. The higher standard deduction wipes out the requirement for some taxpayers to organize deductions. All things considered, it changes relying upon a taxpayer's filing status and doesn't take into consideration extra exemptions for dependents.

## Figuring out Personal Exemptions

The personal exemption was figured by counting up all eligible family individuals and increasing by a for every exemption dollar amount as claimed by the [filing status](/filingstatus). A single filer could claim one personal exemption for themselves. Head of household filers got themselves and could claim every dependent. Those filing jointly received credit for themselves, their spouse, and each qualified dependent.

At last, married filing separately taxpayers could claim themselves, dependents and spouse, as long as the spouse had zero gross income and was not claimed as a dependent by some other taxpayer. To claim an exemption for a dependent, they must be a qualifying child or a [qualifying relative](/qualifying-relative).

### Applying the Personal Exemption

The personal exemption was available to each taxpayer who couldn't be claimed as a dependent on another person's taxes. For instance, a college student who received the greater part of their financial support from their folks couldn't claim the exemption for oneself since their folks could claim the person in question as a dependent. Whether or not the guardians actually did so was unimportant; in light of the fact that they could, the student would have been ineligible for the personal exemption.

The personal exemption was subject to a phaseout (PEP) that continuously reduced the personal exemption of major league salary taxpayers by 2% for each $2,500 or fraction of adjusted gross income (AGI) surpassing $261,500 for single filers, $287,650 for a head of household filers, and $313,800 for joint filers. It phased out altogether for taxpayers with an AGI above $436,300.

The personal exemption was a below-the-line deduction subtracted from [adjusted gross income (AGI)](/agi) to reduce taxable income and, eventually, taxes with respect to your tax bracket. This reduction in taxable income implied its value differed with your marginal tax rate. In the event that you had a $4,050 personal exemption, your tax savings would be $608 in a 15% bracket and $1,418 in a 35% bracket. This value disparity increments as the income tax turns out to be more progressive.
