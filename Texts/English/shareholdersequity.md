# Shareholder Equity (SE)
## What Is Shareholders' Equity?
Shareholders' equity represents the net value of a company. As an accounting measure, shareholders' equity (likewise alluded to as stockholders' equity) is the difference between a company's [assets](/assets) and [liabilities](/liabilities). It is likewise called [book value](/bookvalue) of [equity](/equity).
Shareholders' equity is found at the lower part of a company's [balance sheet](/balancesheet), after assets and liabilities. What's more, as the balance sheet's name suggests, assets must approach the sum of liabilities and shareholders' equity. For publicly traded companies, the balance sheet is found in the financial statement documented quarterly and every year with the [Securities and Exchange Commission](/sec).
A few investors, however, don't see the book value of shareholders' equity as a meaningful measure for assessing the value of a company because it's based on historical data. Some would zero in on alternative valuation measures, for example, [market capitalization](/capitalization), which is calculated by multiplying a company's latest stock price by the number of [shares outstanding](/outstandingshares).
## Step by step instructions to Calculate Shareholders' Equity

#### Formula One
Shareholders' Equity = Assets - Liabilities

### 2. Sum of Its Parts
Shareholders' equity likewise can be calculated by adding the line things that would normally show up on a company's balance sheet: capital stock (common and preferred stock), [retained earnings](/retainedearnings), and other extensive income.
#### Formula Two
Shareholders' Equity = Capital Stock + Additional Paid-In Capital + Retained Earnings + Other Comprehensive Income

## What Items Are Included in Shareholders' Equity?
