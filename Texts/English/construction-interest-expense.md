# Construction Interest Expense
## What Is Construction Interest Expense?

Construction interest expense is an interest that collects on a construction loan used to develop a building or other long-lived business asset.

Ordinarily, interest paid on a loan is promptly expensed and is tax deductible however that isn't generally the case. For instance, construction interest expense that is incurred during the period up until the time the asset starts to deliver revenue is capitalized by adding it to the cost basis of the asset.

Construction [interest expense](/interestexpense) is dealt with uniquely in contrast to different types of business-related interest due to the idea of the business of construction.

## How Construction Interest Expense Works

Construction interest that is incurred on the construction of a structure planned for rental or business use isn't deductible at the time that it is paid. This type of interest is added to the cost basis of the asset all things considered. Therefore, it is otherwise called [capitalized interest](/capitalizedinterest).

Capitalized interest is not quite the same as expected interest expenses since it doesn't appear as an expense on an income statement from the company.

There are different instances of long-term assets that consider promoting interest, such as shipbuilding, production facilities, and real estate.

## Illustration of Construction Interest Expense in Real Estate

In real estate, for instance, when an owner takes out a construction loan to build another property, the interest due on the loan is incurred by the owner during the period that the new home is being fabricated.

While the building (we should expect it is a rental apartment building) is leased and starts to create income for the owner, then the interest, which has been gathering, is capitalized and turns out to be part of the cost basis of the building project.

## Alternative Example of Construction Interest Expense

For instance, XYZ corporation is building another modern estimated gadget press. XYZ corporation applies for a line of credit to purchase the parts and erect the gadget press and expectations it will find true success as a business venture.

Until the time the gadget press is completely functional and begins to deliver gadgets available to be purchased, the interest on the loan to build the gadget press will be added up. Next, it will be added to the cost basis of the gadget press, where it then will turn out to be part of the capitalized cost for the press.

This is an alternate treatment from XYZ corporation's all's other outstanding loans, where the interest is sorted as an expense right away and is tax deductible. It is feasible for the company to have various loans that were taken on a mission to develop the business.
