# Payout
## What Is a Payout?

Payouts allude to the expected financial returns or monetary disbursements from investments or annuities. A payout might be communicated on an overall or periodic basis and as either a percentage of the investment's cost or in a real dollar amount.

A payout can likewise allude to the period wherein an investment or a project is expected to recover its initial [capital investment](/capital-investment) and become negligibly productive. It is short for "time to payout," "term to payout," or "payout period."

## Figuring out Payout

In terms of financial securities, like annuities and dividends, payouts allude to the amounts received at given points in time. For instance, on account of a [annuity](/annuity), payouts are made to the annuitant at standard spans, like month to month or quarterly.

## Payout Ratio as a Measure of Distribution

There are two primary ways that companies can disperse earnings to investors: dividends and share buybacks. With dividends, payouts are made by corporations to their investors and can be as [cash dividends](/cashdividend) or [stock dividends](/stockdividend). The [payout ratio](/payoutratio) is the percentage rate of income the company pays out to investors as distributions. Some payout ratios incorporate the two dividends and share buybacks, while others just incorporate dividends.

For instance, a payout ratio of 20% means the company pays out 20% of company distributions. In the event that company A has $10 million in net income, it pays out $2 million to shareholders. Growth companies and recently formed companies will more often than not have low payout ratios. Investors in these companies depend more on share price appreciation for returns than dividends and share buybacks.

The payout ratio is calculated with the following formula:

- **Payout ratio** = total dividends/net income

The payout ratio can likewise incorporate share repurchases, in which case the formula is as follows:

- **Payout ratio** = (total dividends + share buybacks)/net income

The cash amount paid out to dividends can be found on the [cash flow statement](/cashflowstatement) in the section named cash flows from financing. Dividends and stock repurchases both address an outflow of cash and are classified as outflows on the cash flow statement.

## Payout and Payout Period as a Capital Budgeting Tool

The term "payout" may likewise allude to the capital budgeting instrument used to determine the number of years it takes for a project to pay for itself. Projects that take longer are viewed as less attractive than projects with a shorter period.

The payout, or payback period, is calculated by separating the initial investment by the cash inflow per period. On the off chance that company A burns through $1 million on a project that saves $500,000 per year for the next five years, the payout period is calculated by partitioning $1 million by $500,000. The response is two, and that means the project will pay for itself in two years.
