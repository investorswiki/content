# Cross-Currency Swap
## What Is a Cross-Currency Swap?

Cross-currency swaps are a [over-the-counter](/otc) (OTC) derivative in a form of an agreement between two gatherings to exchange interest payments and [principal](/principal) denominated in two unique currencies. In a cross-currency swap, interest payments and principal in one currency are exchanged for principal and interest payments in an alternate currency. Interest payments are exchanged at fixed intervals during the life of the agreement. Cross-currency swaps are exceptionally customizable and can include variable, [fixed interest rates](/fixedinterestrate), or both.

Since the two gatherings are swapping amounts of money, the cross-currency swap isn't required to be displayed on a company's [balance sheet](/balancesheet).

## Exchange of Principal

In cross-currency, the exchange utilized toward the beginning of the agreement is additionally commonly used to exchange the currencies back toward the finish of the agreement. For instance, in the event that a swap sees company A give company B \u00a310 million in exchange for $13.4 million, this suggests a GBP/USD [exchange rate](/exchangerate) of 1.34. Assuming the agreement is for a considerable length of time, toward the finish of the 10 years these companies will exchange similar amounts back to one another, typically at a similar exchange rate. The exchange rate in the market could be definitely divergent in 10 years, which could bring about [opportunity costs](/opportunitycost) or gains. All things considered, companies regularly utilize these products to [hedge](/hedge) or lock in rates or amounts of money, not conjecture.

The companies may likewise consent to [mark-to-market](/marktomarket) the notional amounts of the loan. This means that as the exchange rate changes small amounts of money are moved between the gatherings to redress. This keeps the loan values something similar on a marked-to-market basis.

## Exchange of Interest

A cross-currency swap can involve the two players paying a fixed rate, the two players paying a [floating rate](/floatinginterestrate), one party paying a floating rate while the other pays a fixed rate. Since these products are over-the-counter, they can be structured in a way the two gatherings need. Interest payments are normally calculated quarterly.

The interest payments are normally settled in cash, and not got out, since every payment will be in an alternate currency. Therefore, on payment dates, each company pays the amount it owes in the currency they owe it in.

## The Uses of Currency Swaps

Currency swaps are mainly utilized in three different ways.

In the first place, currency swaps can be utilized to purchase more affordable debt. This is finished by getting the best rate that anyone could hope to find of any currency and afterward exchanging it back to the ideal currency with [back-to-back loans](/backtobackloan).

Second, currency swaps can be utilized to hedge against foreign exchange rate vacillations. Doing so assists institutions with reducing the risk of being presented to large moves in currency prices which could decisively influence benefits/costs on the parts of their business presented to foreign markets.

Last, currency swaps can be involved by countries as a defense against a [financial crisis](/financial-crisis). Currency swaps permit countries to approach income by allowing other countries to borrow their own currency.

## Illustration of a Currency Swap

One of the most usually involved currency swaps is when companies in two unique countries exchange loan amounts. They both receive the loan they need, in the currency they need, yet based on better conditions than they could get by trying to get a loan in a foreign country all alone.

For instance, a US company, General Electric, is looking to procure Japanese [yen](/jpy-japanese-yen) and a Japanese company, Hitachi, is looking to gain U.S. dollars (USD), these two companies could perform a swap. The Japanese company probably has better access to Japanese debt markets and could get more positive terms on a yen loan than if the U.S. company went in straightforwardly to the Japanese debt market itself, and vice versa in the United States for the Japanese company.

Expect General Electric requirements \u00a5100 million. The Japanese company needs $1.1 million. On the off chance that they consent to exchange this amount, that infers a USD/JPY exchange rate of 90.9.

General Electric will pay 1% on the \u00a5100 million loan, and the rate will drift. This means assuming interest rates rise or fall, so will their interest payments.

Hitachi consents to pay 3.5% on their $1.1 million loan. This rate will likewise be floating. The gatherings could likewise consent to keep the interest rates fixed assuming they so want.

They consent to utilize the 3-month [LIBOR](/libor) rates as their interest rate benchmarks. Interest payments will be made quarterly. The [notional amounts](/notionalvalue) will be reimbursed in 10 years at a similar exchange rate they locked the currency-swap in at.

The difference in interest rates is due to the [economic conditions](/economic-conditions) in every country. In this model, at the time the cross-currency swap is instituted the interest rates in Japan are around 2.5% lower than in the U.S..

On the trade date, the two companies will exchange or swap the notional loan amounts.

Over the next 10 years, each party will pay the other interest. For instance, General Electric will pay 1% on \u00a5100 million quarterly, assuming interest rates stay something similar. That compares liken to \u00a51 million every year or \u00a5250,000 per quarter.

Toward the finish of the agreement, they will swap back the currencies at a similar exchange rate. They are not presented to exchange rate risk, yet they in all actuality do face opportunity costs or gains. For instance, if the USD/JPY exchange rate increases to 100 not long after the two companies lock into the cross-currency swap. The USD has increased in value, while the yen has diminished in value. Had General Electric held up a bit longer, they might have secured the \u00a5100 million while just exchanging $1.0 million instead of $1.1 million. All things considered, companies don't normally utilize these agreements to conjecture, they use them to lock in exchange rates for set periods of time.

## Features
- Interest rates can be fixed, variable, or a mix of both.
- Cross-currency swaps are not normally used to [speculate](/hypothesis), yet rather to lock in an exchange rate on a set amount of currency with a benchmarked (or fixed) interest rate.
- Cross-currency swaps are utilized to lock in exchange rates for set periods of time.
- These instruments trade OTC, and can consequently be customized by the gatherings involved.
