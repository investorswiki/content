The media effect is in many cases found in stock prices connected with earnings changes and in the [mortgage](/mortgage) market when [prepayment](/prepayment) rates can strongly increase following specific reports about the economy.

## The Media Effect Explained

With the 24-hour consistent pattern of media reporting and social media intensification, no company is safe from [headline risk](/headline-risk).

Proceeds from this sale are credited to the short seller's margin account.

The difference between the sale price and the purchase price addresses the short seller's profit or loss.

For instance, accept that TSLA is trading at $300 per share, and an investor accepts the price will decline in the close term as competition has increased. The investor may "get" shares from a broker, and sell them at the current price. At the point when a contender emerges with a comparable energy efficient vehicle model, and TSLA price drops to $290 as anticipated, they can then purchase the shares back and return them to their broker for a $10/share gain.
