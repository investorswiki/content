# Return on Total Assets (ROTA)
## What Is Return on Total Assets?

Return on total assets (ROTA) is a ratio that measures a company's [earnings](/earnings) before interest and taxes (EBIT) relative to its total net assets. It is defined as the ratio between net income and total average assets, or the amount of financial and operational income a company gets in a financial year as compared to the average of that company's total assets.

The ratio is viewed as an indicator of how successfully a company is utilizing its [assets](/asset) to generate earnings. EBIT is utilized rather than net profit to keep the measurement zeroed in on operating earnings without the influence of tax or financing differences when compared to comparative companies.

## Grasping Return on Total Assets

The greater a company's earnings in relation to its assets (and the greater the coefficient from this calculation), the more successfully that company is supposed to utilize its assets. The ROTA, communicated as a percentage or decimal, gives knowledge into how much money is generated from every dollar invested into the organization.

This allows the organization to see the relationship between its resources and its income, and it can give a point of comparison to decide whether an organization is utilizing its assets pretty much successfully than it had beforehand. In conditions where the company procures another dollar for every dollar invested in it, the ROTA is supposed to be one, or 100 percent.

To work out ROTA, partition net income by the average total assets in a given year, or for the trailing year period on the off chance that the data is accessible. A similar ratio can likewise be addressed as the product of profit margin and total asset turnover.

## Step by step instructions to Calculate ROTA

To compute ROTA, get the net income figure from a company's income statement, and afterward add back interest as well as taxes that were paid during the year. The subsequent number outcome is the company's EBIT.

The [EBIT](/ebit) number ought to then be separated by the company's total net assets to show the earnings that the company has generated for every dollar of assets on its books.

Total assets incorporate contra accounts for this ratio, implying that allowance for doubtful accounts and accumulated depreciation are both deducted from the total asset balance before working out the ratio.

## Limitations of Using Return on Total Assets (ROTA)

Over the long haul, the value of an asset might lessen or increase. On account of [real estate](/realestate), the value of the asset might rise. Then again, most mechanical bits of a business, like vehicles or other machinery, generally deteriorate after some time as wear and tear influence their value.

Since the ROTA formula utilizes the book values of assets from the balance sheet, it could be altogether downplaying the fixed assets' genuine market value. This prompts a higher ratio result that shows a return on total assets that is higher than it ought to be on the grounds that the denominator (total assets) is too low.

Another limitation is the means by which the ratio works with financed assets. In the event that a debt was utilized to buy an asset, the ROTA could look good, while the company may really be experiencing difficulty making its interest expense payments.

The ratio sources of info can be adjusted to mirror the assets' functional values while accounting for the [interest rate](/interestrate) presently being paid to a financial institution. For instance, in the event that an asset was acquired with funds from a loan with an interest rate of 5% and the return on the associated asset was a gain of 20%, then the adjusted ROTA would be 15%.

Since numerous fresher companies have higher amounts of debt associated with their assets, these changes might make the business look at less alluring without flinching of investors. When those debts start to clear, the ROTA will seem to in like manner move along.

## Features
- Some concern exists about ROTA depending on the book value of total assets as opposed to their market value, giving a return that looks higher than it ought to be in reality.
- The return on total assets shows how really a company utilizes its assets to generate earnings.
- The ROTA metric can be utilized to figure out which companies are reporting the most efficient utilization of their assets as compared with their earnings.
