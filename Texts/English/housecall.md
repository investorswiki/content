# House Call
## What Is a House Call?

A house call is a demand by a [brokerage firm](/brokerage-organization) that an account holder deposit sufficient cash to cover a shortfall in the amount of money deposited in a margin account. This typically follows losses in the investments bought on margin.

The call is made when the account balance has fallen below the [maintenance margin](/maintenancemargin) required by the brokerage firm. Assuming the client fails to make up the shortfall in the time determined by the house, the account holder's positions will be liquidated minus any additional notice until the base requirement is fulfilled.

## Understanding House Calls

The house call is a type of [margin call](/margincall). Investors who buy assets utilizing money borrowed from the brokerage firm, or "on margin," are required by the brokerage to hold a base amount of cash or securities on deposit to offset losses.

Buying on margin is utilized by investors who hope to duplicate their returns by increasing the number of shares they buy. They borrow money from the house to accomplish that goal. In the event that they succeed, and the price of the shares increases, they repay the loan and pocket the rest as profit. Assuming that they fail and the price of the shares falls, they owe the house. On the off chance that they owe more than they have deposited in reserve, they must compensate for any shortfall.

A house call goes out on the off chance that the investment falls in value below the amount of the required deposit. The investor can cover the shortfall by depositing more cash or selling different assets in the account.

At the point when a customer opens a margin account, up to half of the purchase price of the principal stock in the account can be borrowed by the customer as per [Regulation T](/regulationt) of the Federal Reserve Board. Individual brokerage firms have the caution to increase this percentage.

After a stock is purchased on margin, the [Financial Industry Regulatory Authority](/finra) (FINRA) forces further requirements on margin accounts. One expects that a brokerage hold no less than 25% of the market value of the securities purchased on margin. The brokerage firm might set a higher least.

> The base deposit might really depend on half, yet a few brokerages set a higher amount.

That number really turns into the house requirement for a deposit. At the point when a house call is issued, the account holder must meet the margin maintenance requirement inside a stated period.

Fidelity Investments, for instance, has a margin maintenance requirement that reaches from 30% to 100%, and its home call permits an account holder five business days to sell margin-qualified securities or deposit cash or margin-qualified securities, however Fidelity might cover the call out of the blue (portfolio margin accounts follow an alternate set of requirements). From that point onward, the firm will begin liquidating securities. Charles Schwab has a maintenance requirement that is normally 30%, so it can fluctuate with the security, however house calls are due "right away" by the firm.
