# Municipal Note
## What Is a Municipal Note?

A municipal note is debt issued by state and nearby governments to finance capital expenditures, for example, construction projects. Municipal notes are interesting to investors since they mature in one year or less, offer [fixed income](/fixedincome), and are frequently [exempt](/tax_exempt) from income tax at the federal as well as state levels.

## Understanding a Municipal Note

At the point when neighborhood or state governments choose to raise funds to finance a project that would benefit the region, they regularly opt for municipal notes. Municipal notes are short-term [debt securities](/debtsecurity) issued with maturity terms of 12 months, in spite of the fact that maturities can range from 90 days to three years.

A city government, for instance, may issue a municipal note to raise capital to finance another park in the city. Municipal notes are normally issued in anticipation of tax receipts, revenue, or proceeds from a bond issue.

## Special Considerations

While a majority of municipal bonds make interest payments semiannually, municipal notes will generally make just a single payment upon maturity, which incorporates both interest and principal payment obligations.

Municipal notes typically pay lower [coupons](/coupon) than corporate notes with comparative maturities, but since the yield is tax-free, the after-tax basis might be higher for a municipal bond. Municipal notes are exempt from federal income taxes and once in a while from state and nearby taxes too.

Investors can determine the risk of investing in a specific municipal note by looking at the ratings issued by Moody's and by Standard and Poor's. [Moody's](/moodys) gives municipal notes three potential ratings: MIG 1 (best quality), MIG 2 (high quality), and MIG 3 (adequate quality). [Standard and Poor's](/sp) utilizes a four-layered rating system: SP-1+, SP-1, SP-2, and SP-3. Just the initial three are viewed as worth investing in. SP-3 municipal notes are viewed as speculative.

## Types of Municipal Notes
### Bond Anticipation Notes

[Bond anticipation notes (BANs)](/bondanticipationnote) are issued in anticipation of long-term financing, which when issued is utilized to retire or pay off BANs. A borrowing entity that is due to start work on another project might choose to issue long-term bonds to finance the project. In any case, the issuance of these bonds may not be imaginable prior to the send off of the project due to certain legal, regulatory, or compliance procedures that could create a setback for giving new bonds.

At the point when the long-term bonds are issued, the proceeds are utilized to make the interest and principal payments on the BANs.

### Tax Anticipation Notes (TAN)

The interest and principal payments of [tax anticipation notes (TANs)](/tan) are secured by future tax revenue. TANs are issued by states or municipalities to finance current operations before tax revenues are received. At the point when the issuer gathers the taxes, the proceeds are then used to retire the tax anticipation notes.

### Revenue Anticipation Notes (RAN)

[Revenue anticipation notes (RANs)](/ran) are municipal notes whose interest and principal payments are secured by the anticipated non-tax revenue of a project. At the point when the project is completed and begins generating revenue sometime not too far off, the revenue is utilized to pay off the RAN.
