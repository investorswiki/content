# Conglomerate Boom
## What Was the Conglomerate Boom?

The conglomerate [boom](/boom) was a period of fast growth in the number of conglomerates, or big corporations comprised of many companies traversing numerous and frequently unrelated fields or industries.

## Grasping the Conglomerate Boom

The boom in [conglomerate formation](/conglomerate) happened in the period following World War II, thanks in part to low-interest rates that aided finance [leveraged buyouts](/leveragedbuyout). A series of economic tailwinds met up to establish an environment that upheld a prospering middle class. The conglomerate boom was coincident with the period currently viewed as The Golden Age of Capitalism.

The conglomerate boom happened during the 1960s thanks to low-interest rates and a market that vacillated between [bullish](/bull) and bearish, giving great buyout opportunities to getting companies.

The trigger for the conglomerate boom was the [Celler-Kefauver Act of 1950](/the-celler-kefauver-act) which restricted companies from developing through acquisitions of their rivals or providers. Consequently, organizations started searching somewhere else for growth and acquired companies in unrelated fields.

These companies were packaged as a firm-as-portfolio model. Notwithstanding, when interest rates started to rise again during the 1970s, a significant number of the biggest conglomerates were forced to veer off or sell a considerable lot of the companies they'd acquired, particularly when they'd just done as such to raise more loans and had failed to increase the proficiency of the companies they'd absorbed.

The [Federal Trade Commission](/ftc) (FTC) likewise became worried about the power used by conglomerates and started exploring their accounting books, leading many firms to break up. This was joined by the prevalence of ["bust-up" takeovers](/boom-and-bust-cycle) after Ronald Reagan came to power. Lenders bought large conglomerates and sold their constituent parts for a profit. A few held on and proved that conglomerates can be advantageous, particularly assuming they are very much enhanced. For instance, [Berkshire Hathaway](/berkshire-hathaway) is a conglomerate holding company that has worked effectively for a really long time.

## Conglomerates Today

Today, particularly in advanced economies like the U.S., the bargaining power of conglomerate corporate forms is surpassed by progressions in capital markets. For instance, numerous [monoline](/monoline), private companies approach something similar, while perhaps not more, levels of capital as even the biggest conglomerates of days of old.

Thusly, as a business or growth strategy, turning into a conglomerate doesn't offer a similar [economies of scale](/economiesofscale) as it once did. In fact, it's normal for individuals to allude to the private market as the new public market: to raise huge capital, a company never again should be publicly traded. The rise of venture capital and private equity plays had a big impact in this shift.

Besides, numerous businesses today really like to have some expertise in what they know best, while leasing, licensing, or partnering with other complementary businesses. This has cut into the once sacred operational economies of scale accepted to saturate all through conglomerates.

A former Navy man, Ling had a pizazz for risk. In 1959, he bought Altec Electronics, a maker of sound systems, and followed it up by getting Temco Aircraft, a rocket company. By 1960, LTV had turned into the fourteenth largest industrial company in the USA. Subsequent acquisitions by the company were a different set and incorporated a drugs company, a wire and cable company, and an outdoor supplies company.

The company's stock valuation arrived at new highs, empowering Ling to additional draw on capital for additional acquisitions. "It Is Theoretically Possible for the Entire United States to Become One Vast Conglomerate Presided Over by Mr. James L. Ling," declared the Saturday Evening Post in 1968. Ling's companies created revenues through astute accounting practices yet no profits.

However, the place of cards immediately unwound. The Justice Department got serious about LTV after its acquisition of a steel company. Its share price tumbled from $169 in 1967 to $4.25 in 1970, when James Ling was expelled from the company he established. LTV made due in some form through the 1980s, selling off its assets and rebranding itself as a steel company. Eventually, LTV closed down in 2000.
