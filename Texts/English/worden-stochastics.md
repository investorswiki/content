# Worden Stochastics
## What Is the Worden Stochastic?

The Worden Stochastics [indicator](/indicator) addresses the percentile rank of the latest closing price compared to every one of the other closing values over a predefined lookback period. Traders utilize the indicator to decide whether a specific security is [overbought](/overbought) or [oversold](/oversold), to give trade signals, and spot divergences that could signal a price reversal.

## Figuring out the Worden Stochastics

The Worden Stochastics indicator was planned by Peter Worden to perceive a new [trading range](/tradingrange) more rapidly than traditional [stochastics](/stochasticoscillator) . Dissimilar to traditional stochastics that consolidate high, low, and closing prices, the Worden Stochastics indicator utilizes rankings to abstain from over-weighting in exception periods, giving a possibly more accurate indication of the trading range.

The Worden Stochastic is calculated utilizing the equation: (100/n - 1) x Rank. "N" addresses the number of closing values in the reach, while "Rank" addresses the position of the closing price on a rundown that is arranged in ascending order by value.

Every single stochastic indicator, including Worden Stochastics, measure the level of the close relative to the reach throughout some stretch of time. Traders utilize these readings to decide whether a specific security is possibly trading at overbought or oversold levels.

## Trading with the Worden Stochastics

As a rule, stochastic readings over 80 are considered overbought, while readings below 20 are considered oversold. In any case, traders ought to attempt to affirm these feelings with other technical indicators or [chart patterns](/design). Overbought doesn't be guaranteed to mean the time has come to sell, nor does oversold essentially mean the time has come to buy. In a strong price uptrend, the stochastics readings will frequently arrive at over 80. In a strong downtrend, the readings will frequently be below 20.

The stochastic normally incorporates a [signal line](/signal_line). At the point when the stochastic crosses over the signal line, a few traders utilize that as a buy signal. At the point when the stochastic crosses below the signal line, that is a potential sell signal. Joining that concept with the ones examined over, a potential strategy is search for a stock (or another asset) in a rising trend. Then, at that point, sit tight for the Worden Stochastic to fall below 30 or 20. At the point when the stochastic crosses back over the signal line, or makes some genuine progress of the oversold region, think about a purchase. This isn't a strategy recommendation, just a model.

Likewise, traders might search for bullish or bearish [divergences](/divergence) between the security's price and stochastics trends. Assuming that the price is making higher tops while the stochastic is making lower tops, that could signal a potential downside reversal in the price. If the stochastic is making higher lows while the stock is making lower lows, that is bullish divergence and shows a possible turnaround in the price. Divergence is definitely not a solid timing signal. It ought to just be utilized related to different investigations and trade signals.

## The Worden Stochastics versus the Stochastic Oscillator

The Worden variation contrasts from other stochastics, whether the fast or slow variants, by means of how it is calculated. Most other stochastic indicators are contrasting the recent closing price with high and low values over a predefined period. Worden ranks the close relative to other closing values and afterward involves that rank in the calculation.

## Limitations of the Worden Stochastics

The indicator is inclined to giving various flawed signals. For instance, the indicator will remain in oversold or overbought domain for extended periods of time during a downtrend or uptrend, separately.

There are additionally different crossovers with the signal line that don't bring about huge price moves. Furthermore, price divergence with the indicator is definitely not a solid timing signal.

## Genuine Example of How to Use the Worden Stochastics

This Worden Stochastics model uses 1 through 5 as default settings (signal line in blue), cutting three complete Disney buy and sell cycles north of a four-month period.

The indicator turns around higher at the oversold level in April, however the price keeps on slashing sideways to lower in quiet price action. The indicator dips lower toward the beginning of May, posting a [double bottom](/doublebottom) reversal that translates into a rally wave enduring almost three weeks.

A mid-May crossover starts another sell cycle as the price pulls back to test new price [support](/support) close to 100. The indicator turns higher toward the beginning of June as the price pushes toward another high. As the price changes down, there is a bearish crossover and the stochastics slips once more into the oversold domain in late June. The overall trend is up as of now, so the next bullish crossover over the signal line might have been utilized to start a long trade close to the beginning of July.

The price and indicator rise. The indicator stays in overbought domain for quite a bit of July and early August. Any of the bearish crossovers could be utilized as sell signals. A drop below 80 by the stochastics could likewise be utilized as a sell signal.

## Highlights
- A perusing over 80 is considered overbought, while a perusing below 20 is considered oversold. This isn't really motivation to buy or sell. It just demonstrates the price is in the upper or lower portion of its recent closing price range.
- The Worden Stochastic is unique in relation to other stochastics in that it ranks closing prices, relegating a value in view of where the recent close ranks compared to prior closes.
- Like other stochastics, the Worden variant gives overbought and oversold levels, as well as potential trade signals utilizing signal line crossovers.
