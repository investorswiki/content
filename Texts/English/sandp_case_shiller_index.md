## Special Considerations

The Case-Shiller Home Price Indices are utilized as the underlying pricing mechanism in [Chicago Mercantile Exchange](/cme) (CME) real estate [futures](/futures) and [options](/choice). CME real estate futures and options trade on various indices, representing 10 unique MSAs, and a composite index that represents 20 metropolitan statistical areas.

They represent in any case, the key to the dependability of the indices. Put just, the caveat is that the indices are perfect representations of the housing market. That is on the grounds that they remember just single-family homes for their estimations. Besides, in light of the fact that a portion of the metropolitan areas are so large (like New York City or Los Angeles), having just one value may not precisely represent all areas inside that city.
