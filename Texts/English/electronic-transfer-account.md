An electronic transfer account (ETA) is a bank account for federal payment beneficiaries who don't have checking or savings accounts. ETAs give an alternative to getting federal payments with a money order for [Social Security](/socialsecurity), SSI, and the Railroad Retirement Board.

ETAs are additionally accessible for Office of Personnel Management (OPM) retirement, veterans benefits, DOL/dark lung, and civilian or military wages. An ETA permits the beneficiary to receive their federal transfer payment by [direct deposit](/directdeposit).

Contingent upon the account terms, money can be removed from the account over the counter, at an ATM, or through debit card purchases.
