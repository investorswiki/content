# MSCI EMU Index
## What Is the MSCI EMU Index?

The MSCI EMU Index is a market capitalization-weighted index maintained by MSCI that represents 10 developed markets in the EMU.

## Understanding the MSCI EMU Index

The MSCI EMU Index is Morgan Stanley's eurozone market [capitalization](/capitalization)- weighted equity index. The index tracks mid-and [large-cap](/large-cap) companies in 10 developed markets in the European Economic and Monetary Union (EMU) which include Austria, Belgium, Finland, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, the Netherlands, Portugal, and Spain. Generally 85% of the EMU's free float-adjusted market capitalization is covered by the index.

Morgan Stanley launched the EMU Index in April 1998. The methodology of the index is based on MSCI Global Investable Market Indexes. As per the reality sheet, the methodology is "a comprehensive and consistent approach to index construction that considers meaningful global views and cross-regional comparisons across all market capitalization size, [sector](/sector) and style segments and blends." In essence, component companies are adjusted for available float and must meet objective criteria for inclusion in the Index.

The MSCI EMU Index seeks to measure the performance of the equity market of the EMU member countries, which includes those members of the [European Union](/europeanunion) (EU) that have adopted the [euro](/euro) as their currency. The MSCI EMU Index Fund invests in a representative sample of securities included in the Index that collectively has an investment profile like the index.

As of August 2021, the index is comprised of 237 constituents. The index's top five constituents, alongside their index weight and sector, are:

1. ASML Hldg (5.11%) - Information technology
1. LVMH Moet Hennessy (3.86%) - [Consumer discretionary](/consumer-discretionary)

## Special Considerations

[Index investing](/index-investing) is considered to be a passive investment strategy that tries to profit from returns that imitate a broad index while diversifying against risk. That is because the index fund has a broad mix of assets instead of just a small number of investments. To capture these returns, investors purchase shares in [exchange-traded funds](/etf) (ETFs). These funds track the underlying index.

Anyone in the United States who needs to invest in the MSCI EMU can do as such through the iShares MSCI Eurozone ETF. This fund is designed to follow the price and yield performance of publicly-traded securities in the aggregate in the European Monetary Union markets as measured by the MSCI MU Index.
