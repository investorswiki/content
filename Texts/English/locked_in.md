## What Is Locked In?

Locked in portrays a situation wherein an investor is unwilling or unfit to trade a security in light of regulations, taxes, or punishments associated with doing so. This might happen in a [investment vehicle](/investmentvehicle, for example, a [retirement](/retirement) plan that an employee may not access before a predefined retirement date.

## Understanding Locked In

On the off chance that there is an increase in the value of [stocks](/stock) held by an individual, the shareholder will be subject to a [capital-gains tax](/capital_gains_tax), for certain exemptions. To reduce the tax burden, an investor could shelter these gains in a retirement account. The individual is considered locked in since, supposing that a portion of this investment is removed prior to maturity, the owner will be taxed at a higher rate than if they had paused.

Locked-in securities can portray stock, [options](/choice), and [warrants](/warrant) offered to employees under incentive programs that advance company loyalty and empower strong performance. A considerable lot of these programs accompany mandatory [vesting periods](/vesting) during which the employee has been conceded the securities yet may not yet exercise them (meaning switched over completely to cash or stock).

Regularly, such shares or warrants must be held for quite some time before they can be [exercised](/exercise). There might be phases of the locked-in period when, at stipulated intervals, the shares change ownership or tax status.

Even after options or warrants have been changed over into stock and allowed to an employee, there might be one more holding period before they can sell those shares. In such instances, the employees normally receive the options at the [market price](/market-price) at the time they were conceded, which might address a deep discount to the market price when they are exercised. Depending on when the stock is sold, the proceeds may be taxed at a lower rate than initially forced.

## Purposes behind Locked-In Shares

At the point when a company dispatches a [initial public offering](/ipo) (IPO), or a first-time issue of its stock to the overall population, there might be secure in limitations on shares held by founders, advertisers, and other early supporters of the company. This is to disallow these individuals, as company [insiders](/insider), from selling or transferring shares during the IPO period, when they could have advantageous company information that outside investors don't.

This period could last 90 days or even several years after the IPO. A lock-in period mitigates the possibility of such manipulation by restricting insider trades.

Executives and senior management could likewise be compensated with locked-in shares that are not delivered for a while after they are initially conceded in order to energize prevalent performance.
