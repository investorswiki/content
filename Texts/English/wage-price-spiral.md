# Wage-Price Spiral
## What Is the Wage-Price Spiral?

The wage-price spiral is a macroeconomic theory used to make sense of the circumstances and logical results relationship between rising wages and rising prices, or inflation. The wage-price spiral proposes that rising wages increase [disposable income](/disposableincome) raising the demand at goods and making costs rise. Rising prices increase demand for higher wages, which prompts higher production costs and further vertical pressure on prices making a reasonable spiral.

## The Wage-Price Spiral and Inflation

The wage-price spiral is an economic term that depicts the phenomenon of price increases because of higher wages. At the point when workers receive a wage climb, they demand more goods and services and this, thusly, makes prices rise. The wage increase effectively increases general [business expenses](/businessexpenses) that are given to the consumer as higher prices. It is basically a perpetual loop or cycle of predictable price increases. The wage-price spiral mirrors the causes and results of inflation, and it is, thusly, characteristic of Keynesian economic theory. It is otherwise called the cost-push beginning of inflation. One more reason for inflation is known as demand-pull inflation, which monetary scholars accept starts with the [money supply](/moneysupply).

## How a Wage-Price Spiral Begins

A wage-price spiral is brought about by the effect of supply and demand on aggregate prices. Individuals who earn more than the [cost of living](/cost-of-living) select an allocation mix among savings and consumer spending. As wages increase, so does a consumer's propensity to both save and consume.

Assuming the lowest pay permitted by law of an economy increased, for instance, it would make consumers inside the economy purchase more product, which would increase demand. The rise in [aggregate demand](/aggregatedemand) and the increased wage burden make businesses increase the prices of products and services. In spite of the fact that wages are higher, the increase in prices makes workers demand even higher salaries. In the event that higher wages are conceded, a spiral where prices consequently increase might happen rehashing the cycle until wage levels can at this point not be upheld.

Posen, **Inflation Targeting: Lessons from the International Experience,** dug into the past benefits and weaknesses of inflation targeting to perceive whether there is a net positive in its utilization as a monetary policy rule.
