# Regression
## What Is Regression?

Regression is a statistical method utilized in finance, investing, and different disciplines that endeavors to decide the strength and character of the relationship between one dependent variable (for the most part signified by Y) and a series of different variables (known as independent variables).

Regression helps investment and financial managers to value assets and grasp the relationships between variables, for example, [commodity prices](/commodity) and the stocks of organizations dealing in those commodities.

## Regression Explained

The two fundamental types of regression are simple linear regression and different linear regression, despite the fact that there are non-linear regression methods for additional confounded data and analysis. Simple linear regression utilizes one independent variable to make sense of or anticipate the outcome of the dependent variable Y, while numerous linear regression utilizes at least two independent variables to foresee the outcome.

Regression can help finance and investment experts as well as experts in different organizations. Regression can likewise assist with anticipating sales for a company in light of climate, previous sales, GDP growth, or different types of conditions. The [capital asset pricing model](/capm) (CAPM) is a frequently utilized regression model in finance for pricing assets and finding costs of capital.

The general form of each type of regression is:

- **Simple linear regression:** Y = a + bX + u
- **Different linear regression:** Y = a + b~1~X~1~ ^+^ b~2~X~2~ + b~3~X~3~ + ... + b~t~X~t~ + u

Where:

- Y = the variable that you are attempting to anticipate (dependent variable).
- X = the variable that you are utilizing to foresee Y (independent variable).
- a = the catch.
- b = the incline.
- u = the regression residual.

Regression takes a group of [random variables](/random-variable), remembered to foresee Y, and attempts to track down a mathematical relationship between them. This relationship is commonly as a straight line (linear regression) that best approximates every one of the individual data points. In numerous regression, the separate variables are separated by utilizing addendums.

## A Real World Example of How Regression Analysis Is Used

Regression is frequently used to decide the number of specific factors like the price of a commodity, interest that rates, specific industries, or sectors influence the price movement of an asset. The previously mentioned CAPM depends on regression, and it is used to project the expected returns for stocks and to produce costs of capital. A stock's returns are relapsed against the returns of a more extensive index, like the S&P 500, to create a beta for the specific stock.

Beta is the stock's risk according to the market or index and is reflected as the slant in the CAPM model. The return for the stock being referred to would be the dependent variable Y, while the independent variable X would be the market risk premium.

Extra variables like the market capitalization of a stock, valuation ratios, and recent returns can be added to the CAPM model to get better gauges for returns. These extra factors are known as the Fama-French factors, named after the teachers who developed the different linear regression model to better make sense of asset returns.
