# Symmetrical Distribution
## What Is Symmetrical Distribution?

A symmetrical distribution happens when the values of variables show up at normal frequencies and frequently the [mean](/mean), [median](/median), and [mode](/mode) all happen at a similar point. Assuming a line were drawn taking apart the middle of the graph, it would uncover different sides that mirror another.

In graphical form, symmetrical distributions might show up as a [normal distribution](/normaldistribution) (i.e., [bell curve](/bell-curve)). Symmetrical distribution is a core concept in technical trading as the price action of an asset is assumed to fit a symmetrical distribution curve over the long run.

Symmetrical distributions can be diverged from [asymmetrical distributions](/asymmetrical-distribution), which is a likelihood distribution that exhibits [skewness](/skewness) or different anomalies in its shape.

## What Does a Symmetrical Distribution Tell You?

Symmetrical distributions are utilized by traders to lay out the value area for a stock, currency, or commodity on a set time span. This time period can be intraday, like 30-minute intervals, or it tends to be longer-term utilizing meetings or even long stretches of time. A bell curve can be drawn around the price points hit during that time span and it is expected that the vast majority of the price action — roughly 68% of price points — will fall inside one standard deviation of the center of the curve. The curve is applied to the y-hub (price) as it is the variable though time all through the period is essentially linear. So the area inside one standard deviation of the mean is the value area where price and the real value of the asset are generally closely matched.

Assuming the price action removes the asset price from the value area, then it recommends that price and value are crooked. In the event that the breach is to the lower part of the curve, the asset is viewed as undervalued. Assuming that it is to the highest point of the curve, the asset is to be overvalued. The assumption is that the asset will return to the mean after some time. At the point when traders talk about [reversion to the mean](/meanreversion), they are alluding to the symmetrical distribution of price action over the long haul that varies above and below the average level.

> The [central limit theorem](/central_limit_theorem) states that the distribution of sample approximates a normal distribution (i.e., becomes symmetric) as the sample size increases, no matter what the population distribution — including asymmetric ones.

## Illustration of How Symmetrical Distribution Is Used

Symmetrical distribution is most frequently used to put price action into setting. The further the price action meanders from the value area one standard deviation on each side of the mean, the greater the likelihood that the underlying asset is being under or overvalued by the market. This perception will recommend likely trades to place in view of how far the price action has meandered from the mean for the time span being utilized. On bigger time scales, nonetheless, there is a lot greater risk of missing the genuine [entry](/entry-point) and [exit points](/exit-point).

## Symmetrical Distributions versus Asymmetrical Distributions

Something contrary to symmetrical distribution is asymmetrical distribution. A distribution is asymmetric on the off chance that it isn't symmetric with zero skewness; all in all, it doesn't skew. An asymmetric distribution is either left-skewed or right-skewed. A left-skewed distribution, which is known as a negative distribution, has a more extended left tail. A right-skewed distribution, or a positively skewed distribution, has a more drawn out right tail. Deciding if the mean is positive or negative is important while examining the skew of a data set since it influences data distribution analysis. A [log-normal distribution](/log-normal-distribution) is a commonly-refered to asymmetrical distribution highlighting right-skew.

Skewness is much of the time an important part of a dealer's analysis of a potential investment return. A symmetrical distribution of returns is evenly distributed around the mean. An asymmetric distribution with a positive right skew shows that historical returns that digressed from the mean were basically focused on the bell curve's left side.

On the other hand, a negative left skew shows historical returns veering off from the mean focused on the right half of the curve.

## Limitations of Using Symmetrical Distributions

A common investment refrain is that past performance doesn't guarantee future outcomes; in any case, past performance can outline designs and give knowledge to traders hoping to settle on a conclusion about a position. Symmetrical distribution is an overall principle of thumb, however regardless of the time span utilized, there will frequently be periods of asymmetrical distribution on that time scale. This means that, albeit the bell curve will generally return to evenness, there can be periods of deviation that lay out another mean for the curve to center on. This likewise means that trading dependent exclusively upon the value area of a symmetrical distribution can be risky on the off chance that the trades are not confirmed by other technical indicators.

## Features
- In finance, data-producing processes with symmetrical distributions can assist with informing trading decisions.
- A symmetrical distribution is one where splitting the data down the middle produces mirror pictures.
- True price data, nonetheless, will more often than not display asymmetrical characteristics like right-skewness.
- Having a symmetrical distribution is valuable for dissecting data and making derivations in light of statistical procedures.
- Bell curves are a commonly-refered to illustration of symmetrical distributions.
## FAQ
### What Is the Relationship Between Mean, Median, and Mode in a Symmetrical Distribution?
In a symmetrical distribution, every one of the three of these descriptive statistics will generally be a similar value, for example in a normal distribution (bell curve). This additionally holds in other symmetric distributions, for example, the [uniform distribution](/uniform-distribution) (where all values are indistinguishable; portrayed basically as a horizontal line) or the binomial distribution, which accounts for discrete data that can take on one of two values (e.g., zero or one, yes or no, true or false, etc.).On rare events, a symmetrical distribution might have two modes (neither of which are the mean or median), for example in one that would seem like two indistinguishable ridges equidistant from each other.
### What Is Symmetric versus Asymmetric Data?
Symmetric data is seen when the values of variables show up at standard frequencies or intervals around the mean. Asymmetric data, then again, may have skewness or noise with the end goal that the data shows up at sporadic or aimless intervals.
### Is the Median Symmetric?
The median portrays the place where half of data values lie above, and half lie below. Subsequently it is the mid-point of the data. In a symmetrical distribution, the median will continuously be the mid-point and make a mirror picture with the median in the middle. This isn't the case for an asymmetric distribution.
### What Is the Shape of a Frequency Distribution?
The "shape" of the frequency distribution of data is essentially its graphical representation (for example as a bell curve, and so on.). Picturing the state of the data can assist analysts with rapidly understanding in the event that it is symmetrical or not.
