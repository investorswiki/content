# Community Reinvestment Act (CRA)
## What is the Community Reinvestment Act?
The Community Reinvestment Act was enacted by Congress in 1977 to encourage banks and thrifts to assist with addressing the requirements of the networks where they operate, including low and moderate-pay areas. Under the CRA, insured depository institutions are assessed intermittently to evaluate their efforts to support their networks. The record is then used to assess applications for future branch openings, bank mergers, contracts and bank acquisitions.

Many banks redlined certain parts of urban communities and would not loan to individuals and businesses in those areas. This passed on most run down areas without access to capital to renew their areas, beside government investment. The CRA outlawed redlining. Since its enactment, the CRA has advanced to likewise incorporate rural networks.
Depository institutions that are regulated by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), [the Federal Reserve System](/federal-reserve), the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. furthermore, the Office of Thrift Supervision are subject to reporting requirements. The OCC is responsible for assessing banks' records of assisting networks with meeting their credit needs.
Regulators utilize several indicators to assess depository institutions' compliance with the CRA, yet banks are not subject to lending amounts. They are not required to meet a certain number of loans or make a certain percentage of loans to their nearby networks. Moreover, the CRA doesn't command that banks make high-risk loans that would compromise the institution's financial stability.
Under the CRA regulations:
- Small banks with assets of under $1.202 billion are assessed through a streamlined interaction that spotlights on the bank's lending performance.
- Intermediate small banks with assets of more than $300 million and under $1.202 billion are assessed through a test that surveys lending, qualified investments, and services offered to the community to encourage its development.
- Large retail banks with assets of $1.202 at least billion are assessed by their lending and investment activity, and community development services.

The CRA permits any depository institution, no matter what its size or strategy, to be assessed. Doing so allows institutions to foster performance plans, in view of the community's business needs, and with community input.

- Outstanding
- Satisfactory
- Requirements to get to the next level
- Substantial noncompliance

On average, the OCC assesses banks at regular intervals, yet small banks are assessed less oftentimes. Banks with assets of $250 million or less that receive an overall CRA rating of satisfactory or outstanding may not be assessed by the CRA more than like clockwork or 60 months, individually.
