# Attorney's Fee Awards
## What Are Attorney's Fee Awards?

Attorney's fee awards allude to the order of the payment of the attorney fees of one party by another party. In the U.S., each party in a legal case normally pays for his/her own attorney fees, under a principle known as the American rule.

## Understanding Attorney's Fee Awards

Attorney's fee awards rely upon the law of jurisdiction and, at times, the watchfulness of the judge directing a matter. At times, the award isn't contingent upon the level of court in which the case is attempted. For instance, a state court might award attorney's fees for a case including federal laws or statutes. The practice of ordering the losing side in a case to pay for the triumphant side's legal fees is otherwise called fee-shifting.

In numerous different countries, the losing side generally pays generally legal fees engaged with a case. Even in the United States, notwithstanding, courts can, now and again, order the losing side to pay for the triumphant party's attorney fees.

## At the point when Attorney's Fee Awards May Be Granted

The court might order the losing party in a case to pay the triumphant party's legal fees when a statute, case law, or a contract permits the fruitful prosecutor to get legal fees from the fruitless defendant. Attorney's fee awards are conceded in a number of cases, for example, [class-activity lawsuits](/classaction), civil rights infringement, and copyright and patent encroachments or questions. A few instances of the types of statutes that permit shifting fees to the losing party in litigation include:

- Consumer protection statutes;
- Civil rights statutes, particularly those planned to prevent discrimination in public facilities or work;
- Environmental protection statutes; and
- Different statutes planned to safeguard the public great or the public interest.

To get an attorney's fee award, the prosecutor seeking such an award must demonstrate both that the fees being referred to have, as a matter of fact, been incurred and that they are reasonable.

## Deciding the Amount of Attorney's Fee Awards

The genuine amount awarded may not be guaranteed to rise to the amount paid by the party seeking the award; many courts utilize the north star method of billing, which duplicates reasonable expected billable hours by a reasonable hourly rate. The court will think about the attorney's experience and ability and figure out what an attorney of comparative skill could charge in the community in which the court sits.

To decide a reasonable number of hours, the candidate can bill for similar amount of time as they would have the option to bill their own clients, excluding claims on which they were fruitless, hours are not satisfactorily recorded, and work that is considered pointless, extreme, or excess. By and large, the candidate can be awarded compensation for any expenses that would regularly be paid by a client.
