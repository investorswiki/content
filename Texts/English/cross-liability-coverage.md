# Cross-Liability Coverage
## What Is Cross-Liability Coverage?

Cross-liability coverage is a clause in a commercial insurance contract. At the point when an insurance contract covers numerous parties, cross-liability gives coverage to the two players if one makes a claim against the other.

Cross-liability coverage treats the various parties — covered under a similar contract — as though they have their own separate policies.

## Grasping Cross-Liability Coverage

At the point when two covered parties secure cross-liability coverage, one insured party can sue one more insured party even when the two players are under a similar policy. Standard liability insurance normally incorporates a cross-liability clause known as a "Separation of Insureds" agreement.

An insurance contract that incorporates cross-liability coverage will ordinarily have stating like this: "Each insured claimed against under this policy will be dealt with, at the hour of the claim, as though they were the main insured under the policy."

Commercial insurance contracts commonly have cross-liability coverage. The clause permits the various parties remembered for the contract to be dealt with separately in certain circumstances (while in different circumstances, they are dealt with something similar).

For a situation where the parties are dealt with separately during a claims suit, they are not all given a separate coverage limit. This difference means that a [aggregate limit](/aggregatelimit) still applies to the total coverage given by the policy. Business [liability insurance](/liability_insurance) policies might avoid coverage for intercompany lawsuits, accordingly dispensing with the "Separation of Insureds" feature at times.

For instance, the establishing partners of a law firm might sue each other for damages or wounds that each party demands that the other caused. Companies that need to guarantee against this type of risk should purchase an intercompany product suit exclusion.

Numerous [commercial general liability](/commercial-general-liability-cgl) insurance policies as of now have language tending to cross-liability coverage and don't have exclusions for this type of event. Since no exclusion is involved, a separate endorsement is superfluous. In any case, some liability policies contain insured-versus-insured exclusions that really dispose of cross-liability coverage.

## Illustration of Cross-Liability Coverage

Assume there is an automobile company that shares a liability policy with its auxiliaries, which fabricate different parts. The parent company is responsible for gathering the vehicle, while the auxiliaries make the parts. In light of a flawed part in one of the cars that the automobile company fabricates, a number of road mishaps happen. This outcomes in claims made against the automobile manufacturer. Under the Separation of Insureds feature of the cross-liability coverage policy, the parent company sues one of its auxiliaries.

The cross-liability endorsement is one explanation [general liability insurance](/business-insurance) is so essential to safeguard the financial assets of any business.
