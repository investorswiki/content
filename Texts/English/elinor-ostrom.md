1. **Usage of common resources must be monitored**: Users of the resource must be made accountable for not following defined rules and limits.
1. **Sanctions for violators of the defined rules ought to be graduated**: Rather than an immediate ban on access to the resource, violators are first exposed to a system of alerts, fines, and casual reputational results.
1. **Conflicts ought to be settled effectively and informally**: Low-cost dispute resolution in regards to the resource empowering compliance.
1. **Higher-level specialists perceive the laid out rules and self-governance of resource users**: Governments or other regional specialists ought to preferably perceive and back up, or possibly not subvert, collective action agreements, institutions, and conflict resolution.
1. **Common resource management ought to consider regional resource management**: Responsibility for overseeing the regional resources ought to begin from the littlest nearby level and incorporate the whole interconnected system, for example, on account of dealing with a regional stream.
