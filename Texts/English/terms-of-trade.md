# Terms of Trade (TOT)
## What Are Terms of Trade (TOT)?

Terms of trade (TOT) address the ratio between a country's [export](/export) prices and its [import](/import) prices. TOT indexes are defined as the value of a country's total exports minus total imports. The ratio is calculated by separating the price of the exports by the price of the imports and duplicating the outcome by 100.

At the point when more capital is leaving the country than is entering the country then, the TOT will be under 100%. At the point when the TOT is greater than 100%, the country is gathering more capital from exports than it is spending on imports.

## Grasping Terms of Trade (TOT)

The TOT is utilized as an indicator of a country's economic wellbeing, yet it can lead analysts to draw some unacceptable ends. Changes in import prices and export prices impact the TOT, and it's important to comprehend what made the price increase or lessening. TOT measurements are frequently kept in a [index](/index) for economic monitoring purposes.

An improvement or increase in a country's TOT generally demonstrates that export prices have gone up as import prices have either kept up with or dropped. Then again, export prices could have dropped however not as altogether as import prices. Export prices could stay consistent while import prices have diminished or they could have essentially increased at a quicker pace than import prices. This multitude of situations can bring about a better TOT.

## Factors Affecting Terms of Trade

A country can purchase more imported goods for each unit of export that it sells when its TOT gets to the next level. An increase in the TOT can hence be beneficial on the grounds that the country needs less exports to buy a given number of imports.

It could likewise decidedly affect domestic [cost-push inflation](/costpushinflation) when the TOT increases in light of the fact that the increase is indicative of falling import prices to export prices. The country's export volumes could fall to the weakness of the [balance of payments](/bop) (BOP), in any case.

The country must export a greater number of units to purchase similar number of imports when its TOT deteriorates. The Prebisch-Singer hypothesis states that a few developing markets and emerging nations have encountered declining TOTs in light of a summed up decrease in the price of items relative to the price of manufactured goods.

## TOT Example

Agricultural nations experienced increases in their terms of trade during the commodity price boom in the mid 2000s. They could buy additional consumer goods from different countries while selling a certain quantity of products, like oil and copper.

In the past twenty years, in any case, a rise in [globalization](/globalization) has discounted the price of manufactured goods. Industrialized countries' benefit over non-industrial nations is turning out to be less critical.
