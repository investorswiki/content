## What Was Bre-X Minerals Ltd.?

Bre-X Minerals Ltd., frequently alluded to just as Bre-X, was a Canadian gold mining company that scandalously [defrauded](/fraud) investors by distorting gold examples and misquoting its accessible gold reserves.

From a pinnacle valuation of more than $6 billion Canadian dollars ([CAD](/cad-canadian-dollar)), Bre-X's shares collapsed and the company before long petitioned for [bankruptcy](/bankruptcy). Among the numerous survivors of the Bre-X scandal were Canadian [pension funds](/pensionplan, for example, the Ontario Teachers Pension Plan and the Quebec Public Sector Pension Fund, which confronted combined losses of more than $150 million CAD.

## Understanding Bre-X Minerals Ltd.

Bre-X was founded in 1988 by David Walsh, a Canadian businessman with a foundation in the finance and energy sectors. In 1993, at the command of Walsh's business partner John Felderhof, the company started gold exploration close to the Busang River in Indonesia, with geologist Michael de Guzman employed as the exploration manager.

Through a series of communications, the company proceeded to report several large vertical updates to the estimated gold items in their Indonesian site. These evaluations moved from 2 million ounces to a pinnacle of 70 million ounces in 1997. Appropriately, market participants responded by bidding up the market value of Bre-X's shares.

The scam disentangled quickly in March 1997, after de Guzman purportedly tumbled to his death from a helicopter over the Indonesian wilderness, soon after potential Busang project partner, Freeport-McMoran (FCX), said that its [due diligence](/duediligence) had revealed just insignificant measures of gold at the property. Bre-X plunged on the news and was [delisted](/delisting) from major stock exchanges in May 1997. Simultaneously, it cleared out billions of dollars for its hapless investors, which included major Canadian pension plans and other institutional investors.

With the exceptionally suspicious death of Michael de Guzman in 1997, as well as the subsequent death by natural reasons for David Walsh himself, John Felderhof stayed the main enduring character from the Bre-X debacle.
