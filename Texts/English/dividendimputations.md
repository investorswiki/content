# Dividend Imputation
## What Is Dividend Imputation?

Dividend imputation is a tax policy utilized in Australia and several different countries that takes out the [double taxation](/double_taxation) of cash payouts from a corporation to its [shareholders](/shareholder).

The contention behind dividend imputation is that [dividends](/dividend), as usually took care of under tax law, are an illustration of double taxation. That is, a corporation has paid taxes on the income that it then disperses to shareholders as dividends. This after-tax income is then taxed again when the shareholder reports the dividends as income.

## Figuring out Dividend Imputation

Double taxation is managed through tax credits. Using [tax credits](/taxcredit) called [franking credits](/frankingcredit) or imputed tax credits, the tax specialists are informed that a company has previously paid the required income tax on the income it circulates as dividends. The shareholder doesn't then owe taxes on the dividend income.

For instance, on the Australian Gov. Taxation Office website, it states, "Albeit the beneficiaries are taxed on the full amount of the profit addressed by the distribution and the connected franking credits, they are permitted a credit for the tax previously paid by the corporate tax entity."

The distribution accompanies the franking credits and is then used to offset the taxes.

> The dividend statement will detail the amount of the dividend imputation, expressing the tax credit, and will be deducted from a singular's annual taxable income.
>

The policy is known as imputation since it credits, or "attributes," taxes owed by the corporation to its shareholders.

Australia, Canada, Chile, Korea, Mexico, and New Zealand have established dividend imputation systems.

Advocates of imputation contend that this double taxation makes corporations favor [taking on debt](/debtfinancing) over [issuing stock shares](/equityfinancing) when they need to raise cash. They additionally may make companies bound to hold their cash instead of distributing it to shareholders. The effect, they battle, is to drag down economic growth.

## Dividend Imputation Around the World

In countries where dividend imputation is offered, it is regularly offered as a tax credit. That is, the shareholder's taxable income on the dividends is diminished by a credit that mirrors the taxes paid by the company on the cash that was distributed.

Dividend imputation has had a mixed history among nations, as the conditions of every nation's tax system brief differing applications. Nine countries that once offered such an arrangement have either changed or ended the practice. These countries incorporate the accompanying:

- United Kingdom
- Ireland
- Germany
- Singapore
- Italy
- Finland
- France
- Norway
- Malaysia

The United Kingdom and Ireland, for instance, recently offered partial imputation with tax credits that effectively diminished taxation on the dividends by 12.5% to 25%.

The partial imputation in the United Kingdom gave a 20% refund against a 33% [corporate tax rate](/corporatetax). Starting in 1997, notwithstanding, the government created some distance from this policy, first by killing the refund to tax-exempt shareholders that included pension funds. In 1999, the refund rate was cut to 10%.

Germany, Finland, Norway, and France all recently offered full dividend imputation. France offered tax credits equivalent to half of the face value of the dividend.

Germany got rid of its dividend imputation program with the intent of decreasing the country's corporate tax rate. Finland, similarly, brought down its corporate tax rate after dividend imputation was canceled. Norway, then again, didn't bring down its corporate tax rate when dividend imputation ended.

After canceling imputation, a large portion of these countries taxed dividends at a rate of half or greater.
