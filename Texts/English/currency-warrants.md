# Currency Warrants
## What Are Currency Warrants?

A currency warrant is a financial instrument used to hedge currency risk or estimate on currency changes in foreign exchange (forex) markets. A currency [warrant](/warrant), like other [options](/optionscontract) contracts, gets its value from the [underlying](/underlying-security) exchange rate, where a warrant's value goes up as the underlying ascents and a put warrant's value goes up when the underlying price falls, like a [call option](/calloption).

Some long-term currency call options (with expiration dates in excess of a year) are alluded to as warrants.

The other common utilization of currency warrants is to conjecture on the movement of exchange rates and earn a profit in the event that your view is right. The additional [leverage](/leverage) in currency warrants permits users to gain more exposure to exchange rate movements. In an uncertain macro environment, currency warrants offer those with foreign currency exposure a longer-term solution for the purpose of hedging.
