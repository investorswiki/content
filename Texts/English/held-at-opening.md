# Held at the Opening
## What is Held at the Opening?

Held at the opening is the point at which a security is restricted from trading at the [stock exchange's daily opening](/openingbell). Trading in the security might be halted for different reasons, however is commonly an impermanent situation which defers the official opening of that security.

## Understanding Held at the Opening

Held at the opening is in effect if a trading [halt](/tradinghalt) is called on a stock before the opening of the trading day. Stock exchanges can halt trading on securities whenever, however trading normally continues in less than 60 minutes. Such halts are employed to safeguard investors.

There are three primary justifications for why a stock is held at the opening:

- New data is expected to be delivered by a company that might significantly affect its stock price.
- There is a large imbalance in buy and sell orders in the market, or a circuit breaker has been set off.
- A stock doesn't meet regulatory [listing requirements](/listingrequirements).

Trading delays are trading halts that happen toward the beginning of the trading day. Traders can track down trading halt and postpone data on an exchange's website.

A trading halt overall is a transitory suspension in the trading of a specific security on at least one exchanges, generally in anticipation of a news announcement or to address an order imbalance or in light of the fact that a circuit breaks has been set off (examined below). A trading halt may likewise be forced for regulatory reasons.

## Trading halts

The [Securities and Exchange Commission](/sec) (SEC) features two types of trading halts and postpones that might impact investors: regulatory and nonregulatory.

While the SEC can't halt trading, it might suspend trading for as long as 10 days and, if necessary, disavow the security's registration.

Regulatory halts happen when a company has pending news that might influence the security's price. By halting or postponing trading, has opportunity and willpower to survey the impact of the news. These halts may likewise happen in situations when a security may not keep on gathering an exchange's [listing standards](/listingrequirements).

Non-regulatory halts happen when there is a huge imbalance in pending buy and sell orders in a security. [Designated Market Makers](/designated-market-creator dmm) (DMM) will operate physically and electronically to work with price discovery during market openings..." as indicated by the NYSE.

In some cases the official open of exchange trading on a security will be delayed as the DMM balances the orders on their books, yet the stock might in any case trade on other [electronic communication networks](/ecn) (ECNs) as non-regulatory halts are not shared across exchanges.

## Exchange circuit breakers

Stock exchanges can go to lengths to ease [panic selling](/panicselling) by conjuring circuit breakers and halting trading. Starting around 2020, assuming that the S&P declines over 7% by 3:25 p.m. EST, the market stops for 15 minutes. In the event that the drop surpasses 20% trading is suspended until the end of the session.

## Illustration of a Trading Halt in reality

On March 16, 2020, as COVID-19 pandemic feelings of trepidation expanded, the S&P 500 kept on dropping over 7% from the prior close just after 9:30 AM EST. This halted trading in US stocks for 15 minutes because of a circuit breaker. Orders are not executed during this period, despite the fact that orders can be set and canceled. Trading continued shortly at 9:46 AM.

## Features
- Circuit breakers halt all trading in US stocks for 15 minutes, or the remainder of the day, depending on the circuit breaker level.
- Non-regulatory halts are not shared across exchanges, so while an exchange might be delayed in opening due to an order imbalance, for instance, the stock might in any case trade on different exchanges or ECNs.
- Held at the opening is typically a short-term trading halt where the opening of a security is delayed.
