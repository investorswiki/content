A yield curve is important in light of the fact that it really decides a benchmark for pricing bonds.

On-the-run treasuries are prone to price distortions brought about by the fluctuations in current demand. Off-the-run treasuries are particularly helpful as their [yields](/yield) are more stable than their fresher brethren, consequently the off-the-run treasury yield curve will in general smooth the distortions inherent in the on-the-run treasury yield curve.
