# Transportation Bond
## What Is a Transportation Bond?

A transportation bond is a [fixed-income security](/fixed-incomesecurity) issued by a municipality, state government, or special regional district to fund infrastructure needs connected with public transportation.

## Understanding Transportation Bonds

Transportation bonds are [fixed-rate bonds](/fixedrate-bond) issued by nearby, regional, state, and federal government agencies to fund projects in the transportation sector. These can incorporate drives, for example, the construction and improvement of interstates, spans, ports, airports, rail lines, and public transit systems. In spite of the fact that locales can issue [bonds](/bond), the transportation sector is unique in that projects might have to span across a tremendous region, like a large metropolitan area. In these cases, special districts are frequently made to facilitate regional transportation needs.

The structure of transportation bonds is like numerous [municipal bonds](/municipalbond), which are issued by neighborhood governments, and those issued by state governments. Bonds for states and government elements generally carry a higher [credit rating](/creditrating) than those issued by more modest urban communities and towns.

For instance, the Bay Area Rapid Transit District (BART) was shaped in 1957 to give rail transit in five counties in the San Francisco Bay area. It operates a developing fleet of 800 rail cars more than 130 miles of tracks. The district has the authority to levy [property taxes](/propertytax) and borrow funds by giving bonds, albeit such financing requires elector endorsement by residents in the area.

Other transportation needs, for example, air service receive funding through transportation bonds issued by nearby, state, or special districts shaped for that purpose. The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, for instance, operates several airports as well as overseeing seaport facilities, scaffolds, passages, and transport terminals.

## Transportation Bond Mechanisms

The financing of transportation bonds occurs in more than one way:

- [General obligation bonds](/generalobligationbond) (GO) from state and neighborhood governments have backing by the government's income tax, sales tax, and other required taxes.
- [Revenue bonds](/revenuebond) are structured so that designated wellsprings of revenues are utilized to pay interest and principal. Since specific tolls and fares are frequently charged to utilize interstates, spans, and other transit facilities, these bonds might be fitting for transportation financing. As a general rule, notwithstanding, revenue bonds require a higher interest rate as a result of the risk investors face in the event that revenues fall short of projections.
- [Private-public partnerships](/public-private-partnerships) are elements where government specialists and private firms cooperate to make another body to fund specific drives.

For instance, management of the Elizabeth River Tunnels Project is by both a private company, Elizabeth River Crossings OpCo, LLC, and the Virginia Department of Transportation. Revenue bonds have been issued to assist with financing this project, which funds toll streets and passages close to Portsmouth, Virginia.

Another private-public partnership is the Eagle P3 FasTracks project to build or broaden worker rail lines in the Denver, Colorado, area. Denver Transit Partners, a consortium of several private companies, and the Regional Transportation District (RTD) have partnered on this project, funded in part by transportation bonds.

Albeit traditional municipal bonds have long been appealing to investors due to the earned interest being tax-exempt, transportation bonds might not have this exemption. Now and again, interest might be exempt from state taxes, yet not from federal taxes. In different cases, even bonds issued by private elements in cooperation with public bodies might offer tax-exempt status from federal taxes.

## Features
- Not at all like traditional municipal bonds, transportation bonds might not have the earned interest tax exemption that is extremely appealing to investors.
- Transportation bonds are issued by municipal, state, regional, or federal governments to fund public transportation infrastructure.
- Transportation bonds can be general obligation (GO) bonds or revenue bonds.
