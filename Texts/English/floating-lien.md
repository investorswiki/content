# Floating Lien
## What Is a Floating Lien?

A floating [lien](/lien), otherwise called a [floating charge](/floating_charge), is a way for a company to get a loan utilizing a security interest in a general set of assets, in which the individual assets are not explicitly distinguished, as collateral.

Commonly, a loan would be secured by fixed assets, for example, [property or equipment](/ppe), however with a floating lien, the underlying assets are normally current assets or short-term assets that can change in value.

## How a Floating Lien Works

Floating liens are an effective way for retailers and other item based businesses to utilize their inventory or accounts receivable as collateral. The genuine things might be continually changing, yet the floating lien guarantees the creditor that its loan is secured against any new things. The borrower has the option to sell, transfer or discard any of its assets in the ordinary course of business.

Floating liens in this way permit business owners to access capital secured with dynamic or circulating assets. The assets backing the floating charge are short-term current assets, as a rule consumed by a company in one year or less. The floating charge is secured by the current assets while permitting the company to utilize those assets to run its business operations.

In the event that the company defaults or in any case neglects to repay the loan, the floating charge "solidifies" into a [fixed charge](/fixed-charge), and the lender turns into the preferred choice creditor to have the option to draw against the underlying asset.

## Crystallization of Floating to Fixed Charges

[Crystallization](/crystallization) is the cycle by which a floating lien or charge changes over into a fixed charge. In the event that a company neglects to repay the loan or goes enters liquidation, the floating charge becomes solidified or frozen into a fixed charge. With a fixed charge, the assets become fixed by the lender so the company can't utilize the assets or sell them.

Crystallization can likewise occur on the off chance that a company closes operations or on the other hand in the event that the borrower and lender go to court and the court selects a receiver. When solidified, the now-fixed rate security can't be sold, and the lender might claim it.

Normally, fixed charges are connected with obligations secured by substantial assets, like buildings or equipment. For instance, in the event that a company takes out a mortgage on a building, the mortgage is a fixed charge, and the business can't sell, transfer or discard the underlying asset — the building — until it repays the loan or meets different conditions illustrated in the mortgage contract.
