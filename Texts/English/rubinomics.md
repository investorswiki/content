# Rubinomics
## What is Rubinomics?

Rubinomics is a term that portrays the fiscal policy followed by the Bill Clinton administration and formulated by his economic policy adviser, Robert Rubin. A portmanteau of "Rubin" and "economics," the term "Rubinomics" depicts the administration's emphasis on the impact of a balanced budget on long-term interest rates.

Rubin filled in as Assistant to the President for Economic Policy and as the principal director of the National Economic Council from 1993 to 1995. He filled in as Secretary of the Treasury from 1995 to 1999. Rubin's primary center was [balancing the federal budget](/balanced-budget) and the impact this had on inflation and interest rates over the long term.

## Figuring out Rubinomics

Rubinomics built up some momentum during the 1990s as long-term interest rates stayed high in spite of the activities of the Federal Reserve to lower the Federal Funds Rate. The [Federal Funds Rate](/federalfundsrate) is the rate at which banks will loan each other money overnight. At the point when the Fed builds the [money supply](/moneysupply) through [open market operations](/openmarketoperations), it puts downward pressure on short-term interest rates, utilizing the Fed Funds Rate as its target to measure the immediate impact of monetary policy. In any case, this effect may not necessarily carry over to long-term rates (or may carve out opportunity to do as such).

Federal Reserve Chair Alan Greenspan and different specialists accepted the lack of responsiveness of long-term rates to overnight lending rates was due to an inflation premium that was incorporated into long-term bond prices. Rubin proposed the government concentrate on decreasing the federal [budget deficit](/budget-deficit) rather than spending money on infrastructure, technology, and education. This disappointed liberal economic advisers who inclined toward higher government spending, as well as supply-side market analysts who anticipated the tax expands expected to balance the budget would negatively impact the economy. In any case, Rubin contended that lower long-term rates would prod greater private sector investment in key industries and the development of high-esteem, long-term projects that would develop occupations paying little heed to tax increments.

In this manner, Rubinomics basically contends for balancing the federal budget as an economic growth strategy, a thought that likewise found a few support among more conservative and unregulated economy financial experts. This was a key part of the neoliberal consensus that arose in the post-Cold War time of the Clinton administration. Through the 1990s, this consensus united financial specialists and policy producers of the moderate Left and Right behind fiscal conservatism, low interest rates, and the globalization of trade.

## Did Rubinomics Work?

Defenders contend that Rubinomics contributed greatly to the long and articulated period of economic growth and inevitable government budget excesses that developed throughout the span of the 1990s. Long-term interest rates moved lower during the Clinton administration — as planned by the policy of Rubinomics — with 10-year U.S. Treasury rates falling from 6.60% in January 1993 to 5.16% in January 2001. Long-term corporate bond rates followed suit, falling from 7.91% to 7.15% over a similar period.

Simultaneously, GDP growth found the middle value of around 4%, inflation kept a low, stable rate around 2.5%, and the U.S. economy encountered its longest period of continuous expansion in history up to that point.

So from the outset, the immediate and long-term objectives of Rubinomics seem to have been accomplished. Nonetheless, factors other than just Rubinomics were unquestionably in play, including the continuous simple monetary policy drove by Greenspan, the "Harmony Dividend" coming about because of military drawdowns, and the opening of global international trade as [NAFTA](/nafta) and other multilateral agreements.

Whether Rubinomics or different factors were more important to the success of the 1990s is a continuous matter of discussion among financial specialists still today. It is additionally worth taking note of that the U.S. experienced a recession with the blasting of the [dotcom bubble](/dotcom-bubble) immediately following this period, and a few financial specialists trace the foundations of the [Great Recession](/great-recession) to financial liberalization that happened under Rubin's supervision.
