# Total Liabilities
## What are Total Liabilities?

Total liabilities are the combined [debts](/debt) and [obligations](/obligation) that an individual or company owes to outside parties. All that the company claims is classified as an asset and all amounts the company owes for future obligations are recorded as liabilities. On the [balance sheet](/balancesheet), total assets minus total liabilities equals equity.

## Grasping Total Liabilities

[Liabilities](/liability) can be portrayed as an obligation between one party and another that has not yet been completed or paid for. They are settled over the long haul through the transfer of economic benefits, including money, goods, or services.

Liabilities comprise of numerous things going from month to month lease payments, to utility bills, [bonds](/security) issued to investors and [corporate credit card](/business-credit-card) debt. Money received by an individual or company for a service or product that presently can't seem to be given or delivered, also called [unearned revenue](/unearnedrevenue)**,** is likewise recorded as a liability in light of the fact that the revenue has still not been earned and addresses products or services owed to a customer.

Future pay-outs on things, for example, pending lawsuits and product guarantees must be listed as liabilities, too, in the event that the contingency is possible and the amount can be sensibly estimated. These are alluded to as [contingent liabilities](/contingentliability).

## Types of Liabilities

On the balance sheet, a company's total liabilities are generally split up into three categories: [short-term](/currentliabilities), [long-term](/longtermliabilities), and different liabilities. Total liabilities are calculated by adding all short-term and long-term liabilities, along with any [off-balance sheet](/off-balance-sheet-obs) liabilities that corporations might cause.

### Short-term liabilities

Short-term, or current liabilities, are liabilities that are due in the span of one year or less. They can incorporate payroll expenses, rent, and [accounts payable](/accountspayable) (AP), money owed by a company to its customers.

Since payment is due in something like a year, investors and analysts are quick to find out that a company has enough [cash](/cash) on its books to cover its short-term liabilities.

### Long-term liabilities

Long-term liabilities, or [noncurrent liabilities](/noncurrent-liabilities), are debts and other non-debt financial obligations with a [maturity](/maturity) past one year. They can incorporate [debentures](/debenture), loans, [deferred tax liabilities](/deferredtaxliability), and pension obligations.

Less [liquidity](/liquidity) is required to pay for long-term liabilities as these obligations are due throughout a longer time period. Investors and analysts generally anticipate that they should be settled with assets derived from future [earnings](/earnings) or financing transactions. One year is generally sufficient opportunity to turn [inventory](/inventory) into cash.

### Different liabilities

When something in [financial statements](/financial-statements) is alluded to as "other" it ordinarily means that it is unusual, doesn't squeeze into major categories and is viewed as somewhat minor. On account of liabilities, the "other" tag can allude to things like intercompany borrowings and [sales taxes](/salestax).

Investors can discover what a company's different liabilities are by checking out the [footnotes in its financial statements](/commentary).

## Benefits of Total Liabilities

In segregation, total liabilities fill little need, other than to possibly compare how a company's obligations stack facing a competitor operating in a similar sector.

In any case, when utilized with different figures, total liabilities can be a helpful [metric](/measurements) for dissecting a company's operations. One model is in an entity's [debt-to-equity](/debtequityratio) ratio. Used to assess a company's financial [leverage](/leverage), this ratio mirrors the ability of [shareholder equity](/shareholdersequity) to cover all outstanding debts in the event of a business downturn. A comparative ratio called [debt-to-assets](/totaldebttototalassets) compares total liabilities to total assets to show how assets are financed.

## Special Considerations

A bigger amount of total liabilities isn't all by itself a financial indicator of poor economic quality of an entity. In view of winning [interest rates](/interestrate) accessible to the company, it could be generally good for the business to procure debt assets by causing liabilities.

Notwithstanding, the total liabilities of a business have a direct relationship with the [creditworthiness](/credit-value) of an entity. As a general rule, in the event that a company has moderately low total liabilities, it might gain ideal interest rates on any new debt it embraces from lenders, as lower total liabilities decrease the chance of [default risk](/defaultrisk).
