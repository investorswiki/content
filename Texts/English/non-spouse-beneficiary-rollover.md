# Non-Spouse Beneficiary Rollover
## What Is a Non-Spouse Beneficiary Rollover?

A non-spouse beneficiary rollover is a retirement plan [asset](/asset) rollover performed in the event of the death of the [account holder](/primary-account-holder) where the recipient isn't the spouse of the deceased.

## Understanding a Non-Spouse Beneficiary Rollover

A non-spouse beneficiary rollover typically means that the recipient receives the balance in a one-time [lump-sum payment](/lump-sum-payment), exposing them to full, immediate taxation. With a non-spouse beneficiary rollover, on the off chance that the funds are rolled over into another retirement account, it must be named as a [beneficiary](/beneficiary) account including both the deceased and beneficiary's names. Numerous retirement accounts require that the spouse be the sole beneficiary.

## IRA Rollover versus Transfer

There are two methods for moving an IRA from one [custodian](/custodian) to another: rollover or transfer. With an IRA rollover, the individual might claim the funds for a maximum of 60 calendar days prior to depositing the funds into another [qualified account](/qrp).

An investor may just roll over their IRA once every 12 months. The investor has 60 days from the date of the distribution to deposit 100% of the funds into another qualified account, or they must pay ordinary income taxes on the distribution and a 10% penalty tax on the off chance that the investor is under 59-1/2.

An investor might transfer their IRA directly from one custodian to another by just signing an account transfer form. The investor never claims the assets in the account and the investor may directly transfer their IRA as frequently as they like. They must take required least distributions, however the transfers are typically free on the off chance that you transfer a similar type of IRA.

> It is important to note that these transfers must be made inside a 60-day window to keep from being hit with tax punishments.

## IRA Rollover

A rollover occurs while transferring the holdings of one retirement plan to another without suffering tax results. The [distribution](/distribution) from a retirement plan is reported on [IRS Form 1099-R](/form1099r) and might be limited to one per year for every IRA.

Rollovers frequently are employed to save money on taxes similarly as with retirement plans. With a direct rollover, the retirement plan administrator might pay the plan's proceeds directly to another plan or to an IRA. The distribution might be issued as a check made payable to the new account.

While receiving a distribution from an IRA through a trustee-to-trustee transfer, the institution holding the IRA might distribute the funds from the IRA to the other IRA or to a retirement plan.

On account of a 60-day rollover, funds from a retirement plan or IRA are paid directly to the investor, who deposits some or each of the funds in another retirement plan or IRA in 60 days or less. Taxes are regularly not paid while performing a direct rollover or trustee-to-trustee transfer. However, distributions from a 60-day rollover and funds not rolled over are regularly taxable.
