# Charm (Delta Decay)
## What Is Charm (Delta Decay)?

Charm, or delta decay, is the rate at which the [delta](/delta) of an option or [warrant](/warrant) changes with respect to time. Charm alludes to the second order derivative of an option's value, once to time and once to delta. It is additionally the derivative of [theta](/theta), which measures the [time decay](/timedecay) of an option's value.

## Grasping Charm (Delta Decay)

Charm shows how much an option's delta changes every day until expiration. An option's delta is its change in value (premium) given a change in price in the underlying asset. Consequently, an option with a +.50 delta will gain fifty pennies in value for each dollar that the underlying ascents in price. Delta, be that as it may, isn't static.

[Gamma](/gamma), for example, measures an option's delta change as the underlying price moves â€” so in the event that an option initially has +0.50 delta and the underlying climbs by a dollar, in the event that it had a gamma of .10, the new delta is +0.40. Delta likewise changes (decays) over the long haul, all else being equivalent. Charm measures that.

Charm values range from - 1.0 to +1.0. [In the money (ITM)](/inthemoney) calls and [out of the money (OTM)](/outofthemoney) puts have positive charms, while ITM puts and OTM calls have negative charms. At the money options have a charm of zero, yet delta decay towards one or the other zero or 100 accelerates for options that are not at the money as expiration draws near.

Charm is important for options traders, and fundamentally to those utilizing options to [hedge](/hedge). Since the market closes for two days each end of the week, the charm's effect is amplified. At the point when the market closes Tuesday at 5 p.m. ET and resumes Wednesday at 8 a.m., charm has just half daily of effect. At the point when the market closes Friday at 5 p.m. what's more, resumes Monday at 8 a.m., over two days pass without trading the [underlying security](/underlying-security). Options traders, especially those overseeing delta-hedged positions, must pay close consideration regarding their charm on Friday as it influences their options action on Monday.

A few portfolios are self-hedging against charm risk. Say, for instance, an investor claims a 15% delta call and a - 15% delta put. The charm on these options is offset, leaving them charm-neutral. Since charm makes the option delta incline toward zero after some time for OTM options, the call delta falls after some time and the put delta ascends toward zero. The position is called a [strangle](/strangle) in light of the fact that it is a long out-of-the-money call and put.

## Charm Examples

For instance, expect that an investor has an out of the money [call option](/calloption) with a delta of 15% and a normalized charm of - 1. Taking everything into account, when the investor takes a gander at the call the next day, delta will be 14%.

As another model, say a trader puts a delta-hedged call option on Friday with a charm of 1 and 15% delta; they are [short](/short) 15 loads of the spot product for each 100 calls they own. By Monday at 8 a.m., the call delta might have diminished to 12.5%; more than two days have passed duplicated by the charm of 1. The trader's delta hedge is presently not accurate; they are short too a large part of the underlying security. On the off chance that the [spot market](/spotmarket) opens higher on Monday, the trader needs to buy back deltas to cover their position and restore a delta-neutral position. Special consideration is required around a charm's expiration time, as it might turn out to be exceptionally dynamic.

## Features
- Options traders observe their position's charm to keep up with delta neutral hedging over the long haul, even assuming the underlying waits.
- Charm values range from - 1.0 to +1.0, with in-the-money options inclining toward 100 delta and out-of-the-money options toward zero as expiration draws near.
- Charm, or delta decay, measures the change in an option's delta over the long haul, all else being equivalent.
