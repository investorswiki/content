# Perpetual Subordinated Loan
## What Is a Perpetual Subordinated Loan?

A perpetual subordinated loan is a type of [junior debt](/junior-debt) that continues indefinitely and has no maturity date. Perpetual subordinated loans pay creditors a constant flow of interest until the end of time. As the loan is perpetual, the principal is never repaid so the interest steam goes on and on forever. Basically, the borrower pays interest as a fee for access to the money however never fully repays the principal. The interest rate depends on the borrower's creditworthiness, as well as prevailing market interest rates.

## How a Perpetual Subordinated Loan Works

As the name proposes, with perpetual bonds, the settled upon period over which interest will be paid, is always â€” [perpetuity](/perpetuity). In this respect, perpetual bonds function in basically the same manner to dividend-paying stocks or certain preferred securities. Just as owners of such stock receive dividend payments for the whole time the stock is held, perpetual bond owners receive interest payments, however long they hold onto the bond.

As perpetual subordinated loans are a type of junior debt, they are somewhat riskier for the creditor. They are secondary to [unsubordinated loans ](/unsubordinateddebt)(senior loans), so on the off chance that the borrower of a perpetual subordinated loan defaults, the creditor will not get repaid until the borrower's unsubordinated loans are repaid. As a result of the increased risk associated with subordinated loans, they will have higher interest rates than unsubordinated loans. Creditors can utilize a [present-value calculation](/presentvalue) to determine the current value of a future series of perpetual subordinated loan payments.

## Benefits of Perpetual Bonds

Perpetual bonds fundamentally bear fiscally-moved governments an opportunity to fund-raise without the obligation of paying it back. Several factors support this phenomenon. Essentially, interest rates are extraordinarily low for longer-term debt. Also, in periods of rising inflation, investors really lose money on loans they make to governments.

For instance, when investors receive a 0.5% interest rate, where inflation is 1%, the resulting [inflation-adjusted interest rate of return](/inflation_adjusted_return) is - 0.5%. Subsequently, when investors receive money back from the government, their [buying power](/buyingpower) is drastically diminished.

Consider a scenario where an investor loans the government $100, and after one year, the investment's value moves to $100.50, graciousness of the 0.5% interest rate. Notwithstanding, due to a 1% inflation rate, it currently requires $101 to purchase the equivalent [basket of goods](/basket_of_goods) that cost just $100 one year prior, in this manner the investor's [rate of return](/rateofreturn) neglects to keep pace with rising inflation.

Most financial analysts anticipate that inflation should increase over the long run. Thusly, lending out money at a speculative 4% interest rate appears to be a bargain to government accountants, who accept the future inflation rate could spike to 5% sooner rather than later. Of course, most perpetual bonds are issued with [call provisions](/callprovision) that let issuers make [repayments](/repayment) after a designated time span. In such manner, the "perpetual" part of the package is many times a decision, as opposed to an order, since issuers can really crush the perpetual obligation on the off chance that they have sufficient cash close by to repay the loan in full.

## Risks of Subordinated Perpetual Bonds

There are risks associated with every perpetual bond. Quite, they subject investors to perpetual credit risk exposure, in light of the fact that over time, both governmental and corporate bond issuers can experience financial difficulties, and theoretically even shut down. Perpetual bonds may likewise be subject to [call risk](/callrisk), and that means that issuers can recall them.

Finally, there is the always present risk of the general interest rates rising after some time. In such situations where the perpetual bond's locked-in interest is fundamentally lower than the current interest rate, investors could earn more money by holding an alternate bond. In any case, to swap out an old perpetual bond for a more up to date, higher interest bond, the investor must sell their existing bond on the open market, when it could be worth not exactly the [purchase price](/purchaseprice) since investors discount their offers in light of the [interest rate differential](/interest-rate-differential).

For subordinated perpetual bonds, the additional risk of being less senior for creditors makes it furthermore risky. Accordingly, these carry higher interest rates than senior perpetual bonds.
