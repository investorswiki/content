# Compound Option
## What Is a Compound Option?

A compound option is an option for which its underlying security is another option. Thusly, there are two [strike prices](/strikeprice) and two exercise dates.

They are accessible for any combination of calls and puts. For instance, a put where the underlying is a [call option](/calloption) or a call where the underlying is a [put option](/putoption).

Each pair has a contraction:

- [Call on a put](/call-on-a-put) - CoP (CaPut)
- [Call on a call](/call-on-a-call) - CoC (CaCall)
- [Put on a put](/put-on-a-put) - PoP
- [Put on a call](/put-on-a-call) - PoC

Compound options might be known as parted fee options.

## Grasping Compound Options

At the point when the holder [exercises](/exercise) a compound call option, called the overlying option, they must then pay the seller of the underlying option a premium in light of the strike price of the compound option. This premium is called the [back fee](/backfee).

For instance, expect an investor needs to buy a put to sell 100 shares of stock at $50. The stock is currently trading at $55. The investor could buy a CaPut, which allows them to buy a call now, for say $1 per share ($100), which will allow them to buy a put with a $50 strike from now on. They pay the $1 per share currently, however just have to pay the fee for the subsequent choice assuming they exercise the first coming about in quite a while getting the subsequent choice.

The compound option gives the investor an exposure to the put option now, yet without the cost of paying for a long-term put option right at this point. All things considered, in the event that they exercise the initial call option and receive the put, the premiums paid will probably be more costly than having just bought a put in any case.

On account of a PoP or PoC, the compound option give the right to sell a put or call as the underlying.

## Compound Option Variations
- **Call on a put**: This is a call option on an underlying put option. The owner who exercises the call option receives a put option. A call on a call option can be utilized by an investor to stretch out their exposure to an underlying asset for a minimal price, and it tends to be utilized in real estate development to secure property rights without being obliged to commit.
- **Call on a call**: In this option, the investor buys one more call option with modified provisions. These provisions incorporate the right to buy a plain vanilla call option on an underlying security. Companies could utilize a call on a put during a bidding cycle for a potential work contract.
- **Put on a call**: The investor must deliver the underlying call option to the seller and collect a premium in view of the strike price of the overlying put option. A put on a call option can be utilized by an investor to broaden their hedge on an underlying asset for a minimal price, and it very well may be utilized in real estate development to escape property rights without being committed to the deal.
- **Put on a put**: A put is purchased on a put contract and gains in value when the put contract falls in value, i.e., when the underlying security that the subsequent choice depends on ascents. A put on a put option is utilized when a bullish trader needs to utilize leverage.

## Special Considerations

It is more considered normal to see compound options in currency or [fixed-income](/fixedincome) markets, where vulnerability exists with respect to the option's risk protection capabilities. The advantages of compound options are that they allow for large [leverage](/leverage) and they are less expensive, initially, than straight options. Be that as it may, assuming the two options are exercised, the total [premium](/premium) will be more than the premium on a single option.

In the [mortgage](/mortgage) market, CaPut options are valuable to offset the risk of [interest rate](/nominalinterestrate) changes between the time a mortgage commitment is made and the scheduled delivery date.

Traders might utilize compound options to expand the life of an options position since it is feasible to buy a call with a more limited opportunity to [expiration](/expirationdate) for one more call with a longer expiration, for instance. All in all, they can partake in the gains of the underlying without putting up the full amount to buy it at the beginning. The caveat is that there are two premiums paid and a higher cost assuming the subsequent choice is exercised.

While [speculation](/speculation) in the financial markets will constantly be a major portion of compound option activity, business ventures could track down them helpful while planning or bidding on a large project. Now and again, they must secure financing or supplies before really starting or winning the project. In the event that they don't build or win the project they could be left with financing they needn't bother with. In this case, compound options give a kind of [insurance policy](/insurance-inclusion).

## Instance of Using a Compound Option

For instance, a company bids to complete a large project. Assuming they win the bid, they will require financing for $200 million for a considerable length of time. Nonetheless, the formula they use in the calculation thinks about current interest rates. Hence, the company will have exposure to conceivable higher interest rates between the contract bidding and conceivable winning. They could buy a two-year [interest rate cap](/interestratefloor) beginning the date of the contract award however this could be extravagant in the event that they don't win the contract.

All things considered, the company could buy a call option on a two-year interest cap. In the event that they win the contract, they exercise the option for the interest rate cap at the predetermined premium since they will require it for the project. Furthermore, on the off chance that they don't win the contract, they can let the option terminate in light of the fact that they needn't bother with the underlying any longer. The advantage is a lower initial [outlay](/outlaycost) and decreased risk.
