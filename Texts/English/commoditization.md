# Commoditization
## What Is Commoditization?

Commoditization in addition frequently eliminates the individual, unique attributes, and brand identity of the product so it becomes interchangeable with different products of a similar type. Making commodities interchangeable allows competition with a basis of price just and not on various qualities.

At the point when a financial contract, for example, a mortgage becomes [commoditized](/commoditize), the contract turns out to be more [liquid](/liquidity) since it tends to be bought and sold promptly. This liquidity advances trading in that market on the grounds that the agreements don't need to be assessed individually and treated uniquely.

## Grasping Commoditization

A commodity is a fundamental decent utilized in commerce that is interchangeable with different commodities of a similar type.

Commoditization is an action changes over products, including financial products, into such an interchangeable and marketable thing, to such an extent that it strips a decent or service of separating qualities. The great or service becomes indistinguishable from others in that equivalent category.

Commoditization might occur with a product, service or security, yet in all cases three conditions must be met for a decent or service to turn into a commodity:

1. Normalized eliminates varieties. Agricultural products must be in a raw state. For instance, corn is a commodity, yet light corn syrup isn't.
1. The thing must be usable when purchased, without requiring processing or modifications. Corn is a commodity, however stalks of fresh corn in the husk isn't.
1. Products must change sufficient in price that a market creates for it. Corn is a commodity in light of the fact that the price vacillates and changes, yet a thing which costs similar amount without regulation or tensions isn't.

Getting back to the case of mortgage loans, the rise in buying and selling of these loans increases the amount of cash circulating and available. Increases in cash flows allow banks and different lenders to compose more loans to additional borrowers. This increase is beneficial for the industry as a whole as well with respect to borrowers.

Pundits, in any case, contend that commoditization can make a few negative impacts, by taking out unique or modified products large corporations come to overwhelm while small or specialty producers are presently not able to contend. Commoditization of certain things may likewise be considered corrupt or deceptive, for example by making a market for body parts, companions, or even something a silly as adding a fee to a formerly free town park.
