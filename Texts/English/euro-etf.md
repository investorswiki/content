## What Is an Euro ETF?

An euro ETF is a [exchange-traded fund](/etf) (ETF) that puts resources into the [euro](/euro), either straightforwardly or through euro-designated short-term debt. Euro ETFs are frequently settled as currency trusts or grantor trusts — partners have a claim to a particular measure of euros per share. [Currency ETFs](/currency-etf) mean to follow the performance of a single currency in the foreign exchange market against the U.S. dollar or a basket of currencies.

Beforehand, these markets were simply available to proficient traders; notwithstanding, the rise of exchange-traded funds (ETFs) over the course of the last decade has opened the foreign exchange market to extra portions of investors.

## How an Euro ETF Works

Likewise, euro ETFs can be shorted, as a bet that the currency will fall versus the dollar.

Basically, a currency ETF investment is a speculative trade on [spot exchange rates](/spotexchangerate), which might be the most fundamental part of an investment in currency funds. This means investors place a bet on one of two results: the core currency performs well or the [counter currency](/counter-currency) declines. The investor will constantly take a long situation on a currency relative to being short another. For instance, the CurrencyShares Euro Trust (FXE) will increase when the euro performs well — or when the U.S. dollar falls. Other than profiting from the currency appreciation that happens, investors receive interest rate payments for holding a currency over the long run.

For investors, currency-supported ETFs can be a way for investors to assist with moderating the effects of those changes across their portfolio. On the off chance that the U.S. dollar were to [appreciate](/currency-appreciation) versus the euro, then an unhedged ETF would endure currency losses that offset any gains in the euro. Nonetheless, a currency-supported ETF — which basically fills in as a [futures contract](/futurescontract) on currencies — permits investors to lock in the price of a currency ahead of any likely variances.
