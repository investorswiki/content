# Fibonacci Clusters
## What Are Fibonacci Clusters?

A Fibonacci cluster is where an assortment of [Fibonacci retracements](/fibonacciretracement) or extension levels, in view of different price swings, meet close to one price area. The theory of a cluster is that if different [Fibonacci extension](/fibonacciextensions) or retracement levels are close to one price, that price is probably going to be an important support or resistance area. A trader might then actually take a trade close to that level.

## Everything Fibonacci Clusters Say to You

Fibonacci retracements and extensions are rates of a price swing and are utilized to show areas of conceivable support or resistance that might happen from here on out.

The Fibonacci retracement levels are 23.6%, 38.2%, 61.8%, and 78.6%. While not formally a Fibonacci ratio, half is likewise utilized. In the event that a trader were to draw the Fibonacci retracement device on a [price swing](/swing) that went from $10 to $20, the half retracement would be $15, for instance. This apparatus is utilized to show where the price may [pull back](/pullback) to subsequent to making a vertical or downward price move.

Fibonacci extensions project how far the price could move to the upside or downside following a pullback. Common Fibonacci extension levels are 61.8%, 100%, 161.8%, 200%, and 261.8%.

A trader might draw retracement and extension levels on different price swings. For instance, they might draw a large one on a week after week chart, then draw some on the smaller daily and hourly price swings.

With various Fibonacci levels all around the chart, some will cluster together close to a certain price. This Fibonacci cluster denotes a possibly important area as a Fibonacci level from more than one price swing is saying that this area is probably going to be support or resistance.

The trader may then utilize this cluster area to trade off of. In the event that the price is in an overall [downtrend](/downtrend) and there is a Fibonacci cluster that says the price will slow down close to a specific price on the next rally, the trader will watch to check whether the price really does as a matter of fact slow down at that level. Then, at that point, assuming the price begins to drop once more, they enter a [short position](/short).

## Illustration of How to Use Fibonacci Clusters

There are two Fibonacci retracement devices, and one Fibonacci extension instrument, applied to the Apple Inc. (AAPL) daily chart.

One retracement device is projecting pullback levels in view of the price rally from close $140 to $215. The next Fibonacci retracement instrument is projecting pullback levels in view of the rally from $170 to $215.

When the price begins to decline off $215, the Fibonacci extension instrument is applied to the down wave and first pullback to show how far the next wave down could take the price. These three indicators give a Fibonacci cluster close $180 and furthermore $170. Each has three Fibonacci levels in extremely close vicinity to these prices. In this case, the price lined at $170.27 before turning higher.

A trader could be watching these areas for opportunities to get long. Anticipating confirmation for a move in the anticipated course is suggested. For instance, the price didn't turn higher at the $180 cluster, and on second thought continued to drop. The price turned higher close $170 so an entry might have been taken once the vertical move began. A [stop loss](/stop-lossorder) is set below the recent swing low in this case (or over the recent swing high if going short).

## The Difference Between Fibonacci Clusters and a Consolidation

A Fibonacci cluster is an area where the price might slow down or turn from here on out. A [consolidation](/consolidation) is the point at which the price really slows down and moves sideways or in a small price range. Consolidations might happen close to Fibonacci clusters, yet presently consistently. Consolidations can happen anyplace on a price chart. They are a small pattern and a few traders trade [breakouts](/breakout) from them, typically toward the overall trend.

## Limitation of Using Fibonacci Clusters

Fibonacci clusters will not necessarily show important areas or defining moments on the chart. Price will frequently disregard these levels completely. Despite the fact that, to the Fibonacci trader, this might give data as it tells them the price is moving toward the next Fibonacci level(s).

A contention against Fibonacci analysis is that with such countless levels, particularly while utilizing numerous Fibonacci retracement or extension instruments simultaneously, the price is probably going to turn almost one of them. Just in hindsight is it clear which of the many levels demonstrated on the chart really ended up being critical. This is the reason anticipating confirmation from the price is important.

How the Fibonacci levels are drawn is likewise subject to discuss. A few traders draw them in view of high and low points, while others draw them in light of [closing prices](/closingprice), or a combination of the abovementioned. This means traders might wind up with clusters at an alternate price contingent upon how the devices are drawn.

## Highlights
- Traders might opt to enter or exit trades around Fibonacci clusters.
- Fibonacci clusters show the price could be an important support or resistance area, or defining moment.
- A Fibonacci cluster is the point at which various Fibonacci retracement or extension levels happen close to one price area.
