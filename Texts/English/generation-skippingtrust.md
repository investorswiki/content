# Generation-Skipping Trust (GST)
## What Is a Generation-Skipping Trust (GST)?

A generation-skipping trust (GST) is a type of legally binding trust agreement wherein the contributed [assets](/resource) are passed down to the grantor's grandchildren, consequently "skipping" the next generation, the grantor's children. By disregarding the grantor's children, the assets stay away from the [estate taxes](/estatetax) — taxes on an individual's property upon their demise — that would apply assuming the children straightforwardly inherited them.

Generation-skipping trusts are effective wealth-safeguarding instruments for individuals with critical assets and savings.

## Understanding a Generation-Skipping Trust (GST)

Since a generation-skipping [trust](/trust) effectively transfers assets from the grantor's estate to grandchildren, the [grantor](/grantor's) children never take title to the assets. This allows the grantor to keep away from the estate taxes that would apply assuming the assets came into the possession of the next generation first.

However grandchildren are the most common beneficiaries, the beneficiary of a generation-skipping transfer doesn't be guaranteed to must be a family member. The beneficiary can be anyone who is something like 37\u00bd years more youthful than the grantor and not a spouse or ex-spouse.

> Generation-skipping trusts can in any case give a few financial benefits to the next generation in light of the fact that the grantor can give children access to any income the trust's assets generate while as yet leaving the actual assets in trust for grandchildren.

## Taxing the Generation-Skipping Transfer Trust (GST)

Due to the generation-skipping trust's reasonability as a loophole to stay away from federal estate taxes, changes were made to the [tax code](/tax-code) in 1986 that made a generation-skipping transfer tax. Generation-skipping transfer tax rates have increased and fallen throughout the long term, with a recent high of 55% in 2001 and a low of 0% in 2010 — due to an exemption granted by the 2010 Tax Relief Act.

Planned to guarantee that individuals transferring humble amounts of wealth to more youthful generations don't need to bear the brunt of the tax burden, these exemptions were secured by the [American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012](/american-taxpayer-relief-act-2012). This legislation laid out a permanent $5 million tax exemption on generation-skipping transfers, which implied the federal tax on a generation-skipping transfer of wealth would apply provided that the amount surpassed $5 million.

Nonetheless, the GSTT really applies to the extremely wealthy in light of the fact that the transferred amount is galactic. A great many people won't ever experience the GSTT due to the high threshold: the tax possibly applies when the transferred amount surpasses $11.4 million for each individual (for 2019), and in 2021 is $11.7 million.

## Expanding the Generation-Skipping Trust Tax Exemption

Even with the installment of taxes on generation-skipping transfers, GSTs actually act as devices for [high-net-worth individuals](/hnwi) to transfer wealth at a lower tax rate. Furthermore, they turned out to be even more honed apparatuses on Dec. 22, 2017, when President Donald Trump endorsed into effect the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which multiplied the generation-skipping tax exemption.

Starting on Jan. 1, 2018, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) multiplied the estate tax exemption to $11.2 million for singles and $22.4 million for married couples, however just for 2018 through 2025. The exemption level is indexed for inflation. The 40% top tax rate stays in place.

This act terminates on Jan 1, 2026, pushing the exemptions back to their pre-Act amounts except if Congress broadens them.
