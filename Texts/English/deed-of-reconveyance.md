# Deed of Reconveyance
## What is a deed of reconveyance?
A deed of reconveyance demonstrates that you've fully paid off your mortgage on your home, addressing the transfer of ownership from your mortgage lender to you.
Throughout the time you repaid your mortgage, you legally owned the property, yet the lender held the mortgage lien, or claim, to it. Now that you've paid back the loan, the lender needs to eliminate the lien, and to do that, it'll issue the deed of reconveyance.
"This document is called a mortgage satisfaction or deed of reconveyance relying upon the state," makes sense of Megan Hernandez, director of marketing and public relations at the American Land Title Association. In California, it's called a full reconveyance form, which is endorsed by the lender and authenticated by a public official.
## How a deed of reconveyance functions
State laws generally require a mortgage lender to present the deed of reconveyance documentation to the region recorder or borrower inside a certain time span after payoff — commonly 30 or 60 days, Hernandez says. In certain states, the lender sends you the notice straightforwardly, and you handle dealing with the region to record it.
"On the off chance that they don't do this, they can face a penalty," Hernandez says.
In the event that you're selling your home yet haven't paid off your mortgage yet, a deed of reconveyance actually assumes a part in the last stage of the closing system: The money from the buyer takes care of the remainder of the loan, which then, at that point, triggers issuance of the deed. In this case, the title company regularly handles recording it.
"During the lead-up to closing, the title company will contact your lender and ask for a payoff statement reflecting everything owed up to the day of closing," Hernandez says. "At closing, the title company will send the payoff to your lender and proof of that payment to your buyer's lender."
## For what reason carry out you really want a thing of reconveyance?
At the point when you sell your home, the reconveyance deed or satisfaction of mortgage documentation is evidence that the property has a reasonable title, meaning it's free from any remaining mortgages or different liens or claims. Without this, you could make some harder memories selling, on the grounds that a buyer will need evidence that the title is free and clear.
In the event that you're not planning to sell, however, a deed of reconveyance is as yet fundamental — proof you've paid off your mortgage, and that keeps a lender from making a claim to the property.
Note that assuming you have a reconveyance deed, you actually have financial obligations as a homeowner, most outstandingly your property taxes.
## What occurs on the off chance that a deed of reconveyance isn't recorded?
On the off chance that the deed of reconveyance hasn't been recorded, don't panic just yet.
"The act of paying off all the money owed actually quenches the mortgage," Hernandez says. "The recording of the satisfaction is just evidence of the payoff. Assuming a consumer has documentation showing they paid off their mortgage, they don't have to worry that some lender will come after them."
Assuming that you're worried about acquiring the deed of reconveyance, ask your lender about how it handles the loan payoff and deed recording process. Recall that lenders have an incentive to ensure they deal with the deed subtleties, since they can be punished in the event that the cycle isn't handled by state rules.

## Features
- A deed of reconveyance is ordinarily issued when a mortgage has been paid in full.
- Lenders of second mortgages or home equity loans that keep a security interest in the home after the primary mortgage is paid off can in any case declare their right to dispossess the property for their specific loans.
- A homeowner who has received a deed of reconveyance can't be dispossessed upon by the lending institution.
