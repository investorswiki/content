# Erroneous Trade
## What is an Erroneous Trade?

An erroneous trade is a stock transaction that deviates such a great amount from the current market price that it is considered an error. Erroneous trades are caused by a variety of factors including computer glitches or human error. These trades are often reversed, or broken, because they don't reflect the true price of the security and they can influence or cause erroneous trades on other stocks or exchanges.

## Understanding the Erroneous Trade

In 2009, the [Securities and Exchange Commission](/sec) (SEC) approved new exchange rules that would stop erroneous trades from being executed. The SEC rules permit an exchange to break a trade on the off chance that the price differs from the consolidated last sale price by more than a specified percentage amount.

For example, in regular market hours, 10% for stocks priced under $25; 5% for stocks priced between $25 and $50; and 3% for stocks priced over $50. Furthermore, the review process for the erroneous trade must begin in the span of 30 minutes of the trade.

To begin the review process the time of the transaction, security, number of shares, price of the transaction, side (buy, sell or both), and a statement of why the trade is considered erroneous must be submitted to the exchange.

The percentage guidelines above are for regular trading hours. Since there is less liquidity in the [pre-market](/premarket) and after hours, the guidelines are doubled. For example, on a stock priced under $25, the price would need to deviate by 20% to be considered erroneous.

[Exchange traded funds](/etf) (ETFs) and notes (ETNs) have the same guidelines.

Leveraged ETFs have the same guidelines, yet during regular hours the guidelines are multiplied by the leverage. For example, an ETN that trades over $50, and is a three-times (3x) leveraged fund, would need to see a trade deviate 9% or more to be considered erroneous.

## Consequences of Erroneous Trades

The present markets are highly automated and interconnected, with trades happening quickly. As a result, an erroneous trade on one market can rapidly trigger a wave of further erroneous trades across other interconnected markets.

This can lead to broad and serious consequences for the market. For example, if a stock last trades at $25, however a computer misfire, human error, or some other factor causes a firm to conduct a series of erroneous trades of that stock at $75, other exchanges' automated systems might follow suit, spreading that erroneous trading price across other markets and affecting numerous markets and investors.

## Real-World Examples of Erroneous Trades

In 2010, an erroneous trade was blamed for the nearly 1,000 point drop in the [Dow Jones Industrial Average](/djia). The mistake was rumored to involve E-mini contracts which are stock market index [futures contracts](/futurescontract) that trade in Chicago.

In 2011, two Wall Street Exchanges, Direct Edge and Nasdaq OMX Group, announced the cancellation of dozens of erroneous trades that were executed between 4:57 p.m. what's more, 5:05 p.m. EST on Monday, May 2. The trades involved shares of several companies in the health sector, which jumped precipitously during that day's after-hours trading session. For example, shares of Becton Dickinson and Co. rose from their closing price that day of $86.85 to as high as $112.91.
