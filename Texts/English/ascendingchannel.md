# Ascending Channel
## What Is an Ascending Channel?

An ascending channel is the [price action](/price-action) contained between up slanting parallel lines. Higher ups and higher downs describe this price pattern. Technical analysts develop an ascending channel by drawing a lower [trend line](/trendline) that interfaces the swing lows, and an upper channel line that joins the swing highs.

The pattern's contrary partner is the [descending channel](/descendingchannel).

## Figuring out Ascending Channels

Inside an ascending channel, price doesn't necessarily in all cases remain altogether held inside the pattern's parallel lines however rather shows areas of support and resistance that traders can use to set stop-loss orders and profit targets. A [breakout](/breakout) over an ascending channel can signal a continuation of the move higher, while a breakdown below an ascending channel can show a potential trend change.

Ascending channels show an obviously defined [uptrend](/uptrend). Traders can [swing trade](/swingtrading) between the pattern's support and resistance levels or trade toward a breakout or breakdown.

## Trading the Ascending Channel
- **Support and Resistance**: Traders could open a [long position](/long) when a stock's price arrives at the ascending channel's lower trend line and exit the trade when the price approaches the upper channel line. A [stop-loss order](/stop-lossorder) ought to be put somewhat below the lower trend line to forestall losses on the off chance that the security's price unexpectedly inverts. Traders who utilize this strategy ought to guarantee there is sufficient distance between the pattern's parallel lines to set an adequate gamble/reward ratio. For instance, in the event that a trader puts a $5 stop, the width of the ascending channel ought to be at least $10 to consider a 1:2 gamble/reward ratio.
- **Breakouts**: Traders could buy a stock when its price breaks over the upper channel line of an ascending channel. It is prudent to utilize other [technical indicators](/technicalindicator) to affirm the breakout. For instance, traders could expect that a huge increase in [volume](/volume) goes with the breakout and that there is no overhead resistance on higher time span charts.
- **Breakdowns**: Before traders take a [short position](/short) when price breaks below the lower channel line of an ascending channel, they ought to search for different signs that show weakness in the pattern. Price neglecting to arrive at the upper trend line habitually is one such warning sign. Traders ought to likewise search for negative divergence between a famous indicator, for example, the [relative strength index](/rsi) (RSI), and price. For example, in the event that a stock's price is making higher highs inside the ascending channel, however the indicator is making worse high points, this recommends up momentum is winding down.

## Ascending Channel versus Envelope Channels

Trend lines can be founded on [moving averages](/movingaverage) or ups and downs over determined spans.

Two of the most common envelope channels incorporate [Bollinger Bands](/bollingerbands) and [Donchian Channels](/donchianchannels).
