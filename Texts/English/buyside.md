# Buy-Side
The buy side contains all the money management firms - - mutual funds, pension funds, hedge funds, and so forth - - which profit from buying and selling stocks. The buy side firms have their own stock and sector analysts, too, yet they are undeniably less public. They don't distribute reports or put out buy and sell proposals. They basically research for the portfolio managers inside their organizations.

## Features
- A business engaged with buy-side activities will purchase stocks, bonds, and other financial products in view of the necessities and strategy of their organization's or alternately client's portfolio.
- Common buy-side institutions incorporate hedge funds, pension funds, and mutual funds.
- The sell-side is something contrary to the buy-side, giving just investment proposals and services to work with the purchasing of securities by the buy-side.
- The buy-side is a segment of financial markets comprised of investing institutions that buy securities for money-management purposes.
