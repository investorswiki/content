The actual term references the division between the analysts of an investment bank and the bank's [underwriting department](/underwriting). The division is meant to prevent the exchange of inside data between the two departments.

Bringing an employee from the research department of an investment bank "over the wall" to the underwriting department is a common practice. The research analyst loans their expert assessment on the company, which assists guarantors with turning out to be better educated during the underwriting system.
