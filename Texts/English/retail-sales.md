Retail sales and CPI experienced sharp changes toward the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020. Retail sales got in the vast majority of the months from that point forward, while [inflation](/inflation) accelerated. In the initial four months of 2022, retail sales were over their average in the relating months of the past decade, recommending that prices for some goods were on the rise as opposed to an increase in consumer spending.
The [correlation coefficient](/correlationcoefficient) between retail sales and CPI from April 2013 to April 2022 was 0.296, which was calculated by looking at the two datasets' month-on-month change each month over the period. There were periods in which retail sales were in lockstep with the heading of CPI, yet the correlation between the two slanted to the low side.
## How Do Financial Markets React to Retail Sales Report?
Higher retail sales data can be great for the stock market.

## Why Are Retail Sales Important?

## What's the Trend for Retail Sales?
Since the mid-2000s, consumers shifted their purchases to online venders like Amazon, eroding sales at traditional brick-and-mortar retailers. Some long-term retailers have either needed to screen operations or reduce the number of their stores and employees across the U.S. on account of the difficulties in rivaling the prices set by online venders. In the past decade alone, the proportion of web based business sales to total retail has hopped from around 6 percent in 2013 to around 15 percent in April 2022. That number is probably going to become further.
The Census Bureau distributes a web based business report each quarter, however it could better serve the public by delivering more data, for example, a breakdown of the things sold.
