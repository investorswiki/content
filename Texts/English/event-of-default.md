# Event Of Default
## What Is Event of Default?

An event of default is a predefined situation that permits a lender to demand full repayment of an outstanding balance before it is due. In numerous agreements, the lender will incorporate a contract provision covering events of [default](/default2) to safeguard itself in case apparently the borrower can not or doesn't mean to keep repaying the loan from now on. An event of default enables the lender to hold onto any [collateral](/collateral) that has been pledged and sell it to recover the loan. This frequently is employed if the [default risk](/defaultrisk) is past a certain point.

## Figuring out Events Of Default

An "event of default" is a defined term in loan and lease agreements. The accompanying would comprise a default event in a normal credit agreement clause:

- non-payment of any amount of the loan (counting interest)
- financial [covenant](/covenant) breach

- insolvency

The clause can contain more conditions that would permit the creditor to summon its rights in the event of default. These events would be exclusively custom fitted for the unique situation of the borrower. Albeit a creditor can legally demand immediate repayment in the event of a default, in practice it rarely does as such. All things being equal, it ordinarily works with the distressed borrower to rework the terms of the loan agreement. Assuming the gatherings concur, the lender will deliver a [amendment](/amendment) to the loan agreement that contains more tight terms, and by and large, raise the interest rate of the loan and collect an amendment fee.

Section 7.01 contains 11 distinct events of default, including the ones refered to above aside from MAC, for the striving retailer. Unambiguous terms are customary in an appropriately drafted credit agreement, yet the agreement for Sears is especially definite and restrictive on the grounds that the lending [syndicate](/syndicate) is playing it safe to safeguard its interests.

## Event of Default in Credit Default Swaps
