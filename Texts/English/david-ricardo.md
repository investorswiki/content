## Early Life and Education

Brought into the world in England in 1772, one of 17 children, David Ricardo started working with his dad as a stockbroker at 14 years old. He was repudiated by his dad at 21, be that as it may, for wedding outside his religion. His wealth came from his prosperity with a business he began that managed [government securities](/governmentsecurity). He retired at 41 years old subsequent to earning an estimated \u00a31 million conjecturing on the outcome of the Battle of Waterloo.

In the wake of resigning, Ricardo purchased a seat in Parliament for \u00a34,000, and he filled in as a member of Parliament. Influenced by Adam Smith, Ricardo held company with other leading masterminds of the time, for example, James Mill, Jeremy Bentham, and [Thomas Malthus](/thomas-malthus).

## Notable Accomplishments
### Comparative Advantage Theory

Among the notable thoughts that Ricardo presented was the theory of [comparative advantage](/comparativeadvantage), which contended that countries can benefit from international trade by work in the production of goods for which they have a somewhat lower [opportunity cost](/opportunitycost) in production even in the event that they don't have a [absolute advantage](/absoluteadvantage) in the production of a specific decent.

For instance, a mutual trade benefit would be realized among China and the United Kingdom from China having some expertise in the production of porcelain and tea and the United Kingdom focusing on machine parts. Ricardo is noticeably associated with the net benefits of free trade and the impairment of [protectionist policies](/protectionism). Ricardo's theory of comparative advantage created branch-offs and investigates that are examined right up 'til now.

### Labor Theory of Value

One more of Ricardo's best-known contributions to economics was the [labor theory of value](/labor-theory-of-value). The labor theory of value states that the value of a decent could be estimated by the labor that it took to create it. The theory states that the cost ought not be founded on the compensation paid for the labor, yet on the total cost of production.

One illustration of this theory is that if a table requires two hours to make, and a chair requires one hour to make, one table is worth two chairs, paying little heed to how much each hour the creators of the table and chairs were paid. The labor theory of value would later become one of the groundworks of [Marxism](/marxism).

### Theory of Rents

Ricardo was the principal economist to talk about rents, or benefits that accrue to the owners of assets exclusively due to their ownership instead of their contribution to any actual useful activity. In its original application, agricultural economics, the theory of rents shows that the benefits of a rise in grain prices will generally accrue to the owners of agricultural grounds as rents paid by tenant farmers.

Ricardo's thought was later likewise applied to political economics, in the possibility of [rent-seeking](/rentseeking), where the owners of assets that benefit from public policies that straightforwardly increased rents toward them have, and act on, an incentive to influence public policy.

### Ricardian Equivalence

In public finance, Ricardo composed that whether a government decides to finance its expenditures through immediate taxation or through borrowing and [deficit spending](/deficit-spending), the outcomes for the economy will be equivalent. In the event that citizens are rational, they will account for any expected increase in future taxation to finance current deficits by saving an amount equivalent to current deficit spending, so the net change to total spending will be zero.

So on the off chance that a government engages in [deficit spending to help the economy](/fiscalpolicy), private spending will just fall by an equivalent amount as individuals save more, and the net effect on the aggregate economy will be a wash.

## Distributed Works

In his **Essay on the Influence of a Low Price of Corn on the Profits of Stock** (1815), Ricardo conceptualized the law of diminishing returns with respect to labor and capital.

Ricardo composed his most memorable article on economics, distributed in The Morning Chronicle, at 37 years old. The article supported for the Bank of England to reduce its note-giving activity. His 1815 book, **Principles of Political Economy and Taxation**, contains his most notable thoughts.
