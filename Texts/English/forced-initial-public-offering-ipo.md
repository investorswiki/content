# Forced Initial Public Offering
## What Is a Forced Initial Public Offering?

A forced initial public offering — or "forced IPO" for short — is the interaction by which a [private company](/privatecompany) is required to open up to the world due to having penetrated the limits set out by the [Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)](/sec) and applicable regulations.

## How Forced Initial Public Offerings Work

The most common trigger for a forced IPO is that the company being referred to has developed to have north of 500 [shareholders of record](/shareholder-register), along with assets of no less than $10 million. Under these conditions, the company must organize an IPO and become subject to the enhanced reporting and auditing requirements associated with public companies.

Albeit most entrepreneurs view "opening up to the world" as a much-wanted outcome, a few companies intentionally favor remaining privately owned to the extent that this would be possible. All things considered, privately-owned companies can operate without the substantial transparency requirements demanded of public companies, which incorporate [annual audits](/review) and the publication of point by point quarterly [financial statements](/financial-statements).

Notwithstanding their cost, these standards can make a company's management and ownership become lopsidedly centered around short-term objectives, for example, meeting the quarterly [earnings per share (EPS)](/eps) targets put forward by [investment analysts](/expert). Hence, owners and managers could consider staying private to be the best means of holding concentration and control.

In any case, private companies that arrive at a certain level of growth will regularly cross one of the edges that trigger a forced IPO, especially with respect to the rule concerning $10 million in company assets. As a rule, companies that wish to keep away from the forced IPO as far as might be feasible will try to do as such by solidifying their ownership, with bigger shareholders buying out more modest ones to keep the total number of registered shareholders below the 500-man limit. This strategy might demonstrate unreasonable over the long haul, nonetheless.

> ### Significant
> In the past, entrepreneurs frequently saw opening up to the world as the best method for raising huge measures of cash for their business. Be that as it may, with the rise of the private equity industry in recent many years, this is as of now not really the case. To be sure, today is feasible for private companies to collect comparable measures of money absolutely from private patrons — in this manner possibly partaking in the benefits of an IPO without its continuous oversight requirements.

## Real World Example of a Forced Initial Public Offering

One remarkable illustration of a forced IPO was that of Alphabet (GOOGL), which held its IPO in 2004. Albeit the IPO was fruitful and raised generally $1.2 billion, the company itself was not excited about seeking after its IPO. All things considered, its decision to do so was driven to a great extent by regulatory contemplations, having developed past the 500-shareholder limit commanded by the SEC.

A similar dynamic happened all the more recently with respect to the IPO of Facebook (FB) in 2012. The company was forced to open up to the world due to outperforming its shareholder limit, bringing more than $100 billion up in the subsequent IPO.

## Features
- Companies will frequently postpone penetrating these limits to the extent that this would be possible, to keep away from the increased investigation and compliance costs associated with public ownership.
- It happens due to U.S. securities regulations denying private companies from having in excess of 500 shareholders and $10 million in assets.
- A forced IPO is the interaction by which a private company is forced to turn out to be publicly traded.
