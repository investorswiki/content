# Inactivity Fee
## What Is an Inactivity Fee?

An inactivity fee is a sum charged to investors who haven't taken part in any buying or selling activities in their [brokerage accounts](/brokerageaccount) for an amount of time determined by the brokerage.

## Understanding an Inactivity Fee

Many credit card issuers recently charged an inactivity fee to credit card holders who hadn't made any purchases in that frame of mind of time determined under their terms and conditions. In any case, the practice turned out to be more troublesome after the presentation of the [Credit Card Accountability, Responsibility and Disclosure Act of 2009,](/credit-card-accountability-responsibility-and-disclosure-act-of-2009) which for the most part restricted credit card companies charging consumers for not utilizing their credit cards. Inactivity charges actually apply to some unused or inactive electronic gift certificates, gift cards, and universally useful prepaid cards.

Sadly, the law doesn't stretch out to stock and options investors. One of the manners in which brokerages bring in money is from the [commissions](/commission) on trades. At the point when a customer makes rare trades, the brokerage doesn't bring in money from that customer. The broker can then try to make up for the lack of commissions by charging inactivity fees. Smaller, passive investors who make a small number of trades are the most distraught by inactivity fees.

## Inactivity Fee and the Credit Card Accountability, Responsibility And Disclosure Act Of 2009

Until the Credit CARD Act of 2009 passed, credit card issuers could undoubtedly charge consumers for not utilizing their credit cards. At the point when these [dormancy fees](/dormancy-fee) were in effect, cardholders needed to try to utilize their cards periodically to try not to cause charges. Various issuers had different time periods for considering an account inactive and imposing the fee. During that period, the best method for keeping away from an inactivity fee would have been to close the account of the unused card. In any case, this represented a problem for consumers who wanted to have a credit card for crises. It was likewise problematic for consumers who would have rather not closed a [zero-balance account](/zba) in light of the fact that bringing down their total accessible credit would increase their credit utilization ratio, perhaps bringing about a lower credit score.

The Credit CARD Act generally made dormancy fees unlawful, however card issuers can in any case charge consumers assuming there has been no account activity for quite some time. The [issuer](/issuer) must disclose the presence, frequency, and amount of these fees obviously before the card is issued and must not charge them at least a couple of times each month.

## Illustration of a Broker Inactivity Fee

Well known online brokerage firm Interactive Brokers Group (IBKR) applies a $20 each month inactivity fee to accounts with balances under $2,000 in the event that clients don't produce no less than $20 in commissions. The charge lessens to $10 for accounts with a balance of somewhere in the range of $2,000 and $100,000 and that don't meet least month to month commissions of $10. Investors 25 and under must produce no less than $3 in month to month commissions or pay the equivalent in activity fees.

Such charges are less inclined to impact [active traders](/active-exchanging) who routinely buy and sell securities. Notwithstanding, inactivity fees can accumulate for investors who favor buy and hold strategies. Investors and traders can rapidly compare inactivity fees by means of brokerage comparison destinations.
