# Rights of Accumulation (ROA)
## What Are Rights of Accumulation (ROA)?

Rights of accumulation (ROA) are rights that permit a mutual fund [shareholder](/shareholder) to receive decreased sales commission charges when the amount of mutual funds purchased plus the amount previously held equals a rights of accumulation (ROA) [breakpoint](/breakpoint).

## Figuring out Rights of Accumulation

Rights of accumulation breakpoints are structured by mutual fund companies to give commission discounts to investors. Mutual fund companies determine the sales commission fee structures for investment funds. An investor causes sales charges when they buy shares of a [mutual fund](/mutualfund) with an intermediary for which the sales charges apply. Mutual fund companies might offer ROA breakpoints with their sales commission schedules.

Commonly, there is no time limit on how long the mutual fund should be held to meet all requirements for rights of accumulation. Not all mutual funds offer ROA breakpoints so investors ought to make certain to recognize them for a mutual fund on the off chance that they exist. ROA breakpoints commonly allude to front-end sales charges and consequently are established essentially on fund [share classes](/share_class) with a front-end sales charge.

## Rights of Accumulation Breakpoints

Breakpoints are set at different levels to offer investors a discount on sales charges when they make bigger investments. Breakpoints are determined by the mutual fund and integrated inside the fund distribution process. They are ordinarily offered for funds with a front-end sales charge however might be accessible for different types of sales charges too.

Mutual funds are required to give a description of breakpoints and qualification requirements in the fund [prospectus](/prospectus). By coming to or outperforming a breakpoint, an investor will face a lower sales charge and set aside cash.

The Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) gives the accompanying manual for mutual fund ROA breakpoints. ROA breakpoints may become effective when an investor's holdings reach $25,000.

Investment and Sales Charge:

- Under $25,000 5.00%
- Somewhere around $25,000, yet under $50,000 4.25%
- No less than $50,000, yet under $100,000 3.75%
- No less than $100,000, however under $250,000 3.25%
- Something like $250,000, yet under $500,000 2.75%
- Somewhere around $500,000, however under $1 million 2.00%
- $1 million or more No sales charge

Rights of accumulation breakpoints can be important for high net worth investors buying shares through a financial intermediary that charges the fund's front-end sales charge. ROA breakpoints can influence the investor's long-term investing plans. In this model, the investor would have to invest another $20,000 to arrive at the next front-end sales breakpoint of 3.75%. In the event that an investor has a $1 million investment or compasses the $1 million ROA breakpoint they commonly wouldn't need to pay a front-end sales charge.

## Illustration of ROA

For instance: Suppose an investor might want to buy $5,000 of Fund ABC Class A shares with a [front-end sales charge](/front-endload) of 5.00% charged by the intermediary. The investment of $5,000 adds to the investor's existing investment of $25,000 in the fund's Class A shares as of now. Fund ABC follows a similar ROA breakpoint schedule illustrated by FINRA.

With the new investment of $5,000, the investor currently has an accumulation of $30,000. Consequently, their extra purchase of $5,000 fits the bill for a discounted front-end sales charge of 4.25% versus the standard 5.00%.

## Highlights
- Breakpoints for load mutual funds are the dollar amounts for the purchase of the fund's shares that qualifies the investor for a diminished sales charge.
- Rights of accumulation (ROA) grant holders of mutual fund shares the potential for decreased loads (commissions) while purchasing more fund shares.
- While common, not all funds offer ROAs, so check before purchasing in the event that you plan to collect a sizable position.
