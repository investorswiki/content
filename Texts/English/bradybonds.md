## What Are Brady Bonds?

Brady bonds are sovereign debt securities, named in [U.S. dollars (USD)](/usd), issued by emerging nations and backed by [U.S. Treasury bonds](/treasurybond).

## Understanding Brady Bonds

Brady bonds are the absolute most liquid emerging market securities. The bonds are named after former U.S. Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady, who sponsored the work to rebuild emerging market debt of, principally, Latin American countries.

Since the bank exchanges a nonperforming loan for a performing bond, the debtor government's liability turns into the payment on the bond, as opposed to the bank loan. This decreased the concentration risk to these banks.

The program, known as the Brady Plan, called for the U.S. furthermore, multilateral lending agencies, like the [International Monetary Fund (IMF)](/imf) and the [World Bank](/worldbank), to cooperate with commercial bank creditors in restructuring and paying off the debt of those non-industrial nations that were chasing after structural changes and economic programs upheld by these agencies. The most common way of making Brady bonds included changing over defaulted loans into bonds with U.S. Treasury [zero-coupon bonds](/zero-couponbond) as collateral.
