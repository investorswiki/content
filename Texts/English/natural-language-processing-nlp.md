# Natural Language Processing (NLP)
## What Is Natural Language Processing (NLP)?

Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a field of artificial intelligence (AI) that empowers computers to break down and figure out human language, both written and spoken. It was formed to build software that produces and grasps natural dialects so a client can have natural discussions with a computer rather than through programming or artificial dialects like Java or C.

## Understanding Natural Language Processing (NLP)

Natural Language Processing (NLP) is one step in a bigger mission for the technology area — specifically, to utilize artificial intelligence (AI) to improve on the way the world works. The digital world has proved to be a game-changer for a great deal of companies as an undeniably technology-shrewd population tracks down better approaches for communicating online with one another and with companies.

Social media has re-imagined the importance of local area; [cryptocurrency](/cryptocurrency) has changed the digital payment standard; online business has made another significance of the word convenience, and cloud storage has presented one more level of data retention to the majority.

Through AI, fields like [machine learning](/machine-learning) and deep learning are opening eyes to a world, everything being equal. Machine learning is progressively being utilized in data analytics to figure out [big data](/big-data). It is likewise used to program chatbots to recreate human discussions with customers. Be that as it may, these forward applications of machine learning wouldn't be possible without the ad lib of Natural Language Processing (NLP).

## Stages of Natural Language Processing (NLP)

NLP joins AI with computational etymology and computer science to handle human or natural dialects and discourse. The interaction can be broken down into three parts. The primary task of NLP is to comprehend the natural language received by the computer. The computer utilizes an underlying statistical model to perform a discourse recognition schedule that switches the natural language over completely to a programming language. It does this by breaking down a recent discourse it hears into little units, and afterward compares these units to previous units from a previous discourse.

The output or result in message design statistically decides the words and sentences that were undoubtedly said. This first task is called the discourse to-message process.

The next task is called the grammatical feature (POS) labeling or word-classification disambiguation. This cycle basically recognizes words in their syntactic forms as things, action words, modifiers, past tense, and so on utilizing a set of dictionary rules coded into the computer. After these two processes, the computer presumably now comprehends the importance of the discourse that was made.

The third step taken by a NLP is text-to-discourse conversion. At this stage, the computer programming language is changed over into a discernible or text based design for the client. A financial news chatbot, for instance, that is posed an inquiry like "How can Google do today?" will probably filter online finance locales for Google stock, and may choose to choose just data like price and volume as its reply.

## Special Considerations

NLP endeavors to make computers intelligent by causing humans to accept they are connecting with another human. [The Turing test](/turing-test), proposed by Alan Turing in 1950, states that a computer can be completely intelligent in the event that it can think and make a discussion like a human without the human realizing that they are really talking with a machine.

One computer in 2014 did convincingly finish the assessment — a chatbot with the persona of a 13-year-old kid. It is not necessarily the case that an intelligent machine is impossible to build, however it frames the troubles inherent in making a computer think or speak like a human. Since words can be utilized in various settings, and machines don't have the genuine experience that humans have for conveying and depicting substances in words, it might take a short time longer before the world can totally get rid of computer programming language.

## Features
- Natural language processing (NLP) utilizes computer calculations and artificial intelligence to empower computers to perceive and answer human communication.
- Text-to-discourse applications, which are presently found on most iOS and Android platforms, alongside smart speakers like the Amazon Echo (Alexa) or Google Home, have become pervasive instances of NLP throughout the course of recent years.
- While several NLP methods exist, they regularly include breaking discourse or text into discrete sub-units and afterward contrasting these with a database of how these units fit together in light of past experience.
