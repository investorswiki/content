## What Is an Account Hold?

An account hold is a restriction on an account owner's ability to access funds in the account due to different reasons. At the point when a bank requires an account to briefly wait, it generally does as such to safeguard itself from expected loss, yet it likewise may have the interest of the customer as a top priority. For example, a bank might put a hold on an account assuming they distinguish unusual activity that might be due to thought fraud or identity theft.

## Understanding Account Holds

There are several explanations behind an account hold. A [deposit](/deposit) of an especially large check, an out-of-state check, or a foreign check might make an account be requires to briefly wait, however the hold would be limited to the check amount. The customer would need to trust that the check will go through before approaching the funds. Note that new accounts, in any case, are normally subject to holds on whole initial deposits. In the event that funds were pledged as [collateral](/collateral) for a loan, there would be a hold.

Likewise, when a customer promises a bank account as collateral for a loan, either the loan must be paid off, or the bank account must be taken out as collateral before the customer can resume accessing funds in the account.
