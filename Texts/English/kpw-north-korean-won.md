The North Korean government, which keeps into under severe control, utilizes a special [convertible](/convertible-currency) won for use by foreign guests when in country.

As of September 2020, U.S. $1 is worth approximately 900 KPW.

## Figuring out the North Korean Won

The North Korean won is the currency of record inside North Korea's [centralized economy](/centralizedmarket), implying that it is controlled by the socialist state. Because of that state control, getting accurate data about the North Korean economy can be troublesome. State control can likewise lead to some unique [monetary policy](/monetarypolicy) choices. For instance, in 2001 the government eliminated the rate of 2.16 won to one dollar, supposedly a representative since bits of gossip were that it depended on former Supreme Leader Kim Jong-il's February 16 birthday. State banks currently issue banknotes at rates nearer to the black market rate.

The Central Bank of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea has complete authority over the KPW, being responsible for its regulation and issuance. It processes generally national [revenues](/income) and [precious metals](/preciousmetal) and funds all government agencies all through the country. The central bank likewise has oversight of several state banks, including the Foreign Trade Bank, which is responsible for processing foreign transactions and foreign currencies.

The North Korean won went through a dubious, and very exorbitant, [revaluation](/revaluation) in November 2009. The government wanted to fix control over the country's markets, and the won proved to be its method of decision. The goal of the currency update was to tamp down inflation and reclaim the country's economy from dealers on the [black market](/blackmarket). The revaluation was at 1 percent of its existing value. The outcome was that all possible savings individual residents had accumulated were basically cleared out by almost 100%.

## The North Korean Economy

Korea was generally an independent realm. Be that as it may, following the Russo-Japanese War, the Korean landmass was officially added by the Japanese. Korea stayed a Japanese settlement from 1910 to 1945. After World War II, the Japanese powers in the northern region of Korea gave up to the Soviet Union. As Japanese powers pulled out (and the Japanese occupation really ended), Soviet soldiers assumed command over the northern region of the country. Simultaneously, American soldiers assumed responsibility for the southern region. The North and South stayed in conflict with each other, finishing in the U.S.- involved Korean war from 1950-1953, at which point the North locked down and isolated itself.

The country of North Korea, officially known as the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK), has an isolated and firmly controlled [command economy](/command-economy). A command economy is a standard part of any socialist country. In a command economy, the economy is centrally arranged and composed by the government. The North Korean State and the socialist faction figure out what goods ought to be delivered and by whom, how much ought to be created, and the price at which the goods are offered available to be purchased.

Poverty and civil struggle has increased dramatically over the course of the last a very long time as the [private sector](/private-sector) initially built up some decent forward momentum in light of the fact that the state couldn't furnish the general population with adequate food. Facing a food crisis, the government permitted select [wholesale market](/wholesaling) activity, including rancher's markets, starting in 2002. In any case, as those markets developed and compromised Kim Jong-il's extremist rule, and that of his replacements, he stepped in with the revaluation. The drop successfully shut down private markets and tossed the country and its residents into a deep economic crisis.

North Korea's gross national income per capita remained at 1.408 million won (U.S. $1,185) in 2019, just 3.8% of that of South Korea's.
