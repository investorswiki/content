# SEC MEF Filings
## What Are SEC MEF Filings?

A SEC MEF filing concerns the registration of up to an extra 20% of [securities](/security) for an offering under Rule 462(b) of the [Securities Act of 1933](/securitiesact1933). The filing is an increasing the finished by an issuer size of its offering.

## Understanding SEC MEF Filings

SEC Rule 462(b) states that a registration statement and any post-effective amendments for up to an extra 20% of securities will become effective after filing with the [Securities and Exchange Commission](/sec) (SEC) if the registration is for the same class of securities previously approved for registration by the SEC.

The term SEC filling generally refers to formal documents submitted to the SEC. [Broker-dealers](/agent seller), public companies, and some insiders must make SEC filings consistently. These filings give important information about companies to investors and finance professionals. The [Electronic Data Gathering, Analysis and Retrieval](/edgar) (EDGAR) database makes numerous SEC filings accessible to the public online.

To ensure that the filing fees are calculated accurately, including any fees previously paid, an issuer must make certain to incorporate the total Proposed Maximum Aggregate Offering Price (PMAOP) from the prior registration statement notwithstanding the new PMAOP on the MEF filing.

## Types of SEC MEF Filings

EC MEF filings might apply to the below SEC forms, among others, under Rule 462(b). The primary difference for an increased registration form would be the type of issuer (for example foreign or domestic) and type of securities in the offering:

- [Form S-1](/sec-form-s-1) is a basic form used when different forms are neither authorized nor required. Enlisting securities of foreign governments or their political subdivisions is not used.
- **Form S-3** is for companies required to report for no less than 12 months that have stuck to the convenient filing requirements of Form S-2.
- [Form S-11](/sec-form-s-11) is used to register securities of [real estate investment trusts](/reit) (REITs) and some other real estate companies.
- [Form F-1](/sec-form-f-1) is used by eligible foreign private issuers.
- [Form F-3](/sec-form-f-3) can be used by eligible foreign private issuers that have reported for something like 12 months under the [Securities Exchange Act of 1934](/seact1934), and have a worldwide public market float of more than $750 million.
