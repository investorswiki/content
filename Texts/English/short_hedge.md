## Illustration of a Short Hedge

We should expect it's October and Exxon Mobil Corporation consents to sell 1,000,000 barrels of oil to a customer in December with the sale price in light of the market price of crude oil upon the arrival of delivery. The energy firm realizes that it can serenely create a gain on the sale by selling each barrel for $50 in the wake of considering [production](/production-cost) and marketing costs.

Currently, the commodity trades at $55 per barrel. Be that as it may, Exxon accepts it could fall over the course of the next couple of months as the [trade war](/trade-war) between the United States and China keeps on compelling global economic growth. To moderate [downside risk](/downsiderisk), the company chooses to execute a partial short hedge by shorting 250 Crude Oil Dec. 2019 Futures contracts at $55 per barrel. Since every crude oil futures contract addresses 1000 barrels of crude oil, the value of the contracts is $13,750,000 (250,000 x $55).

At the hour of delivery to the customer in December, the oil price has fallen and presently trades at $49. Exxon thus [covers](/buytocover) its short position for $12,250,000 (250,000 x $49) with a profit of $1,500,000 ($13,750,000-$12,250,000). Consequently, the short hedge has offset the sale's loss brought about by the decline in the oil price.
