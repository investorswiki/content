# NAHB/Wells Fargo Housing Market Index
## What Is the NAHB/Wells Fargo Housing Market Index (HMI)?

The NAHB/Wells Fargo Housing Market Index (HMI) is a month to month sentiment survey of individuals from the National Association of Home Builders (NAHB). The index measures sentiment among builders of U.S. single-family homes, and is a widely watched measure of the U.S. housing sector. Since housing addresses is a large capital investment and spurs extra consumer spending on machines and decorations, housing market indices help to monitor the overall soundness of the economy.

## Figuring out the NAHB/Wells Fargo Housing Market Index (HMI)

The National Association of Home Builders is a league of in excess of 700 state and neighborhood associations with 140,000 individuals. Around one-third are home builders and remodelers, and the rest experts from related fields, for example, mortgage finance and building materials supply. NAHB builders account for some 80% of the new homes worked in the U.S.

Starting around 1985, the HMI has been founded on a month to month survey completed by NAHB builders, which was generating nearly 400 reactions starting around 2007. In finishing the survey, builders rate housing market conditions and outlook in view of their recent experience.

The HMI is a [weighted average](/weightedaverage) of three diffusion indexes, intended to go from 0 to 100. HMI readings over 50 mirror a generally good market view and outlook in the industry.

HMI tumbled to a record low of 8 in January 2009, and set a record high of 90 in November 2020.

### Ascertaining the Housing Market Index

The HMI is a weighted average of three component indices: current single-family sales, the outlook for sales over the course of the next six months, and traffic of prospective buyers. Every month, participating builders rate current sales and the half year outlook as great, fair, or poor and the buyer traffic as high to extremely high, average, or low to exceptionally low.

A [diffusion index](/diffusionindex) is calculated for every series by applying the formula (great - poor + 100)/2 to the present and future sales series and (high/extremely high - low/exceptionally low + 100)/2 to the prospective buyer traffic reactions.

Each subsequent index is then seasonally adjusted and weighted to generate the HMI. The loads are .5920 for present sales, .1358 for future sales, and .2722 for traffic. The loads were picked in light of historical data to augment the [correlation](/correlation) between the HMI and [housing starts](/housingstarts) over the course of the next six months.

## The Housing Market Index as an Economic Indicator

The HMI shows a close correlation with U.S. single-family housing begins, which measure the number of exclusive homes on which construction began in a given month. Housing begins are a key [economic indicator](/economic_indicator) and the report is supplied month to month by the U.S. [Census Bureau](/bureauofcensus).

As a check of home developer sentiment, the HMI gives important insights on the close term heading of housing begins. The HMI is delivered at 10 a.m. EST normally on the 11th business day of the month, which is the day leading up to when the housing begins data are delivered by the Census Bureau.

The HMI has historically closely followed housing starts and building permits. Its complete recovery from the profundities of the 2008-2009 global financial crisis has dominated the rebound in housing begins, notwithstanding.
