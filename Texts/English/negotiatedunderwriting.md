The underwriting firm is chosen well in advance of the expected date when the security will be offered available to be purchased. Before the trade, the issuer and the underwriter will enter negotiations to decide a purchase price and offering price. Negotiated underwriting is essential during a [initial public offering](/ipo) (IPO).

The purchase price is the price that the underwriter will pay for the new issue. This price must take care of the expense of selling the bonds to investors, giving counsel to the issuer about the offering, and extra costs to market the offering to institutional investors. The size and structure of the specific issue are likewise up for negotiation during a negotiated underwriting process.

As the gatherings work through the course of negotiation, they will concur upon an offering price, which is the price that the public will pay. The difference between the purchase price and the public offering price is known as the [underwriting spread](/underwritingspread) and addresses the profits which will go to the underwriting institution. In a negotiated cycle, the underwriter regularly assumes a part in marketing the security to likely investors.

On the off chance that the issuer of a security doesn't have adequate information on [debt financing ](/debtfinancing)to enter negotiations, an independent financial advisor can assume the job of a third-party moderator for their sake. Contingent upon the contract went into, the underwriting bank might be required to expect ownership of shares which don't sell through an interaction called [devolvement](/devolvement).
