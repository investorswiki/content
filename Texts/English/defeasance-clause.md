# Defeasance Clause
## What Is a Defeasance Clause?

A defeasance clause is a provision in some [mortgage](/mortgage) contracts demonstrating that the borrower will receive the title to the property once the mortgage payments have been all made.

## How a Defeasance Clause Works in Real Estate

In a normal mortgage loan, the home or other property fills in as [collateral](/collateral). That permits the lender to recover its money if the borrower [defaults](/default2) on the loan.

States vary in the way that functions. In states that follow "lien theory," the borrower holds title to the property, yet the lender holds a [lien on the property](/property-lien) and can [foreclose](/dispossession) on it assuming the borrower defaults. In states that follow what's known as "middle theory," the borrower likewise holds title to the property, however the [title](/title) returns to the lender in the event of a default.

The leftover states follow "title theory," in which the lender holds the title to the property until the mortgage is paid off. In states where the lender actually holds the title, the mortgage contract is probably going to contain a defeasance clause. Defeasance clauses depend on the concept of [defeasance](/defeasance), which invalidates a deed or contract.

The states that buy into title theory are Alaska, Arizona, California, Colorado, Georgia, Idaho, Mississippi, Missouri, Nebraska, Nevada, North Carolina, Oregon, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Virginia, Washington, West Virginia, and Wyoming, as well as Washington, D.C.

At last, defeasance happens when the borrower wraps up making each of the payments on the loan and no longer owes anything to the lender.

## Alternative Uses for a Defeasance Clause

In certain circumstances, defeasance clauses may likewise be utilized for transferring alternative collateral. In particular, the borrower could give different assets to supplant the real estate as collateral eventually during the loan.

This type of defeasance clause could make it workable for the borrower to get ownership of the property's title before the finish of the loan by providing adequate alternative collateral. The alternative collateral could incorporate investment assets or other property.

## Defeasance Clause Exceptions

As referenced before, states that follow title theory permit a lender to hold title to a property until the mortgage has been fully paid off. By then, the lender can release the deed to the borrower as endorsed in the mortgage contract's defeasance clause. Presently, 20 states plus the District of Columbia, listed above, follow title theory.

The excess 30 states are special cases. In those states, mortgage contracts essentially reach a conclusion when the payments have been all made and wo exclude a defeasance clause.
