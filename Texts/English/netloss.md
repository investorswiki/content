## What Is Net Loss?

A net loss is when total expenses (counting taxes, fees, interest, and depreciation) surpass the income or revenue created for a given period of time. A net loss might be stood out from a net profit, otherwise called [after-tax income](/aftertaxincome) or [net income](/net-income-after-taxes-niat).

## Figuring out Net Loss

For a business, net loss is sometimes alluded to as a [net operating loss](/netoperatingloss) (NOL). For tax purposes, net losses might be carried forward into future tax a very long time to offset gains or profits in those years. A net loss shows up on the company's primary concern or [income statement](/incomestatement). Net loss or net profit is calculated utilizing the following formula:

**Net Loss** (or Net Profit) **= Revenues - Expenses**

Since revenues and expenses are matched during a set time, a net loss is an illustration of the matching principle, which is a necessary part of the [accrual accounting](/accrualaccounting) method. Expenses connected with income earned during a set time are remembered for (or "matched to") that period paying little mind to when the expenses are paid.

## Factors Contributing to a Net Loss
- The most common factor that adds to a net loss is a low revenue stream. Strong competition, ineffective marketing programs, weak pricing strategies, not keeping up with market requests, and inefficient marketing staff add to decreasing revenues. Diminished revenues bring about diminished profits. At the point when profits fall below the level of expenses and [cost of goods sold](/cogs) (COGS) in a given time, a net loss results.
- COGS likewise influences net losses. Substantial production or purchase costs of products being sold are subtracted from revenue. The excess money is utilized for covering expenses and making profit. At the point when COGS surpasses funding for expenses, a net loss happens.
- Expenses add to net losses too. Even when targeted revenue is earned, and COGS stays inside limits, unexpected expenses and overspending in planned areas might surpass gross profits.
- Unnecessary [carrying costs](/carrying-costs) are a type of expense that can add to net losses. These are the costs a company pays for holding inventory in stock before it is sold to customers.

> Businesses that have a net loss don't be guaranteed to fail quickly in light of the fact that they might opt to utilize their [retained earnings](/retainedearnings) or loans to remain above water. This strategy, in any case, is just short-term, as a company without profits won't make due in the long-term.

## Net Loss Examples

Say that substantial refunds were expected as companies took advantage of outstanding [tax credits](/taxcredit) recently issued as an approach to holding position in the state during the recession. Subsequently, the state treasurer expects a lessening of $99 million in revenue from the state's principal business taxes. This prompts state authorities to cut the current and impending fiscal year revenue projections overwhelmingly and, except if they can cut expenditures too, they will be operating at a net loss.

Another model would be if Company A has $200,000 in sales, $140,000 in COGS, and $80,000 in expenses. Subtracting $140,000 COGS from $200,000 in sales results in $60,000 in gross profit. Be that as it may, on the grounds that expenses surpass gross profit, a $20,000 net loss results.

Yet another model would be of a company that offers frozen food sources and needs to pay for refrigerated storage facilities, utility costs, taxes, employee expenses, and insurance. In the event that sales are slow, the company should hold onto its inventory for a longer time frame, causing extra carrying costs which could add to a net loss.
