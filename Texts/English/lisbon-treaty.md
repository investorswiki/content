# Lisbon Treaty
## What is the Lisbon Treaty?

The Lisbon Treaty, otherwise called the Treaty of Lisbon, refreshed regulations for the European Union, laying out a more centralized leadership and foreign policy, a legitimate interaction for countries that wish to leave the Union, and a streamlined cycle for establishing new policies.

The treaty was endorsed on December 13, 2007, in Lisbon, Portugal, and amended the two previous deals that laid out the foundation for the [European Union](/europeanunion).

## Grasping the Lisbon Treaty
### Before the Lisbon Treaty

The Lisbon Treaty was endorsed by the 27 member states of the European Union and officially produced results in December of 2009, two years after it was agreed upon. It amended two existing deals, the Treaty of Rome and the [Maastricht Treaty](/maastricht-treaty).

- Treaty of Rome: Signed in 1957, this treaty presented the European Economic Community (EEC), diminished customs regulations between member countries, and worked with a single market for goods and the set of policies for shipping them. Otherwise called the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU).
- Maastricht Treaty: Signed in 1992, this treaty laid out the three mainstays of the European Union and made ready for [the euro](/euro), the common currency. Otherwise called the Treaty on European Union (TEU).

While these previous deals set ground rules and precepts of the European Union, the Lisbon Treaty went further to lay out new extensive jobs and official legal procedures.

### What the Lisbon Treaty Changed

The Lisbon Treaty was based on existing settlements yet adopted new rules to upgrade attachment and streamline action inside the European Union. Important articles of the Lisbon Treaty include:

- Article 18: Established protocol for choosing a High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy. Chosen in or out of office by a majority vote, this Representative directs the Union's foreign and security affairs.
- Article 21: Detailed global political policy for the European Union, in light of the principles of universal human rights, a majority rule government, and development. The Union pledged to manufacture collusions with those countries that support these convictions and contact [third-world nations](/third-world) to assist them with creating.
- [Article 50](/article-50): Established procedures for a member country to leave the European Union.

The Lisbon Treaty likewise supplanted the previously dismissed Constitutional Treaty, which endeavored to lay out a Union constitution. Member countries couldn't settle on the voting procedures laid out in the constitution, since certain countries, like Spain and Poland, would lose voting power.

The Lisbon Treaty settled this issue by proposing weighted votes and broadening the scope of qualified majority voting.

### Assessments of the Lisbon Treaty

The people who supported the Lisbon Treaty contended that it enhanced accountability by giving a better system of [checks and balances](/checks-and-balances), and that it provided more power to the European Parliament, which held major influence in the Union's legislative branch.

Numerous pundits of the Lisbon Treaty contended that it pulled influence toward the center, framing an inconsistent distribution of power that disregarded the necessities of more modest countries.
