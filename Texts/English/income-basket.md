Every category, or basket, addresses a different source of income. Baskets might operate at a net gain or a net loss individually. In any case, a loss in one basket may not be utilized to offset [taxable gains](/taxablegain) from another

## How an Income Basket Works

Income baskets are an assortment of types of income grouped together to make analysis of the group simpler.

The basket concept can assist taxpayers with understanding which sources of income are furnishing them with gains and which with losses. Without the utilization of baskets, this cycle can be more troublesome.

Another "basket" is category 901(j) that explicitly applies to an individual, estate, or trust who paid or accrued certain foreign taxes to a foreign country or U.S. possession seeking to claim the [foreign tax credit](/foreign-tax-credit).

### Income Baskets in Business

The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 presented two new baskets for companies' foreign income: The Global Intangible Low Taxed Income (GILTI) basket and the foreign branch basket. What these baskets mean for the assortment of taxes isn't important here.

The taxpayer had a [net loss](/netloss) of $5,000 on that investment this year. Toward the year's end, this taxpayer has had a net income of $65,000. This addresses their salary minus the loss from the investment.

Overall, the taxpayer brought in money this year. Notwithstanding, if they wanted to take a gander at their finances to evaluate where their money comes from and how to get more cash-flow next year, they can take a gander at the returns on their baskets individually.
