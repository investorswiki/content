# Interest Rate Differential (IRD)
## What Is an Interest Rate Differential (IRD)?

An interest rate differential (IRD) gauges the differentiation in [interest rates](/interestrate) between two comparable interest-bearing assets. Most frequently it is the difference between two interest rates.

Traders in the foreign exchange market use IRDs while pricing forward exchange rates. In light of the [interest rate parity](/interestrateparity), a trader can make an expectation representing things to come exchange rate between two currencies and set the premium, or discount, on the current market exchange rate [futures contracts](/futurescontract).

## Understanding Interest Rate Differential (IRD)

IRDs essentially measure the difference in interest rates between two securities. In the event that one bond yields 5% and another 3%, the IRD would be 2 percentage points â€” or 200 [basis points](/basispoint) (bps). IRD estimations are most frequently utilized in [fixed income](/fixedincome) trading, forex trading, and lending computations.

The IRD is utilized in the housing market to portray the difference between the interest rate and a bank's posted rate on the prepayment date for mortgages.

The IRD is likewise a key part of the carry trade, a trading strategy that includes borrowing at a low-interest rate and investing the proceeds in a [asset](/asset) that gives a higher rate of return. Carry trades frequently comprise of borrowing in a low-interest rate currency, and afterward changing over the borrowed amount into one more currency with a higher yield.

## Interest Rate Differential: A Bond Trade Example

The IRD is the amount the investor can hope to profit utilizing a carry trade. Say an investor borrows $1,000 and changes over the funds into British pounds, considering the purchase of a British bond. If the purchased [bond yields](/bond-yield) 7% while the equivalent U.S. bond yields 3%, then the IRD equals 4%, or 7% - 3%. This profit is guaranteed provided that the [exchange rate](/exchangerate) among dollars and pounds stays steady.

One of the primary risks implied with this strategy is the vulnerability of currency variances. In this model, assuming that the British pound were to fall according to the U.S. dollar, the trader might experience losses.

Furthermore, traders might utilize [leverage](/leverage), like a factor of 10-to-1, to further develop their profit potential. On the off chance that the investor leveraged the borrowing by a factor of 10-to-1, they could create a gain of 40%. Notwithstanding, leverage could likewise cause bigger losses on the off chance that there are strong developments in exchange rates.

## Interest Rate Differential: A Mortgage Example

At the point when homebuyers borrow money to purchase houses, there might be an IRD.

For instance, say a homebuyer purchased a home and took out a [mortgage](/mortgage) at a rate of 5.50% for quite a long time. Expect 25 years have passed and the borrower just has five years left in the mortgage term. The lender could utilize the current market interest rate it is offering for a five-year mortgage to determine the IRD. In the event that the current market interest rate on a five-year mortgage is 3.85%, the IRD is 1.65% or 0.1375% each month.

## Interest Rate Differential (IRD) versus Net Interest Rate Differential (NIRD)

The [net interest rate differential](/net-interest-rate-differential) (NIRD) is a specific type of IRD utilized in forex markets. In international currency markets, the NIRD is the difference between the interest rates of two distinct economic locales.

For example, in the event that a trader is long the [NZD/USD](/nzd-usd-new-zealand-dollar-us-dollar-currency-pair) pair, they would possess the New Zealand currency and borrow the US currency. These New Zealand dollars can be put into a New Zealand bank while at the same time applying for a line of credit for a similar amount from the U.S. bank. The NIRD is the difference in any interest earned and any interest paid while holding the [currency pair](/currencypair) position.
