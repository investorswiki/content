# Guideline Premium and Corridor Test (GPT)
## What Is the Guideline Premium and Corridor Test (GPT)

The guideline premium and corridor test (GPT) is utilized to decide if a [insurance](/insurance) product can be taxed as insurance as opposed to as an investment. GPT limits the amount of premiums that can be paid into an insurance policy relative to the policy's [death benefit](/deathbenefit).

## Understanding the Guideline Premium and Corridor Test (GPT)

The GPT is a [Internal Revenue Service](/irs) (IRS) approved method that decides if a life insurance policy is permitted advantaged tax treatment.

Life insurance policies come in a wide range of shapes and sizes. A special part of a [universal life insurance](/universallife) policy is that the premium is split into two portions. The first portion is allocated towards the cost of the policy, while the subsequent portion goes towards a cash accumulation account; a kind of savings account for the insured. This cash reserve can be borrowed against or permitted withdrawals, both with certain limitations.

Life insurance policies can be structured to either make the most of the death benefit when a person dies or full advantage of the cash accumulation reserve. Those that are death benefit centered start with higher [premiums](/insurance-premium) in the early years and lower premiums in the later years. Life insurance policies zeroed in on cash accumulation are the inverse, with lower premiums in the early years and higher premiums in the later years.

No matter what the life insurance policy chose, every policy must breeze through a specific assessment to decide if it meets all requirements to be taxed as an insurance product or taxed as an investment. Being taxed as an insurance product is better as the tax rate is lower.

There are two tests to decide this factor: the guideline premium and corridor test (GPT) and the cash value accumulation test (CVAT).

## Guideline Premium and Corridor Test (GPT) Implementation

The GPT method is utilized when the policyholder needs to pay the maximum amount of premiums while keeping a variable death benefit or needs to expand the amount of cash that they can collect in the policy more so than boosting the death benefit. As opposed to zeroing in on the death benefit available at life expectancy, the GPT is utilized when the policyholder needs to expand the cash accumulation portion with benefits at a later age.

Insurance policies can fill in value on a tax-deferred basis, with death benefits being exempt from income tax or [capital gains tax](/capitalgain). Having the option to pass the GPT is extraordinarily important to a policyholder as well as the insurer. In the event that an insurance product neglects to breeze through the assessment, it is not generally viewed as an insurance product and is in this way taxed like an investment, implying that neglecting to finish the assessment will lead to a higher tax rate.

Notwithstanding the directed premium and corridor test, an insurer has the option of planning a policy so it passes the [cash value accumulation test](/cash-value-accumulation-test-cvat) (CVAT). The CVAT limits the cash value relative to the death benefit, not at all like the GPT, which limits the premiums relative to the death benefit. Figuring out which test to utilize depends on which insurance product is picked.

The insurer must demonstrate which test will be utilized on the issue date, and when the policy is issued, the insurer can't choose to utilize the other test option all things considered. The decision of test can figure out what the policy premiums, cash value, and benefits will be.

## Guideline Premium and Corridor Test (GPT) and the Deficit Reduction Act (DEFRA).

As universal life insurance policies have an investment viewpoint through cash accumulation with interest earned on the cash reserves, they began being viewed as [investment vehicles ](/investmentvehicle)with cash surrender values. The IRS accepted it was important to separate between [life insurance](/lifeinsurance) policies that were being utilized as traditional insurance or as investment vehicles, so they laid out the Deficit Reduction Act of 1984 (DEFRA).

DEFRA laid out the capabilities that universal life insurance policies must meet to keep up with advantaged tax status under the Internal Revenue Code (IRC) Section 7702. To satisfy the IRC definition of life insurance, life insurance contracts must accommodate an adequate "amount at risk", implying that the pure death benefit protection that a beneficiary would receive upon the death of the insured is adequate.
