# Base Metals
## What Are Base Metals?

Base metals are common metals that stain, oxidize, or erode moderately rapidly when presented to air or dampness. They can be stood out from [precious metals](/preciousmetal) and are widely utilized in commercial and industrial applications, like construction and manufacturing.

Base metals experience the ill effects of several huge disadvantages, too, all of which make them less suitable as [currencies](/money) than precious metals.
