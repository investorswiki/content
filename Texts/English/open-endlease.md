# Open-End Lease
## What Is an Open-End Lease?

An open-end lease is a type of rental agreement that obliges the [lessee](/lessee) (the person making periodic lease payments) to make a balloon payment toward the end of the lease agreement adding up to the difference between the residual and [fair market value](/fairmarketvalue) of the asset. Open-end leases are likewise called "finance leases."

Frequently, open-end leases are utilized in commercial transactions. For instance, while a moving business obtains a fleet of vans and trucks, an open-end lease might end up being a better bargain due to the unlimited mileage offered under the terms of a lease.

## How an Open-End Lease Works

Since the lessee must purchase the leased asset upon lease expiration, that person bears the risk that the asset devalues more than was expected toward the lease's end. Of course, simultaneously, the lessee stands to understand a gain on the off chance that the asset devalues not exactly expected.

For instance, assume your lease payments for a vehicle depend on the assumption that a $20,000 new vehicle will be worth just $10,000 toward the end of your lease agreement. In the event that the vehicle ends up being worth just $4,000, you must repay the [lessor](/lessor) (the company who leased the vehicle to you) for the lost $6,000 since your lease payment was calculated on the basis of the vehicle having a salvage value of $10,000.

Essentially, since you are buying the vehicle, you must bear the loss of that extra [depreciation](/depreciation). On the other hand, on the off chance that the vehicle is worth more than $10,000 toward the end of the lease, you receive a refund from the lessor.
