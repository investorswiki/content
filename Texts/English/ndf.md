# Non-Deliverable Forward (NDF)
## What Is a Non-Deliverable Forward (NDF)?

A non-deliverable forward (NDF) is a cash-settled, and normally short-term, [forward contract](/forwardcontract). The [notional amount](/notionalvalue) is never exchanged, consequently the name "non-deliverable." Two gatherings consent to take inverse sides of a transaction for a set amount of money â€” at a contracted rate, on account of a currency NDF. This means that counterparties settle the difference between contracted NDF price and the common spot price. The profit or loss is calculated on the notional amount of the agreement by taking the difference between the settled upon rate and the [spot rate](/spot_rate) at the hour of settlement.

## Figuring out Non-Deliverable Forwards (NDF)

A non-deliverable forward (NDF) is a two-party currency derivatives contract to exchange cash flows between the NDF and winning spot rates. One party will pay the other the difference coming about because of this exchange.

**Cash flow = (NDF rate - Spot rate) * Notional amount**

NDFs are traded [over-the-counter (OTC)](/otc) and normally quoted for time spans from one month as long as one year. They are most often quoted and settled in U.S. dollars and have turned into a famous instrument since the 1990s for corporations seeking to [hedge](/hedge) exposure to illiquid currencies.

A non-deliverable forward (NDF) is typically executed [offshore](/offshore), significance outside the home market of the illiquid or untraded currency. For instance, in the event that a country's currency is restricted from moving offshore, settling the transaction in that currency with somebody outside the restricted country won't be imaginable. Notwithstanding, the two gatherings can settle the NDF by changing over all profits and losses on the contract to an unreservedly traded currency. They can then pay each other the profits/losses in that openly traded currency.

All things considered, non-deliverable forwards are not limited to illiquid markets or currencies. They can be utilized by parties hoping to hedge or open themselves to a specific asset, yet who are not keen on conveying or getting the underlying product.

## Non-Deliverable Forward Structure

All NDF contracts set out the currency pair, notional amount, fixing date, settlement date, and NDF rate, and specify that the overall spot rate on the fixing date be utilized to finish up the transaction.

The fixing date is the date at which the difference between the overarching spot market rate and the settled upon rate is calculated. The settlement date is the date by which the payment of the difference is due to the party getting payment. The settlement of a NDF is nearer to that of a [forward rate agreement (FRA)](/fra) than to a traditional forward contract.

Assuming that one party consents to buy Chinese yuan (sell dollars), and the other consents to buy U.S. dollars (sell yuan), then there is potential for a non-deliverable forward between the two gatherings. They consent to a rate of 6.41 on $1 million U.S. dollars. The fixing date will be in one month, with settlement due shortly later.

Assuming that in one month the rate is 6.3, the yuan has increased in value relative to the U.S. dollar. The party who bought the yuan is owed money. Assuming the rate increased to 6.5, the yuan has diminished in value (U.S. dollar increase), so the party who bought U.S. dollars is owed money.
