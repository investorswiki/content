# Foreign Aid
## What Is Foreign Aid?

The term foreign aid alludes to an assistance that one country intentionally transfers to another, which can appear as a gift, [grant](/grant), or loan. A great many people will generally think of foreign aid as [capital](/capital), yet it can likewise be food, supplies, and services like humanitarian aid and military assistance.

More extensive meanings of aid incorporate any assistance moved across borders by strict organizations, non-governmental organizations (NGOs), and establishments. U.S. foreign aid normally alludes to military and economic assistance given by the federal government gives to different countries.

## Figuring out Foreign Aid

As verified above, foreign aid is any type of assistance that one country's government gives to another nation, as a rule from developed to emerging countries. Governments might issue aid as:

- [Money](/money)
- Food and supplies
- Medical assistance including specialists and supplies
- Humanitarian aid like relief laborers
- Training services including agricultural training
- [Wellbeing care](/health_care_sector)
- Education
- Assistance with [infrastructure](/infrastructure) building
- Activities related to peacebuilding

Governments might settle on agreements with the countries to which they give assistance. For example, a developed nation might consent to give grants to those deprived after a natural disaster or during times of conflict, whether they give any type of capital or humanitarian aid. Or on the other hand a government might consent to issue loans to an allied nation that encounters economic vulnerability with special [repayment](/repayment) provisions.

According to the [Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development](/oecd) (OECD), member countries contributed a record $161.2 billion in international aid in 2020. This was isolated into:

- $158 billion in capital grants and loans (counting $12 billion directed toward COVID-19 relief)
- $1.3 billion to create [private sector](/private-sector) vehicles for development
- $1.9 billion worth of loans and [equity](/equity) to private companies

The United States is the most liberal, according to the OECD, giving $35.5 billion in foreign aid in 2020. The leftover countries that were among the main five givers included:

- Germany: $28.4 billion
- The United Kingdom: $18.6 billion
- Japan: $16.3 billion
- France: $14.1 billion

The [United Nations](/united-nations-un) (UN) calls for economically advanced countries to spend no less than 0.7% of their [gross national income](/gross-national-income-gni) (GNI) on international aid. Turkey, Denmark, Luxembourg, Norway, Sweden, and the United Kingdom are the main countries that met or surpassed this level. The total contribution of member countries, however, arrived at the midpoint of 0.3% — much lower than the UN target.

According to Security Assistance Monitor, the Middle East and North African region received the most assistance, trailed by the Sub-Saharan Africa region. The countries that received the most foreign aid from the U.S. for 2020 incorporate Israel, Jordan, Egypt, Tanzania, and Uganda.

## Special Considerations

Foreign aid gauges will quite often change, given the various agencies, funding methods, and aid categories associated with U.S. foreign assistance efforts. For example, the Congressional Research Service (CRS) — an objective association — the country burned through $44.12 billion in foreign assistance during the 2020 fiscal year. That figure amounted to 1% of the total federal budget authority.

Aid can be given by governments straightforwardly or through special federal agencies. For example, the [United States Agency for International Development](/united-states-aid) (USAID) was made in 1961 to give civilian aid. It furnishes assistance with education, environment, climate change, global wellbeing, emergencies and conflicts, food and agriculture, water, and human rights.

## History of Foreign Aid

Foreign aid — likewise commonly alluded to as international aid and economic aid — is certainly not another concept. The colonies were beneficiaries of foreign military aid, especially from France, during the [American Revolution](/modern revolution). During World War I, the U.S. government loaned the Committee for Relief in Belgium $387 million — a lot of which it later excused.

U.S. foreign aid started in earnest during World War II. Before entering the war, the government started piping funds and materials to the allied nations under the Lend-Lease program, which totaled $50.1 billion by August 1945. The United States likewise contributed $2.7 billion through the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA), beginning in late 1943.

For the four years following 1948, the U.S. gave $13 billion in aid to countries impacted by the war like the United Kingdom, France, and West Germany through the [Marshall Plan](/marshall-plan). The Mutual Security Act of 1951 authorized around $7.5 billion in foreign aid each year until 1961. The amount of aid authorized by the Mutual Security Act in 1951 was roughly 2.2% of the country's [gross domestic product](/gdp) (GDP).
