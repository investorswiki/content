# Goal-Based Investing
## What Is Goal-Based Investing?

Goal-based investing is a generally new approach to [wealth management](/wealthmanagement) that underlines investing with the objective of accomplishing specific life goals. Goal-based investing (GBI) includes a wealth manager or investment company's clients measuring their progress towards specific life goals, for example, saving for kids' education or building a retirement savings, as opposed to zeroing in on generating the highest conceivable [portfolio return](/portfolio-return) or beating the market.

## Understanding Goal-Based Investing

Goal-based investing contrasts from traditional investing, in that its measuring stick for progress is the way well the investor can meet their personal life goals, as opposed to how well their investments perform against the market average in a given period.

Consider an investor who is anticipating retirement in no less than a year, and who thusly can't stand to lose even 10% of their portfolio. Assuming the stock market plunges 30% in a given year and the investor's portfolio is down "as it were" 20%, the way that the portfolio has outperformed the market by 10 percentage points would offer meager comfort. That investor needs to zero in more on keeping up with, as opposed to developing, wealth to arrive at their personal goal of bearing the cost of retirement soon.

Goal-based investing re-outlines achievement, based on clients' necessities and goals. On the off chance that a client's principal goals are to put something aside for inevitable retirement and fund the college education of youthful grandkids, an investment strategy would be more conservative for the former and generally aggressive for the last option.

For instance, the [asset allocation](/assetallocation) for the retirement assets may be 10% equities and 90% fixed-income, while the asset allocation for the education fund might be half equities and half fixed-income. Individual requirements and goals, as opposed to risk tolerance, drive investing choices made under the goal-based structure.

The upsides of goal-based investing include:

1. Clients' increased commitment to their life goals by permitting them to notice and participate in unmistakable progress
1. A reduction in hasty direction and overreaction, based on market variances

## Goal-Based Investing After the Great Recession

Goal-based investing has filled in prominence in the years after the [Great Recession](/great-recession) of 2008-09 as investors realized the degree to which chasing high returns could negatively impact long-term wealth accumulation. A large number of hapless investors saw their net worth plunge emphatically, in correlation with declines across virtually all major markets, and a precarious correction in U.S. housing prices.

Several teams have attempted to foster more all encompassing investment approaches in recent years. The startup Ellevest, for instance, centers around goal-based investing strategies, tailored to ladies. CNBC named the company one of 25 promising startups to watch in 2017.

Ellevest has developed calculations for wealth management over the long haul that consider changes in ladies' incomes as they progress through their careers, as well as the wage gap among people. Rather than planning to outperform benchmarks like the [S&P 500](/sp500) or [Russell 2000](/russell2000), Ellevest first requests that its investors make sense of their personalities and life goals; from that point, the team attempts to foster specific investment portfolios for every goal.
