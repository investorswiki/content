# Bank Draft
## What Is a Bank Draft?

The term bank draft alludes to a [negotiable instrument](/negotiable-instrument) that can be utilized as payment just like a check. Not at all like a [check](/check), however, a bank draft is guaranteed by the responsible bank. The total amount of the draft is drawn from the mentioning payer's account — their bank account balance diminishes by the money withdrawn from the account — and is typically held in a [general ledger](/generalledger) account until the draft is cashed by the payee. Bank drafts give the payee a secure form of payment.

## How a Bank Draft Works

Customers have several roads accessible when they need secure, certified payment options. They might expect them to secure a loft or for a deposit for an exceptionally large purchase. Certified payment options give the payee security, it are accessible to know that the funds. These options incorporate [certified checks](/certifiedcheck), [wire transfers](/wiretransfer), and bank drafts.

Bank drafts — additionally called banker's drafts, bank check, or teller's check — are just similar to [cashier's checks](/cashierscheck). They are secure payment options that are guaranteed by the responsible bank — generally speaking, for a large amount of money. At the point when a customer demands a bank draft, the representative guarantees they have sufficient money in their account to cover the amount mentioned. When checked, the bank pulls out the funds from the customer's account and transfers it to an overall ledger or internal account. The bank prepares the draft with the payee's name and the amount. The draft has a serial number — which recognizes the dispatching customer — watermarks, and may even have miniature encoding — distinguishing it as a genuine financial instrument that can be negotiated when introduced by the [payee](/payee) to their bank. Since the funds are as of now withdrawn from the mentioning customer's account, the responsible bank eventually turns into the payer.

As referenced above, bank drafts act as a suitable and secure form of payment. They might be required by a seller when they have no relationship with a buyer, when a [transaction](/transaction) includes a large sale price, or on the other hand in the event that the seller honestly thinks collecting payment might be troublesome. For instance, a seller might demand a bank draft while selling a home or an automobile. Of course, a seller may not collect funds with a bank draft in the event that the bank becomes [insolvent](/bankruptcy) and doesn't respect outstanding drafts, or on the other hand on the off chance that the draft is fraudulent.

Banks regularly charge customers for drafts. This means that notwithstanding the amount of the draft, the mentioning customer might be responsible for a [fee](/fee) — generally a flat rate, a flat fee in light of the total amount of the draft, or for a percentage of the draft. Banks might postpone the fee for customers who have a decent relationship with the institution or for the people who are considered [high-net-worth individuals](/hnwi) (HNWIs).

## Special Considerations

A few banks may not put [stop payments](/stop-payment) on drafts whenever they're issued. That is on the grounds that the transaction has previously occurred, as per their records. Assuming the purchaser wishes to reverse the transaction, the bank normally expects that they [redeem](/recovery) the draft for the full amount. At times, it is feasible to cancel or replace a lost, taken, or obliterated draft as long as the customer has the right documentation.

## Bank Drafts versus Money Orders

A bank draft and a [money order](/money-order) are both prepaid, with a predetermined amount imprinted on the actual instrument. Each is viewed as a secure method of payment from a third-party institution. The payer doesn't have to carry large amounts of money while utilizing a bank draft or money order. Nonetheless, a bank draft is a check drawn on a bank's funds subsequent to accepting the amount from the issuer's account, while cash is utilized while purchasing a money order.

Just a bank might issue a bank draft, while an approved institution, like a certified store, post office, or bank, can issue a money order. Since money orders are frequently used to [launder money](/moneylaundering), numerous states limit how much money can be changed over into a money order. Bank draft amounts can be a lot higher. Due to the limited amounts imprinted on money orders — and the cycle banks go through while giving drafts — money orders cost not as much as bank drafts. Getting a bank draft is more troublesome than getting a money order on the grounds that the [payer](/payer) must go to their bank to purchase the draft, as opposed to utilizing one of the more available institutions that sell money orders.
