# Activity-Based Management (ABM)
## What Is Activity-Based Management?

Activity-based management (ABM) is a system for determining the profitability of each and every part of a business so that its strengths can be enhanced and its shortcomings can either be improved or dispensed with out and out.

Activity-based management (ABM), which was first developed during the 1980s, looks to feature the areas where a business is losing money with the goal that those activities can be killed or improved to increase profitability. ABM breaks down the costs of employees, equipment, facilities, distribution, [overhead](/overhead), and different factors in business to determine and designate activity costs.

## Understanding Activity-Based Management (ABM)

Activity-based management can be applied to various types of companies, including manufacturers, service suppliers, non-profits, schools, and government agencies. ABM can give cost data about any area of operations in a business.

As well as further developing profitability and the overall financial strength of a company, the consequences of an ABM analysis can assist that company with creating more accurate [budgets](/spending plan) and long-term financial estimates.

## Instances of Activity-Based Management (ABM)

ABM can be utilized, for instance, to break down the profitability of another product a company is offering, by taking a gander at marketing and [production costs](/production-cost), sales, warranty claims, and any costs or repair time required for returned or traded products. In the event that a company is dependent on a research and development department, ABM can be utilized to take a gander at the costs of operating the department, the costs of testing out new products and whether the products developed there ended up being productive.

Another model may be a company that has opened an office in a subsequent location. ABM can assist management with evaluating the costs of the running that location, including the staff, facilities, and overhead, and afterward determine whether any subsequent profits are sufficient to compensate for or legitimize those costs.

## Special Considerations

A ton of the data accumulated in activity-based management is derived from data assembled from another management device, [activity-based costing](/abc) (ABC). While activity-based management centers around business processes and managerial activities driving organizational business objectives, activity-based costing tries to recognize and reduce cost drivers by advancing resources.

Both ABC and ABM are management devices that assistance in overseeing operational activities to work on the performance of a business entity or a whole organization.

Activity-based costing can be viewed as a branch-off of activity-based management. By planning business costs like supplies, salaries, and leasing activity to business processes, products, customers, and distribution activity, activity-based costing works on overall managerial viability and transparency.
