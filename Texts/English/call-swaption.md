# Call Swaption
## What is a Call Swaption?

A call swaption, or call swap option, gives the holder the right, yet not the obligation, to go into a swap agreement as the floating rate payer and fixed rate receiver. A call swaptions is otherwise called a receiver swaption.

## How a Call Swaption functions

Swaptions function as the option to swap one sort of interest rate payments for another. This gives a sort of risk protection against rising or falling rates relying upon the sort of option acquired. Swaptions are like other options in that they have two types (receiver or payer), a [strike price](/strikeprice), expiration date, and expiration style. The buyer pays the seller a premium for the swaption.

[Swaptions](/swaption) come in two fundamental types: a call, or receiver, swaption and a [put](/put-swaption), or payer, swaption. Call swaptions give the buyer the right to turn into the floating rate payer while put swaptions give the buyer the right to turn into the fixed rate payer. These develops permit call swaption buyers to exploit floating rate payments in markets with falling interest rates, and gives put swaption buyers the insurance against such markets.

Strike prices for swaptions are really interest rate levels. Expiration dates might show up quarterly or month to month relying upon the offering institution. Expiration styles incorporate [American](/americanoption), which permits exercise whenever, [European](/europeanoption), which permits exercise just at the swaption's expiration date, and [Bermudan](/bermudaswaption), which sets a series of defined exercise dates. The style is defined at the beginning of the swaption contract.

Swaptions are over-the-counter contracts and are not normalized like equity options or futures contracts. In this way, the buyer and seller need to both consent to the price of the swaption, the time until expiration of the swaption, the [notional amount](/notionalvalue), and the fixed and floating rates.

## Call Swaption Considerations

The buyer of a call swaption expects interest rates to fall and wants to hedge against this possibility. For instance, consider an institution that has a large amount of fixed-rate debt and wishes to increase its exposure to falling interest rates. With a call swaption, the institution changes its fixed-rate liability over completely to a floating-rate one however long the swap might last. Hence, the receiver swaption can now plan to pay a floating rate on their balance sheet debt and receive the fixed rate from the put swaption position. In the event that interest rates fall, the call swaption can benefit by paying lower interest. Neither position has a guaranteed profit and, in the event that interest rates rise over the call swaption payer's fixed rate, they stand to lose from the adverse market move.

## Put Swaptions

Put swaptions are the inverse position to call swaptions and are additionally called payer swaptions. A put swaption position accepts interest rates might increase. To capitalize or hedge this possibility, the put swaption holder will pay the fixed rate for the chance to profit from the fixed rate differential as the floating rate increases.
