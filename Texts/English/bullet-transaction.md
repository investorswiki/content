# Bullet Transaction
## What Is a Bullet Transaction?

Bullet [transaction](/transaction) is a term that alludes to a loan that requires the [principal](/principal) balance to be paid in full when it matures, as opposed to sharing it into portions over its lifetime. Borrowers just have to cover interest payments during the life of a bullet loan, basically until the last principal payment is required. Payment of the principal balance upon maturity is called a bullet payment.

## How Bullet Transactions Work

The majority of [loan](/loan) contracts require the repayment of principal and [interest](/interest) over the long haul. So when a homeowner has a mortgage, for example, the lender [amortizes](/amortization) the principal balance for the length of the loan — say, 30 years — figuring in interest payments in view of the loan's [interest rate](/interestrate). The borrower is responsible to make standard payments until the balance is paid off in full.

Nonetheless, not all loans work something very similar. Bullet transactions expect borrowers to cover the full principal balance at the [maturity date](/maturitydate). Until the principal balance is due, they just pay interest. Bullet loans can be repaid by [refinancing](/refinance) or by earning sufficient cash to repay the loan.

Mortgages that require bullet transactions are additionally called [balloon mortgages](/balloon-mortgage). Mortgages and different loans that mature in 15 years are called 15-year bullets. Bullet transactions are priced as a number of [basis points (BPS)](/basispoint) over a benchmark like U.S. [Treasuries](/ustreasury). Investors can buy certificates to invest in bullet transactions.

> Bullet transactions might have at least two tranches, each with various maturities and different interest rates.

## Who Uses Bullet Transactions?

Bullet transactions are considerably less common than "ordinary" loans, in which the principal loan amount is paid off throughout the span of several payments. Nonetheless, bullet transactions are helpful for lenders or borrowers in a number of specific conditions.

For instance, bullet transactions are a decent option for [franchisees](/franchisee), who may not quickly have sufficient money to cover the full cost of possessing a [franchise](/franchise). Bullet transactions allow them to foster cash flow through their business and save to the point of paying off the debt when it matures.

In different cases, companies might utilize bullet loans to create [working capital](/workingcapital) to purchase equipment or finance an acquisition, among different purposes. Revolving loans and term loans can be structured as bullet transactions.

Even in these cases, notwithstanding, lenders might be reluctant to offer bullet transactions, since this model concentrates the risk of default. On the off chance that a franchisee can't generate cash flow rapidly, they might default on the whole amount of the loan.

## Upsides and downsides of Bullet Transactions

The advantages and disadvantages of bullet transactions are different for the borrower and the lender.

For borrowers, the major benefit of a bullet transaction is that tiny repayment is due before the loan matures. This allows lenders to keep a greater amount of the capital that they generate in this period. Then again, bullet transactions will generally bring about borrowers paying more in interest, since they are not diminishing the principal over the lifetime of the loan.

For lenders, the image is unique. In spite of the fact that borrowers are simply required to make interest payments before maturity, bullet transactions can be very [risky](/risk) for lenders. That is a result of a greater chance that borrowers may [default](/default2) when the principal comes due. In the event that the borrower defaults, the lender may not get back any of the principal.

It's important to note that there are many types of bullet transactions, and some can be structured in additional complex ways. Some bullet transactions can have at least two [tranches](/tranches), for example, where various tranches have various maturities or different interest rates. This diminishes risk for the lender.

Also, bullet transactions can be utilized in numerous ways. A [bullet bond](/bulletbond) is a debt instrument whose whole principal value is paid at the same time on the maturity date, rather than amortizing the bond over its lifetime. Bullet bonds can't be reclaimed right on time by an issuer, and that means that they are [noncallable](/noncallable). Along these lines, bullet bonds might pay a generally low rate of interest due to the issuer's high degree of interest rate exposure.

## Bullet Transaction Pricing Formula and Calculation

This is the way pricing for a bullet transaction works. To start with, the total interest payments for every period must be collected and discounted to their [present value (PV)](/presentvalue). This is finished utilizing the following equation:

- PV = Pmt/(1 + (r/2)) ^ (p)

Where:

- PV = present value
- Pmt = total payment for the period
- r = bond yield
- p = payment period

For instance, envision a bullet bond with a par value of $1,000. The [bond yields](/bond-yield) 5%, its [coupon rate](/coupon-rate) is 3%, and the bond pays the coupon two times a year over a period of five years. Given this data, there are nine periods where a $15 coupon payment is made, and one period — the last one — where a $15 [coupon](/coupon) payment is made and the $1,000 principal is paid.

Utilizing the formula above, we can determine the payments during the life of the [bond](/bond) as illustrated in the table below:
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Period</td><td>Calculation</td><td>Present Value</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>1</td><td>$15 / (1 + (5% / 2)) ^ (1)</td><td>$14.63</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>2</td><td>$15 / (1 + (5% / 2)) ^ (2)</td><td>$14.28</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>3</td><td>$15 / (1 + (5% / 2)) ^ (3)</td><td>$13.93</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>4</td><td>$15 / (1 + (5% / 2)) ^ (4)</td><td>$13.59</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>5</td><td>$15 / (1 + (5% / 2)) ^ (5)</td><td>$13.26</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>6</td><td>$15 / (1 + (5% / 2)) ^ (6)</td><td>$12.93</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>7</td><td>$15 / (1 + (5% / 2)) ^ (7)</td><td>$12.62</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>8</td><td>$15 / (1 + (5% / 2)) ^ (8)</td><td>$12.31</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>9</td><td>$15 / (1 + (5% / 2)) ^ (9)</td><td>$12.01</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>10</td><td>$1,015 / (1 + (5% / 2)) ^ (10)</td><td>$792.92</td></tr>
</tbody>
</table>
Including these 10 present values equals $912.48, which is the price of the bond. Note that the principal balance isn't repaid anytime with the exception of the absolute last period — the sign of a bullet transaction.
