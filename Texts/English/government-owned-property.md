# Government-Owned Property
## What Is Government-Owned Property?

Government property comprises of land or [assets](/resource) owned by federal, state, or nearby governments and may likewise incorporate government agencies or government-sponsored organizations like libraries or parks.

## Understanding Government-Owned Property

Government-owned property is much of the time considered 'public' property, albeit that doesn't mean that all such property is freely accessible to all residents. For example, a military base or laboratory might be government-owned, yet with exceptionally restricted access. A public jungle gym, then again, might be owned by a neighborhood government and free to anyone to appreciate.

Property rights characterize the hypothetical and legal ownership of resources and how they can be utilized. These resources can be both unmistakable or theoretical and can be owned by individuals, organizations, and governments.

Government property can incorporate residential, commercial, and industrial land, as well as other physical assets, like machinery. Property might become government-owned property through normal purchases or on the other hand assuming it is [foreclosed](/dispossession) on for inability to pay taxes, or for different reasons. Government-owned property may likewise allude to the property administered by the federal government, like office buildings and consulates.

Some government-owned properties are expected for public use and might be funded by [taxation](/taxation). A [public good](/public-great), for example, is a product that one individual can consume without diminishing its availability to other people and from which nobody is denied. Instances of public goods incorporate law enforcement, national defense, sewer systems, libraries, and public parks. As those models uncover, public goods are quite often publicly financed.

## Special Considerations

Financial backers keen on land and different assets can go to a [auction](/auction) of government-owned property, which may eventually be sold at attractive prices.

For instance, the government might seize [capital equipment](/capitalgoods) from a manufacturer who declared bankruptcy and owed a substantial amount of taxes. It might auction this off to different manufacturers, who are probably going to pay less for the pre-owned equipment than they would in the event that they purchased pristine equipment.

## Government-Owned Property versus Private Property

Government-owned property can be stood out from private property, which is owned by individuals or corporations. Contemporary thoughts of private property stem from eighteenth century rationalist John Locke's theory of homesteading. In this theory, human creatures gain ownership of a natural resource through an act of original development or appropriation. Locke utilized the adage "blending of labor."

For instance, in the event that a man found an obscure island and started to clear the land and build a shelter, he is viewed as the rightful owner of that land. Since most resources have previously been claimed sooner or later ever, the modern acquisition of property happens through voluntary trade, [inheritance](/inheritance), gifts, a gambling bet, or as [collateral](/collateral) on a loan.

Private property rights are one of the mainstays of [capitalist](/capitalism) economies, as well as numerous legal systems, and moral ways of thinking. Inside a private property rights system, individuals need the ability to bar others from the purposes and benefits of their property.

All privately owned resources are **rivalrous**, meaning just a single client might have the [title](/title) and legal claim to the property. Private property owners have the exclusive right to utilize and benefit from the services or product and may exchange the resource on a voluntary basis.
