# Secure Asset Fund for Users (SAFU)
**SAFU**
The Secure Asset Fund for Users (SAFU) is an emergency insurance fund that was laid out by Binance in July 2018 to safeguard users' funds. At the point when the fund was laid out, Binance committed a percentage of trading fees to develop it to a sizable level to safeguard users.
The Secure Asset Fund was valued at US$1 billion in light of the opening price on January 29, 2022. The value of the fund will vary in view of the market. The SAFU fund wallets include BNB, BUSD, and BTC. The wallet locations can be found here and here.
**The beginning of SAFU**
During unscheduled maintenance, Changpeng Zhou (CZ), the Binance CEO, tweeted out to users expressing:
> Funds are safe
After this, the phrase "Funds are safe" turned out to be consistently utilized by CZ to guarantee users knew that their funds were, as a matter of fact, safe.
In 2018, a substance maker named **Bizonacci** transferred a video on YouTube named "Funds Are Safu". It immediately spread and turned into a viral image. From that point forward, the community started utilizing the phrase "Funds are SAFU."
