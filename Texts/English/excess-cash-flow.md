Assuming that an event happens that outcomes in excess cash flows as defined in the credit agreement, the company must make a payment to the lender. The payment could be made a percentage of the excess flow, which is generally dependent on what event created the excess cash flow.

Lenders define what is viewed as an excess cash flow typically by a formula that comprises of a percentage or amount far in excess of expected net income or profit throughout some time span. In any case, that formula will shift from one lender to another, and it depends on the borrower to arrange these terms with the lender.
