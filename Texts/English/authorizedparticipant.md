# Authorized Participant
## What Is an Authorized Participant?

An authorized participant is an organization that has the option to make and recover shares of an exchange traded fund ([ETF](/etf)). They give a large portion of the [liquidity](/liquidity) in the ETF market by getting the underlying assets required to make the shares of an ETF. At the point when there is a shortage of ETF shares in the market, authorized participants make more. Alternately, authorized participants will reduce ETF shares in circulation when the price of the ETF is lower than the price of the underlying shares. That should be possible with the creation and redemption mechanism that keeps the price of an ETF lined up with its underlying net asset value ([NAV](/nav)).

## Grasping Authorized Participants

Authorized participants are responsible for getting the securities that the ETF needs to hold. Assuming that is the S&P 500 index, they will purchase every one of its constituents (weighted by market capitalization) and deliver them to the sponsor. In return, authorized participants receive a block of similarly valued shares called a creation unit. Issuers can involve the services of at least one authorized participants for a fund. Large and active funds tend to have more authorized participants. The number of participants additionally contrasts between different types of funds. Equities, on average, have more authorized participants than bonds, maybe due to higher trading volume.

Generally, authorized participants are large banks, like Bank of America (BAC), JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Goldman Sachs (GS), and Morgan Stanley (MS). They don't receive compensation from a sponsor and have no legal obligation to recover or make the ETF's shares. All things being equal, authorized participants are compensated through activity in the secondary market.

Eventually, the two players benefit from working together. The sponsor receives help in making the fund while the participant gets a block of shares to exchange for a profit. This cycle additionally works in reverse. Authorized participants receive similar value of the underlying security in the fund in the wake of selling shares. Authorized participants make the vast majority of their profits in the ETF market through [arbitrage](/arbitrage).

## Benefits of Authorized Participants

Around the same time, the closed-end fund EXG traded at $7.30 per share, even however its net asset value was $8.02. The closed-end fund EXG was trading at a [discount](/discount) of $0.72, which was around 8.98% of its net asset value. In this case, the closed-end fund EXG was many times further away from its net asset value than the VXUS ETF.

Authorized participants increase the [transparency](/transparency) of markets by keeping ETF prices close to their net asset values. At the point when most investors buy an ETF, they need to make a bet on a specific asset class. Most clearly, somebody purchasing a total stock market ETF trusts that stock prices will go up. Run of the mill investors would rather not investigate whether funds are trading above or below their net asset values. In any case, some long-term [value investors](/valueinvesting) favor closed-end funds definitively in light of a periodic opportunity to track down steep discounts. As a practical matter, authorized participants guarantee that premiums and discounts never get too large in the ETF market.
