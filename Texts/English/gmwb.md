# Guaranteed Minimum Withdrawal Benefit (GMWB)
## What Is a Guaranteed Minimum Withdrawal Benefit (GMWB)?

A guaranteed least withdrawal benefit (GMWB) is a type of rider or contract connected to some annuity insurance policies. It guarantees the policyholder a constant flow of annual withdrawals by means of the return of all premiums paid into the contract, no matter what an investment's performance, through a series of annual withdrawals. A GMWB is dissimilar to a [guaranteed least income benefit](/gmib) (GMIB), where the last option offers a payout of indicated least periodic income after a waiting period, no matter what the variable annuity's investment performance.

## Understanding Guaranteed Minimum Withdrawal Benefit (GMWB)

Guaranteed least withdrawal benefit (GMWB) riders are available for some [fixed annuity](/fixedannuity) and [variable annuity](/variableannuity) products. During market slumps, the policyholder, or annuitant, can pull out a maximum percentage of their whole investments in the annuity. Annual maximum percentages available for withdrawal shift with contracts yet are ordinarily somewhere in the range of 5% and 10%. of the initial investment amount. Until arriving at the depletion of the total initial investment, the annuitant might keep on getting income during the withdrawal period.

A GMWB safeguards annuitants against investment losses without losing the benefit of upside gain. For instance, assume that Jamie's initial investment was $100,000. But since of slumps in the economy, that investment is currently just worth $85,000. Since Jamie had purchased a guaranteed least withdrawal benefit with a rate of 10%, she will actually want to enact the rider contract to pull out a certain percentage every year ($8,500 in this case) until she recuperates the whole $100,000 initial investment.

At times, GMWB riders incorporate the ability to pull out higher amounts when the market is blasting, and the annuity fund is developing. Utilizing these riders, the annuitant may possibly pull out income higher than the maximum investment. Returning to the model above, say the initial investment is presently worth $150,000. In the event that Jamie's rider incorporates a clause where she might understand 2% of the profits earned, she could pull out more than the annual $8,500. This scenario is applicable assuming her rider incorporated the ability to conform to favorable market trends.

## How Is a GMWB Calculated?

The amount available for withdrawal may likewise connection to a policy holder's age when they start to make withdrawals.

For instance, the rider agreement might permit you to take 4% of your investments assuming you start taking withdrawals between the ages of 60 and 64. Income increments to 4.5% on the off chance that you begin taking them between the ages of 65 and 69. Withdrawals after the age of 70 can be at 5%. Before the age of 59\u00bd, withdrawals from the annuity might be subject to [early withdrawal penalties](/withdrawal-punishment) of 10% by the Internal Revenue Service.

The terms of GMWB riders including fees change contingent upon the provider, which is normally an insurance company. Other available annuity riders incorporate guaranteed lifetime withdrawal benefits and guaranteed least accumulation benefits.
