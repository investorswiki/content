It is comprised of in excess of 134,000 professionals who gather data and give knowledge into the national housing market, including the Housing Price Balance.

The housing price balance figure is calculated as the extent of surveyors reporting a rise in housing prices minus the extent reporting a fall in prices. The national survey is comprised of 19 housing-related questions. A portion of the areas covered include:

- The expected price changes over the course of the next three-month, year, and five-year time spans

- How surveyors feel about current price levels

A positive net balance means more surveyors see more price increases, signaling a robust housing market. A negative net balance, however, infers that more surveyors see really housing price diminishes, signaling a delicate housing market.

We should expect that in a survey of 300 surveyors, 150 reported that prices went up, 50 reported no change, and 100 reported that prices went down. Relatively, half of surveyors reported higher prices, and 33% reported lower prices, giving a net house price balance of +17.
