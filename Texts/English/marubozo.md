## What Is a Marubozo?

A Marubozo is a type of [candlestick](/candlestick) charting formation that demonstrates a security's price didn't trade past the scope of the opening and closing price. It is a candlestick pattern that misses the mark on [shadow](/shadow).

## Figuring out the Marubozo

The name Marubozo comes from the Japanese word for "close-edited", demonstrating a candle with no shadow. The central trait of the Marubozo on a chart is the shortfall of upper or lower shadows, meaning the chart doesn't stretch out past the opening day price range. On an up day, the opening price is equivalent to the day's low, and the closing price is equivalent to the day's high. On days that the stock has acquired, it is indicative of a [bull market](/bullmarket), and on days that it has lost, it is indicative of a [bear market](/bearmarket).

Acquiring days, or up days, strongly demonstrate that there is a greater demand for the [stock](/stock) than there is a supply. Or if nothing else a greater demand for the stock than there is a readiness to sell it. The inverse can be said on losing, or down days.

Candlestick charting has been well known since the times of Japanese rice shippers and rice traders. They alluded to the wide part of the candlestick as the real body, and they would utilize it to determine whether the closing price had transcended or fallen below the opening price.

At the point when a Marubozo type of candle is found in a [uptrend](/uptrend), it is utilized to signal that the bulls are forcefully buying the asset and it proposes that the [momentum](/momentum) may go on vertical. The bullish Marubozo candle (open equals low, high equals close) can signal a [reversal](/reversal) when it is found toward the finish of a [downtrend](/downtrend) in light of the fact that it shows that the sentiment has changed and that the bulls are probably going to keep pushing the asset higher. Then again, a bearish Marubozo found in a downtrend (open equals high, low equals close) can signal further selling pressure, particularly whenever found at the highest point of an uptrend.
