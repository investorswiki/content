# Permanent Income Hypothesis
## What Is the Permanent Income Hypothesis?

The permanent income hypothesis is a theory of consumer spending expressing that individuals will spend money at a level reliable with their expected long-term average [income](/income). The level of expected long-term income then, at that point, becomes considered the level of "permanent" income that can be securely spent. A worker will save provided that their current income is higher than the anticipated level of permanent income, to make preparations for future decreases in income.

## Figuring out the Permanent Income Hypothesis

The permanent income hypothesis was figured out by the Nobel Prize-winning economist [Milton Friedman](/milton-friedman) in 1957. The hypothesis suggests that changes in consumption behavior are not unsurprising in light of the fact that they depend on individual expectations. This has broad ramifications concerning economic policy.

Under this theory, even on the off chance that economic policies are fruitful in expanding income in the economy, the policies may not start off a multiplier impact with respect to increased consumer spending. Rather, the theory predicts that there won't be an increase in [consumer spending](/consumer-spending) until workers reform expectations about their future incomes.

Milton accepted that individuals will consume in light of an estimate of their future income rather than what [Keynesian](/keynesianeconomics) economics proposed; individuals will consume in view of their at the time after-tax income. Milton's basis was that individuals like to [smooth](/consumption-smoothing) their consumption as opposed to let it bounce around because of short-term changes in income.

## Spending Habits Under the Permanent Income Hypothesis

On the off chance that a worker knows that they are probably going to receive an income [bonus](/bonus) toward the finish of a specific pay period, it is conceivable that the worker's spending in advance of that bonus might change in anticipation of the extra earnings. Nonetheless, it is likewise conceivable that workers might decide to not increase their spending dependent exclusively upon a short-term windfall. They may rather put forth attempts to increase their savings, in view of the expected lift in income.

Something almost identical can be said to describe individuals who are educated that they are to receive a [inheritance](/inheritance). Their personal expenditures could change to exploit the anticipated flood of funds, however per this theory, they might keep up with their current spending levels to save the supplemental assets. Or on the other hand, they might try to invest those supplemental funds to give long-term growth of their money as opposed to spend it promptly on disposable products and services.

## Liquidity and the Permanent Income Hypothesis

The [liquidity](/liquidity) of the individual can play a job in future income expectations. Individuals without any assets may currently be prone to spend regardless of their income; current or future.

Changes over the long run, but — through incremental salary raises or the assumption of new long-term positions that bring higher, supported pay — can lead to changes in permanent income. With their expectations raised, employees might permit their expenditures to scale up thus.
