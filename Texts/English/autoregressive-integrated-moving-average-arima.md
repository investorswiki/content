# Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA)
## What Is an Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA)?

An autoregressive integrated moving average, or ARIMA, is a statistical analysis model that utilizes [time series data](/timeseries) to either better comprehend the data set or to foresee future trends.

A statistical model is autoregressive in the event that it predicts future values in light of past values. For instance, an ARIMA model could try to foresee a stock's future prices in light of its past performance or forecast an organization's earnings in view of past periods.

## Figuring out Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA)

An autoregressive integrated moving average model is a form of [regression analysis](/regression) that checks the strength of one dependent variable relative to other evolving variables. The model's goal is to foresee future securities or financial market moves by analyzing the differences between values in the series rather than through genuine values.

An ARIMA model can be perceived by framing every one of its components as follows:

- [Autoregression (AR)](/autoregressive): alludes to a model that shows a changing variable that relapses all alone lagged, or prior, values.
- **Integrated (I):** addresses the differencing of raw perceptions to take into account the time series to become stationary (i.e., data values are supplanted by the difference between the data values and the previous values).
- [Moving average (MA)](/movingaverage): consolidates the dependency between a perception and a residual blunder from a moving average model applied to lagged perceptions.

## ARIMA Parameters

Every component in ARIMA functions as a parameter with a standard documentation. For ARIMA models, a standard documentation would be ARIMA with p, d, and q, where integer values substitute for the parameters to show the type of ARIMA model utilized. The parameters can be defined as:

- **p**: the number of lag perceptions in the model; otherwise called the lag order.
- **d**: the number of times that the raw perceptions are differenced; otherwise called the degree of differencing.
- q: the size of the moving average window; otherwise called the order of the moving average.

In a [linear regression](/nonlinear-regression) model, for instance, the number and type of terms are incorporated. A 0 value, which can be utilized as a parameter, would mean that particular component ought not be utilized in the model. Along these lines, the ARIMA model can be developed to perform the function of an ARMA model, or even simple AR, I, or MA models.

## Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) and Stationarity

In an autoregressive integrated moving average model, the data are differenced to make it stationary. A model that shows stationarity is one that shows there is consistency to the data over the long haul. Generally economic and market data show trends, so the purpose of differencing is to eliminate any trends or seasonal designs.

[Seasonality](/seasonality), or when data show regular and unsurprising examples that repeat over a calendar year, could negatively influence the regression model. In the event that a trend appears and stationarity isn't clear, many of the calculations during the cycle can't be made with great viability.

## Special Considerations

ARIMA models depend on the assumption that past values meaningfully affect current or future values. For instance, an investor utilizing an ARIMA model to forecast stock prices would expect that new purchasers and merchants of that stock are influenced by recent market transactions while choosing the amount to offer or acknowledge for the security.

Albeit this assumption will hold under many conditions, this isn't generally the case. For instance, in the years prior to the 2008 Financial Crisis, most investors didn't know about the risks presented by the large arrangement of [mortgage-backed securities](/mbs) (MBS) held by many financial firms.

During those times, an investor utilizing an autoregressive model to foresee the performance of U.S. financial stocks would have had valid justification to foresee a continuous trend of stable or rising stock prices in that sector. Nonetheless, when it became public information that many financial institutions were at risk of up and coming collapse, investors out of nowhere turned out to be less worried about these stocks' recent prices and far more worried about their underlying risk exposure. Subsequently, the market quickly revalued financial stocks to a much lower level, a move that would have completely perplexed an autoregressive model.

## Oftentimes Asked Questions
### What is ARIMA utilized for?

ARIMA is a method for forecasting or anticipating future results in view of a historical time series. It depends on the statistical concept of serial correlation, where past data points influence future data points.

### What are the differences among autoregressive and moving average models?

ARIMA consolidates autoregressive elements with those of moving averages. An AR(1) autoregressive cycle, for example, is one in which the current value depends on the promptly going before value, while an AR(2) process is one in which the current value depends on the previous two values. A moving average is a calculation used to dissect data points by making a series of averages of various subsets of the full data set to streamline the influence of exceptions. Because of this combination of strategies, ARIMA models can consider trends, cycles, seasonality, and other non-static types of data while making forecasts.

### How does ARIMA forecasting work?

ARIMA forecasting is accomplished by connecting time series data for the variable of interest. Statistical software will distinguish the proper number of lags or amount of differencing to be applied to the data and check for stationarity. It will then output the outcomes, which are frequently deciphered similarly to that of a different linear regression model.

## Features
- Autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) models anticipate future values in light of past values.
- ARIMA makes utilization of lagged moving averages to smooth time series data.
- They are widely utilized in technical analysis to forecast future security prices.
- Autoregressive models verifiably accept that the future will look like the past.
- Consequently, they can demonstrate wrong under certain market conditions, like financial emergencies or periods of fast mechanical change.
