## What Is Margin of Safety?

Margin of safety is a principle of investing wherein an investor possibly purchases securities when their [market price](/market-price) is fundamentally below their intrinsic value. All in all, when the market price of a security is essentially below your assessment of its intrinsic value, the difference is the margin of safety. Since investors might set a margin of safety as per their own risk inclinations, buying securities when this difference is available permits an investment to be made with negligible [downside risk](/downsiderisk).

On the other hand, in accounting, the margin of safety, or safety margin, alludes to the difference between real sales and [break-even](/breakevenanalysis) sales. Managers can use the margin of safety to know how much sales can diminish before the company or a project becomes unprofitable.

## Figuring out Margin of Safety

The margin of safety principle was promoted by popular British-conceived American investor [Benjamin Graham](/bengraham) (known as the dad of value investing) and his adherents, most remarkably Warren Buffett. Investors use both qualitative and quantitative factors, including firm management, governance, industry performance, assets and earnings, to decide a security's [intrinsic value](/intrinsicvalue). The market price is then utilized as the point of comparison to compute the margin of safety. Buffett, who is a steadfast devotee to the margin of safety and has declared it one of his "foundations of investing," has been referred to apply as much as a half discount to the intrinsic value of a stock as his [price target](/pricetarget).

Considering a margin of safety while investing gives a cushion against errors in analyst judgment or calculation. It doesn't, nonetheless, guarantee a fruitful investment, to a great extent on the grounds that deciding a company's "valid" worth, or intrinsic value, is profoundly subjective.

Furthermore, foreseeing a company's earnings or revenue is famously troublesome.

## Instance of Investing and Margin of Safety

However insightful as Graham seemed to be, his principle depended on simple insights. He realize that a stock priced at $1 today could just as reasonable be valued at 50 pennies or $1.50 later on. He additionally recognized that the current valuation of $1 could be off, and that means he would expose himself to pointless risk. That's what he presumed if he would buy a stock [at a discount](/at-a-discount) to its intrinsic value, he would limit his losses substantially. In spite of the fact that there was no guarantee that the stock's price would increase, the discount gave the margin of safety he expected to guarantee that his losses would be negligible.

For instance, if he somehow happened to verify that the intrinsic value of XYZ's stock is $162, which is well below its share price of $192, he could apply a discount of 20% for a target purchase price of $130. In this model, he might feel XYZ has a fair value at $192 yet he wouldn't consider buying it over its intrinsic value of $162. To totally limit his downside risk, he sets his purchase price at $130. Utilizing this model, he probably won't have the option to purchase XYZ stock whenever in the foreseeable future. In any case, on the off chance that the stock price declines to $130 because of reasons other than a collapse of XYZ's earnings outlook, he could buy it with confidence.
