# Cape Verde Escudo (CVE)
## What Is the Cape Verde Escudo (CVE)?

CVE is the ISO 4217 currency code for the Cape Verde escudo, the official national currency of the island nation of Cabo Verde. The Cape Verde Escudo (CVE) subunit is called **centavo**. The dollar symbol ($) is utilized in lieu of a decimal point. Subsequently, 20 escudos is composed as 20$00. The Banco de Cabo Verde issues the country's currency. It mints coins in 1, 5, 10, 20, 50 and 100 denominations and prints banknotes in 200, 500, 1,000, 2,000, and 5,000 denominations.

## Understanding the Cape Verde Escudo (CVE)

Cabo Verde is a former Portuguese settlement. The CVE supplanted the former national currency, the Cape Verde real, which was equivalent to the Portuguese real. Portugal has since turned into a member of the[ European Union](/europeanunion) and adopted the [euro](/euro) as its currency. Starting around 1998, the Cape Verde escudo is technically pegged to the euro, inferable from the way that the currency is officially pegged to the Portuguese escudo**,** which was subsequently supplanted by the euro.

The Cape Verde escudo supplanted the Rei in 1914, where one Escudo = 1,000 Reis. The escudo was valued equivalent to the Portuguese Escudo. In 1998, the CVE was pegged to the Portuguese Escudo at 1 Portuguese Escudo = 0.55 CVE. At the point when the Portuguese escudo was supplanted by the euro, the CVE was pegged to the Euro at 110$265 Escudos = 1 Euro. In 1992, a third round of banknotes was issued and, in 2005, the 200-escudo note was redesigned and distributed in festival of 30 years of independence. This 2005 issue has been removed from circulation. There is one more form that was circled in 2015.
