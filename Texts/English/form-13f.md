# SEC Form 13F
## What Is SEC Form 13F?

The Securities and Exchange Commission's (SEC) Form 13F is a quarterly report that is required to be filed by all institutional investment managers with something like $100 million in [assets under management](/aum). It reveals their equity holdings and can give experiences into what the [smart money](/smart-money) is doing in the market.

Hedge funds are required to file Form 13F in somewhere around 45 days after the last day of the calendar quarter. Most funds hold on for the rest of this period to disguise their investment strategy from contenders and the public.

## Understanding the SEC's Form 13F

Congress made the 13F requirement in 1975. Its aim was to give the U.S. public a perspective on the holdings of the country's biggest institutional investors. Legislators accepted this would increase investor confidence in the integrity of the country's financial markets. Firms that are viewed as institutional investment managers incorporate mutual funds, hedge funds, trust companies, pension funds, insurance companies, and [registered investment advisors](/ria).

Since 13F filings give investors a glance at the holdings of Wall Street's top stock pickers, numerous smaller investors have looked to involve the filings as an aide for their own investment strategies. Their reasoning is that the country's biggest institutional investors are apparently the smartest, however their size likewise enables them to move markets. So investing in similar stocks — or selling similar stocks — seems OK as a strategy.

## Key Issues With Form 13F

Smaller investors who need to imitate the strategies of demigod money managers like Daniel Loeb, [David Tepper](/david-tepper), or Seth Klarman investigate 13F filings. Furthermore, the financial press frequently reports on what these fund managers have been buying and selling by looking at changes in quarterly filings. In any case, there are a number of issues with 13F filings that warrant alert.

### Temperamental Data

13F has drawn analysis from many groups who claim it gives a loophole to hedge fund managers. As a matter of fact, in a 2010 statement, the SEC itself recognized the form had numerous issues and suggested a number of changes ought to be made to guarantee "valuable and dependable data is given to the public and government regulators."

The SEC's internal audit likewise noticed that albeit "the SEC would be expected to utilize the Section 13(f) information for regulatory and oversight purposes, no SEC division or office leads any customary or systematic survey of the data filed on Form 13F."

Maybe this makes sense of how notorious fraudster [Bernard Madoff](/bernard-madoff) obediently filed 13F forms each quarter yet ran an effective Ponzi scheme.

One more incessant analysis of the form is the way that it just requires fund managers to file 13F reports 45 days after the finish of each quarter. Most managers present their 13Fs as late as conceivable in light of the fact that they would rather not tip off opponents to what they are doing. When different investors get their hands on those 13Fs, they are seeing stock purchases that might have been made over four months prior to the filing.

In a March 31, 2021, letter to Allison Herren Lee, the acting chair of the SEC, the progressive nonprofit Americans for Financial Reform encouraged the SEC to "grow both the frequency of Form 13F reporting and the range of financial products required to be unveiled on this form."

Another group, the National Investor Relations Institute, suggested the SEC execute a month to month reporting of ownership positions along with a 15-day window.

### Herd Behavior

One risk for both professional and retail investors is the [tendency of money managers](/trend impact) to borrow investment thoughts from each other. Hedge fund managers are not any more insusceptible to behavioral inclinations than any other individual. All things considered, on the off chance that you are a fund manager, it is more secure to be off with the majority than wrong alone. This can lead to crowded trades and overvalued stocks. What's more, on the off chance that small investors are late to the party getting into a trade, they are probably going to late get out.

### An Incomplete Picture

One more issue with 13F filings is that funds are simply required to report long situations, notwithstanding their put and call options, [American Depositary Receipts](/adr) (ADRs), and convertible notes. This can give a fragmented and, surprisingly, misleading picture, since certain funds produce the greater part of their returns from their [short-selling](/shortselling), just involving long situations as hedges. It is basically impossible to recognize these hedges from genuine long situations on 13F forms.

## Features
- Smaller investors habitually utilize these filings to figure out what the "smart money" is doing in the market, however there are serious issues with the unwavering quality and timeliness of the data.
- Congress planned these filings to give transparency on the holdings of the country's greatest investors.
- The SEC's Form 13F must be filed quarterly by institutional investment managers with something like $100 million in assets under management.
