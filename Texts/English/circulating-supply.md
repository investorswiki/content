# Circulating Supply
The term circulating supply alludes to the number of cryptocurrency coins or tokens that are publicly accessible and circulating in the market.
The circulating supply of a cryptocurrency can increase or diminish over the long run. For instance, the circulating supply of [Bitcoin](/bitcoin) will slowly increase until the max supply of 21 million coins is reached. Such a slow increase is connected with the course of [mining](/mining) that creates new coins like clockwork, on average. On the other hand, coin burn occasions like the ones performed by Binance, cause a lessening in the circulating supply, permanently eliminating coins from the market.
The circulating supply alludes to the coins that are open to the public and ought not be mistaken for the [total supply](/total-supply) or [max supply](/maximum-supply). The total supply is utilized to evaluate the number of coins in presence, i.e., the number of coins that were at that point issued minus the coins that were burned. The total supply is essentially the sum of the circulating supply and the coins that are locked up in escrow. Then again, the max supply evaluates the maximum amount of coins that will at any point exist, including the coins that will be mined or made accessible later on.
In addition, the circulating supply of a [cryptocurrency](/cryptocurrency) can be utilized for computing its [market capitalization](/market-capitalization), which is created by duplicating the current market price with the number of coins in circulation. So on the off chance that a certain cryptocurrency has a circulating supply of a million coins, which are being traded at $5.00 each, the market cap would be equivalent to $5,000,000.
