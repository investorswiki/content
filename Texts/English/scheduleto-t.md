On the off chance that the [bidder](/bidder) or acquiring company claims 90% of the stock in the company to be acquired, they can perform a short-form merger.

The most common form of back-end merger is a [reverse triangular merger](/rtm), in which the target company continues as a subsidiary of the buyer. This sort of merger requires less administrative work as third-party consents.
