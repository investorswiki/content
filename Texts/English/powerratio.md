## What Is Power Ratio?

Power ratio shows how much revenue a transmission media company earns compared to the amount it would be expected to earn given its [market share](/marketshare). It is calculated as follows:

Company Revenue/(Audience Share * Total Market Revenue)

## Grasping Power Ratio

Companies need to have a power ratio of something like 1.0, which demonstrates expected [revenue](/revenue) levels. A higher power ratio demonstrates a greater amount of revenue received from the company's crowd share. Power ratios show how well media companies convert their [ratings](/rating) into advertising revenue. Values greater than one show a company that is beating its industry.

Power ratios help media firms assess their own performance and, on account of a potential [acquisition](/acquisition) or merger, assess the performance of a target media company. Analysts and investors likewise pay close regard for power ratios since they give knowledge into how efficient companies are at changing over ratings into revenue. Power ratios can likewise be utilized to compare the revenue performance of one category of media (e.g., the Internet) to another category (e.g., papers).

While power ratios measure effectiveness at generating revenue relative to the crowd, they don't measure a telecaster's profitability. All in all, a telecaster could have a high power ratio yet be unrewarding, for example, due to high programming costs.

## Which Factors impact Power Ratios?

A 2005 scholastic study of power ratios for broadcast radio stations in the United States that was distributed in the Journal of Media Business Studies found that as a radio station's crowd share develops, it's market revenue share develops lopsidedly. On the other hand, its crowd share contracts, a company's market revenue share diminishes lopsidedly. While taking a gander at the 100 biggest U.S. broadcasters, that equivalent study, as well as others, likewise found that power ratios for a given telecaster can be lower than expected due to a relative lack of demand for its crowd relative to other crowd segments. Station arrangement can emphatically (news/talk) or negatively (for example Simple Listening and those targeting ethnic minorities) influence the power ratio. Overall AM stations create lower power ratios than FM ones do.

At the point when analysts and management groups assess power ratios, they additionally take a gander at ratios for specific day parts and demographic gatherings, for example, the covered 18 to 49-year-old segment. They likewise survey the trend across time spans. Management groups' evaluation of power ratio impacts programming investments, ability enlistment and compensation, and station purchase choices as well as long-term corporate planning choices.
