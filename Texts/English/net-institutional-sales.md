# Net Institutional Sales (NIS)
## What Is Net Institutional Sales (NIS)?

Net institutional sales (NIS) is a measurement utilized while evaluating for securities that are being sold, on a net basis, by [institutional investors](/institutionalinvestor).

Net institutional sales looks at the net sales of an organization's shares by large institutional investors, for example, pension funds and [hedge funds](/hedgefund). A stock with a high (negative) amount of net institutional sales would recommend that institutional investors, in the aggregate, never again feel they ought to hold the stock.

## Figuring out Net Institutional Sales (NIS)

Net institutional sales is a famous [stock screening](/stockscreener) filter utilized by traders expecting to distinguish the stocks that are actively being net sold by institutional investors. The measurement is a net number, since it compares overall buying of the stock to overall selling of the stock.

Traders who need to capitalize on the data might join the flow by [short selling](/shortselling) the stock, which thus could lead to more descending pressure. As calculated as a ratio, a stock with a net institutional sales ratio of - 10% would recommend that institutional investors (instead of [retail investors](/retailinvestor)) are selling 11 shares of the firm for each ten they buy.

## NIS Caveats

A number of sites and data service suppliers track net institutional sales. In any case, large institutional investors discharge subtleties of [portfolio](/portfolio) holdings (and by extension, trading activity) just on a quarterly basis, and that means that the average investor or even a professional trader won't know precisely **who** bought or sold a specific stock during the previous quarter.

This is important on the grounds that not all institutional investors are made equivalent â€” some understand what they are doing, others don't. A net institutional sales ratio could be - 10%, however in the event that "idiotic money" is doing the selling and "[smart money](/smart-money)" is buying, then, at that point, the negative ratio could give out a false signal.

Besides, with the flood of [passive investing](/passiveinvesting), a waning amount of trading is carried out by [actively-managed funds](/activemanagement), making net institutional sales less significant as an indicator of a sentiment toward a certain stock.

## Highlights
- Traders wanting to recognize stocks being actively sold by institutional investors can involve net institutional sales as a stock screener.
- Be that as it may, as passive investing supersedes active fund management, net institutional sales is turning out to be less significant as a sentiment indicator.
- Net institutional sales measures overall buying of a stock to overall selling and is communicated as a net number.
