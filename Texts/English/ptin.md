# Preparer Tax Identification Number (PTIN)
## What Is a Preparer Tax Identification Number?

A preparer tax identification number (PTIN) is a [Internal Revenue Service](/irs) (IRS) identifier executed in 1999 that has required all paid federal tax return preparers to register with the federal government and get a unique number starting around 2010. Tax preparers are any individuals who prepare, calculate, and file income tax returns on behalf of individuals or organizations, and receive compensation for their services. Preparer tax identification number candidates must give palatable responses to several suitability inquiries to receive a preparer tax identification number. Tax preparers must restore their preparer tax identification numbers each calendar year.

## How a Preparer Tax Identification Number (PTIN) Works

As well as getting a preparer tax identification number (PTIN), the IRS requires [enrolled agents](/enrolled_agent) to finish an assessment and complete continuing education requirements. These additional requirements don't matter to attorneys and [certified public accountants](/cpa) (CPAs) on favorable terms, or to directed preparers and non-1040 preparers, whose work is supervised by an enrolled agent, attorney or a CPA.

Preparer tax identification numbers were made in 1999 to safeguard the privacy of tax preparers. From 1999 to 2010, preparers were given the option of giving their number or their Social Security number while signing tax returns. In Sept. 2010, the IRS made a new electronic preparer tax identification system. From that point forward around 1.77 million preparer tax identification numbers have been issued and 748,927 individuals held current numbers as of Aug. 26, 2021. CPAs address the biggest credentialed group, with 204,678 individuals currently holding preparer tax identification numbers.

Preparers were originally charged a registration fee of $64.25 and annual renewal fees like the registration fee. The fee was decreased to $50 in 2016 after a [class action](/classaction) claim started against the IRS. In 2017, the fee was disposed of following a ruling on the class-action claim. The fee had been no different for each preparer, paying little mind to the number of returns the preparer filed.

In June 2017, U.S. District Court Judge Royce Lamberth decided that gathering fees for giving tax preparer identification numbers was illegal and that the IRS had surpassed its authority by gathering these fees. The case was **Steele, et al. v. the United States**, and was a class action addressing all individuals and substances who have paid to receive a tax preparer identification number. The Judge presumed that while the IRS could keep on giving the numbers, the fees were illegal in light of the fact that they were not a "service or thing of value" given by the agency.

Following the ruling, the IRS suspended the tax preparer identification number system yet reestablished it without requiring fees later in June. Taxpayers can look for a registered tax preparer and confirm that their tax preparer is registered by checking the IRS' index.
