# Alpha Generator
## What Is an Alpha Generator?

An alpha generator is any security that, when added by an investor to an existing portfolio of assets, generates [excess returns](/excessreturn) or returns higher than a pre-chosen benchmark without extra risk.

Frequently alpha generators occur from the expansion of an investor's passable universe. For example, adding international investments to broaden an investor's portfolio can result in higher returns from both fixed income and equity investments.

Since [alpha](/alpha) can be a measure of the returns a portfolio produces in excess of the return estimated by the capital asset pricing model, on a risk-adjusted basis, theoretically an investor can measurably add to [portfolio returns](/portfolio-return) while expanding their investment universe to incorporate new types of alpha generators.
