# Excess Reserves
## What Are Excess Reserves?

Excess reserves are capital reserves held by a bank or financial institution in excess of what is required by regulators, creditors, or [internal controls](/internalcontrols). For commercial banks, excess reserves are measured against standard reserve requirement amounts set by central banking specialists. These required [reserve ratios](/reserveratio) set the base liquid [deposits](/store) (like cash) that must be in reserve at a bank; more is viewed as excess.

Excess reserves may likewise be known as secondary reserves.

## Grasping Excess Reserves

Excess reserves are a safety buffer of sorts. Financial firms that carry excess reserves have an extra measure of safety in the event of sudden loan loss or huge cash withdrawals by customers. This buffer expands the safety of the banking system, particularly in times of economic vulnerability. Helping the level of excess reserves can likewise further develop a substance's [credit rating](/creditrating), as measured by rating agencies like [Standard and Poor's](/sp).

The [Federal Reserve](/federalreservebank) has many tools in its monetary standardization toolkit. As well as setting the fed funds rate, it currently can change the rate of interest that banks are paid on required (interest on reserves, or IOR) and excess reserves (interest on excess reserves, or IOER).

## Rule Change Increases Excess Reserves

Preceding Oct. 1, 2008, banks were not paid a rate of interest on reserves. The Financial Services Regulatory Relief Act of 2006 authorized the Federal Reserve to pay banks a rate of interest interestingly. The rule was to become real on Oct. 1, 2011. Be that as it may, the [Great Recession](/great-recession) advanced the decision with the [Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008](/emergency-economic-stability-act). Suddenly, and without precedent for history, banks had an incentive to hold excess reserves at the Federal Reserve.

Excess reserves hit a record $2.7 trillion in August 2014 due to the quantitative easing program. Between January 2019 and February 2020, excess reserves went somewhere in the range of $1.3 and $1.6 trillion. After March 11, 2020, the excess reserves soar to reach $3.2 trillion by May 20, 2020, in the wake of the 2020 COVID-related financial crisis.

Proceeds from quantitative easing were paid out to banks by the Federal Reserve as [reserves](/bank-reserve), not cash. Be that as it may, the interest paid on these reserves is paid out in cash and recorded as interest income for the getting bank. The interest paid out to banks from the Federal Reserve is cash that would some way or another be going to the U.S. Treasury.

## Interest on Excess Reserves and the Fed Funds Rate

By and large, the fed funds rate is the rate at which banks loan money to each other and is many times utilized as a benchmark for variable rate loans. Both the IOR and the still up in the air by the Federal Reserve, explicitly the [Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC)](/fomc). Thus, banks had an incentive to hold excess reserves, particularly when market rates were below the fed funds rate. Along these lines, the interest rate on excess reserves filled in as a proxy for the fed funds rate.

The Federal Reserve alone has the power to change this rate, which increased to 0.5% on December 17, 2015, after almost a decade of lower bound interest rates. From that point forward, the Fed has been utilizing the interest on excess reserves to make a band between the fed funds rate and the IOER by setting it deliberately below to keep their target rates on target. For instance, in December 2018, the Fed raised its target rate by 25 basis points however just raised IOER by 20 basis points.

This gap makes excess reserves another policy tool of the Fed. Assuming the economy is heating up too fast, the Fed can shift up its IOER to urge more capital to be stopped at the Fed, easing back growth in accessible capital and increasing flexibility in the banking system.

Up to this point, in any case, this policy tool has not been tried in a difficult economy. The primary test to be watched and dissected is presently with the 2020 crisis, and the doubling of the excess reserves amount in merely nine weeks.
