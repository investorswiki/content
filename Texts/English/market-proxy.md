# Market Proxy
## What Is a Market Proxy?

A market proxy is a broad representation of the overall stock market. A market proxy can act as the basis for a [index fund](/indexfund) or statistical studies. The [S&P 500 index](/sp500) is the most popular market proxy for the U.S. stock market. Index funds and [exchange traded funds (ETFs)](/etf) have been built to incorporate all, or a portion, of the stocks in the S&P 500 index. Investors and analysts utilize the price moves in the S&P 500 as the proxy to perform different statistical research on stock market behavioral examples.

## Understanding a Market Proxy

The S&P 500 index is a broad proxy of the stock market in light of a market capitalization of 500 large companies traded on the [New York Stock Exchange (NYSE)](/nyse) and [Nasdaq](/nasdaq) stock exchange. Market capitalization-or market cap for short-increases the organization's stock price by its outstanding [equity](/equity) shares. The market cap weighting of the S&P 500 will in general lean toward larger companies since they have more shares outstanding. Subsequently, the price moves of the larger companies will generally greaterly affect the value of the index as compared to the smaller market cap companies.

Most concur that the S&P is a better proxy than the [Dow Jones Industrial Average](/djia) (DJIA), which randomly utilizes nominal share prices to compute the index value. The Dow's price-weighted formula gives companies with higher share prices greater weight in the index, no matter what their significance in addressing the relative industry standing in the economy. Standard and Poor's Financial Services controls the sythesis of the DJIA Index.

## Bond Market Proxy

In spite of the fact that there is no equivalent market proxy for the [bond](/bond) market as extensive as the S&P 500 Index, casual references are made to [dividend](/dividend) stocks being a proxy for bonds. Dividends are cash outlays to investors by corporations as a reward for claiming the organization's stock. [Utility](/utilities_sector) stocks, which incorporate the gas and electric companies, as a rule pay reliable dividends. Likewise, consumer staples stocks, which sell essential goods, are a safe wagered for dividend payments. The two utilities and consumer staples are accepted to be close in nature to bonds, which pay interest by means of a [coupon rate](/coupon-rate).

In any case, certain bonds, like U.S. Treasuries, are backed by the [U.S. Treasury Department](/ustreasury), meaning investors will not lose their initial investment called the [principal](/principal). On the other hand, stocks, including utility and consumer staples, are not guaranteed by the government and investors might possibly lose part or the entirety of their investment.

## Notoriety of Market Proxy Funds

Index funds, a large number of which are essentially market intermediaries of the S&P 500, have filled in prominence due to their low fees. Index funds are not [actively managed](/activemanagement) by an investment portfolio manager, significance stocks are not being bought and sold all through the fund. Throughout the long term investors have picked these [passively-managed](/passivemanagement) funds, which incorporate Vanguard, BlackRock, and State Street.

These funds have made passive vehicles in view of the S&P 500 index and numerous different intermediaries addressing the international stock market, the global stock market (U.S. + international), and portions of the stock market, for example, [large-capitalization](/large-cap) stocks, medium-cap stocks, and [small-cap](/small-cap) stocks.

Indexed products have generally outperformed actively-managed funds, however there is a developing discussion about whether they have become too large to really serve the necessities of investors. In the event of heavy or supported market downturns, for example, there's a concern of how well passive funds will perform relative to actively-managed funds that have the flexibility to answer changing market conditions.
