# Current Account Deficit
## What Is a Current Account Deficit?

The current account deficit is a measurement of a country's trade where the value of the goods and services it imports surpasses the value of the products it exports. The current account incorporates net income, like interest and dividends, and moves, like foreign aid, albeit these parts make up just a small percentage of the total current account. The current account addresses a country's foreign transactions and, similar to the capital account, is a part of a country's [balance of payments (BOP)](/bop).

## Figuring out a Current Account Deficit

A country can reduce its existing debt by expanding the value of its exports relative to the value of imports. It can place limitations on imports, like tariffs or portions, or it can underline policies that advance export, like import substitution, industrialization, or policies that work on domestic companies' global seriousness. The country can likewise utilize monetary policy to further develop the domestic cash's valuation relative to different currencies through devaluation, which reduces the country's export costs.

While an existing deficit can infer that a country is spending too far in the red, having a current account deficit isn't innately disadvantageous. On the off chance that a country utilizes outer debt to finance investments that have higher returns than the interest rate on the debt, the country can stay dissolvable while running a current account deficit. On the off chance that a country is probably not going to cover current debt levels with future revenue streams, nonetheless, it might become indebted.

## Real World Example of Current Account Deficits

Changes in a country's current account are largely dependent on market powers. Even countries that deliberately run deficits have volatility in the deficit. The United Kingdom, for instance, saw a decline in its existing deficit after the [Brexit](/brexit) vote results in 2016.

The United Kingdom has generally run a deficit since a country utilizes high levels of debt to finance unnecessary imports. A large portion of the country's exports are commodities, and declining commodity prices have brought about lower earnings for domestic companies. This reduction means less income flowing once more into the United Kingdom, expanding its current account deficit.

In any case, after the British pound declined in value because of the Brexit vote that was held on June 23, 2016, the more vulnerable pound diminished the country's existing debt. This abatement happened in light of the fact that overseas dollar earnings were higher for domestic commodity companies, bringing about more cash inflows to the country.
