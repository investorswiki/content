## What Is a Quanto Swap?

A quanto swap is a cash-settled, cross-currency interest rate swap, where one of the [counterparties](/counterparty) pays a foreign interest rate to the next. The notional amount is named in the domestic currency. [Interest rates](/interestrate) might be fixed or floating.

One more name for these swaps could likewise be guaranteed exchange rate swap since they normally implant a fixed currency exchange rate in the [swap](/swap) contract.

## Understanding a Quanto Swap

However quanto swaps deal with two distinct currencies, payments are settled in just one. For instance, a potential quanto swap would include a U.S. investor paying half year [LIBOR](/libor) in U.S. dollars, for a US $1 million loan, and receive in return, payments in U.S. dollars at the half year [EURIBOR](/euribor) + 75 [basis points](/basispoint).

Fixed-for-floating quanto swaps permit an investor to limit [foreign exchange risk](/foreignexchangerisk). This aversion of risk is accomplished by fixing both the exchange rate and interest rate simultaneously.

It likewise makes a foreign exchange, or currency risk. A quanto swap tackles this problem since all future exchange rates are fixed at the hour of the swap contract composing.
