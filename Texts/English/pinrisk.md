# Pin Risk
## What Is Pin Risk?

Pin risk is the uncertainty that emerges about whether an options contract will be exercised (or assigned) when the expiration price of the underlying security is at or exceptionally close to the option's strike price. This is known as [pinning a strike](/pinningthestrike); for instance, on the off chance that XYZ stock lapses at $50 the 50-strike would be pinned.

Pinning a strike forces a risk for options traders, who might become uncertain about [exercising](/exercise) their long options, which have expired [at the money](/atthemoney) (ATM) or extremely close to being at the money. Part of their reluctance is additionally due to the simultaneous uncertainty of the number of comparative short positions they will be [assigned](/task) on. Along these lines, options holders might experience losses when the market opens on the next trading day in view of the number of long contracts they that exercised and the number of shorts they that ended up being assigned on.

## Understanding Pin Risk

Pin risk is the risk an option seller experiences as expiration draws near and the price of the underlying asset is close to being [in the money](/inthemoney) (ITM) after expiration. This risk is really a complex riddle since, supposing that the underlying lapses even a small amount [out of the money](/outofthemoney) (OTM), the option writer's profit is the total premium collected, however assuming the underlying is in the money even a small amount, the seller might be assigned by a long who exercises that option.

In such an event, the option changes over into a short for the seller (if a [call](/calloption) has been sold) or a long (if a [put](/putoption)) position on the underlying. Since the underlying security itself won't trade until the market opens, the option seller is currently presented to the possibility that the underlying will gap horribly against them. Contingent upon how large the gap is, it could make substantial losses.

At the times before the market closes ahead of expiration, the option seller doesn't know precisely how to hedge the position heading into expiration, and practically any hedge they pick will substantially dissolve their likely profits.

Pinning alludes to the potential for institutional option buyers to control price action in the underlying as options expiration draws near. On the off chance that these option buyers face the potential for a total loss of the option, they might try to pin the stock to a price just in the money by strategically entering buy orders without a second to spare before the close. If ineffective, these endeavors imply a huge liability to those trying to pin the stock, yet if effective, it can imply a substantial danger to the option sellers.

>  Pinning the strike happens most often when there is a large amount of [open interest](/openinterest) in the calls and puts of a particular strike as expiration draws near.

## Pin Risk May Result in Market Risk

It is worth repeating that the risk to the options seller is that they don't be aware for certain if the holder will exercise the options, leaving them with either a long or a short position in the underlying. Putting on a [hedge](/hedge) against such a position will likewise leave the options seller with market risk on the off chance that the option isn't exercised.

Consequently, neither one of the parties knows precisely how to hedge their positions. At one stock price, they have no requirement for hedges, yet at an alternate price, they could have exposure to market risk, typically more than an end of the week, that they should buy or sell the underlying while trading resumes Monday to straighten out the position.

For instance, say the purchaser of a $30 call wishes to exercise the option to buy the stock on the off chance that it closes at this price at expiration. On the off chance that the position isn't covered by the writer, it will wind up with a short position in the stock and every one of the risks associated with this position. The reverse is true for a put, leaving the writer of the option with a long position that is possibly going to lose money.

## Illustration of Pin Risk

Suppose XYZ stock is trading at $30.10 on the last day of trading, and there is a great deal of open interest in the 30 strike calls and puts. Say that Trader An is long the calls and Trader B is short calls. As the trading day comes to a close, the stock falls consistently to precisely $30.00, where it closes.

Trader A would regularly exercise the options on the off chance that they were ITM, profiting from the difference in the strike price (where they would purchase the shares) and the market price where the shares could be sold. In any case, at precisely $30 there is no profit to be had thus Trader An is uncertain whether to exercise the contracts. Trader B ought to anticipate that the options should terminate worthless, yet since they couldn't say whether or the number of calls Trader A will that exercise, they can't rest assured this will be the case and, whenever assigned, rather than worthless options they would receive a short position in XYZ shares from $30.00.

## Features
- Pin risk is the risk to options traders that the underlying security will close at or exceptionally close to the strike price of terminating options positions held.
- The risk is that it is muddled the number of long options that ought to be exercised and the number of shorts they that will be assigned on.
- A pinned position is difficult to successfully hedge against.
- This uncertainty can make positions that are verifiably held unhedged throughout the end of the week, with the risk of the market moving against them and wiping away their expected gains.
