# Limited Risk
## What Is Limited Risk?

The term-limited [risk](/risk) alludes to an investment strategy that covers the possible amount of loss an investor can face — typically, the initial amount invested. This means the investor knows the amount they could lose in the event [market](/market) conditions go south.

Investors who utilize this strategy do as such by purchasing [securities](/security) that move in inverse bearings. This strategy essentially furnishes investors with a form of insurance or protection against potential losses.

## How Limited Risk Works

Limited risk alludes to putting a [investor](/investor) in circumstances where they are aware of the maximum level of loss they might be presented to before they even go into a position. This type of strategy puts a ceiling on the expected loss, safeguarding a [portfolio](/portfolio) against any [volatility](/volatility) in the market. It tends to be particularly attractive when an investor has encountered an extended period of gains and needs to lock in a portion of those positive [returns](/return).

One method for accomplishing limited risk is to buy stocks that are not as sensitive to [economic cycles](/economic-cycle). Sometimes called [defensive stocks](/defensivestock), they remember companies for the food, utilities, or different industries that sell products that consumers think about vital. These stocks hypothetically hold their value during downturns and other economic slumps, which will generally push down the performance of the stock market also.

### Options Strategies

One more method for limiting the risk of an equities investment is to purchase a [put option](/putoption) contract on the shares. This approach may sometimes be expensive, however it permits an investor to lock in a base price at which the shares could continuously be sold. An investor could likewise sell a [futures](/futures) contract, promising to sell the stock at a set price at one point from here on out.

As, a limited-verified over, an investor risk investment is completely aware of the potential amount they could lose. For instance, going into a cash [long position](/long) in a stock has a limited risk on the grounds that the investor can lose something like the initial amount invested. Likewise, buying options contracts (which give you the right, yet not the obligation, to purchase an asset at a certain price by a certain date) has limited risk. Assuming that the asset's price moves against you, and it's a horrible idea to exercise the option, just the initial [premium](/premium) you paid to buy the option is lost.

> Like all investment strategies, limiting one's risk requires a little planning. Notwithstanding, the security that this strategy gives could put forth it certainly worth the time and attempt during a period of declining stock prices.

## Illustration of Limited Risk

Suppose an investor makes an investment portfolio that incorporates [shares](/shares) of the company Cushy Couches, which manufactures luxury couches and seats. Since the furniture industry is a [cyclical](/cyclical_industry) one, Company Beta will probably sell more sofas during boom times than it will when the economy is slow or contracting.

Along these lines, Company Beta's shares will decline in [value](/value) during slow economic times — something that the investor ought to know about when they invest in the company. The investor will presumably need to shield their portfolio from this volatility by purchasing an equivalent amount of shares (or making a comparable investment) in the Super Foodstuffs Corporation — a leading manufacturer of basic food item staples, and a respected defensive stock. As referenced above, economic slumps don't be guaranteed to influence the value of such firms — everybody must eat, all things considered — so they'll act as a defense, limiting the risk of holding shares of Cushy Couches.

## Limited versus Unlimited Risk

[Unlimited risk](/unlimitedrisk) is something contrary to limited risk. It happens when the potential for losses isn't capped. As the name proposes, there is an endless, or unlimited, potential for losses on a specific investment.

While investors might lose just the value of their initial investment with limited risk, unlimited risk means they can lose considerably more than that — whether it's just a small portion, or the whole investment itself.

Since no investment is 100% guaranteed, performance-wise, no investor is totally safe from unlimited risk. However, particularly defenseless are traders and investors who buy on [margin](/margin) (that is, through loans from their broker) or who participate in [short selling](/shortselling) — borrowing a security and selling it on the open market, with the aim to buy it back later for less money. The risk of loss on a short sale is hypothetically unlimited since the price of any asset can move to endlessness.
