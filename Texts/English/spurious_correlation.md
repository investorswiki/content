# Spurious Correlation
## What Is Spurious Correlation?

In [statistics](/statistics), a spurious correlation (or spuriousness) alludes to an association between two variables that appears to be causal however isn't. With spurious correlation, any noticed dependencies between variables are simply due to chance or are both related to some concealed confounder.

## Grasping Spurious Correlation

Spurious relationships will initially appear to show that one variable straightforwardly influences another, yet that isn't the case. This misleading [correlation](/correlation) is in many cases brought about by a third factor that isn't apparent at the hour of examination, sometimes called a confounding factor.

At the point when two random variables track each other closely on a graph, it is not difficult to suspect correlation where a change in one variable causes a change in the other variable. Setting to the side causation, which is another topic, this perception can lead the reader of the chart to accept that the movement of variable An is linked to the movement in variable B or vice versa.

Notwithstanding, closer statistical examination might show that the adjusted movements are unplanned or brought about by a third factor that influences the two variables. This is a spurious correlation. Research directed with small sample sizes or inconsistent endpoints is particularly susceptible to spuriousness.

## Spotting Spuriousness

The clearest method for spotting a spurious relationship in research discoveries is to utilize common sense. Just in light of the fact that two things happen and appear to be linked doesn't mean that there could be no different factors at work. Be that as it may, to be aware without a doubt, research methods are fundamentally inspected.

In studies, all variables that could impact the discoveries ought to be remembered for the statistical model to control their impact on the dependent variable.

> ### Spurious Correlation
> Numerous spurious relationships can be distinguished by utilizing common sense. On the off chance that a correlation is found, there is normally more than one variable at play, and the variables are frequently not promptly self-evident.

## Spurious Correlation Examples

Intriguing correlations are not difficult to track down, yet many will end up being spurious. Three examples are the skirt length theory, the super bowl indicator, and a suggested correlation among race and college completion rates.

1. **Skirt Length Theory**: Originating during the 1920s, the skirt length theory holds that skirt lengths and stock market heading are correlated. Assuming skirt lengths are long, the correlation is that the stock market is [bearish](/bearmarket). Assuming shirt lengths are short, the market is [bullish](/bullmarket).
1. **Super Bowl Indicator**: In late January, there is in many cases chat about the purported Super Bowl indicator, which proposes that a success by the American Football Conference team probably means that the stock market will go down in the approaching year, while a victory by the National Football Conference team portends a rise in the market. Starting from the beginning of the Super Bowl period, the indicator has been accurate around 74% of the time, or 40 out of the 54 years, as per OpenMarkets. It is a pleasant discussion piece yet probably not something a serious financial advisor would suggest as an investment strategy for clients.
1. **Educational Attainment and Race**: Social researchers have zeroed in on distinguishing which variables impact educational fulfillment. As per government research, 56% of White 25-to 29-year-olds had completed a college degree in 2019, compared to just 36% of black individuals of a similar age. The implication being that race causally affects college completion rates.

In any case, it may not be race itself that impacts educational fulfillment. The outcomes may likewise be due to the effects of bigotry in society, which could be the third "covered up" variable. Bigotry impacts people of variety, placing them in a difficult situation educationally and monetarily. For example, the schools in non-white networks face greater difficulties and receive less funding, parents in non-white populations have lower-paying position and less resources to dedicate to their kids' education, and numerous families live in food deserts and experience the ill effects of hunger. Prejudice, as opposed to race, may be seen as a causal variable that impacts educational fulfillment.

## Features
- The appearance of a causal relationship is frequently due to comparable movement on a chart that ends up being incidental or brought about by a third "confounding" factor.
- Spurious correlation, or spuriousness, happens when two factors appear nonchalantly related to each other however are not.
- Affirming a causal relationship requires a study that controls for every single possible variable.
- Analysts and researchers utilize careful statistical analysis to decide spurious relationships.
- Spurious correlation can be brought about by small sample sizes or inconsistent endpoints.
## FAQ
### What Is Spurious Regression?
Spurious regression is a statistical model that shows misleading statistical evidence of a linear relationship; as such, a spurious correlation between independent non-fixed variables.
### What Is an Example of Correlation yet not Causation?
An example of a correlation is that more sleep leads to better performance during the day. In spite of the fact that there is a correlation, there isn't really causation. More sleep may not be the explanation an individual performs better; for example, they may be utilizing another software apparatus that is expanding their productivity. To find causation, there must be genuine evidence from a study that shows a causal relationship among sleep and performance.
### How to Spot Spurious Correlation?
Analysts and different researchers who break down data must be keeping watch for spurious relationships constantly. There are various methods that they use to recognize them including:- Ensuring a proper representative sample-Obtaining an adequate sample size-Being careful about erratic endpoints-Controlling for however many outside variables as could reasonably be expected Using a [null hypothesis](/null_hypothesis) and checking for a strong [p-value](/p-value)
### What Is False Causality?
False causality alludes to the assumption made that one thing causes something different due to a relationship between them. For example, we might expect that Harry has been training hard to turn into a quicker runner since his race times have improved. Nonetheless, the reality may be that Harry's race times have improved on the grounds that he has new running shoes made with the latest technology. The initial assumption was a false causality.
