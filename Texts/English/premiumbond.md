## What Is a Premium Bond?

A premium bond is a bond trading over its face value or all in all; it costs more than the face amount on the bond. A bond could trade at a [premium](/at-a-premium) on the grounds that its interest rate is higher than current rates in the market.

## Premium Bonds Explained

A bond that is trading at a premium means that its price is trading at a premium or higher than the face value of the bond. For instance, a bond that was issued at a face value of $1,000 could trade at $1,050 or a $50 premium. Even however the bond presently can't seem to arrive at maturity, it can trade in the secondary market. All in all, investors can buy and sell a 10-year bond before the bond develops in decade. On the off chance that the bond is held until maturity, the investor receives the face value amount or $1,000 as in our model above.

A premium bond is likewise a specific type of bond issued in the United Kingdom. In the United Kingdom, a premium bond is alluded to as a lottery bond issued by the British government's National Savings and Investment Scheme.

## Bond Premiums and Interest Rates

For investors to comprehend how a bond premium functions, we must initially investigate how bond prices and interest rates connect with one another. As interest rates fall, bond prices rise while alternately, rising interest rates lead to falling bond prices.

Most bonds are fixed-rate instruments implying that the interest paid won't ever change over the life of the bond. Regardless of where interest rates move or by the amount they move, bondholders receive the interest rate — [coupon rate](/coupon-rate) — of the bond. Subsequently, bonds offer the security of stable interest payments.

Fixed-rate bonds are alluring when the market interest rate is falling in light of the fact that this existing bond is paying a higher rate than investors can get for a recently issued, lower rate bond.

For instance, say an investor bought a $10,000 4% bond that develops in decade. Over the course of the next two or three years, the market interest rates fall so that new $10,000, 10-year bonds just pay a 2% coupon rate. The investor holding the security paying 4% has a more alluring — premium — item. Subsequently, should the investor need to sell the 4% bond, it would sell at a premium higher than its $10,000 face value in the secondary market.

Thus, when interest rates fall, bond prices rise as investors hurry to buy more established higher-yielding bonds and subsequently, those bonds can sell at a premium.

Alternately, as interest rates rise, new bonds coming on the market are issued at the new, higher rates pushing those bond yields up.

Likewise, as rates rise, investors demand a higher yield from the bonds they think about buying. On the off chance that they anticipate that rates should keep on rising later on they don't need a fixed-rate bond at current yields. Accordingly, the secondary market price of more seasoned, lower-yielding bonds fall. Thus, those bonds sell at a [discount](/discountbond).

## Bond Premiums and Credit Ratings

The company's credit rating and at last the bond's credit rating likewise influences the price of a bond and its offered coupon rate. A [credit rating](/creditrating) is an assessment of the creditworthiness of a borrower in everyday terms or with respect to a specific debt or financial obligation.

On the off chance that a company is performing great, its bonds will typically draw in buying interest from investors. Simultaneously, the bond's price rises as investors will pay something else for the creditworthy bond from the financially practical issuer. Bonds issued by very much run companies with fantastic credit ratings ordinarily sell at a premium to their face values. Since many bond investors are risk-opposed, the credit rating of a bond is an important measurement.

[Credit-rating agencies](/bond-rating-agencies) measure the creditworthiness of corporate and government bonds to give investors an outline of the [risks](/interestraterisk) associated with investing in bonds. Credit rating agencies regularly assign letter grades to show ratings. Standard and Poor's, for example, has a credit rating scale going from AAA (magnificent) to C and D. A debt instrument with a rating below BB is viewed as a speculative grade or a junk bond, and that means defaulting on loans is more probable.

## Effective Yield on Premium Bonds

A premium bond will generally have a coupon rate higher than the overarching market interest rate. Nonetheless, with the additional premium cost over the bond's face value, the effective yield on a premium bond probably won't be worthwhile for the investor.

The effective yield expects the funds received from coupon payment are reinvested at a similar rate paid by the bond. In a world of falling interest rates, this may not be imaginable.

The bond market is efficient and matches the current price of the bond to reflect whether current interest rates are higher or lower than the bond's coupon rate. Investors should know why a bond is trading for a premium — whether this is a direct result of market interest rates or the underlying company's credit rating. As such, in the event that the premium is so high, it very well may be worth the additional yield as compared to the overall market. Nonetheless, on the off chance that investors buy a premium bond and market rates rise fundamentally, they'd be at risk of overpaying for the additional premium.

## Real World Example

As an illustration suppose that Apple Inc. (AAPL) issued a bond with a $1,000 face value with a 10-year maturity. The interest rate on the bond is 5% while the bond has a credit rating of AAA from the credit rating agencies.

Thus, the Apple bond pays a higher interest rate than the 10-year Treasury yield. Likewise, with the additional yield, the bond trades at a premium in the secondary market at a cost of $1,100 per bond. In return, bondholders would be paid 5% each year for their investment. The premium is the price investors will pay for the additional yield on the Apple bond.
