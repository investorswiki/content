# Re-Fracking
## What Is Re-Fracking?

Re-fracking is an oil company practice of returning to more established shale-oil and shale-gas wells, [fracked](/fracking) in the recent past, yet which are as of now not in production. The company desires to utilize new, more effective, extraction innovations to revitalize and capitalize on the well's resources. Re-fracking can be valuable on those deposits where the shale delivers low yields, as it might grow their productivity and expand their lifespan.

## Figuring out Re-Fracking

Re-fracking, in its most essential form, is shooting a mixture of mud, made out of sand, synthetics, and water into an underperforming great to support production. Companies have been involving this function somewhat for a really long time. The mixture assists with forming breaks in the substrate and hold the airs out once they create. The breaks in the stone and soil allow the oil to flow more quickly, helping the amount that the company can extricate from the formation.

Re-fracking has come to the fore recently as companies are currently utilizing this long-utilized technique with [vertical drilling](/verticalwell) processes and different advances. These methods allow a company to access deposits which were previously futile.

With that in mind, companies are presently re-fracking a few wells sunk just quite a while back. One technique in the re-fracking process includes fixing up larger breaks in the well's shale with small plastic balls so that new proppant may find its direction into more tight breaks with the assistance of a higher pressure wellbore.

For instance, organizations are re-fracking in the Bakken shale deposit of North Dakota to revisit a few wells penetrated somewhere in the range of 2008 and 2010, due to improved [hydraulic fracturing](/hydraulic-fracturing) advancements. As per the North Dakota Pipeline Authority, companies have re-fractured more than 140 wells in the Bakken as of mid-2017. The greater part of the re-explored wells considered an increase in production to be a result. Also, companies are re-fracking in other deep rooted, large shale formations in the U.S. for example, Eagle Ford and Barnett, both in Texas.

## The Costs of Using Re-Fracking

Oil and gas recovery might cost a huge number of dollars to bore and complete, and some have a fairly low recovery or production rate. Likewise, a few areas have large segments of deposits that produce either nothing or next to nothing. The appeal of re-fracking is that it can allow new technology to expand the life of existing wells, where exploration and production companies already have found some achievement. This interaction limits the amount of fresh ground that must be opened up.

One more advantage of the exploration and production companies utilizing re-fracking is that it frequently costs not as much as putting in new vertical wells.

Similarly as with fracking by and large, re-fracking is dubious. Pundits point to similar unfavorable effects it can have on the air, water, and soil of the areas where re-fracking occurs. For instance, one of the primary synthetics utilized in the re-fracking or fracking process is methane, which escapes into the atmosphere during extraction. Methane is 25 times more grounded than carbon dioxide in catching intensity and causing greenhouse effects. Additionally, the release of this gas is unfavorable to air quality nearby fracking destinations.
