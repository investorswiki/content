Since flash PMIs are among the first [economic indicators](/economic_indicator) released every month, and give evidence of changing [economic conditions](/economic-conditions) ahead of comparable government statistics, they can essentially affect markets, especially the [foreign exchange market](/foreign-exchange-markets).

It accomplishes this outcome by tracking changes in factors like output, new orders, and prices across the manufacturing, construction, retail and [service sectors](/service-sector).
