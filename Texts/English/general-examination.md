# General Examination
## What Is a General Examination?

An overall examination is a regulatory measure set up to work with nitty gritty, careful reviews of [banks](/bank). General examinations include assessing the management processes and activities of [financial institutions](/financialinstitution) (FIs) licensed to receive [deposits](/deposit) and make [loans](/credit) to guarantee that they are in compliance with laws and regulations and are operating in a sound way.

Different administering bodies are responsible for evaluating the strength of banks. Typically, [national banks](/national-bank) are examined by the [Office of the Comptroller of the Currency](/office-comptroller-currency-occ) (OCC), state-[chartered banks](/charteredbank) are investigated by the [Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation](/fdic) (FDIC) or the state banking department, and bank [holding companies](/holdingcompany) are examined by the [Federal Reserve Board](/frb) (FRB).

## Figuring out General Examinations

The overall examination is normally led like clockwork. The bank examiners carrying out the exam will take a top to bottom glance at the bank being referred to, zeroing in a great deal of time on its [financial statements](/financial-statements), while meeting staff and managers on policies and procedures.

The examiners will take a gander at the bank's supervisory guidance, proposals, and issues. They will dive into the bank's overall financial state, examine its trust operations, the wellbeing and efficiency of its electronic systems, and its performance in terms of meeting the [credit](/credit) requirements of the community in which it works. Examiners will likewise survey whether the bank is in compliance with state and federal regulations.

> There are in excess of 2,000 examiners in the United States entrusted with assessing banks.

Data that bank examiners request during the course of an overall examination incorporates:

- The bank's written policies and procedures
- [Income statements](/incomestatement)
- [Balance sheets](/balancesheet)
- The bank's latest board parcel
- Minutes of board meetings
- Reports of [audits](/review), [past-due](/past-due) accounts, [problem loans](/problem-credit), and so on.

Surveys associated with an overall examination can occur both on-and off-site. Examiners might go over written data and reports in their own offices, and afterward head to the bank to perform nitty gritty meetings with management.

## Recording a General Examination

When the overall examination has been completed, the examiners will hold an exit meeting with the bank's management and maybe with its [board of directors](/boardofdirectors) (B of D) too. During the meeting, findings will be introduced, conclusions will be circulated out, and the bank will be issued with a rating. After this interaction is complete, the FDIC will distribute a Report of Examination enumerating its perceptions.

While assessing the safety and sufficiency of a FI, examiners follow what is known as the [CAMELS system](/camelrating): [capital adequacy](/capitaladequacyratio), [asset quality](/assetqualityrating), management, [earnings](/earnings), [liquidity](/liquidity), and sensitivity (to [systemic risk](/systemic-risk)). Banks receive a [ranking](/bank-rating) on a scale of one to five in every category, with one being the highest or most grounded and five being the least or most fragile.

Banks that receive an average score of under two are viewed as top notch institutions. Banks with CAMELS of four and five, then again, will be put on a watch list by regulators and checked closely.
