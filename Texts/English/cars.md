## Definition of Car Allowance Rebate System (CARS)

The Car Allowance Rebate System was a U.S. government program that permitted individuals to trade in utilized vehicles that didn't meet government-determined fuel economy standards. Under President Barack Obama's administration, individuals trading in old cars could fit the bill for a discount of either $3,500 or $4,500 off the purchase or five or more year lease of a fresher, more fuel efficient vehicle. The program started on July 1, 2009, and ended presently in light of the fact that it turned out to be well known to such an extent that funds immediately ran out.

The House approved the creation of a [cash-for-clunkers](/cash-for-clunkers) program with the 298 to 119 entry of the CARS Act. In the Senate, the money for-clunkers legislation was embedded into a larger war supplemental funding bill. In response to the U.S. Department of Transportation estimate that the $1 billion appropriated for the system was nearly exhausted by July 30, 2009, due to exceptionally high demand, Congress approved an extra $2 billion for the program fully backed by the Obama Administration.
