The contrary measurement, measuring how much in dividends are paid out as a percentage of earnings, is known as the payout ratio.

## The Formula for the Plowback Ratio Is

The plowback ratio is calculated by deducting the quotient of the annual dividends per share and earnings per share (EPS) from 1. Then again, it very well may be calculated by deciding the extra funds after ascertaining the [dividend payout ratio](/dividendpayoutratio).

For instance, a company that reports $10 of EPS and $2 per share of dividends will have a dividend payout ratio of 20% and a plowback ratio of 80%.

## What Does the Plowback Ratio Tell You?

The plowback ratio is an indicator of how much profit is retained in a business as opposed to paid out to investors. More youthful businesses will generally have higher plowback ratios. These more quickly developing companies are more centered around business development. More mature businesses are not as dependent on reinvesting profit to extend operations. The ratio is 100% for companies that don't pay dividends, and is zero for companies that pay out their whole net income as dividends.

Utilization of the plowback ratio is most valuable while contrasting companies inside a similar industry. Various markets require different utilization of profits. For instance, it is entirely expected for technology companies to have a plowback ratio of 1 (that is, 100%). This demonstrates that no dividends are issued, and all profits are retained for business growth.

The plowback ratio addresses the portion of [retained earnings](/retainedearnings) that might actually be dividends. Higher retention ratios demonstrate management's conviction of high growth periods and ideal business economic conditions. Lower plowback ratio calculations demonstrate a carefulness in future business growth opportunities or satisfaction in current cash holdings.

### Investor Preference

The plowback ratio is a helpful measurement for figuring out what companies put resources into. Investors inclining toward cash distributions stay away from companies with high plowback ratios. Notwithstanding, companies with higher plowback ratios could have a greater opportunity of capital gains, accomplished through valued stock prices during the growth of the organization. Investors see stable plowback ratio calculations as indicators of current stable dynamic that can assist with forming future expectations.

The ratio is commonly higher for [growth companies](/growthcompany) that are experiencing quick expansions in incomes and profits. A growth company would like to furrow earnings back into its business in the event that it accepts that it can reward its shareholders by expanding incomes and profits at a quicker pace than shareholders could accomplish by investing their dividend receipts.

### Impact from Management

Since management decides the dollar amount of dividends to issue, management straightforwardly impacts the plowback ratio. On the other hand, the calculation of the plowback ratio requires the utilization of EPS, which is impacted by a company's decision of [accounting method](/accountingmethod). Subsequently, the plowback ratio is highly impacted by a couple of factors inside the organization.

## Illustration of the Plowback Ratio

For instance, on Nov. 29, 2017, The Walt Disney Company declared a $0.84 semi-annual cash dividend per share to shareholders of record Dec. 11, to be paid Jan. 11. As of the [fiscal year ended](/fiscalyearend) Sept, 30, 2017, the company's EPS was $5.73. Its plowback (retention) ratio is, thusly, 1 - ($0.84/$5.73) = 0.8534, or 85.34%.

The retention ratio is an opposite concept to the dividend payout ratio. The dividend payout ratio assesses the percentage of profits earned that a company pays out to its shareholders. It is calculated just as dividends per share separated by [earnings per share](/eps) (EPS). Utilizing the Disney model over, the payout ratio is $0.84/$5.73 = 14.66%. This is natural as you realize that a company keeps any money that it doesn't pay out. Of its total net income of $8.98 billion, Disney will pay out 14.66% and hold 85.34%.
