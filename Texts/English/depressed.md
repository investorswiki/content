Depressed prices can as a rule be found in markets after prices have run up, topped, and in this manner declined for a prolonged period.

This diminished level of economic activity can be serious assuming the conditions that made this outcome continue. Making a differentiation between a depressed economy and a stock with depressed prices is helpful.

## Special Considerations

Depressed conditions occur in many markets and once started, will go on insofar as demand-hosing factors stay powerful. One noticeable model was the U.S. housing market after the [subprime real estate market](/subprime_market) [bubble](/bubble) burst in 2006.

Excessive real estate [speculation](/speculation) all through the 2000s prompted a housing bubble. When the [bubble burst](/housing_bubble), a huge number of homeowners were forced into foreclosure, making an excess supply of homes that lasted for quite a long time. In a seriously depressed market, similar to the U.S. real estate market from 2008 to 2012, the market is defined by low prices, yet in addition by low transaction volume.

A period of depressed asset prices can happen in quite a few asset classes, from real estate to bonds to stocks. The global market for commodities is one market that saw a depressed movement somewhere in the range of 2008 and 2018. The [Dow Jones-UBS Commodity Index](/dj-aigci) lost the greater part its value, mirroring a prolonged period of oversupply and declining demand for raw materials.

On account of stocks, a depressed stock is [undervalued](/undervalued) in comparison to other comparative stocks in a similar industry or market. Undervalued is a financial term alluding to a security or other type of investment that is selling at a cost ventured to be below the investment's true intrinsic value and may welcome on [bottom fishing](/base fishing) investors and traders. These examiners think an asset's depressed price is transitory and the price will recuperate to turn into a productive investment over the long haul. Frequently they utilize either technical or fundamental analysis strategies to determine which assets to purchase.

## Types of Depressed Markets
### Depressed Economy

An economic [depression](/depression) is generally viewed as longer lasting than an economic downturn. On the off chance that the conditions inside a country's economy spur a seriously diminished interest for goods and services, then a recessionary environment could happen or decline. Several factors can make such a decline in demand, however practically every one of them add to a choked ability of people to thrive from their labor or carefully invest or both. Conditions, for example, these:

- Adverse weather patterns or events like floods, dry season, or starvation
- Compelled access to credit
- High taxes, tariffs, or fees on consumption
- High levels of government and corporate corruption that obliterate investor confidence
- Destruction of natural resources like in times of war

Any of these conditions that compel consumer demand for quite a long time will negatively impact the country's [gross domestic product](/gdp) (GDP). In the event that those impacts are allowed to proceed, the impact may last for some time as well as will seriously hamper the production capacity of the country and the productivity of the people inside it.

### Depressed Security

Individual company stocks or commodity prices might experience a similar phenomenon on a more limited size. In the event that investors see a greater degree of risk in a security, they will more often than not stay away from it. In the event that the view of risk is complemented by poor performance or unscrupulous behavior with respect to company officers, investors will avoid thinking about the stock. After some time, even assuming the conditions have changed, the discernment can wait, making the stock stay depressed: performing all around ok to get by, however not drawing in new investment money. The purposes behind depressed commodity prices may be more complex, yet the dynamic continues as before. Prices can remain low for an extended period inasmuch as demand stays subdued.

During a depressed market, prices might stay depressed for a really long time, on the off chance that not years, contingent upon the degree to which investor confidence has been harmed. Now and again this can be connected with how emphatically investors had mobilized ahead of time. If during the times when investor confidence was high and excitement was at a breaking point, prices would rocket higher. When the price became unmistakable to virtually all investors as impractical and overvalued, then, at that point, demand drops and prices fall. Assuming prices fall fast and investors horrendously lose more than they expected, faster than they expected, that will lessen the probability that investors will track down confidence in the investment later on.

Frequently the conditions which lead to the depressed market, or depressed prices, are due to activities of banking and financial crisis or the exceptional change in the political structure of an area. A proceeded with depressed market might lead to a [deflationary spiral](/deflationary-spiral) as credit confidence, production capacity, and laborer productivity all lessening in an endless loop. During this downward cycle, economic output slows, and demand for investment and consumption evaporates. A prolonged slowdown may then lead to additional declines in asset prices as producers are forced to liquidate inventories that individuals never again need to buy.

### Depressed Economies

These conditions are frequently coincident with the impression of corruption, as studies on the [Corruption Perception Index](/corruption-insight index) (CPI) have shown.

Depressions are more serious than downturns, which are less articulated contractions that happen as a customary feature of the business cycle. Depressions will generally incorporate factors past the natural expansion and contraction of supply and demand inherent in a country's economy.

Every year, Bloomberg distributes a Misery Index that positions nations in light of levels of inflation, unemployment, and different factors. The Misery Index will in general incorporate countries with depressed economies. Their report from August 2020 shows Venezuela, Argentina, South Africa, and Turkey just like the most depressed economies.
