## Is Craig Wright Satoshi?

Wired magazine and tech news site Gizmodo were the principal publications to propose that Wright concocted Bitcoin. Wright likewise claims to be Satoshi on his personal website. Wired put together its claim with respect to an assortment of evidence, from a store of reserved documents to erased blog entries on Wright's personal site to emails went to the editors from his colleagues.

### The Case for Wright Being Satoshi

As per the publication, Wright utilized a similar email address as Nakamoto for correspondence.

Other than Wright's posts and correspondence, the publications additionally pointed to his business interests, which look like those required to run cryptocurrency mining operations. Through his company, Tulip Trading, Wright is said to control the 1.1 million bitcoins held by Nakamoto. Those bitcoins can't be moved until 2020, as per a trust fund PDF endorsed by the late Dave Kleiman, Wired stated.

The Wired article speculated that Wright might be holding on to the reserve for future investment purposes. Tulip Trading was likewise reported to have made the world's seventeenth quickest supercomputer — C01N — that had a speed of 3.52 Petaflops. (One petaflop is 1,000 teraflops or one trillion drifting point operations each second).

Wright likewise had a dash of hostile to dictatorship like Nakamoto. He subscribed to a cypherphunk mailing list that served to tweak and develop standards for cryptocurrencies. Wright is likewise a freedom supporter who prescribes a return to the gold standard, and a fan of Japanese culture.

### Checking Wright's Claims

As per cryptography experts, Wright needs to perform both of the accompanying two tasks to back up his claim of being Nakamoto.

- He could conduct a bitcoin transaction utilizing Nakamoto's private key.
- He could cryptographically "sign" a message utilizing a similar set of keys. (A message endorsed with a private key is cryptographically secure and must be opened with a comparing public key).

Bitcoin Foundation's Gavin Andresen met Craig Wright in 2016 at a lodging in London to learn proof in regards to his claims. During his meeting with Andresen, Wright marked a message — "Gavin's #1 number is eleven" — with his initials and a private key from one of the initial 50 bitcoin blocks at any point mined.

Wright marked the message on his own PC and moved it onto a brand new computer utilizing a USB stick owned by Andresen. After an initial hiccup, during which Andresen realized they had neglected to add Wright's initials, the signature was checked by Bitcoin's software Electrum. "I accept Craig Steven Wright is the person who developed Bitcoin," Andresen proclaimed on his website the next day.

In any case, it was later revealed that Wright probably hoodwinked Andresen.

Security researcher Dan Kaminsky found that Wright's key separated to transaction data from 2009, which had Satoshi's publicly-accessible signature from parts of the blockchain.

Pundits have likewise examined other evidence and found Wright's claim needing. Wright's PGP keys were made in 2009 and could be followed back to Satoshi Nakamoto's email address. Both Wired and Gizmodo claim this as an important part of their case for Wright being Nakamoto. However, Motherboard, a Vice publication, exposed that theory. PGP keys can be backdated and furthermore fixed to point to anybody's email address.

Adding to the dinkiness are allegations that Craig Wright distorted his scholastic credentials and lied about his company's partnerships.

However, the University let Forbes know that it had not granted a doctorate to him.

Cloudcroft, Wright's company, likewise claimed to have partnered with Silicon Graphics International, a high-performance computing firm that was consequently acquired by Hewlett-Packard, to foster two supercomputers that are listed among the world's main 500. In any case, SGI rejected that Cloudcroft was a customer and said it had no record of the C01N supercomputer.
> In 2021, Craig Wright appeared in court, where he was the litigant in a lawsuit brought by a former business partner claiming that Wright took intellectual property and furthermore claimed fraud, theft, and breach of fiduciary duty. In question was half of Wright's checked 1.1 million BTC. The jury found Wright liable just of intellectual property theft and demanded he pay $100 million in damages. He didn't, notwithstanding, need to surrender any of his bitcoins.
