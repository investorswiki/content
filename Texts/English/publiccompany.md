Instances of public companies incorporate Chevron Corporation, Google Inc., and The Proctor and Gamble Company.

## Burdens of Public Companies

It likewise brings about less control for the majority owners and founders of the corporation. What's more, there are substantial costs to directing an IPO (also the progressing legal, accounting, and marketing costs of keeping a public company).

## Special Considerations
### Progressing From a Public Company to a Private Company

At the point when a company changes to private, a "take-private" transaction is essential.
