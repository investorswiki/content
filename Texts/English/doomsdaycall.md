# Doomsday Call
## What is a Doomsday Call?

A doomsday call is a provision which permits the [issuer](/issuer) to hedge against [interest rate risk](/interestraterisk) by reclaiming the [bond](/bond) (paying back the principal and accrued interest) prior to maturity.

## Understanding Doomsday Call

A doomsday call is a [call option](/calloption) added to a bond which permits either the issuer or investor to early reclaim the bond. The assignment "DD" on a bond statement demonstrates the bond has a doomsday call option. At the point when exercised, a doomsday call can reduce the [yield](/yield) of a bond since it abbreviates the bond's term (the amount of time between bond issuance and [maturity](/maturity)) and hence decline the overall interest paid. The doomsday call is conversationally alluded to as the Canada call since bonds issued by Canadian corporations frequently incorporate them.

It is somewhat phenomenal for a bond issuer to conjure a doomsday call, as it is generally to the issuer's advantage to permit the bond to proceed to maturity. Be that as it may, ought to interest rates decline fundamentally, it very well might be to the issuer's benefit to exercise a doomsday call. They can then issue new bonds at a lower interest rate. While practicing the call, the issuer takes care of the principal and accrued interest before maturity.

Typically, the doomsday call provision guarantees that the price paid for the bond makes a specific yield for the bondholder, and the exercise of one reduces risk since it pays the [principal](/principal) back right on time. The miserable name is due to the way that the bondholder runs the risk of losing out on the higher [coupon rate](/coupon-rate) assuming the issuer exercises this option. For the issuer, the name would have positive undertones, as it might actually bring down their cost for borrowing money.

A doomsday call option can help safeguard the [bondholder](/bondholder) since it indicates what the investor will get in the event that the issuer exercises this option. This limitation typically directs that the bond will be called at a fixed and predetermined amount. This predetermined amount is either a specific spread over the yield of government bonds or [par value](/parvalue), whichever is higher.

Afterward, the option became known as a doomsday call or, for those that vibe that moniker is too bleak, a Canada call.
