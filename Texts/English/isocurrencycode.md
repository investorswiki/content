# ISO Currency Code
## What Is an ISO Currency Code?

ISO currency codes are the three-letter alphabetic codes that address the different [currencies](/currency) utilized all through the world. At the point when combined in pairs, they make up the images and [cross rates](/crossrate) utilized in currency trading.

Every one of the country-explicit three-letter alphabetic codes likewise have a relating three-digit numeric code. These codes are distinguished by the [International Organization for Standardization](/international-organization-for-standardization-iso) (ISO), a nongovernmental organization that gives standards to manufacturing, commerce, technology, and communication. For currencies, the overseeing document is called ISO 4217:2015.

## Grasping ISO Currency Codes

ISO currency codes are central to [currency pairs](/currencypair), which are the quotation and pricing structures of the currencies traded in the [forex market](/forex-market). The value of a currency is a rate still up in the air by its comparison to another currency.

The initial three-digit code used to assign a currency in a currency pair quotation is called the [base currency](/basecurrency), and the subsequent currency is called the [quote currency](/quotecurrency). The currency pair shows the amount of the quote currency is expected to purchase one unit of the base currency.

For instance, [EUR/USD](/eur-usd-euro-us-dollar-currency-pair) is the quote for the euro against the U.S. dollar. EUR is the three-letter ISO currency code for the euro, and USD is the code for the U.S. dollar. A quoted price for this pair of 1.2500 means that one euro is exchanged for 1.2500 U.S. dollars in light of the fact that, in this case, [EUR](/euro) is the base currency and USD is the quote currency (or counter currency). This means that 1 euro can be exchanged for 1.25 U.S. dollars. One more perspective on is that it will cost you USD $125 to buy EUR 100.

ISO wasn't engaged with currency transactions until 1973 when the standards-production body concluded it would be helpful to be involved. Following five years of cooperation and thought, the principal standardized currency codes were distributed in 1978, with a standard on how they ought to change.

## Special Considerations

As indicated by the ISO website, "ISO 4217:2015 determines the structure for a three-letter alphabetic code and an equivalent three-digit numeric code for the representation of currencies. For those currencies having minor units, it likewise shows the decimal relationship between such units and the currency itself." For instance, the three-digit numeric code for the U.S. dollar is 840, and the numeric code for the euro is 978. However, you wouldn't see currencies quoted utilizing numbers like this (978/840).

However, as the ISO document makes sense of, "ISO 4217:2015 is expected for use in any application of trade, commerce, and banking, where currencies and, where fitting, funds are required to be depicted. It is intended to be similarly suitable for manual users and for those utilizing automated systems." Were it helpful to do as such, trading or order processing calculations could involve numeric codes for more effective processing.

## Major Currency Codes

The ISO website offers a complete rundown of currency codes in XML and XMS designs. All of the major currency pairs have very [liquid markets](/liquidmarket) that trade 24 hours per day each business day, and they have exceptionally narrow [spreads](/spread).

The major currency pairs are as per the following:

- EUR/USD - euro/U.S. dollar
- [GBP/USD](/gbp-usd-english pound-us-dollar-currency-pair) - [Great Britain pound (sterling)](/gbp)/U.S. dollar
