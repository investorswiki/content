# Five Percent Rule
## What Is the Five Percent Rule?

The five percent rule is a limitation of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority ([FINRA](/finra)), which oversees brokers and brokerage firms in the U.S. Dating back to 1943, it specifies that a broker shouldn't charge commissions, markups, or markdowns of over 5% on standard trades, both stock exchange postings and [over-the-counter](/otc) transactions, along with proceeds sales and riskless transactions.

Albeit otherwise called the FINRA 5% markup policy or 5% policy, the five percent rule is to a greater extent a guideline rather than a genuine regulation. The aim is to require [brokers](/broker) to utilize fair and ethical practices while setting commission rates, so that the prices investors pay are sensibly connected with the market for the [securities](/speculation securities) they buy.

## How the Five Percent Rule Works

The five percent rule itself sets forward no criterion for ascertaining commissions or [fees](/brokerage-fee). All things being equal, it demonstrates that the broker ought to follow guidelines. The rule is applied to different transactions, including the following:

- **Head transactions**: A broker-dealer buys or sells securities from its own holdings and, in light of that, charges a markup or markdown.
- **Office transactions**: A brokerage firm, going about as a middleman, charges a commission on a transaction.
- **Proceeds transactions**: A broker-dealer sells a security for a client and utilizations those proceeds to purchase other securities. This constitutes one transaction, not two.
- **Riskless transactions**: Such simultaneous transactions see a firm buy a security from its own holdings and quickly offer it to a client.

The rule itself has several exemptions. For instance, it doesn't matter to securities sold through a [prospectus](/prospectus) — like in an initial public offering.

## What Determines a Fair Commission?

On the off chance that the five percent rule aims to lay out a reasonable fee, it's natural to ponder: How do firms figure out what's fair? Components that are considered while figuring out what is fair and reasonable include:

- The price of the security being referred to
- The total value of the transaction (larger transactions might meet all requirements for discounted pricing)
- What sort of security it is (options and stocks transactions have higher costs than bonds, for instance)
- The overall value of the individuals' administrations
- What it cost to execute the transaction (a few firms impose a base transaction)

It ought to be noticed that each factor might contribute to a higher or lower commission than 5%; a large equity transaction that was simple to execute might be done as such for definitely under 5%, while a small, complicated transaction of an all the more delicately traded security could be undeniably over 5%.

## Five Percent Rule Example

To buy 100 shares of Hypothetical Co. at $10 a share, the total value of that transaction would be $1,000. On the off chance that the broker's base transaction cost was $100, the total fee would be 10% of the exchange — definitely more than the five percent rule. In any case, as long as the client knew about the transaction least in advance, the rule wouldn't matter.
