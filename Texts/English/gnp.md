# Gross National Product (GNP)
## What Is Gross National Product (GNP)?

Gross national product (GNP) is an estimate of the total value of the relative multitude of end results and services turned out in a given period by the means of production owned by a country's occupants. GNP is generally calculated by taking the sum of [personal consumption expenditures](/pce), private domestic investment, government expenditure, [net exports](/netexports), and any income earned by inhabitants from overseas investments, minus income earned inside the domestic economy by foreign occupants. Net exports address the difference between what a country exports minus any imports of goods and services.

GNP is connected with another important economic measure called [gross domestic product](/gdp) (GDP), which considers all output delivered inside a country's boundaries paying little mind to who possesses the means of production. GNP begins with GDP, adds inhabitants' [investment income](/investmentincome) from overseas investments, and deducts foreign occupants' investment income earned inside a country.

## Figuring out Gross National Product (GNP)

GNP measures the total monetary value of the output created by a country's occupants. Accordingly, any output created by foreign occupants inside the country's lines must be excluded in estimations of GNP, while any output delivered by the country's inhabitants outside of its boundaries must be counted. GNP does exclude intermediate goods and services to try not to twofold count since they are as of now incorporated in the value of conclusive goods and services.

The U.S. utilized GNP until 1991 as its fundamental measure of economic activity. After that point, it began to involve GDP in its place for two primary reasons. In the first place, since GDP relates all the more closely to other U.S. economic data of interest to policymakers, like employment and industrial production, which, similar to GDP, measure activity in the limits of the U.S. also, disregard nationalities. Also, the switch to GDP was to work with crosscountry correlations on the grounds that most different countries at the time basically utilized GDP.

## The Difference Between GNP and GDP

GNP and GDP are closely related concepts, and the primary differences between them come from the way that there might be companies owned by foreign occupants that produce goods in the country, and companies owned by domestic occupants that produce goods until the end of the world and return [earned income](/earnedincome) to domestic inhabitants.

For instance, there are a number of foreign companies that produce goods and services in the United States and transfer any income earned to their foreign occupants. Similarly, numerous U.S. corporations produce goods and services outside of the U.S. borders and earn profits for U.S. occupants. On the off chance that income earned by [domestic corporations](/domestic-company) outside of the United States surpasses income earned inside the United States by corporations owned by foreign inhabitants, the U.S. GNP is higher than its GDP.

Working out both GNP and GDP can deliver various outcomes in terms of total output. For instance, in 2021 (as per Q3 data), U.S. GDP was $23.2 trillion, while its GNP was $23.47 trillion. While GDP is the most widely followed measure of a country's economic activity, GNP is as yet worth taking a gander at in light of the fact that large differences among GNP and GDP might show that a country is turning out to be more participated in international trade, production, or financial operations. The larger the difference between a country's GNP and GDP, the greater the degree of incomes and investment activity in that country include transnational activities, for example, [foreign direct investment](/fdi) somehow.

## FAQ
### What Does Gross National Product Measure?
Gross national product is one measurement for measuring a country's economic output. Gross national product is the value of all products and services created by the residents of a country both domestically, and internationally minus income earned by foreign occupants. For example, on the off chance that a country had production facilities in an adjoining country and its nation of origin, gross national product would account for both of these production outputs.
### What Is the Difference Between Gross National Product and Gross Domestic Product?
Gross national product accounts for its resident's productions both inside and outside its boundaries. This figure then deducts income earned by foreign occupants inside the country. Conversely, gross domestic product measures the production of goods and services made inside a country's lines by the two residents and foreign occupants overall.
### What Is an Example of Gross National Product?
Consider a country that has a gross national product that surpasses its gross domestic product. This shows that its residents, organizations, and corporations are giving net inflows to the country through their overseas operations. Thus, this higher gross national product might signal that a country is expanding its international financial operations, trade, or production.
