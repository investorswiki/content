# The Pot
## What Is the Pot?

The pot — as in, "what's left in the pot" — is the portion of a stock or bond issue that investment bankers return to the overseeing or [lead underwriter](/leadunderwriter) after an issue, for example, a [initial public offering](/ipo) (IPO). The underwriter then, at that point, offers the portion to institutional investors.

An institutional investor is a non-bank person or organization who exchanges [securities](/investment-securities) in large enough share amounts or has a net worth high enough to meet all requirements for particular treatment and lower commissions. Instances of institutional investors incorporate hedge funds, high-net-worth people, pension funds, and blessings. These players have the financial capital to buy large measures of stock after an issue like an IPO. Underwriters follow specific advances while undertaking an IPO.

### Steps of an Initial Public Offering (IPO)

Initial, an outside IPO team is included an underwriter, attorneys, certified public accountants (CPAs), and [Securities and Exchange Commission](/sec) (SEC) specialists. Next, data with respect to the company is amassed, including financial performance and expected future operations.

These records become part of the company prospectus, which is flowed for audit among potential investors. [Financial statements](/financial-statements) are submitted for an official audit. The responsible company at long last documents its prospectus with the SEC and marks the calendar for the offering.

An underwriter may [build their book](/bookbuilding) by accepting orders from fund managers, who will show the number of shares they might want to purchase and the price they will pay.

When investment bankers or IPO underwriters decide the price, the company markets the IPO before its most memorable day of trading. As stated over, the pot is the portion of the issue that investment banks return to the lead underwriter following the deal.

Being the lead underwriter can be highly lucrative — in the event that a deal is fruitful.
