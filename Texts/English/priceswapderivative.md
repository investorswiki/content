## What Is a Price Swap Derivative?

A price swap derivative is a derivative transaction where one entity guarantees a fixed value for the total asset holdings of one more entity over a predetermined period. Under this type of agreement, at whatever point the value of the secured assets declines, the counterparty must deliver securities or other collateral to offset that loss and take the asset back to its original value.

## Understanding a Price Swap Derivative

Price [swap](/swap) derivatives empower the value of one company's assets to remain consistent over a set period through the assistance of another company's distributing shares. In this sense, the price swap derivative can really conceal the way that the accepting company's financial position is debilitating after some time. Notwithstanding, when the counterparty issues new shares to fill the gap made by the brought down asset, it results in [dilution](/dilution) of value for existing shareholders. This combination of a deceptive valuation on one side and progressively diluted stock on the other can undermine the financial standing of the two players in the agreement.
