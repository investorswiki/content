# Sales Mix
## What Is the Sales Mix?

The sales mix is a calculation that decides the extent of every product a business [sells](/offer) relative to total sales. The sales mix is critical in light of the fact that a few products or services might be more profitable than others, and assuming that a company's sales mix changes, its profits likewise change. Overseeing sales mix is an instrument to expand company profit.

## Understanding Sales Mix

Examiners and financial backers utilize a company's sales mix to decide the company's possibilities for overall growth and profitability. On the off chance that profits are flat or declining, the company can de-underscore or even stop selling a low-profit product and spotlight on expanding sales of a high-profit product or service.

## Figuring in Profit Margin

[Profit margin](/profitmargin) is defined as net income partitioned by sales, and this ratio is a helpful instrument to compare the relative profitability of two products with various retail sales prices. Expect, for instance, XYZ Hardware creates a net income of $15 on a lawnmower that sells for $300 and sells a $10 hammer that delivers a $2 profit. The profit margin on the hammer is 20%, or $2 partitioned by $10 while the cutter just produces a 5% profit margin, $15 separated by $300. Profit margin eliminates the sales price in dollars as a variable and permits the owner to compare products in view of profit per sales dollar. Assuming XYZ's profits are easing back, the firm might shift the marketing and sales budget to advance the products that offer the highest profit margin.

## Target Net Income

The sales mix can be utilized to plan business results and arrive at a target level of net income. Expect, for instance, XYZ needs to earn $20,000 for the month by generating $200,000 in sales and chooses to compute various presumptions for the sales mix to decide the net income figure. As XYZ shifts the product mix toward products with a higher profit margin, the profit for each dollar sold increments alongside net income.

## Instances of Inventory Cost Issues

Sales mix likewise affects the total [inventory](/inventory) cost incurred, and this cost might change company profit overwhelmingly. On the off chance that, for instance, XYZ chooses to stock more yard trimmers to fulfill spring grass need, the firm will earn a lower profit margin than It would on the off chance that it sold hammers and different products. Likewise, stocking more yard cutters requires more warehouse space, a bigger cash investment in inventory, and the expense of moving trimmers into the store and out to customer vehicles. Carrying bigger, more costly products creates higher inventory costs and requires a bigger cash investment.
