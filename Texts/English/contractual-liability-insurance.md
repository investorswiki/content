# Contractual Liability Insurance
## What Is Contractual Liability Insurance?

Contractual liability insurance safeguards against liabilities that the policyholder has assumed from going into a contract of any nature.

## Figuring out Contractual Liability Insurance

Contractual liability includes the financial outcomes radiating from [liability](/liability), not the assumption of the indemnitee's liability itself. Once the indemnitee coincidentally causes or supposedly makes injury or damage an outsider, the indemnitee is as yet responsible for that liability. Consequently, liability to an outsider for injury or damage can't be assumed by anybody other than the person who caused the injury or damage. What is being moved by the indemnitor to the indemnitee rather are the financial outcomes (i.e., [money damages](/compensatory-damages)) of the decided indemnitee's liability.

Contractual liability insurance reimburses the policyholder from liabilities that might be explicitly stated in the contract or might be implied by the idea of the obligations listed in the contract. A common phrase found in contracts states that one party consents to hold another party harmless for any wounds, mishaps, or losses that happen while the contact is in effect.

For instance, a construction company working on a city government building might be required to hold the city harmless if somebody somehow managed to be harmed on the construction site. The construction company has agreed to accept liability and repay the city. A contractual liability insurance policy would safeguard the contractor from losses that the building contract shields the city from.

One more important part of the contractual liability is grasping that the genuine significance of the terms "hold harmless," "repay," and "shield" vary. These terms are common in contract language. "Hold harmless" means an agreement to accept the financial results of another's liability. "[Indemnify](/repayment)" means to repay damages and defense costs however it does exclude the obligation to protect. If an indemnitee needs to be safeguarded, it must express so in its contract.

Indemnification agreements are common increases to real estate contracts, for example, one between a [lessor](/lessor) and [lessee](/lessee). A business that leases an office in a strip shopping center, for instance, needs to sign a lease contract. This lease will probably state that the business needs to hold harmless the landlord from losses, damages, and different liabilities that might happen because of the activities (or inaction) of the business.

## Contractual Liability Insurance Limitations

Various companies have general [liability policies](/liability_insurance) that shield them from the many risks that they face in everyday activities; in any case, these policies might prohibit coverage in certain occasions. Such an exclusion might apply to contractual liability, since this type of liability has been added to the overall [risk profile](/risk-profile) of the company and might not have existed had the company not agreed to the contract.

An exception to an overall liability policy's contractual liability exclusion would likewise incorporate a liability assumed under an insured contract. A contractual liability insurance policy fills the gap made by the [commercial general liability](/commercial-general-liability-cgl) insurance policy's exclusion.
