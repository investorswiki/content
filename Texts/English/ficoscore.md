# FICO Score
## What is a FICO score?
The Fair Isaac Corp., known as FICO, is a company that has some expertise in what it calls "prescient analytics." It collects data about several areas of your financial life and by relegating a value to every one of five factors, it predicts whether you are a decent credit risk. The FICO score it doles out you in light of its credit analysis offers a quick understanding into your creditworthiness, with 300 being the most terrible credit score and 850 the best.
## More profound definition
FICO's analytics model is the one generally ordinarily utilized by lenders to decide creditworthiness. In spite of the fact that it isn't the main credit-scoring company around, it is the one liable to carry the most weight as you apply for credit. Everything starts by FICO gathering your credit data from one of the big three reporting agencies: Equifax, TransUnion and Experian.
These agencies, known as credit bureaus, collect data about your credit, past and present. Their reports incorporate any lenders you could have borrowed from, for example, credit card companies, banks, student loan lenders and mortgage companies. They may likewise incorporate reports from utility and telephone companies. All of this data illustrates you as a borrower, taking note of whether you were late on bills or paid on time, and whether you got to all of credit extended to you or whether you utilized it reasonably.
Here is where it can get precarious: Each of your credit reports from the three credit bureaus is probably going to be to some degree different on the grounds that not all creditors supply data to all credit bureaus. For instance, your bank might report your car loan payments to only one bureau every month, while your student loans are reported to two others. Likewise, assuming there are negative errors on one of your reports, the score on that report is probably going to be lower.

## Instances of FICO credit score
There are five factors that go into deciding your FICO score, some weighed more intensely than others. In view of data given by a particular credit bureau, this is the very thing that FICO searches for:
- **Installment history**. The biggest part of your credit score pie, 35 percent of it, is the manner by which well you have paid your bills. The more late or missed payments, the lower this part of your score. The more reliable you have been, the higher this portion.
- **Sums owed.** Lenders needs to realize that you are capable of having credit available to you without utilizing everything simultaneously. In the event that you have a credit card with a $5,000 credit limit, your FICO score will benefit more on the off chance that you owe $300 as opposed to $3,000. This data is 30 percent of the credit score pie.
- **Length of credit history**. Generally, the longer your credit history, the higher your FICO score. It doesn't address a colossal slice of the pie, just 15 percent, however lenders feel better realizing that you have a long history of repayment.
- **Credit mix**. At the point when a lender sees that you can handle a wide range of credit â€” including a mortgage, vehicle loan, credit cards and some other type of loan - it feels more certain that you will actually want to deal with their loan. This contains 10 percent of the credit pie.
- **New credit**. History has shown that individuals who open several credit accounts inside a short period of time are bound to default on no less than one of them. This is 10 percent of the credit score pie.
