This type of account doesn't have a specific maturity or expiration date, so it is legitimate however long the account holder needs it to stay open. This is rather than a [term deposit](/termdeposit), which is open for a certain period of time.

## How Current Account Savings Accounts (CASA) Work

A CASA operates like a normal bank account in which funds might be used out of the blue. It joins both the checking and savings capabilities into one. Due to this flexibility, a CASA has a lower interest rate than a term deposit, in which money is set to the side to be immaculate for a specific time frame period with a guaranteed interest rate.

Most banks offer CASAs to their customers for free. At times, there might be a small fee, contingent upon certain base or average balance requirements.

A CASA will in general be a less expensive manner for a bank to fund-raise than giving term deposits, for example, [certificates of deposit](/certificateofdeposit) (CDs), which offer higher interest rates to the customers.

Financial institutions empower the utilization of a CASA on the grounds that it generates a higher [profit margin](/profitmargin). Since the interest paid on the CASA deposit is lower than on a term deposit, the bank's [net interest income](/net-interest-income) (NII) is higher. Hence, CASAs can be a less expensive source of funding for banks.
