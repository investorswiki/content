## Education and Early Career

He later proceeded with his studies in meteorology at Caltech in Pasadena, Calif., the town that turned into his lifelong home.

In the wake of entering Harvard Law School — without an undergraduate degree — he graduated magna cum laude with a J.D. in 1948. As a real estate attorney in those early years, he established Munger, Tolles and Olson, a renowned California law firm.

## Transition From Law to Finance

In 1962, Buffett started to buy shares of Berkshire Hathaway; by 1965, he had assumed command over the company as Chair and CEO; in 1978, Munger became Vice Chair of Berkshire Hathaway.

## From "Stogie Butt" to Buffet-Munger Value Investing

Buffett has forever been a [value investor](/valueinvesting) — effectively seeking and dissecting stocks trading for not exactly their true value — a strategy he learned from his guide, [Benjamin Graham](/bengraham).

Nonetheless, in his 1989 letter to shareholders, Buffett acknowledged Munger for setting him straight on the way that Berkshire shouldn't seek after the "stogie butt" rendition of value investing — a term to portray investors who buy a dying business at present worth $1 for $0.75 just "to get the $0.25 of free puff" that is left in the business.

As Buffett makes sense of it, he started his own career as that sort of stogie butt investor — and it was Munger who understood the stupidity of that approach long before he did: "Charlie understood this early; I was a slow learner."

Working with Munger, what he at long last learned was that the bargain price for a troubled business with different flaws too frequently ended up being a false discount eventually, and any immediate gain would before long be dissolved by low returns. All things considered, Munger and Buffett would prefer to buy "a great business for $1.25, when it is as of now worth $1 however is certainly going to be worth $15 in 10 years."

All in all, the Berkshire rendition of value investing turned out to find success by following Munger's mantra: "Fail to remember what you realize about buying fair businesses at great prices; all things being equal, buy brilliant businesses at fair prices."

## Berkshire Hathaway's "Four Giants"

As Vice Chair, Munger is additionally second-in-charge, everything being equal, including what Buffett calls Berkshire's "Four Giants" — the four investments that account for the bulk of Berkshire's value.

**Insurance Float:** Heading the rundown in 2021 is a cluster of entirely owned subsidiary insurance companies that have made Berkshire the world leader in [insurance float](/normal daily-float) — an investment term for all the money from insurance premiums that Berkshire can hold for quite a long time and invest for their own benefit before paying it back on claims. During Munger's tenure, Berkshire's insurance float has developed from $19 million to $147 billion, starting around 2022. Even with periodic underwriting losses from catastrophic events (for instance, the psychological oppressor assaults on September 11, 2001), colossal, long-term value creation is the explanation insurance float heads the rundown of Berkshire's four goliaths.

**Apple, Inc:** A close sprinter up to insurance float is Berkshire's investment in Apple, Inc. Not at all like the company's completely owned investments, Berkshire possesses just 5.55% of Apple as of year-end 2021, which makes it an abnormal holding for the company. Nonetheless, Apple meets the exceptionally high Munger-Buffett investment bar for the simple explanation that their 5.55% ownership stake increased from 5.39% the previous year due exclusively to Apple's repurchase of their own stock. Given Apple's monstrous value, each 0.1% of the increase from 5.39% to 5.55% ownership earned Berkshire $100 million — with no Berkshire funds spent.

**BNSF (Burlington Northern Santa Fe Corporation):** Berkshire's third goliath, BNSF, operates one of the largest freight railroad networks in North America, with 8,000 trains and 32,500 miles of rail across the western 66% of the U.S. This investment is a classic illustration of the Munger-Buffet preference for investing in companies with a [economic moat](/economicmoat) — an underlying [competitive advantage](/competitive_advantage) that safeguards long-term profits and [market share](/marketshare) from contenders. On account of railways, the tremendous amount of start-up capital required to lay railroad tracks across the U.S. shields railways from rivals, just like a moat around a middle age palace. In 2021, Berkshire had record earnings of $6 billion from BNSF.

**BHE (Berkshire Hathaway Energy):** The fourth monster, BHE, a portfolio of privately managed businesses in the utility sector, is one more classic illustration of the Munger-Buffet preference for companies with an economic moat — the huge capital required to lay power lines across the U.S. safeguards BHE from contenders. Under Munger's leadership, in addition to the fact that BHE earned a record $4 billion of every 2021 (up from $122 million out of 2000, when Berkshire previously purchased a stake), yet it has likewise developed from zero renewable energy capacity into a leading player in wind, sun oriented, and hydro transmission all through the U.S. In 2021, Berkshire owned 91.1% of BHE.
