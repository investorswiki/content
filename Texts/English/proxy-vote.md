## What Is a Proxy Vote?

The term proxy vote alludes to a ballot cast by a single person or firm for a company's shareholder who will be unable to go to a shareholder meeting, or who may not decide to vote on a specific issue. Shareholders receive a proxy ballot in the mail alongside a data booklet called a [proxy statement](/proxystatement), which depicts the issues to be voted on during the meeting. Shareholders vote on various issues including the election of board members, [merger](/merger) or acquisition endorsements, or supporting a stock compensation plan.

Registered [investment management](/investment-management) companies may likewise project proxy votes for the benefit of mutual fund shareholders or high net worth investors in separately managed accounts.

## How a Proxy Vote Works

[Public companies](/publiccompany) report their activities to shareholders through their annual meetings. Before those meetings, shareholders receive data on subjects to be voted on at the meeting, for example, share ownership, the structure of the [board of directors](/boardofdirectors) (BOD), and executive salary and benefits. Investors who own applicable voting shares in the company as of the company's [record date](/recorddate) might be eligible to vote on these issues.

The company might make proxy materials available online, which typically incorporates a [annual report](/annualreport), a proxy statement depicting the issues to be voted on, and a proxy card with voting directions. Materials may likewise be sent in the mail to investors who are eligible to vote at the [annual general meeting](/agm) (AGM).

As opposed to physically going to the shareholder meeting, investors might choose another person, for example, a member of the company's management team, to vote in their place. This person is designated as a [proxy](/proxy) and will make a proxy choice in accordance with the shareholder's bearings as written on their proxy card. Proxy votes might be projected via mail, telephone, or online before the cutoff time. This is typically 24 hours before the shareholder meeting. Reactions might incorporate "For," "Against," "Decline," or "Not Voted."

For issues including subjects other than choosing directors, for example, voting on shareholder proposition, a majority of the votes typically prompts endorsement of the issue.

## Special Considerations

At times a majority vote applies when a company chooses its board of directors. The triumphant candidate essentially needs a greater number of votes than their rival in a majority vote. In this way, an unopposed director just necessities one vote to be chosen. If [shareholders](/shareholder) are against the candidate, they might keep their voting rights.

In certain cases, the decision is made in view of a majority voting system. At the point when a majority vote applies, directors need to receive a majority of the votes to be chosen. Since swearing off voting can impact whether a director is chosen, the company's proxy statement must detail what declined or kept votes will mean for the voting results.
