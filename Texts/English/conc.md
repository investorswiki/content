## What Is Cash-or-Nothing Call?

A cash-or-nothing call (CONC) is an option that has a binary outcome: it pays out either a fixed amount, in the event that the underlying stock surpasses a foreordained threshold or [strike price](/strikeprice), or pays out nothing.

## Understanding Cash-or-Nothing Call

Since it's a [call option](/calloption), CONCs payout relies just upon whether the underlying closes over the strike price (i.e., [in the money](/inthemoney)) at the expiration date. It doesn't, be that as it may, matter how deep in the money it is as the payout is fixed. A cash-or-nothing put (CONP), then again, would payout on the off chance that the underlying price dips under its strike.

This sort of option is otherwise called a [binary](/binary-option) or a digital option, and might be compared with a [asset-or-nothing call](/aonc) (AONC). The difference is that cash-or-nothing options are [cash-settled](/cash-settled-options) while AONC options take physical delivery of the underlying shares or assets.

As the name proposes, cash-or-nothing options get comfortable cash. The buyer pays a premium for the option, and the cash settlement pays out or not. The payout relies just upon whether the underlying asset closes over the strike price (in the money) at the expiration date. It doesn't make any difference how deep in the money it is as the payout is fixed.

Albeit all digital options might seem, by all accounts, to be simple, they are not quite the same as vanilla options and might be traded on unregulated platforms. Therefore, they might carry a higher risk of fraudulent activity. Investors who wish to invest in binary options ought to utilize platforms that are regulated by the Securities and Exchange Commission ([SEC](/sec)), the Commodity Futures Trading Commission ([CFTC](/cftc)), or different regulators.

Binary options likewise carry a shame of resembling a gambling instrument since they either pay or not and the outcome appears to be regularly taken a risk with. Standard options pay on a sliding scale so the deeper in the money they move, the higher the payout, and this gives them more of a feeling of being an investment or trading vehicle, as opposed to a betting vehicle, however the differentiation is to a great extent more perceived than real.

Binary options are either [American Style](/americanoption) or [European Style](/europeanoption) contingent upon the individual market and the underlying asset.

American Style digital options automatically exercise the moment they get in the money, in contrast to American style standard options. This means that the holder gets the payoff promptly as opposed to waiting for expiration. This is like [one-touch](/onetouchoption) options.

## Cash-or-Nothing versus Asset-or-Nothing

There are different types of binary options including asset-or-nothing calls and [asset-or-nothing puts.](/aonp) However, while the name recommends they settle with [physical delivery](/physicaldelivery) of the underlying asset, that isn't correct all the time.

Contingent upon the options, the payoff could be the cash price of the underlying asset at expiration. Also, it is digital, for example all or none, so assuming that the underlying price is over the strike price, it pays the underlying price. On the off chance that it isn't over the strike then the payoff is zero.

> European Style digital options just exercise at expiration. Most digital options are in the European Style.

## Illustration of a Cash-or-Nothing Call

For instance, expect to be the Standard and Poor's 500 Index ([S&P 500 Index](/sp500)) right now trades at 2,090 at 12:45 p.m., on June 2. A trader is bullish on the S&P 500 Index and accepts that it will trade over 2,100 before the finish of that trading day. The trader purchases 10 S&P 500 Index 2,100 cash-or-nothing call options at 12:45 p.m. for $50 per contract. In the event that the S&P 500 Index closes over 2,100 toward the finish of the trading day, on June 2, the trader would receive $100 per contract, or a profit of $50 per contract. On the other hand, in the event that the S&P 500 Index closes below 2,100, the trader loses the entirety of their investment, or $500.

Closing just somewhat in the money is all the call holder necessities to profit. Assuming the trader accepts the underlying asset will close essentially higher than the strike price, then, at that point, a standard ("vanilla") option might be a better decision since it permits the holder to partake in that gain. The cost ought to likewise be lower.
