# Do It Right The First Time (DRIFT)
## What Is Do It Right The First Time (DRIFT)?

Do It Right The First Time (DRIFT) is a [managerial accounting](/managerialaccounting) technique or practice that centers around decreasing waste and increasing effectiveness in the production cycle. Do It Right The First Time is part of inventory management, by which just the inventory materials that are required are requested to reduce inventory costs. Do It Right The First Time can assist businesses with reducing production deferrals and lift effectiveness. Nonetheless, DRIFT has its drawbacks, including it might keep a company from capitalizing on a flood in demand for the company's products.

## Understanding Do It Right The First Time (DRIFT)

The significance of Do It Right The First Time (DRIFT) arises from the goal of decreasing the costs of idle inventory or raw materials. DRIFT connects with [just-in-time](/jit) (JIT) inventory, which is a course of receiving just the necessary materials, which is intended to lower inventory costs and further develop production management. At the end of the day, under JIT, companies don't begin production until sales are recorded, allowing inventory levels to remain low. The thought behind DRIFT is that management needs each of the processes that make up the JIT philosophy to be done accurately and proficiently, so there are no postpones in the production cycle.

DRIFT endeavors to address the limitations and possible traps of the JIT inventory system. For instance, assuming there's the smallest mistake at one of the phases of production, the whole production cycle can be impacted. By "doing it right the initial time" a company can run a smooth production process without the need to carry unreasonable inventory, which will assist with diminishing the costs of production. Accordingly, DRIFT expects companies to have an effective communication system in place to record sales, make the resulting inventory purchases, and adjust production plans depending on the situation.

## Reactions of DRIFT

Companies that use DRIFT can experience lower costs and improved [profit margins](/profitmargin). Profit margin is the amount of profit generated for every dollar of revenue. Profit margin is an important metric since it accounts for expense controls as well as revenue growth. Profit or net income can increase with higher revenues, yet on the off chance that expenses rise at a quicker rate, profit is disintegrated, leading to a lower profit margin. In the manufacturing system, DRIFT assists with addressing expense management and lift margins. Nonetheless, there are a few expected drawbacks to the DRIFT and JIT production strategy that can lead to **lower** margins.

### Forestalls Economies of Scale

Companies that utilization the DRIFT and JIT system lose the opportunity to accomplish [economies of scale](/economiesofscale). Economies of scale happens when production increases however the average input costs go down. The reduced costs that outcome from output increases are due to the fixed costs, like equipment, remaining something very similar or generally unchanged.

Companies that utilization DRIFT and JIT additionally do without amount based discounts while buying supplies. Accordingly, the company might pay more per thing since it makes smaller, more regular supply orders that don't fit the bill for price breaks from providers. The lack of discounts can lead to higher per unit supply costs and dissolve profit margins.

### No Back Stock

With no back stock of inventory or materials, any [supply chain issue](/scm) or an unforeseen flood in demand for the finished product can lead to delivery deferrals to end customers. The extended deferrals could lead to disappointed customers and the loss of orders.

On-demand production using JIT and DRIFT additionally means companies must find providers that are willing to ship continuous, small orders. On the off chance that any disruption happens, for example, a natural disaster, the company could experience production delays on the off chance that the provider couldn't deliver the materials. Buying in bulk, albeit more costly than on-demand, allows companies to have adequate amounts of stock to endure supply chain disruptions.

### Increased Shipping Costs

Regular orders to providers likewise lead to extra shipping and handling charges. The outcome can increase the per-unit cost of a decent and at last lessening the company's profit margin. As such, the extra shipping costs could clear out the profit margin increases that the DRIFT production method was intended to make.
