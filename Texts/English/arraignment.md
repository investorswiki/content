# Arraignment
## What Is an Arraignment?

Arraignment is a court continuing in which the litigant is perused the charges in the [indictment](/racketeering), and is asked to enter a request. The arraignment happens after the respondent is captured and formal charges are required.

## Figuring out Arraignment

Court cases ordinarily travel through a series of stages before being thought of as closed. In civil cases, the main stage has the offended party file a protest with the court illustrating the offended party's claims. The litigant then, at that point, gets a copy of the protest and a notice to show up in court. As of now, the offended party and litigant are given the opportunity to settle the case privately or utilize a [alternative dispute resolution](/alternative-dispute-resolution) (ADR) mechanism instead of go to trial. The courts may likewise give a [summary judgment](/at first sight). In the event that the case goes to trial, the judge will at last levy a decision, and either party to the suit might decide to appeal the court's decision.

## Arraignment in Criminal Cases

Criminal cases follow an alternate series of stages. Criminal cases start with a [indictment](/racketeering), which is a conventional notice of charges. The respondent is then charged and captured. The respondent is brought before a judge and educated regarding the charges, alluded to as the arraignment. Normally, the respondent goes to the arraignment in person, however in cases in which the discipline would be a fine or detainment for under a year, the litigant doesn't need to be available.

In the United States, the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure requires an arraignment to happen in open court, where the litigant is given a copy of the prosecution, is perused the prosecution, and is asked to concede or not blameworthy to the charges. Arraignments happen decently fast once a respondent is captured. A respondent will normally stay in custody before arraignment for 48 to 72 hours, however the amount of time might shift among state and federal courts. The U.S. Constitution's Sixth Amendment awards litigants the opportunity to be, "educated regarding the nature and reason for the allegation." It doesn't, notwithstanding, require the respondent to be educated during the arraignment stage.

The arraignment likewise offers the litigant the opportunity to ask for [bail](/bail-bond). The judge might permit the respondent to be delivered on bail until the trial starts. Before bail is conceded, the judge surveys the litigant's experience, including the respondent's lawbreaker record, to decide whether the litigant will represent a huge risk whenever delivered. Assuming the litigant is denied bail or on the other hand in the event that the respondent can't post bail, they will be kept in custody.

In 2011, the United States filed criminal charges against Rajat Gupta, an overseeing director at management counseling firm McKinsey and Company. The charges were connected with a prior civil case filed by the SEC concerning [insider trading](/insidertrading) activities. In the civil case, he was found to have given insider data to his companion and [hedge fund manager](/hedge-fund-manager) Raj Rajaratnam. During the arraignment, Gupta argue not blameworthy to the charges, and was allowed bail. Bail was set at $10 million. The trial started May 2012, and the jury found him liable in June 2012.
