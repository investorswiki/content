# SPOT Premium
## What Is a SPOT Premium?

The SPOT premium is the money that an investor pays to a broker to purchase a type of [exotic](/exoticoption) option known as a single payment options trading (SPOT) option. This type of option is most ordinarily utilized in [foreign exchange markets](/foreign-exchange-markets).

## Figuring out SPOT Premium

With a SPOT option (likewise called a [binary option](/binary-option)) the investor picks the payout they believe as well as the specific market conditions should receive that payout. The broker then sets a [premium](/option-premium) for the option in light of the likelihood of the investor's expectations happening.

After the broker sets the premium, the investor can decide to buy the option assuming that the price is good, or decline on the off chance that they think the price is too high. If the payout conditions do happen, the investor collects the payout. In the event that they don't happen, the investor will lose the premium. In any case, regardless of what occurs in the market, the most the trader can lose is the premium itself.

Spot premium may on the other hand allude to cases where the [spot market](/spotmarket) price of some commodity is greater than (trades at a premium to) the price of its front-month [futures](/futurescontract) contract. All in all, the current price (spot) is greater than the expected price from now on, not set in stone by the futures contract. This situation is all the more usually alluded to as [backwardation](/backwardation).

## SPOT Option

For the most part, a [SPOT option](/spot) is a type of option contract that permits an investor to set not just the conditions that should be met to receive the ideal payout, yet in addition the size of the payout looked for assuming that those conditions are met. The broker that gives this product will decide the probability that the conditions will be met and, thus, will charge what it feels is a proper commission.

This type of arrangement is frequently alluded to as a "binary option" in light of the fact that main two types of payouts are workable for the investor:

1. The conditions set out by the two players happen, and the investor collects the agreed-upon payout amount.
1. The event doesn't happen and the investor forfeits the full premium paid to the broker.

The broker for the contract, given that the terms of the SPOT option are pleasant with the two players, will then, at that point, acknowledge a percentage of that projected payout as the premium and the investor can continue to buy the option.

For example, say a trader thinks that the [CHF/USD](/usd-chf-us-dollar-swiss-franc-money pair) will **not** break below 1.40 inside the next about fourteen days, they would pay a certain spot premium to a broker and afterward collect the agreed upon payout in 14 days on the off chance that this scenario ends up being true.

In any case, if the CHF/USD **does** break below 1.40, during that time period, the trader will miss out on the full amount of the spot premium.

## SPOT Premium Example

Expect an investor trusts that the [EUR/USD](/eur-usd-euro-us-dollar-cash pair) will exchange above 1.15 on Friday at [expiry](/expirationdate), and it is currently Monday. The EUR/USD is currently trading at 1.14.

The investor is utilizing a binary options broker outside the U.S., which ordinarily cites payouts as a percentage of money invested.

For instance, the investor chooses to bet $1,000 that the EUR/USD will exchange above 1.15 when the option terminates on Friday. In the event that the option isn't trading above 1.15, the investor loses the $1,000. In the event that they are right, the broker has agreed to pay them $750 (and their initial investment back).

In this case, the investor isn't claiming the underlying EUR/USD, rather the transaction is a wagered with the broker on whether the price of the EUR/USD will be over a certain level or not by a certain date.

In the event that not utilizing a binary options broker, the arrangement might be different since exotic options can be structured anyway the gatherings concur. It very well may be set up that the investor pays a premium of $250 front and center. Assuming they lose, they just lose the premium. In the event that they win, they get $437.50 (yet recollect that they paid $250, so the profit is truly just $187.50).

In binary options, it is regular to lose more when you are off-base than you make when you win. This is since, supposing that a scenario is probably going to happen (win) the broker isn't probably going to give a high payout. What's more, in the event that the scenario is impossible, they will offer a higher payout however simply because you are probably going to lose.

In the two cases over, the loss is greater than the success. In the main model, you are gambling $1,000 to make just $750, and in the subsequent model, the trader is gambling $250 to make just $187.50 ($437.50 - $250 in light of the fact that $250 of that payout is just getting the premium back, not profit). This is something to know about. Generally, traders like to make more on champs than lose on failures as this makes a good [risk/reward](/riskrewardratio) tradeoff.
