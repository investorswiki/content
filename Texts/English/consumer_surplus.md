# Consumer Surplus
## What Is Consumer Surplus?

Consumer [surplus](/surplus) is an economic measurement of consumer benefits. A consumer surplus happens when the price that consumers pay for a product or service is not exactly the price they're willing to pay. It's a measure of the extra benefit that consumers receive in light of the fact that they're paying less for something than what they were ready to pay.

## Grasping Consumer Surplus

The concept of consumer surplus was developed in 1844 to measure the social benefits of [public goods](/public-great) like national thruways, waterways, and scaffolds. It has been an important apparatus in the field of [welfare economics](/welfare_economics) and the plan of tax policies by state run administrations.

Consumer surplus depends on the economic theory of [marginal utility](/marginalutility), which is the extra satisfaction a consumer gains from another unit of a decent or service. The utility a decent or service gives shifts from one individual to another in view of their personal preference.

Normally, the to a greater extent a decent or service that consumers have, the less they're willing to spend for a greater amount of it, due to the diminishing marginal utility or extra benefit they receive. A consumer surplus happens when the consumer will pay more for a given product than the current [market price](/market-price).

## Measuring Consumer Surplus

The [demand curve](/demand-curve) is a graphic representation used to work out consumer surplus. It shows the relationship between the price of a product and the quantity of the product demanded costing that much, with price drawn on the y-pivot of the graph and [quantity demanded](/quantitydemanded) drawn on the x-hub. In view of the law of diminishing marginal utility, the demand curve is descending slanting.

Consumer surplus is measured as the area below the descending slanting demand curve, or the amount a consumer will spend for given amounts of a decent, or more the real market price of the upside, portrayed with a [horizontal line](/horizontal-line) drawn between the y-pivot and demand curve. Consumer surplus can be calculated on either an individual or aggregate basis, in the event that assuming the demand curve is individual or aggregated.

Consumer surplus generally increments as the price of a decent falls and diminishes as the price of a decent ascents. For instance, assume consumers will pay $50 for the principal unit of product An and $20 for the 50th unit. In the event that 50 of the units are sold at $20 each, 49 of the units were sold at a consumer surplus, expecting the demand curve is steady.

Consumer surplus is zero when the demand for a decent is impeccably [elastic](/versatility). Yet, demand is totally inelastic when consumer surplus is limitless.

## Illustration of a Consumer Surplus

Consumer surplus is the benefit or positive sentiment of getting a fair setup. For instance, suppose that you bought an airline ticket for a flight to Disney World during school vacation week for $100, yet you were expecting and able to pay $300 for one ticket. The $200 addresses your consumer surplus.

Notwithstanding, organizations know how to transform consumer surplus into [producer surplus](/producer_surplus) or for their gain. In our model, suppose the airline understands your surplus and as the calendar gravitates toward to school vacation week raises its ticket prices to $300 each.

The airline realizes there will be a spike in demand for movement to Disney World during school vacation week and that consumers will actually want to pay higher prices. So by raising the ticket prices, the airlines are taking consumer surplus and transforming it into producer surplus or extra profits.
