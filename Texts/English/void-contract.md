# Void Contract
## What Is a Void Contract?

A void contract is a conventional agreement that is successfully ill-conceived and unenforceable from the moment it is made. A void contract varies from a [voidable contract](/voidable-contract) on the grounds that, while a void contract is one that was never legally substantial in any case (and won't ever be enforceable at any future point in time), voidable contracts might be legally enforceable once underlying contractual deformities are rectified. Simultaneously, void contracts and voidable contracts can be invalidated for comparative reasons.

## Figuring out Void Contracts

A contract might be considered void in the event that the agreement isn't enforceable as it was initially written. In such occasions, void contracts (likewise alluded to as "void agreements"), include agreements that are either illegal in nature or in violation of fairness or public policy.

A contract may likewise become void in the event that a change parents in law or regulations happens after an agreement was reached yet before the contract was satisfied in the event that the formerly legal activities portrayed inside the document are presently considered illegal.

This incorporates agreements made where one party kept data or intentionally gave incorrect data. Inability to unveil things as required by law, or distorting data, may deliver the contract voidable yet doesn't consequently make it void. In cases when one party is permitted to cancel the contract on account of the illegal or unfair (voidable) activities by the other party, the contract or agreement then, at that point, becomes void.
