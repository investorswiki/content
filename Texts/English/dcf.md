# Discounted Cash Flow (DCF)
Discounted Cash Flow (DCF), is a method utilized by analysts and investors to inspect the appeal of an investment opportunity, which uses future free cash flow projections. Those projections are discounted, or adjusted to account for the time value of money, to lay out the value of an investment in the present dollars (present value, or PV).

## Features
- In the event that the DCF is over the current cost of the investment, the opportunity could bring about positive returns.
- The current value of expected future cash flows is shown up at by utilizing a discount rate to compute the DCF.
- The DCF has limitations, essentially in that it depends on assessments of future cash flows, which could demonstrate inaccurate.
- Discounted cash flow (DCF) decides the value of an investment in view of its future cash flows.
- Companies regularly utilize the weighted average cost of capital (WACC) for the discount rate, since it thinks about the rate of return expected by shareholders.
## FAQ
### What Is an Example of a DCF Calculation?
You have a discount rate of 10% and an investment opportunity that would deliver $100 each year for the accompanying three years. Your goal is to ascertain the value today — as such, the "present value" — of this surge of cash flows. Since money in what's in store is worth under money today, you reduce the current value of every one of these cash flows by your 10% discount rate. In particular, the principal year's cash flow is worth $90.91 today, the subsequent year's cash flow is worth $82.64 today, and the third year's cash flow is worth $75.13 today. Adding up these three cash flows, you infer that the DCF of the investment is $248.68.
### Is DCF the Same as Net Present Value (NPV)?
No, DCF isn't equivalent to NPV, albeit the two concepts are closely related. Basically, NPV adds a fourth step to the DCF calculation process. Subsequent to forecasting the expected cash flows, choosing a discount rate, and discounting those cash flows, NPV then deducts the upfront cost of the investment from the investment's DCF. For example, assuming the cost of purchasing the investment in our above model were $200, then the NPV of that investment would be $248.68 minus $200, or $48.68.
### How Do You Calculate DCF?
Working out the DCF includes three fundamental steps — one, forecast the expected cash flows from the investment. Two, you select a discount rate, normally founded on the cost of financing the investment or the opportunity cost introduced by alternative investments. Three, the last step is to discount the forecasted cash flows back to the current day, utilizing a financial calculator, a bookkeeping sheet, or a manual calculation.
