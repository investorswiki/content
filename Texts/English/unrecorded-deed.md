## What Is an Unrecorded Deed?

An unrecorded deed alludes to the situation where the [title](/title) to a property, normally real estate, isn't registered with the fitting public records department.

## Figuring out an Unrecorded Deed

An unrecorded deed is a deed for real [property](/property) that neither the buyer nor the seller has delivered to a suitable government agency. Unrecorded deeds can introduce many issues for sellers (or grantors) and buyers (or grantees) like proof of ownership and tax suggestions.

A [deed](/deed) transfers specific rights of ownership to a piece of real property between two gatherings. Most wards expect that sellers file an original deed with a government agency that keeps up with such records in a given district. In the United States, this frequently happens at the area level. This record tells the public of the sale of property, which thusly gives assurance of current ownership to any entity engaged with transactions impacted by the property, for example, the issuance of a [mortgage](/mortgage) or a [home equity loan](/homeequityloan), where the property fills in as [collateral](/collateral).

Inability to record a deed really makes it unimaginable for the public to be familiar with the transfer of a property. That means the legal owner of the property has all the earmarks of being somebody other than the buyer, a situation that can have serious implications. A buyer, for instance, could experience great difficulty in selling, guaranteeing, or getting loans for a property in the event that financial institutions and insurance companies can't lay out clear title. More regrettable, an unrecorded deed makes potential for a seller to participate in a subsequent sale of a similar property to yet another buyer.

Most mortgage companies require prospective home buyers to lead a [title search](/titlesearch) and secure [title insurance](/title_insurance) on the property to be purchased. The title search looks at existing public records to guarantee a clean transfer of title, an interaction that could be disturbed by outstanding [liens](/home-lien) or past-due property taxes.

Title insurance offers a further backstop by protecting the insurance holder from any losses due to lacks in the title not turned up by the title search. Buyers ought to note that lenders frequently require a separate title insurance policy that safeguards just the loan specialist's interest in the property. In this way, buyers might need to purchase a policy covering their interests too.

Assume, for instance, that a homeowner self-financed the purchase of a home with an unrecorded deed and the seller neglected to close out an existing second mortgage. On the off chance that the seller were to default on the loan, the bank would file a lien against the collateral, which would in any case seem to have a place with the seller as a result of the unrecorded deed.
