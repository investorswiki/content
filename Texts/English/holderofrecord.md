## What Is Holder of Record?

A holder of record is the name of the person who is the registered owner of a security and who has the rights, benefits, and obligations of ownership.

## Figuring out Holder of Record

The holder of record for a stock normally has shareholder [voting rights](/votingright) and gets dividend [payouts](/payout), in the event that there are any. The holder of record for a bond claims the bond and gets the principal and interest payments. At the point when the owner sells the security, they cease to be the holder of record. Holder of record may likewise relate to the authentic owner of different securities, like commodities and derivative contracts.

Securities can be issued in by the same token "registered" or "bearer" form. Registered form means the responsible firm itself tracks a security's owner and sends out payments to them. [Bearer form](/bearerform) means the security is traded with next to no record of ownership; physical possession of the security is the sole evidence of ownership. Bearer form securities have generally been phased out due to their true capacity for abuse. By and by, securities are for the most part issued in registered form.

A registered holder is likewise distinct from a [beneficial owner](/beneficialowner) or holder, whose holdings are held in a brokerage account or by a bank or nominee in street name. Be that as it may, as shareholders of a company, registered holders and beneficial owners will have similar rights as to voting, getting dividends and communications, and so forth, the main difference being how voting rights are practiced and dividends or communications received. Despite the fact that holding securities in street name is the standard, a few investors actually really like to hold physical certificates in their own name. Since it is more costly to transfer ownership along these lines, brokers will charge a higher rate for the burden.
