## What Is a Qualified Dividend?

A qualified dividend is a dividend that falls under [capital gains tax](/capital_gains_tax) rates that are lower than the [income tax](/incometax) rates on unqualified or ordinary dividends. Tax rates for [ordinary dividends](/ordinary-dividends) (typically those paid out from most common or preferred stocks) are equivalent to standard federal income tax rates, which range from 10% to 37% for tax years 2021 and 2022.

By comparison, qualified dividends are taxed as capital gains at rates of 20%, 15%, or 0%, contingent upon the tax bracket. In light of this error in rate, the difference between ordinary versus qualified dividends can be substantial when it comes time to pay taxes.

## Figuring out Qualified Dividends

Standard dividends are classified as either qualified or ordinary, each with various tax suggestions that impact an investor's net return. The tax rate on qualified dividends for investors that have ordinary income taxed at 10% or 12% is 0%. Those that pay income tax rates greater than 12% and up to 35% (for ordinary incomes of up to $445,850) have a 15% tax rate on qualified dividends. The tax rate on qualified dividends is capped at 20%, which is for individuals in the 35% or 37% [tax brackets](/taxbracket) and with ordinary income greater than $445,850. These tax rates on long-term capital gains are current through the 2021 calendar year. Note likewise that there is an extra 3.8% Net Investment Income Tax (NIIT) which is applicable for individuals with modified adjusted gross income exceeding $200,000 or $250,000 for married taxpayers who are filing their taxes jointly.

Qualified dividends are listed in box 1b on IRS [Form 1099-DIV](/form1099div), a tax form shipped off investors who receive [distributions](/circulation) during the calendar year from an investment. Box 1a on the form is held for ordinary dividends, which are the most common type of dividend paid to investors from a corporation or mutual fund, as per the IRS.

To fit the bill for the maximum tax rates of 0%, 15%, or 20% that apply to long-term capital gains, qualified dividends must meet the accompanying requirements, as illustrated by the Internal Revenue Service ([IRS](/irs)):

1. The dividend must have been paid by a U.S. company or a qualifying foreign company.
1. The dividends are not listed with the IRS as those that don't qualify.
1. The required dividend [holding period](/holdingperiod) has been met.

## Ordinary versus Qualified Dividends

Qualified and unqualified (ordinary) dividends might have differences that give off an impression of being minor, however they fundamentally affect overall returns. Overall, most customary dividends distributed by companies in the U.S. can be classified as qualified.

The greatest difference among qualified and unqualified dividends, to the extent that their impact at tax time is the rate at which these dividends are taxed. Unqualified dividends are taxed at an individual's normal income tax rate, instead of the preferred rate for qualified dividends as listed previously. This means that individuals possessing any tax bracket will see a difference in their tax rates relying on whether they have qualified or ordinary dividends.

## Requirements for Qualified Dividends
### Qualifying Foreign Companies

A foreign corporation fits the bill for the special tax treatment in the event that it meets one of the accompanying three conditions: the company is incorporated in a U.S. possession, the corporation is eligible for the benefits of a [comprehensive income](/comprehensiveincome) [tax treaty](/taxtreaty) with the United States, or the stock is promptly tradable on a laid out securities market in the United States. A foreign corporation isn't qualified on the off chance that it is considered a [passive foreign investment company](/pfic).

### Dividends That Do Not Qualify

A few dividends are automatically exempt from consideration as a qualified dividend. These incorporate dividends paid by [real estate investment trusts](/reit) (REITs), master limited partnerships (MLPs), those on [employee stock options](/eso), and those on tax-exempt companies. Dividends paid from [money market accounts](/moneymarketaccount, for example, deposits in savings banks, credit unions, or other financial institutions, don't qualify and ought to be reported as interest income.

Special one-time dividends are additionally unqualified. Finally, qualified dividends must come from shares that are not associated with hedging, for example, those utilized for short sales, puts, and call options. The aforementioned investments and distributions are subject to the ordinary income tax rate.

### The Holding Period

The IRS expects investors to hold shares for a base period of time to benefit from the lower tax rate on qualified dividends. Common stock investors must hold the shares for over 60 days during the 121-day period that begins 60 days before the ex-dividend date, or the date after the dividend has been paid out and after which any new purchasers would then be eligible to receive future dividends. For [preferred stock](/preferredstock), the holding period is over 90 days during a 181-day period that begins 90 days before the ex-dividend date.

For mutual funds, the holding period requirements are fairly unique. In this case, a mutual fund must have held the security unhedged for something like 61 days of the 121-day period which started no less than 60 days before the ex-dividend date of the security. Investors must have held the applicable share of the mutual fund for a similar period too.

## Example

Since the holding period requirements can be challenging to evaluate, think about the accompanying speculative example:

An investor receives dividends as qualified from shares in mutual fund X. That investor bought 1,000 shares of fund X on May 1 for the tax year being referred to. That investor then sold 100 of those shares on June 1 however kept on holding the (unhedged) 900 leftover shares. The ex-dividend date for the fund being referred to was May 15.

Inside the 121-day window, the investor held 100 shares for 31 days (from May 1 through June 1) and the leftover 900 shares for no less than 61 days (from May 1 through July 1). This means that the dividend income earned from the 900 shares held for somewhere around 61 days would be viewed as qualified dividend income, while the income earned from the 100 shares held for just 31 days would be unqualified dividend income. The investor could then involve the qualified dividend per share price to compute the genuine amount of qualified dividends for tax reporting purposes.

## How It Affects Investors

For most regular investors, whether or not a dividend will be qualified or not is normally a non-issue. The justification for this is that most standard dividends from U.S. corporations are viewed as qualified. Nonetheless, especially for those investors zeroed in on foreign companies, REITs, MLPs, and different types of investment vehicles indicated over, the difference among qualification and the alternative can be critical when it comes time to compute taxes.

Then again, there isn't a lot of that an investor can do to have a direction on whether dividends will be viewed as qualified. The main action an investor can take is to hold stocks for the base holding period as stipulated by the type of stock as definite above.
