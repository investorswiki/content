## What Is Capital Goods Price Index (CGPI)?

Capital Goods Price Index (CGPI) is an official statistical monitor of changes in fixed capital asset prices in New Zealand. The index tracks the change in costs for [capital assets](/capitalasset), which are utilized by companies and the New Zealand government to create different goods.

- Land improvement costs including land clearing, reclamation, water system, and seepage
- Plant machinery and equipment
- Different types of construction including [infrastructure projects](/infrastructure)

CGPI is a constituent of New Zealand's broader Business Price Index alongside indices connected with producer prices, farm prices, salaries and wages, and consumer goods and services prices.
