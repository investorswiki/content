# European Sovereign Debt Crisis
## What Was Europe's Sovereign Debt Crisis?

The European sovereign debt crisis was a period when several European countries encountered the collapse of financial institutions, high government debt, and quickly rising bond [yield spreads](/yieldspread) in government securities.

## History of the Crisis

The debt crisis started in 2008 with the collapse of Iceland's banking system, then spread principally to Portugal, Italy, Ireland, Greece, and Spain in 2009, leading to the promotion of a fairly offensive moniker ([PIIGS](/piigs)). It has prompted a loss of confidence in European businesses and economies.

The crisis was eventually controlled by the financial guarantees of European countries, who feared the collapse of the euro and financial contagion, and by the International Monetary Fund (IMF). Rating agencies downgraded several Eurozone countries' debts.

Greece's debt was, at a certain point, moved to junk status. Countries receiving bailout funds were required to meet [austerity measures](/austerity) intended to slow down the growth of public-area debt as part of the loan agreements.

## Debt Crisis Contributing Causes

A portion of the contributing causes included the financial crisis of 2007 to 2008, the [Great Recession](/great-recession) of 2008 to 2012, the real estate market crisis, and property [bubbles](/bubble) in several countries. The fringe states' fiscal policies regarding government expenses and incomes likewise contributed.

Toward the finish of 2009, the fringe Eurozone member states of Greece, Spain, Ireland, Portugal, and Cyprus couldn't repay or refinance their government debt or bail out their overwhelmed banks without the assistance of third-party financial institutions. These included the [European Central Bank](/europeancentralbank) (ECB), the IMF, and, eventually, the [European Financial Stability Facility](/european-financial-stability-facility) (EFSF).

Likewise in 2009, Greece revealed that its previous government had terribly underreported its budget deficit, signifying a violation of EU policy and spurring fears of an euro collapse by means of political and financial contagion.

Seventeen Eurozone countries voted to make the EFSF in 2010, specifically to address and help with the crisis. The European sovereign debt crisis topped somewhere in the range of 2010 and 2012.

With increasing fear of extreme [sovereign debt](/sovereign-debt), lenders demanded higher [interest rates](/interestrate) from Eurozone states in 2010, with high debt and deficit levels making it harder for these countries to finance their budget deficits when they were confronted with overall low economic growth. A few impacted countries increased government rates and sliced expenditures to combat the crisis, which contributed to social bombshell within their boundaries and a crisis of confidence in leadership, particularly in Greece.

Several of these countries, including Greece, Portugal, and Ireland had their sovereign debt downgraded to junk status by international credit rating agencies during this crisis, worsening investor fears.

A 2012 report for the United States Congress stated the following:

>
> The Eurozone debt crisis started in late 2009 when another Greek government revealed that previous governments had been misreporting government budget data. Surprisingly high deficit levels disintegrated investor confidence causing [bond](/bond) spreads to rise to unsustainable levels. Fears immediately spread that the fiscal positions and debt levels of a number of Eurozone countries were unsustainable.

## Greek Example of European Crisis

In mid 2010, the advancements were thought about in rising spreads [sovereign bond](/sovereignbond) yields between the impacted fringe member states of Greece, Ireland, Portugal, Spain, and most outstandingly, Germany.

The Greek yield separated with Greece needing Eurozone assistance by May 2010. Greece received several bailouts from the EU and IMF throughout the following a long time in exchange for the adoption of EU-commanded austerity measures to cut public spending and a critical increase in taxes. The country's economic recession continued. These measures, along with the economic situation, caused social distress. With partitioned political and fiscal leadership, Greece confronted [sovereign default](/sovereign-default) in June 2015.

The Greek residents voted against a bailout and further EU austerity measures the following month. This decision raised the possibility that Greece could leave the European Monetary Union (EMU) completely.

The withdrawal of a nation from the EMU would have been extraordinary, and in the event that Greece had returned to using the Drachma, the speculated effects on its economy ranged from total economic collapse to a surprise recovery.

In the end, Greece remained part of the EMU and started to give indications of recovery in subsequent years slowly. Unemployment dropped from its high of more than 27% to 16% in five years, while annual GDP when from negative numbers to a projected rate of north of two percent in that equivalent time.

## "Brexit" and the European Crisis

In June 2016, the United Kingdom voted to leave the European Union in a mandate. This vote powered Eurosceptics across the continent, and speculation took off that different countries would leave the EU. After a somewhat long negotiation process, Brexit occurred at 11pm Greenwich Mean Time, Jan. 31, 2020, and didn't encourage any groundswell of sentiment in different countries to depart the EMU.

It's a common discernment that this movement developed during the debt crisis, and missions have portrayed the EU as a "sinking ship." The UK mandate sent shock waves through the economy. Investors escaped to safety, pushing several government yields to a negative value, and the British pound was at its lowest against the dollar since 1985. The S&P 500 and Dow Jones plunged, then recuperated in the following a long time until they hit all-time highs as investors ran out of investment options in light of the negative [yields](/bond-yield).

## Italy and the European Debt Crisis

A combination of market volatility triggered by Brexit, sketchy performance of lawmakers, and an ineffectively managed financial system demolished the situation for Italian banks in mid-2016. A staggering 17% of Italian loans, roughly $400 billion worth, were junk, and the banks required a huge bailout.

A full collapse of the Italian banks is seemingly a greater risk to the European economy than a Greek, Spanish, or Portuguese collapse since Italy's economy is a lot bigger. Italy has more than once requested help from the EU, however the EU as of late introduced "[bail-in](/bailin)" rules that preclude countries from bailing out financial institutions with citizen cash without investors taking the principal loss. Germany has been certain that the EU won't twist these rules for Italy.

## Further Effects

Ireland followed Greece in requiring a bailout in November 2010, with Portugal following in May 2011. Italy and Spain were additionally powerless. Spain and Cyprus required official assistance in June 2012.

The situation in Ireland, Portugal, and Spain had worked on by 2014, due to different fiscal changes, domestic austerity measures, and other unique economic factors. Notwithstanding, the road to full economic recovery is anticipated to be a long one with an emerging banking crisis in Italy, instabilities that Brexit might trigger, and the economic impact of the COVID-19 episode as potential troubles to survive.
