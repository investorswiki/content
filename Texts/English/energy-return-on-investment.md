# Energy Return on Investment (EROI)
## What Is Energy Return on Investment (EROI)?

Energy Return on Investment (EROI) is a ratio for depicting a measure of energy delivered corresponding to the energy used to make it. For example the ratio would represent how much energy is utilized to find, separate, deliver, and refine crude oil relative to how much useable energy is made.

The energy return on investment (EROI) is a key determinant of the price of energy since sources of energy that can be tapped relatively efficiently will allow the price to stay low.

## Understanding Energy Return on Investment

EROI is important since, supposing that the cost of an energy plant is more than the revenues gained from selling power, that plant isn't economically feasible. EROI can also assist organizations and state run administrations with looking at changed energy sources for profitability, like nuclear versus sunlight based power.

At the point when the EROI is large, that means that delivering energy from that source is relatively simple and cost-effective. Nonetheless, when the number is small, getting energy from that source is troublesome and costly. For instance, when the ratio is 1, there is no return on energy invested. As per the World Nuclear Association, the break-even number is 7.

In its least complex form, EROI is calculated as:

> **EROI = Energy Output/Energy Input**

Notwithstanding, there are emotional differences in how certain means of the info cycle are measured. This measurement is complex on the grounds that the data sources are different and there is uncertainty concerning the way in which far back they ought to be taken in the analysis. Notwithstanding energy costs, there are other external costs that should be considered with respect to energy production, for example, those associated with the environment and individuals' health.

Generally, we can expect that the highest accessible EROI energy sources will be utilized first in light of the fact that these offer the most energy for the least exertion. A net energy gain is accomplished by consuming less energy while endeavoring to get and utilize a source of energy. EROI analysis is viewed as part of a [life-cycle analysis](/industrylifecycleanalysis).

## Types of Energy Sources Where EROI Is Measured

There are a number of consumable energy sources where not entirely settled for productivity and cost analysis. These energy sources incorporate oil, biofuels, geothermal energy, nuclear fuels, coal, sun based, wind, and hydroelectric.

The average EROI across all generating advancements is around 40 for the United States, as indicated by the World Nuclear Association pages refered to above. The Association refers to a study by Weissback et al. (2013), which states that "The outcomes show that nuclear, hydro, coal, and natural gas power systems (in a specific order) are one order of greatness more effective than photovoltaics and wind power."

As indicated by the U.S. Energy Information Administration, petroleum derivatives like coal, petroleum, and natural gas, have been the significant sources of energy since the late 1800s. Until the 1990s, hydropower and strong biomass were the most utilized environmentally friendly power resources. From that point forward, the amount of energy coming from biofuels, sun based, and wind energy has increased.

The EROI for oil has diminished dramatically throughout recent years. The amount of energy required to deliver one barrel of oil has diminished as additional efficient methods, for example, [fracking](/fracking), have been presented.

## Features
- Energy Return on Investment (EROI) is the amount of energy used to deliver a certain amount of net energy.
- EROI is an important determinant in energy commodity and power pricing.
- EROI diminishes when energy becomes more difficult to find and more challenging to concentrate or deliver.
