# Trust Indenture Act of 1939
## What Is the Trust Indenture Act (TIA) of 1939?

The Trust Indenture Act (TIA) of 1939 is a law that restricted bond issues valued more than $10 million from being offered available to be purchased without a formal written agreement (a [indenture](/indenture)). Both the bond issuer and the bondholder must sign the indenture, and it must completely uncover the specifics of the bond issue. It likewise expects that a trustee be designated for all bond issues so the rights of bondholders are not compromised.

In 2015, the SEC concluded a rule change that increased the reporting threshold to issues more than $50 million.

## Understanding the Trust Indenture Act (TIA) of 1939

Congress passed the Trust Indenture Act of 1939 to safeguard bond investors. It denies the sale of any debt securities in a public offering except if they are issued under a qualified indenture. The [Securities and Exchange Commission](/sec) (SEC) directs the TIA.

The Trust Indenture Act was acquainted as an amendment with the [Securities Act of 1933](/securitiesact1933) to make indenture trustees more proactive in their jobs. It puts a few obligations straightforwardly on them, like reporting requirements.

TIA was expected to address flaws in the trustee system. For instance, trustees' passive actions blocked collective bondholder action before the TIA. Individual bondholders could theoretically force action yet frequently provided that they could distinguish different bondholders who might act with them. Collective action was much of the time impractical given the wide geographical distribution of all bondholders of an issue. With the act, trustees are required to make a rundown of the investors accessible so they can speak with one another.

The TIA of 1939 gave investors more meaningful rights, including the right for an individual bondholder to independently seek after legal action to receive payment. The TIA expects that the employed trustee be free of irreconcilable situations including the issuer.

The trustee must likewise make semiannual revelations of relevant data to the securities holders. On the off chance that a bond issuer becomes [insolvent](/indebtedness), the designated trustee might reserve the option to hold onto the bond issuer's assets. The trustee can then sell the assets to recover the bondholders' investments.

## Requirements for Bond Issuers

Debt issuers are expected to unveil the terms under which a security is issued with a formal written agreement known as a [trust indenture](/trust_indenture). A trust indenture is a contract placed into by a bond issuer and an independent trustee to safeguard the interests of bondholders. The SEC must support this document.

The trust indenture features the terms and conditions that the issuer, lender, and trustee must stick to during the life of the bond. Any protective or restrictive contracts, for example, [call provisions](/callprovision), must be remembered for the indenture.

Securities that are not subject to regulation under the Securities Act of 1933 are exempt from the Trust Indenture Act of 1939. For instance, [municipal bonds](/municipalbond) are exempt from the TIA. Securities registration requirements don't matter to bonds issued during a company reorganization or recapitalization.

As indicated by the SEC, raising the interest rate on outstanding convertible bonds to deter transformations doesn't likewise need enrolling the securities once more. Notwithstanding, bonds of rearranged companies and convertible bonds with increased interest rates keep on falling under the provisions of the Trust Indenture Act.
