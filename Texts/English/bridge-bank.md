# Bridge Bank
## What Is a Bridge Bank?

A bridge bank is an institution that has been authorized by a national regulator or national bank to operate a [insolvent](/insolvency) bank until a buyer can be found.

A bridge bank is accused of holding the assets and liabilities of the failed bank until the bank becomes dissolvable once more — either through acquisition by another entity or through [liquidation](/liquidate).

A bridge bank is normally settled by a publicly supported deposit insurance association, for example, the [Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation](/fdic) (FDIC), or a financial regulator. In the United States, the FDIC was given authority to charter these impermanent banks by the Competitive Equality Banking Act (CEBA) of 1987.

## How a Bridge Bank Works

The FDIC has the authority, utilizing a bridge bank, to operate a failed bank until a buyer can be found. Bridge banks might be employed to stay away from systemic financial risk to a nation's economy or credit markets and to mollify creditors and depositors trying to stay away from negative effects, like frenzies and [bank runs](/bankrun).

A bridge bank is intended to be a brief measure — subsequently, the term "bridge." A bridge bank gives the time expected to a wiped out bank to find a buyer so the indebted bank can be absorbed under another ownership structure. In the case that a wiped out bank can't find a buyer or effect a bailout, the bridge bank will control its liquidation with the assistance of the fitting bankruptcy court.

By and large, a bridge bank won't surpass the a few years designated for a ruined bank to track down a buyer or to liquidate. (In the U.S., this must happen in no less than two years, which can be extended for cause by an extra year.)

Notwithstanding, on the off chance that a bridge bank demonstrates fruitless in its slowing down task, a national regulatory or national deposit insurer might step in as the receiver of the ruined bank's assets. For instance, the bridge bank might be required to contact the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency of its intent to disintegrate the bridge bank. In this situation, the FDIC is selected as the receiver of the bridge bank's assets.

## Functions of a Bridge Bank

The primary job of a bridge bank is to accommodate the consistent change from bank insolvency to proceeded with operations. In the U.S., under CEBA, if a FDIC-safeguarded bank is in financial difficulty (facing bank disappointment or insolvency), the FDIC can lay out a bridge bank to perform these functions:

1. Accept the deposits of the closed bank;
1. Accept such different liabilities of the closed bank as the Corporation, in the Corporation's watchfulness, may determine to be proper;
1. Purchase such assets of the closed bank as the Corporation, in the Corporation's watchfulness, may determine to be fitting; and
1. Perform whatever other impermanent function which the Corporation might endorse as per this Act.

In the U.S., all bridge banks must be chartered as national banks (as per U.S. banking law). Bridge banks are tasked with regarding all customer commitments of the failed bank; most eminently, not intruding on or terminating enough got loans.

Bridge banks are authorized to try to liquidate failed banks, either by finding buyers for the bank as a going concern or by liquidating its arrangement of assets, in something like two years, which can be extended for cause by an extra year.
