# Fixed-for-Fixed Swaps
## What Is a Fixed-for-Fixed Swap?

A fixed-for-fixed swap alludes to a type of [foreign currency swap](/foreign-currency-swaps) in which two gatherings exchange currencies with each other. In this agreement, the two players pay each other a [fixed interest rate](/fixedinterestrate) on the [principal](/principal) amount. A fixed-for-fixed swap can be utilized to exploit situations where interest rates in different countries are less expensive.

A fixed-for-fixed swap might be diverged from a [fixed-for-floating](/fixed_floatswap) swap, where fixed interest payments in a single currency are exchanged for floating interest payments in another. In a fixed-for floating swap, the principal amount of the underlying loan isn't exchanged.

## How Fixed-for-Fixed Swaps Work

Currency swaps happen between two foreign elements. The gatherings basically swap principal and interest payments on a loan in one [currency](/currency) for those in another currency. One of the gatherings engaged with the agreement borrows currency from one more while lending an alternate currency to that party. Foreign currency swaps come in fixed-for-floating and fixed-for-fixed swaps.

The gatherings engaged with a fixed-for-fixed swap — who are likewise called counterparties — go into an agreement, paying each other interest at a fixed rate. So one party consents to exchange fixed [interest](/interest) payments in a single currency for interest at a fixed rate in another. This means one party utilizes its own currency to buy funds in the foreign currency.

Foreign currency swaps — including fixed-for-fixed swaps — permit substances to get loans at better interest rates than if they somehow managed to go straightforwardly for [financing](/financing) in the foreign [capital markets](/capitalmarkets).

## Benefits of Fixed-for-Fixed Swaps

To comprehend how investors benefit from these types of arrangements, consider a situation where each party has a [comparative advantage](/comparativeadvantage) to apply for a line of credit at a certain rate and currency. For instance, an American firm can apply for a line of credit in the United States at a 7% interest rate, yet requires a loan in [yen](/jpy-japanese-yen) to finance an expansion project in Japan, where the interest rate is 10%. Simultaneously, a Japanese firm wishes to finance an expansion project in the U.S., however the interest rate is 12%, compared to the 9% interest rate in Japan.

Each party can benefit from the other's interest rate through a fixed-for-fixed [currency swap](/currencyswap). In this case, the U.S. firm can borrow U.S. dollars for 7%, then loan the funds to the Japanese firm at 7%. The Japanese firm can borrow Japanese yen at 9%, then, at that point, loan the funds to the U.S. firm for a similar amount.

## Fixed-for-Fixed versus Fixed-for-Floating Swaps

As verified above, there are two primary sorts of currency swaps — fixed-for-endlessly fixed for-floating swaps. Fixed-for-floating swaps include two gatherings where one swaps interest on a loan at a fixed rate, while the other one pays interest at a floating rate. Not at all like the fixed-for-fixed swap, the principal portion on the fixed-for-floating swap isn't exchanged. One of the primary reasons parties go into this agreement assuming the floating interest rate is lower than the fixed rate that is being paid.
