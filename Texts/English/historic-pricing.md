# Historic Pricing
## What Is Historic Pricing?

Historic pricing is a unit pricing method used to compute the value of a [asset](/asset) utilizing the last [valuation](/valuation) point calculated. Historic pricing is utilized when the value of an asset doesn't refresh in real time.

## Grasping Historic Pricing

Historic pricing outlines the significance of understanding when assets have last had their values calculated, whether at one point or at different points during the trading day or in real time. This is known as the valuation point. On the off chance that an investor ends up trading at the specific point that the [net asset value](/nav) (NAV) is calculated, then, at that point, they don't need to consider gaps in time as part of their [investment strategy](/investmentstrategy).

Nonetheless, on the off chance that an investor trades the asset before or after the net asset value still up in the air, they will be working off an old (old) value. This means that there might be the risk that the estimated valuation whereupon the trading decision was based is, truth be told, wrong.

[Mutual funds](/mutualfund) commonly update their net asset values toward the finish of the trading day. [Fund managers](/fundmanager) have two options: they can take a gander at the last calculated net asset value (otherwise called the historic valuation point), or they can note the net asset value of the next valuation point.

An investor hoping to buy a fund in light of historic pricing knows the number of [shares](/shares) can be purchased for a certain amount of money on the grounds that the valuation point is known. Thusly, sellers know precisely how much money they can get for a specific number of shares. The buyer's risk is that the net asset value of the fund really diminishes by the next valuation point, implying that they will have spent erring on a particular number of shares. The risk for the seller is that the shares increase in value at the next valuation point, implying that the seller doesn't get as much cash-flow for a given number of shares.

## Forward Pricing versus Historic Pricing

[Forward pricing](/fowardpricing) is the net asset value calculation method utilized the most. Forward pricing includes processing buy and sell orders for shares of unconditional mutual funds at the net asset value as of the next market close.

Prominently, [open-finished mutual funds](/open-endfund) revalue their assets upon the close of the trading day. Buyers are in a difficult situation since they don't have the foggiest idea the number of fund shares can be purchased. This pricing mechanism guarantees that the shares are bought and sold at a price that all the more precisely mirrors the changes in the fund that might have happened since the previous valuation.

## Features
- Forward pricing of NAV is utilized more much of the time than historic pricing.
- Investors utilizing historic pricing can precisely register the total number of shares or units that a certain dollar amount will buy, however runs the risk the last valuation will be lifeless.
- Historic pricing is a method for computing an investment's net asset value (NAV) in view of changes from its previous valuation.
