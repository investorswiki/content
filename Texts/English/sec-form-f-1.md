# SEC Form F-1
## What Is SEC Form F-1?

SEC Form F-1 is a filing with the [Securities and Exchange Commission](/sec) (SEC) required for the registration of certain securities by foreign issuers. SEC Form F-1 is required to register securities issued by foreign issuers for which no other specialized form exists or is authorized.

## Understanding SEC Form F-1

Form F-1, which is also known as a Registration Statement, is a requirement under the Securities Exchange Act of 1933. This act⁠ — often referred to as "reality in securities" law⁠ — requires that these forms, giving essential facts, are filed to disclose important endless supply of a company's securities. Form F-1 helps the SEC accomplish the objectives of this act. Foreign issuers, with which domestic investors might be less familiar, are required to disclose significant information in regards to securities offered to limit or forestall fraud.

The instructions for Form F-1 are extensive, yet the bulk of the filing centers around summary information about the business, risk factors, management and compensation, financial statements and notes to the statements, material changes with respect to accounting in the financial statements, and details on the securities offering. Any amendments or changes which must be made by the foreign issuer are filed under Form F-1/A ("A" denotes amendment).

> After the foreign issuer's securities are issued, the company is required to file [Form 20-F](/sec-form-20-f) yearly with the SEC.
