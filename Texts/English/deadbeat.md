## Deadbeats Can Still Generate Revenue for Credit Card Companies

How could a credit card company need a deadbeat as a customer on the off chance that they don't earn interest or late fees from them?

Since credit card companies actually earn money from deadbeats. One way they bring in money is that merchants pay around 3% of each credit card transaction in fees to the credit card company.

For instance, assume a deadbeat charges $2,000 on their card. Then, assuming they pay that balance in full and on time and don't permit the credit company to charge 10% to 30% in annual interest, the credit card company actually earns money. How? Since the company makes $60 from the deadbeat customer through the 3% fees that the merchant pays on the $2,000 charges.

They use credit cards for the convenience and consumer protections they offer. They likewise use them for the grace period that allows them to keep their cash in their bank accounts between the time they charge a purchase and the time the credit card bill is due.

This grace period is for the most part around three weeks. Another explanation nonrevolvers or deadbeats like utilizing credit cards are the awards programs. What's more, since deadbeats don't carry a balance and pay no interest, a rewards card that offers 1% to 5% back on purchases means a deadbeat can bring in money from utilizing a credit card.
