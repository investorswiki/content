## What is a Private Investment Fund?

A private investment fund is an investment company that doesn't request capital from retail investors or the overall population. Individuals from a private investment company normally have deep information on the industry as well as investments somewhere else. To be classified as a private fund, a fund must meet one of the exemptions illustrated in the [Investment Company Act of 1940](/investmentcompanyact). The [3C1](/3c1) or [3C7](/3c7) exemptions inside the Act are much of the time used to lay out a fund as a private investment fund. There is an advantage to keeping up with private investment fund status, as the regulatory and legal requirements are a lot of lower than what is required for funds that are traded publicly.

## Understanding a Private Investment Fund

Private funds are supposed to meet certain criteria to keep their status. Generally, the requirements limit both the number and type of investors that can claim shares in the fund. In the U.S., under the previously mentioned Investment Company Act of 1940, a 3C1 fund can have up to 100 [accredited investors](/accreditedinvestor), and a 3C7 fund can have a soft limit of around 2,000 qualified investors. Both the definition of qualified and accredited investor accompany individual wealth tests. Accredited investors need to have more than $1 million in net worth without counting their primary residence or potentially $200,000 in annual income for an individual and $300,000 for a couple. Qualified investors need to hold assets in excess of $5 million.

## Why Funds Stay Private

A private investment fund might decide to remain private for a number of reasons. As referenced, the regulations around private investment funds are a lot looser than for public funds. Private investment funds appreciate more freedom by they way they handle all that from reporting to [redemptions](/reclamation). This permits private investment funds to take a gander at illiquid investments that a public fund would evade due to the hardships of standard valuation and liquidation on account of rising recoveries. Many hedge funds are private investment funds so they can keep on utilizing aggressive trading strategies that the manager of a public fund would stay away from due to the potential for investor lawsuits coming about because of irrational gamble taking. In particular, there is no public reporting of positions for private investment funds, which permits them to try not to show their cards to the market and eroding the profitability of a subtly constructed position.

Notwithstanding investment flexibility, private investment funds can be vehicles of decision for dealing with huge family wealth. Very wealthy families can make private investment funds to invest the wealth with the family individuals as shareholders. Frequently a company fills in as the initial structure for this arrangement, and it is reused to make a capital investment arm from the profits of the business. In this case, the family doesn't need or need outside capital, so there is no incentive to take the fund public.
