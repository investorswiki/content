## What Is an Adjustment Bureau?

An adjustment bureau is an organization that spotlights on assisting businesses with collecting outstanding debts from delinquent debtors.

The [Fair Debt Collection Practices Act](/fair-debt-collection-practices-act-fdcpa) (FDCPA) is the primary federal law administering debt collection practices in the United States.

- Freedom from debt collection calls that cost the debtor toll calls;
- Limits on the times of day at which debt collectors can call debtors;

Many states likewise have laws managing the collection practices adjustment bureaus might utilize. The FDCPA directs that in the case that a state law is more restrictive than the federal law in overseeing debt collection practices, the more restrictive state law will be applied.
