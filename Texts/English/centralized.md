# Centralized
Local area submission - Author: **John Ma**

The concept of centralization connects with the distribution of power and authority in an organization or a network. At the point when a system is centralized, it means that the planning and dynamic mechanisms are packed in a specific point inside the system.
A governance mechanism is required in any system. Any other way, no choices can be made that provide guidance to the remainder of the network. The level of governance can go from setting out the primary rules to continuously hovering over each function of the system.
In a centralized system, a central point of power approves and upholds choices, which are then passed down to bring down tiers of power.
Something contrary to a centralized system is a decentralized system, where choices are made in a distributed way without the coordination of a central authority.
The key inquiry in the discussion of centralization versus decentralization is whether the specifics of navigation ought to occur at a central point in the network, or be designated away from any central authority.
There can be several **advantages** of centralization:
- Long-term strategy can be firmly controlled.
- Obligations are clear cut inside the system.
- Independent direction is fast and clear.
- The central power has an interest in the flourishing of the whole network.

A portion of the **disadvantages** of centralization can be:
- Miscommunication and errors between the center and different spots.
- High chance of corruption.
- Requirement to hold power at the high level.
- Rejects entertainers at the neighborhood level with specific information or ability.

Before the introduction of Bitcoin, it was generally accepted to be difficult to design a decentralized network where consensus is accomplished without critical downsides.
In any case, with the presentation of Bitcoin, a decentralized network has turned into a substantial alternative to centralized ones. This made the discussion among centralized and decentralized more intricate and given a possible alternative to the existing power structures.
