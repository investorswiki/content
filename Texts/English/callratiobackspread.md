# Call Ratio Backspread
## What Is a Call Ratio Backspread?

A call ratio backspread is an options spreading strategy that bullish investors use assuming they accept the underlying security or stock will rise overwhelmingly while restricting losses. The strategy consolidates purchasing a greater number of call options to sell a lesser number of calls at an alternate [strike](/strikeprice) however same expiration date. While the downside is protected, gains can be huge assuming the underlying security mobilizes altogether due to the [ratio feature](/ratiospread). The ratio of long to short calls is typically 2:1, 3:2, or 3:1.

A call ratio backspread can measure up to a [put ratio backspread](/putratiobackspread), which is bearish and utilizes puts rather than call options.

## Grasping Call Ratio Backspreads

A call ratio [backspread](/backspread) is generally made by selling, or composing, one call option and afterward utilizing the collected premium to purchase a greater number of call options with a similar expiration at a higher strike price. This strategy has possibly unlimited upside profit on the grounds that the trader is holding more long call options than short ones. An investor utilizing a call ratio backspread investing strategy would sell less calls at a low strike price and buy more calls at a high strike price. The most common ratios utilized in this strategy are one in-the-money short call combined with two out-of-the-money long calls or two out-of-the-money short calls combined with three in-the-money long calls. In the event that this strategy is laid out at a credit, the trader stands to make a small gain assuming the price of the underlying security diminishes dramatically.

For survey, a [call option](/calloption) gives the option buyer the right, yet not the obligation, to buy a stock at a predetermined price inside a specific time span. In the event that an investor buys a call option with a strike price of $10 while the stock is trading at $10, the option is considered at-the-money. If the stock rises to $15, the call option brings in money. On the off chance that the underlying stock tumbles to $5, the investor loses just the premium paid for the call option and never possesses the stock.

To finance the premium for purchasing the call options, the investor sells a call option that is in-the-money or below the current stock price. So an investor could sell one call option at a strike price of $13 while the current price of the stock trades at $15 in the market. By selling the call option, the investor gets compensated a credit for the premium of the option. The credit offsets the premium paid for buying the call options at the $17 strike price. The offset in premiums could be a partial offset or the credit received could surpass the premium paid for the call options. The premiums charged rely upon many factors including the volatility of the stock price.

## Utilizing Ratio Backspreads

Backspread strategies are intended to benefit from [trend reversals](/inversion) or tremendous changes or moves in the market. Call ratio backspread strategies benefit most extraordinarily from a rally in the [underlying security](/underlying-security). The goal of the strategy is for the underlying to rise over the strike price of the purchased call options. In a perfect world, the price needs to go high to the point of making up for any premium paid for the call options. In any case, the sale of the option that is in-the-money is set to pay the investor a credit to offset or finance the purchase of the call options.

Utilizing the model over, the investor would believe that the stock price should rise from $15 to well over the $17 (the strike price for the call options) and earn enough to more than pay for any premium for purchasing the call options.

Call ratio back spread strategies are intended to benefit from expansions in market [volatility](/volatility). Investors typically utilize them when they accept financial markets are ready to move higher. By at the same time buying and selling call options, traders can hedge their downside risk, while benefiting from the upside as markets gain. Backspread strategies can be utilized on a standalone basis, to "go long" the market. On the other hand, they can be utilized as part of a bigger or more complex investing position.

## Illustration of a Call Ratio Backspread

Note that the model below factors no commissions from a broker, which should be considered before executing any strategy.

Suppose you're an investor who's bullish on the stock of XYZ Company and you accept the stock could rise fundamentally in the short term.

- XYZ Company stock is trading at $20 per share in the market currently.
- Call options with a strike price of $20 (at-the-money) currently trade with a premium of $2 each. You buy two [option contracts](/optionscontract) by which each contract is 100 options for a cost of $400 altogether.
- The second leg of the strategy includes you selling one in-the-money call option. Call options for a strike price of $16 are currently trading at $6 each. You sell one call option at a strike price of $16 and receive a credit for $600 to your account.
- You have a net credit of $200 for the strategy initially in light of the fact that you paid $400 for buying the two at-the-money call options while you received $600 for selling the one in-the-money option.
- On the off chance that the stock rises to $22 by expiry, you earn $2 on the two call options you purchased for a total of $400 (or 2 contracts at 100 options each increased by $2).
- In any case, the call option you sold will get exercised, and you'll sell the stock at $16 while the market is at $22 for a $6 loss. The $6 is duplicated by 100 contracts (the one call option) yielding a $600 loss.
- Your net is the $600 loss minus the $400 you earned plus the $200 credit that you received initially for a gain of zero or breakeven.

In the above model, the stock price needs to move high enough by which you bring in sufficient money on the two at-the-money call options combined with the initial credit to more than offset any loss from the one in-the-money option that you initially sold.

Suppose in the model; the stock moved to $26 by expiry.

- You would earn $6 on the two call options for a total of $1,200 (200 duplicated by $6).
- The call option that you sold would have a loss of $10 ($16 strike - $26) or $1,000 in light of the fact that $6 duplicated by the 100 contracts would yield a loss of $1,000 for the one option sold.
- Notwithstanding, your net gain would be $400 on the grounds that your $1,000 loss is deducted from your $1,200 gain on the two options purchased plus the $200 earned from the initial credit.

Suppose in the model; the stock moved to $10 by expiry.

- The two options that you bought would terminate worthless since you wouldn't exercise the option to buy at $20 when the price is trading at $10 in the market.
- Essentially, the call option that you sold wouldn't get exercised on the grounds that nobody would buy at $16 on the off chance that they can buy the stock at $10 in the market.
- In short, you would earn the initial credit of $200 and the two options would terminate worthless.

## Call Ratio Backspread versus Put Ratio Backspread

A put ratio backspread is a bearish [options](/option) trading strategy that joins short puts and long puts to make a position whose profit and loss potential relies upon the ratio of these puts. A put ratio backspread is supposed in light of the fact that it tries to profit from the volatility of the underlying stock, and consolidates short and long puts in a certain ratio at the watchfulness of the options investor.

The put ratio spread is like call ratio spread, however rather than buying at least two call options and selling one call option to finance the strategy, you would buy several put options and sell one put option to assist with funding the purchase of the two puts.

In the event that the stock goes down overwhelmingly, the strategy earns money from the two puts to offset any loss from the one put that was sold.
