# Stock Ahead
## What is Stock Ahead?

Stock ahead alludes to a situation where an order is placed, however not executed, due to a formerly sent order including a similar price. Contingent upon the [exchange's](/exchange) priority rules, this can likewise happen when two offers or offers are made with indistinguishable prices. The orders are placed in a line, and are filled by the exchange's priority rules when liquidity at that price is available.

## Understanding Stock Ahead

Stock ahead alludes to the line of orders waiting to be executed. Five traders might place a [limit order](/limitorder) at a similar price. Their orders form a setup. The person who placed their order initially is the front of the line, and will be [filled](/fill) first when liquidity is available costing that much. The subsequent order received will be filled second, and the third order, third, etc. Anybody who isn't preferred choice has "stock ahead" of them that requirements to filled before their order is filled.

Various exchanges have different priority rules. Some depend on the time in which orders are received, like [Nasdaq](/nasdaq), as referenced previously. This is genuinely direct: the primary person at that price gets filled first when shares are available.

Different markets might utilize a hybrid system. For instance, on the [New York Stock Exchange](/nyse) (NYSE), the principal person in line gets a large portion of the shares, however different orders at that level likewise get a few shares. For instance, there might be five sellers on the [offer](/inquire). On the off chance that a market buy order comes in, the preferred choice gets the most, yet the other four sell orders likewise get a small piece of the buy order (filling or to some extent filling their sell order).

Stock ahead ordinarily alludes to limit orders where a specific price is mentioned. [Market orders](/marketorder) will fill at any price available, normally quickly, and consequently have no stock ahead of them. There are priority rules for that also, which will shift by exchange, assuming two market orders are received at precisely the same time. NYSE executes the greater order first.

## Illustration of Stock Ahead on Nasdaq

Bert places a limit order to sell 100 shares of Apple (AAPL) stock for $250 per share. While his order is waiting, Ernie sends a limit order to sell 1,000 shares of Apple stock at a similar cost. At the point when the price ascends to approach $250, expect that somebody places a buy order for 100 shares at $250.

Since the buy order is for 100 shares, and Bert was selling at $250 first, his 100 shares will be filled. Ernie is left selling his 1,000 shares at $250, however he is currently preferred choice. Apple is listed on the Nasdaq stock exchange, which takes care of requests in view of the time they are received.

Assuming that Jill places an order to sell 500 shares at $250, she should hold on until Ernie can sell his 1,000 shares. Whenever somebody has bought the 1,000 shares from Ernie, then Jill will get filled with subsequent buy orders (to fill her sell order). Until this occurs, Jill has stock ahead of her.
