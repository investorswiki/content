# Super-Prime Credit
## What Is Super-Prime Credit?

Super-prime credit is a credit score that is at the highest end of a credit bureau's score range. Consumers with super-prime credit are considered to have brilliant credit and represent the least risk to lenders and [creditors](/creditor). Credit card companies and lenders offer their best credit cards and loans with the least interest rates and most good terms to consumers with super-prime credit since they are viewed as the most minimal risk consumers.

## Seeing Super-Prime Credit

Every one of the three major credit bureaus — Equifax, Experian, and TransUnion — has its own [credit score](/credit_score) range. For Equifax, it's 280 to 850. Experian's reach is 330 to 830. TransUnion is 150 to 950. Having super-prime credit means having a score close to the highest point of these reaches.

Experian, for instance, considers a credit score of 740 or above to be super-prime. Consumers with marginally lower scores, in the 680 to 739 score range, are viewed as prime borrowers and are additionally offered generally excellent terms, however their interest rates might be somewhat higher than whatever super-prime borrowers pay.

## Super-Prime Credit Interest Rates

By and large, consumers with super-prime credit will approach better loan terms and lower interest rates. For instance, in the event that a super-prime borrower can get a car loan at a [annual percentage rate](/apr) (APR) of 2.7%, a prime borrower could get a similar loan at 3.1% APR. A large portion of the new credit and loans that banks issue go to super-endlessly prime borrowers in light of the fact that these consumers are the probably going to repay what they owe. In markets where credit is tight, super-prime borrowers are bound to hold access to credit than subprime, close prime, and in some cases even [prime borrowers](/prime-borrower).

A consumer's credit score and classification as super-prime, prime, close prime, or [subprime](/subprime) can shift by the credit bureau for two reasons. One, the consumer's credit file with every bureau might have to some degree different data since certain lenders just report to a couple of the three bureaus. Two, every bureau involves an alternate method for computing credit scores. Therefore, a consumer that one bureau characterizes as super-prime may be classified as prime by another bureau.

## Qualities of People With Super-Prime Credit

In Aug. 2019, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) delivered its biennial report, "The Consumer Credit Card Market." The 193-page report records different realities in regards to Americans who have super-prime credit scores, which it characterizes as a credit score of 720 or higher. The report incorporates data that may be valuable to anybody hoping to join the elite positions of those consumers with the highest scores.

### Average Debt

The CFPB report showed super-prime cardholders had an average 2018 year-end balance on their broadly useful cards of about $5,000. This is essentially not as much as consumers with prime credit, who had an average balance of around $9,000. For [private label](/private-label-credit) or store-marked credit cards, super-prime cardholders averaged somewhat more than $1,000 in debt while close prime cardholders averaged about $2,000 in debt.

### Consumer Cardholding

Around 95% of super-prime cardholders have something like one credit card and on average they have four open credit card accounts. Of course, credit card companies showed a preference for giving credit to super-prime consumers, giving them close to half of all new credit cards.

In spite of approaching expanding credit, consumers with amazing credit don't [max out their credit cards](/credit_limit). The CFPB report showed that the greater part of the growth in accessible credit is represented by unused lines on accounts held by consumers with super-prime scores.

### Revolving Rates

The CFPB report sorts credit card accounts as by the same token "executing" or "revolving." Cardholders who pay off their accounts in full before the next credit cycle starts (and in this manner try not to pile up interest charges) fall into the executing category. Cardholders who don't pay their accounts in full and permit balances to carry over are in the [revolving](/revolvingcredit) category.

The majority of consumers with brilliant credit pay their full credit card balance every month. Just 30% of super-prime borrowers permitted a balance to carry over to the next month, compared to almost 70% of prime accounts, 80% of close prime accounts, and around 90% of subprime or deep subprime accounts.
