# Variable Cost-Plus Pricing
## What Is Variable Cost-Plus Pricing?

Variable cost-plus pricing is a pricing method by which the selling price is laid out by adding a [markup](/markup) to total [variable costs](/variablecost). The expectation is that the markup will add to meeting all or a part of the [fixed costs](/fixedcost) and yield some level of [profit](/profit). Variable cost-plus pricing is particularly valuable in competitive situations, for example, [contract bidding](/competitivebid), yet it isn't suitable in circumstances where fixed costs are a major part of total costs.

## How Variable Cost-Plus Pricing Works

Variable costs incorporate direct labor, direct materials, and different expenses that change in relation to production output. A firm utilizing the variable cost-plus pricing method would initially compute the variable costs per unit, then, at that point, add an increase to cover fixed costs per unit and create a targeted profit margin.

For instance, expect that total variable costs for manufacturing one unit of a product are $10. The firm gauges that fixed costs per unit are $4. To cover the fixed costs and leave a profit for each unit of $1, the firm would price the unit at $15.

> This type of pricing method is simply internal looking. It doesn't integrate benchmarking with contenders' prices or consider how the market sees the price of a thing.

## When to Use Variable Cost-Plus Pricing

This method of pricing can be suitable for a company when a high extent of total costs are variable. A company can be sure that its markup will cover fixed costs per unit. If the [ratio of variable costs](/variable-cost-ratio) to fixed costs is low, truly intending that there are significant fixed costs that go up as additional units are created, the pricing of a product might turn out to be mistaken and impractical for the company to create a gain.

Variable cost-plus pricing may likewise be suitable for companies that have excess capacity. At the end of the day, a company that wouldn't cause extra fixed costs per unit by gradually expanding production. Variable costs, in this case, would make most out of the total costs (e.g., no extra factory space would should be leased for extra production), and adding a markup on the variable costs would give a profit margin.

The major deficiency of this pricing method is that it neglects to consider how the market sees the product in terms of value or the prices of comparative products sold by contenders.

## Advantages and Disadvantages of Variable Cost-Plus Pricing

The primary advantage of variable cost-plus pricing is its simplicity: it allows merchants to handily set a price that covers their costs while allowing a reasonable margin for profit. It likewise makes it simple to set contracts with providers, who normally really like to lock in a price that locks in set profits over a model that is less predictable. It likewise makes it simpler to legitimize price increases to consumers, since a rise in prices can basically be credited to rising production costs.

> Variable cost-plus pricing isn't suitable for a company that has critical fixed costs or fixed costs that increase assuming that more units are delivered; any markup on the variable costs on top of the fixed costs per unit could bring about an unreasonable price for the product.
>

Then again, the variable cost-plus pricing model doesn't factor in market conditions, and may at times leave money on the table. For instance, in the event that a particular product line is in particularly high demand among consumers, the producers could earn greater profits by raising the prices on those products.

In like manner, the model doesn't account for contending products. At times, a company could increase its profit margins, on the off chance that its products are better than the contenders. On the other hand, a company can some of the time increase revenues by lowering prices, on the off chance that doing so undermines the prices of their rivals.
