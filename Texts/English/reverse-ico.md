The SEC ventured to such an extreme as to make a fake ICO page selling a made-up [shitcoin](/shitcoin) called Howeycoin — a play on the Howey test the SEC purposes to figure out what is a security — to train unwary investors to peruse the fine print before they invest. The organization's suit against Kik might be one justification for why the reverse ICO market has evaporated since the blasting of the crypto bubble.
