# Indexed Rate
## What Is an Indexed Rate?

An indexed rate is a [interest rate](/interestrate) that is tied to a specific benchmark with rate changes based on the movement of the benchmark. Indexed interest rates are utilized in variable-rate credit products. Well known benchmarks for an indexed rate incorporate the [prime rate](/primerate), LIBOR, and different U.S. Treasury bills and notes rates.

## Figuring out an Indexed Rate

Loans and different forms of lending have interest rates associated with them. Many interest rates are [fixed](/fixedinterestrate). At the point when a financial product incorporates an indexed rate, it means that the interest rate is [variable](/variableinterestrate) and will vacillate with the benchmark that it is pegged to. Variable interest products can be offered at the indexed rate or they might be offered at a completely indexed rate that incorporates a spread added to the indexed rate.

[Benchmarks](/benchmark) utilized for working out an essential indexed rate are generally deep rooted in the credit market. The prime rate, LIBOR, and different rates on U.S. Treasury bills and notes can be utilized as an index rate. They each address different sections of the market and are utilized with different maturities.

## Well known Benchmarks for Indexed Rates

Generally, a lending institution or credit product will decide and uncover the specific benchmark utilized in an indexed rate product. While borrowers ordinarily can't pick the indexed rate for a specific product, they can compare the benchmarks utilized for [loans](/credit) at different institutions.

### Prime Rate

The market prime rate is an average of the prime rates offered by banks to different banks and their most [creditworthy](/credit-value) borrowers. Banks change their prime rate as indicated by market conditions. **The Wall Street Journal** offers a prime rate based on a bank survey. Generally, loans indexed to a prime rate will be based on the bank's individual prime rate.

### LIBOR

[LIBOR](/libor) is quite possibly of the most comprehensively involved benchmark in the world for indexing interest rates. It is the London InterBank Offered Rate; the rate at which London banks would loan to each other. LIBOR is calculated and administered by the ICE Benchmark Administration. This entity works with the calculation and production of 35 unique LIBOR rates daily that can be utilized for an extensive variety of credit products.

> As per a declaration by the Federal Reserve in November 2020, banks ought to stop composing contracts utilizing LIBOR toward the finish of 2021. The Intercontinental Exchange, the authority responsible for LIBOR, will stop distributing multi week and multi month LIBOR after December 31, 2021. All contracts utilizing LIBOR must be wrapped up by June 30, 2023.

### Treasuries

The different [yields](/yield) on U.S. Treasuries are likewise a famous benchmark for interest rates. Credit products can be indexed to Treasuries of different maturities, giving an alternate yield and subsequently an alternate rate.

## Indexed Rates on Mortgages

At the point when a mortgage has an indexed rate rather than a fixed rate, it is known as an adjustable-rate mortgage. An adjustable-rate mortgage can be beneficial or inconvenient to a homeowner. After the initial introductory period, the interest rate on the mortgage will change to that of the overall price of the index. In the event that the rate has gone up, a homeowner will wind up paying something else for their mortgage, while in the event that the rate goes down, a homeowner will benefit from lower rates.

A homeowner must guarantee that they will actually want to keep paying their mortgage assuming that the rate increments.

The indexed rate is normally the least rate a lender will charge to a borrower. Standard indexed rates are normally charged to an institution's highest credit quality borrowers. Different borrowers with variable rate credit products will normally be charged a [fully indexed interest rate](/fullyindexedinterestrate). This rate adds a [spread](/spread) or margin to a base indexed rate. The spread on a credit product not entirely set in stone by the underwriter and is based on the data a borrower gives in a credit application.

Borrowers with a higher [credit score](/credit_score) and lower [debt-to-income](/dti) level will have a lower spread. Lower credit quality borrowers will have a higher spread. The spread implies the danger associated with the borrower. Frequently, the spread on a variable rate credit product will continue as before. Thusly, the borrower's variable interest rate will change however a similar rate when the underlying indexed interest rate changes.
