# Rich Valuation
## What Is Rich Valuation?

Rich valuation refers to a security that is priced above expected levels without a consistent explanation. The term is applicable to the [valuation](/valuation) of any asset, however it is generally ordinarily used with reference to stock valuations. An asset that is trading at a rich valuation might have a [risk/reward](/riskrewardratio) payoff that isn't particularly attractive to [value investors](/valueinvesting).

## Understanding Rich Valuation

Rich valuation is a term that can be used in several contexts in finance. Each context refers to a situation where an asset, typically a stock, has a current [market price](/market-price) that is high compared to a particular [benchmark](/benchmark); either a historical average, a [peers](/peer-group) or valuation modeling based upon earnings [multiples](/multiple), or [free cash flows](/freecashflow) (FCF).

Stocks that are trading at very high multiples in relation to their earnings or [book value](/bookvalue) ([price-to-earnings](/price-earningsratio) or [price-to-book ratios](/price-to-bookratio)), compared to their peers, are considered to be trading at rich valuations. Likewise, a [real estate investment trust](/reit) (REIT) would be considered to be lavishly valued in the event that it is trading at a high multiple of its [funds from operations](/fundsfromoperation) (FFO); calculated by adding depreciation and amortization to earnings and afterward deducting any gains on sales.

A company becomes lavishly valued when investors are confident and buy loads of its stock. [Bullish](/bull) sentiment pushes the company's share price up to a level that probably won't be justified by current figures, for example, revenue, cash flow, and profit, reported in financial statements.

Rich valuations are typically triggered by bullish analyst growth projections, optimistic company [guidance](/guidance), and positive media commentary. All when a company orders a rich valuation, it often suggests that investors are betting on it achieving its elevated objectives in the future. That perpetually means that the slightest smidgen of a slip-up can have heartbreaking consequences for the share price. As a result, some investors view rich valuations as a decent opportunity to sell.

## Examples of Rich Valuation

Assets tend to achieve rich valuations during [bubbles](/bubble). During the [tech bubble](/tech_bubble) of the early 2000s, stocks hit prices that weren't supported by typical valuation models and prices were incredibly high compared to historic standards. The increased stock valuations were a mix of speculation and excess venture capital money that was funding startups. These companies never really made any revenue or profits, leading to the collapse.

Likewise, during the [housing bubble](/housing_bubble) that predated the [Great Recession](/great-recession), home prices saw incredibly rich valuations compared to historic averages. The Dotcom bubble was partially responsible for the housing bubble as investors moved their investment capital into real estate. This combined with lower interest rates led to a beeline to home purchases, which decisively increased housing prices.

## Special Considerations

Determining whether a stock is luxuriously valued or not is often a subjective judgment. The numerous investors that bought shares in the company will believe they purchased them at a fair price, while onlookers will debate whether they paid over the chances.

The valuations of [growth companies](/growthcompany), technology, and [startups](/startup), in particular, are often fiercely debated because their share prices don't necessarily in every case consider past performance and on second thought tend to reflect what investors believe they can achieve over the next decade or something like that. That explains why a considerable lot of them trade on a high price-to-earnings ratio (P/E ratio); the widely-used valuation metric appearance what multiple the market will pay today for a stock based on its past, current, and following year earnings.

Given the wide varieties that exist between companies, it is important to take a gander at different ratios to value them. One ratio could make the shares look luxuriously valued, while another may present a different picture, implying that they could instead be potentially [undervalued](/undervalued).
