# Foreign Tax Credit
## What Is the Foreign Tax Credit?

The foreign tax credit is a U.S. tax credit used to offset income tax paid abroad. U.S. citizens and resident aliens who pay [income taxes](/incometax) forced by a foreign country or U.S. possession can claim the credit. The credit can reduce your U.S. tax liability and assist with guaranteeing you're not [taxed twice](/double_taxation) on a similar income.

## How the Foreign Tax Credit Works

In the event that you paid taxes to a foreign country or U.S. possession — and are subject to U.S. tax on a similar income — you can take an itemized deduction or a credit for those taxes. For foreign tax credit purposes, U.S. possessions incorporate Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands, Guam, the Northern Mariana Islands, and American Samoa.

Taken as a deduction (on Schedule An of your 1040 or 1040-SR), the foreign income tax reduces your U.S. taxable income. On the other hand, the foreign income straightforwardly reduces your U.S. tax liability assuming you assume the acknowledgment. Assuming you opt for the tax credit, you must complete Form 1116 and append it to your U.S. tax return.

> You must assume either a praise or a deduction for all qualified foreign taxes. For instance, you can't assume the praise for a portion of your foreign taxes and a deduction for other people. Furthermore, of course, you can't claim both a credit and a deduction for a similar tax.

Assuming the acknowledgment typically checks out on the grounds that the amount comes straight off your real tax bill rather than just bringing down your taxable income. One way or another, the tax break reduces the double tax burden that would somehow emerge assuming you were taxed on a similar income two times — in the U.S. what's more, abroad.

Generally, just income, war profits, and [excess profits taxes](/excess-profits-tax) are eligible for the credit. Foreign taxes on wages, dividends, interest, and sovereignties additionally qualify. In any case, that's what the IRS determines "the tax must be a levy that isn't payment for a specific economic benefit," and it must be comparable in character to a U.S. income tax.

You can likewise claim the credit on foreign taxes that aren't forced under a foreign income tax regulation — gave the tax is "in lieu" of income, war profits, or excess profits tax. In this situation, the tax must be forced in place of — and not notwithstanding — an income tax the country in any case forces.

Other foreign taxes, for example, foreign real and personal property taxes, don't fit the bill for the foreign tax credit. In any case, you might have the option to deduct these different taxes on Schedule An of your income tax return even on the off chance that you likewise claim the foreign tax credit. You can deduct foreign real property taxes unrelated to your trade or business. In any case, different taxes must be expenses you cause in a trade or business or to create income.

Individuals, domains, and trusts can utilize the foreign tax credit to reduce their income tax liability. Moreover, taxpayers can carry any unused foreign tax back for one year and afterward forward for as long as 10 years.

## Special Considerations

Not all taxes paid to a foreign government can be claimed as a credit against the U.S. federal income tax. By and large, you must meet four tests for the foreign tax to fit the bill for the credit:

1. The tax must be forced on you by a foreign country or U.S. possession.
1. You must have paid or accrued the tax to a foreign country or U.S. possession.
1. The tax must be the legal and real foreign tax liability you paid or accrued during the year.
1. The tax must be an income tax or a tax in lieu of an income tax.

There is a limit on the amount of credit you can claim, which you work out on Form 1116 (it can't be more than your total U.S. tax liability increased by a specific division). You can claim the more modest of the foreign tax you paid or your calculated limit. By and large, you claim the foreign tax credit on Form 1116 except if you fit the bill for one of these exemptions:

- Your main foreign source income for the tax year is passive income.
- Your qualified foreign taxes for the year don't surpass $300 ($600 whenever married filing jointly).
- Your gross foreign income and the foreign taxes are reported to you on a payee statement (e.g., Form 1099-DIV or 1099-INT).
- You choose this methodology for the tax year.

In the event that you fit the bill for an exemption, claim the tax credit straightforwardly on [Form 1040](/1040).

> On the off chance that you claim the foreign earned income exclusion as well as the foreign housing exclusion, you can't assume a foreign tax praise for taxes on the income you excluded (or might have excluded). Assuming that you do, the IRS could repudiate either of your decisions.

## Refundable versus Non-refundable Tax Credits

Tax credits can be either refundable or non-refundable. A [refundable tax credit](/refundablecredit) brings about a refund on the off chance that the tax credit is more than your tax bill. Thus, on the off chance that you apply a $3,400 tax credit to a $3,000 tax bill, you will receive a $400 refund.

Then again, a [non-refundable tax credit](/nonrefundabletaxcredit) will not give a refund since it just reduces the tax owed to zero. Following the model above, if the $3,400 tax credit was non-refundable, you would not owe anything to the government. Nonetheless, you would likewise relinquish the $400 that stayed after the credit was applied. Most tax credits, including the foreign tax credit, are non-refundable.
