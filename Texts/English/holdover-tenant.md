## What Is a Holdover Tenant?

A holdover tenant is a renter who stays in a property after the expiration of the lease. Assuming that the landlord keeps on accepting rent payments, the holdover tenant can proceed to legally possess the property, and state laws and court decisions determine the length of the holdover tenant's new rental term. In the event that the landlord doesn't acknowledge further rent payments, the tenant is viewed as intruding, and on the off chance that they don't speedily move out, an eviction might be fundamental.

## Understanding Holdover Tenants

Landlords who need to stay away from the misstep of winding up with a holdover tenant ought to continuously remember a clause for the original lease stating what occurs at the finish of the lease period to safeguard their property and interests. An extended condo rental lease, for instance, could indicate that when the lease terminates, it converts to a [month-to-month lease](/month-to-month-tenancy).

On the off chance that a landlord acknowledges rent from a holdover tenant, the implications shift in view of state and nearby laws. At times accepting payment resets the lease term. To illustrate, in the event that the original lease was for a year, another drawn out lease begins when the landlord acknowledges a rent payment after the main lease has expired. In different cases accepting payment from a holdover tenant triggers a month-to-month lease.

To eliminate a tenant from a property, a landlord must initiate a holdover continuing, which basically is an eviction case that did not depend on missed rent payments. This is a cycle that is normally taken care of in eviction or small claims courts.
