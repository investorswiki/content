# Treynor-Black Model
## What Is the Treynor-Black Model?

The Treynor-Black model is a portfolio optimization model that looks to boost a portfolio's [Sharpe ratio](/sharperatio) by consolidating an actively managed portfolio worked with a couple mispriced securities and a passively managed market index fund. The Sharpe ratio assesses the relative risk-adjusted performance of a portfolio or a single investment against the [risk-free rate of return](/risk-freerate), like the yield on U.S. Treasury securities.

The Treynor-Black model really calls for two portfolio segments: a [actively managed](/activemanagement) portion containing undervalued stocks, and a [passive](/passivemanagement) segment that follows an indexing strategy.

## Understanding the Treynor-Black Model

The Treynor-Black model was distributed in 1973 by financial specialists Jack Treynor and Fischer Black. Treynor and Black assumed that the market is profoundly yet not impeccably [efficient](/marketefficiency). Following their model, an investor who to a great extent concurs with the market pricing of an asset may likewise accept that they have extra data that can be utilized to generate excess returns — known as [alpha](/alpha) — from a chosen handful mispriced securities.

The investor utilizing the Treynor-Black model will in this manner select a small mix of undervalued securities to make a dual-partitioned portfolio, in light of their own research and understanding. One portion of the portfolio follows a passive index investment, and the other part an active investment in those mispriced securities.

The Treynor-Black model gives an efficient approach to executing an active investment strategy. Since it is difficult to continuously pick stocks accurately as the model requires, and since limitations on short selling might limit the ability to take advantage of market efficiencies and generate alpha, the model has gotten forward momentum with investment managers or investors.

> The Treynor-Black model depends on the assumption that individuals can promptly distinguish mispriced assets and earn alpha, which is unbelievably hard for even thoroughly prepared analysts and expert portfolio managers.

## The Treynor-Black Dual Portfolio

The passively invested market portfolio contains securities in proportion to their market value, for example, with an index fund. The investor accepts that the [expected return](/expectedreturn) and standard deviation of these passive investments can be estimated through macroeconomic forecasting.

In the active portfolio — which is a [long/short fund](/long-shortequity), every security is weighted by the ratio of its alpha to its unsystematic risk. Unsystematic risk is the business explicit risk appended to an investment or an innately flighty category of investments. Instances of such risk incorporate another market contender who eats up market share or a natural disaster that obliterates revenue.

The Treynor-Black ratio or appraisal ratio measures the value the security under a magnifying glass would add to the portfolio, on a risk-adjusted basis. The higher a security's alpha, the higher the weight assigned to it inside the active portion of the portfolio. The more unsystematic risk the stock has, the less weighting it gets.

> Fischer Black, who died in 1995, is additionally knows for his work on the [Black-Litterman](/black-litterman_model) Model, the [Black 76 Model](/blacksmodel), and the [Black Scholes](/blackscholes) options pricing model.
