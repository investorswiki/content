# Time Value
## What Is Time Value?

Time value alludes to the portion of a [option's](/option) premium that is inferable from the amount of time staying until the expiration of the option contract. The premium of any option comprises of two components: its [intrinsic value](/intrinsicvalue) and its extrinsic value.

Time value is a component of an option's [extrinsic value](/extrinsicvalue), alongside implied volatility (IV), and connects with derivatives markets. It ought not be mistaken for the [time value of money](/timevalueofmoney) (TVM), which portrays the discounting of money's purchasing power after some time.

## The Basics of Time Value

The price (or cost) of an option is an amount of money known as the [premium](/premium). An option buyer pays this premium to an option seller in exchange for the right conceded by the option: the decision to exercise the option to buy or sell an asset or to permit it to [expire](/expirationdate) worthless.

The intrinsic value is the difference between the price of the [underlying asset](/underlying-asset) and the [strike price](/strikeprice) of the option. The intrinsic value for a call option — the right, yet not the obligation, to buy an asset — is equivalent to the underlying price minus the strike price, while the intrinsic value for a put option — the right to sell an asset — is equivalent to the strike price minus the underlying price.

An option's total premium depends on its intrinsic plus extrinsic value. A key part of extrinsic value is known as "time value." Under normal conditions, a contract loses value as it moves toward its expiration date since there is less time for the underlying security to well move. As such, an option with one month to expiration that is [out of the money](/outofthemoney) (OTM) will have more extrinsic value than that of an OTM option with multi week to expiration.

Another factor that influences extrinsic value and time value is [implied volatility](/iv) (IV). IV measures the amount an underlying asset might move over a predetermined period. Assuming the IV increases, the extrinsic value will likewise increase. For example, on the off chance that an investor purchases a [call option](/calloption) with an annualized IV of 20% and the IV leaps to 30% the next day, the extrinsic value would rise as investors figure that emotional moves help the possibility of the asset moving their direction.

### Working out Time Value

As an equation, time value may be communicated as:

>
> Option Premium - Intrinsic Value = Time Value + Implied Volatility

Or on the other hand, to put it another way: the amount of a premium that is in excess of the option's intrinsic value is alluded to as its time value. For instance, if Alphabet Inc. stock is priced at $1,044 per share and the Alphabet Inc. $950 call option is trading at $97, then, at that point, the option has an intrinsic value of $94 ($1,044 - $950) and a period value of $3 ($97 - $94).

## The Significance of Time Value

When in doubt, the additional time that remaining parts until expiration, the greater the time value of the option. The reasoning is simple: Investors will pay a higher premium for additional time since the contract will have longer to profit from a great move in the underlying asset.

On the other hand, the less time that remaining parts on an option, the to a lesser degree a premium investors will pay, in light of the fact that the likelihood of the option getting the opportunity to profitable is recoil. Therefore, more secure to sell or hold an option actually has time value left, as opposed to practicing it; in any case, that excess time value would be lost.

> Theoretically, adding time to an option or expanding the IV make a similar fundamental difference: expanding the likelihood that an option will complete [in the money](/inthemoney) (ITM).

As a general rule, an option loses one-third of its time value during the primary half of its life, and the leftover two-thirds of its time value during the last part. Time value diminishes over the long run at a speeding up pace, a phenomenon known as [time decay or time-value decay](/timedecay). An option price's sensitivity to time decay is known as its [theta](/theta).

## Features
- Time value is one of two key components, the other being implied volatility, that comprise an option's extrinsic value.
- Generally, the additional time that remaining parts until the option terminates, the greater the time value of the option.
- An option's total price, or premium, is the aggregation of its intrinsic and extrinsic value.
