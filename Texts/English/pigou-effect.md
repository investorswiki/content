# Pigou Effect
## What Is the Pigou Effect?

The Pigou effect alludes to the relationship between consumption, wealth, employment, and output during periods of [deflation](/deflation). The Pigou effect states that when there is deflation of prices, employment (and accordingly output) will increase due to an increase in wealth (which increases consumption).

Prior to a period of deflation, a [liquidity trap ](/liquiditytrap)occurs, which is a period where there is zero demand for investment in bonds, and individuals crowd cash since they expect a period of deflation or war. The Pigou effect proposes a mechanism to escape this trap. As per the theory, price levels and employment fall, and unemployment rises. As price levels decline, real balances increase, and by the Pigou effect, consumption is animated in the economy. The Pigou effect is otherwise called the "real balance effect."

## Understanding the Pigou Effect

Arthur Pigou was an English economist who contended against [Keynesian](/keynesianeconomics) economic theory by declaring that periods of deflation due to a drop in [aggregate demand](/aggregatedemand) would self-right. The [deflation ](/deflation)would cause an increase in wealth, making expenditures rise, hence amending the drop in demand. Then again, during inflation, prices rise, wealth and consumption drop, output and employment drop, and aggregate demand likewise goes down.

An economy that is experiencing a liquidity trap can't make a difference monetary stimulus to increase output. There is no definitive connection between the demand for money and personal income. As per John Hicks, this makes sense of high unemployment rates.

In spite of this, the Pigou Effect is a mechanism to dodge the liquidity trap. As unemployment goes up, the price level drops. This increases the "real balance," which is the effect on spending of changes in the real value of money. Individuals can buy more with their money when unemployment rises and prices fall.

As consumption rises, employment goes down, and prices rise. During inflation, as prices rise, the real purchasing power of the money individuals as of now hold goes down. This makes individuals bound to save and more averse to spend their incomes. At full employment, the economy will be in a better place. That's what pigou reasons assuming wages and prices become sticky, there will be equilibrium, and the employment rate will fall below the full employment rate.

## History of the Pigou Effect

The Pigou effect was begat by Arthur Cecil Pigou in 1943, in "The Classical Stationary State," which was an article in the **Economic Journal**. In the piece, Pigou proposed a connection between "real balances" and consumption.

In the custom of classical economics, Pigou favored the possibility of "natural rates," to which an economy would commonly return, despite the fact that he recognized that sticky prices could in any case prevent reversion to natural output levels after a demand shock. Pigou saw the real balance effect as a mechanism to intertwine Keynesian and classical models. With the real balance effect, higher purchasing power brings about diminished government and investment expenditure.

Notwithstanding, pundits of the Pigou effect note that assuming the effect was continuously operating in an economy, the almost zero nominal interest rates in Japan during the 1990s could have been expected to end the memorable Japanese deflation sooner than they.

Other apparent evidence against the Pigou effect from Japan might be the extended stagnation of buyer expenditures while prices were falling. Pigou said falling prices ought to cause consumers to feel more extravagant (and increase spending), yet Japanese consumers liked to postpone purchases, expecting that prices would fall even further.

## Government Debt and the Pigou Effect

[Robert Barro](/ricardobarroeffect), a Harvard economist, battled that due to [Ricardian equivalence](/ricardianequivalence), the public can't be tricked into thinking they are more extravagant than they are the point at which the government issues bonds to them. This is on the grounds that government bond coupons must be paid for by expanding future taxes. Ricardian equivalence is an economic theory that says that financing government spending out of current taxes or future taxes (and current deficits) will equally affect the overall economy. Barro contended that at the microeconomic level, the subjective level of wealth ought to be diminished by the national government expecting a share of the debt.

As a result, bonds ought not be viewed as part of net wealth at the macroeconomic level. This, he battled, infers that it is basically impossible for a government to make a Pigou effect by giving bonds in light of the fact that the aggregate level of wealth won't increase.

## Analysis of the Pigou Effect

The Keynes Effect holds that as prices fall, a nominal money supply will be associated with a bigger real money supply, causing interest rates to fall. This will invigorate investment and spending on physical capital and lift an economy. The ramifications is that lacking demand and output will be settled by lower price levels.

The Pigou Effect, running against the norm, accounts for a fall in the aggregate demand through rising real balances. Individuals have more money to spend in the event that prices fall, which raises expenditure by means of the income effect.

Polish economist Michal Kalecki was a pundit of the Pigou effect. As indicated by him, the adjustment proposed by Pigou "would increase horrendous the real value of debts, and would subsequently lead to wholesale bankruptcy and a confidence crisis."

In the event that this were the case, and the Pigou effect generally operated, The Bank of Japan's policy of almost zero interest rates would have been fruitful in tending to the Japanese deflation during the 1990s. In this manner, the steady consumption expenditure in Japan regardless of falling prices conflicts with the Pigou effect. On account of Japanese consumers, they anticipated further price declines and delayed consumption.

## Highlights
- Pigou tested the free market economy by proposing that the government ought to intercede and tax private companies and people for the negative effects of their operations on society.
- A Pigovian tax is a tax surveyed against private people or organizations for taking part in activities that make adverse cultural impacts and costs.
- The Pigou Effect has limited materialness in making sense of Japan's deflationary economy.
- Harvard economist Robert Barro has fought that the government can't make a Pigou effect by giving more bonds.
- The Pigou effect states that price deflation will bring about an increase in employment and wealth, empowering the economy to return to its "natural rates."
## FAQ
### How Do Marshall, Coase, and Pigou Differ in Their Treatment of Externalities?
Pigou extended Alfred Marshall's concept of externalities as costs forced or benefits presented on others that are not considered by the person making the move. Pigou contended that the presence of externalities is adequate defense for government intervention. Pigou suggested that negative externalities (costs forced) ought to be offset by a tax, while positive externalities ought to be offset by a subsidy. Ronald Coase contended with Pigou's analysis in the mid 1960s recommending that "taxes and sponsorships are excessive if the partners in the transaction — that is, individuals impacted by the externality and individuals who cause it — can bargain over the transaction."
### How Did Pigou Challenge the Free Market?
Pigou tested the free market by proposing that the government ought to mediate and tax private companies and people for the negative effects their operations have on society. For instance, Pigou accepted that polluters ought to be taxed and health care coverage ought to be compulsory.
### What Is a Pigou Tax?
A Pigovian (Pigouvian) tax is a tax evaluated against private people or organizations for participating in activities that make adverse cultural impacts and costs. The costs of the incidental effects are excluded as a part of the item's [market price](/market-price). For instance, the cost of coal energy is environmental pollution, while the cost of tobacco production is a stress on public healthcare. The purpose of the Pigovian tax is to reallocate the cost back to the producer or client of the negative externality. A carbon emissions tax or a tax on plastic bags are instances of Pigovian taxes.
