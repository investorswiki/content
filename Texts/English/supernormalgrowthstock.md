## What is a Supernormal Growth Stock?

A supernormal growth stock is a security that experiences particularly robust [growth](/growthstock) for a period, then eventually returns to normal levels of growth. During their supernormal growth stage, these stocks [outperform](/outperform) the market altogether and furnish investors with [returns](/return) that are well better than expected. To be viewed as a supernormal growth stock, earnings must keep on developing at a bizarrely fast pace for no less than one year.

## Understanding a Supernormal Growth Stock

Supernormal [growth stocks](/growthstock) display strangely fast growth for an extended period — a year or longer — that generally outpaces any concurrent growth in the overall economy. A company's period of abnormally quick stock growth can't be sustained endlessly. Eventually, contenders will enter the market and find the firm. Then, at that point, earnings will probably slip to a level that is more in accordance with the competition and the overall economy. Notwithstanding the term "supernormal," the maxims "nonconstant" and "unpredictable growth" might be applied to stocks that are encountering this heightening growth pattern.

Supernormal growth is viewed as an ordinary part of a [industry lifecycle](/industrylifecycle), particularly when there is great demand for another product. Hence, some new businesses normally go through a supernormal growth phase. A considerable lot of the best companies in history have delighted in supernormal growth eventually in their development.

During their initial a very long time in particular, future [blue-chip stocks](/bluechipstock) frequently will appreciate at a lot higher levels than the more extensive market averages. These earnings then, at that point, level off, and the stock might turn into a blue chip. Or on the other hand in the event that the company just created a fad, earnings might decline emphatically after the growth phase, and the company remains small in size or vanishes totally.

## What Causes Supernormal Growth in Stocks?

Quite a few factors might set off strangely fast growth in a security: sending off a thrilling new product or innovation; making an imaginative business model or marketing strategy; or starting a truly necessary service.

A company likewise may accomplish supernormal growth by having a patent, [first-mover advantage](/firstmover), or another factor that gives an impermanent lead in a specific marketplace. Further, an uncommon growth spray can happen due to circumstances that influence the economic environment. For instance, an engineering firm might experience a flooding stock price and earnings during extraordinary growth and demand in the construction industry. One more illustration of a trigger for supernormal growth could be the point at which a business dispatches a fruitful new product that depends on man-made brainpower (AI) before AI innovations become mainstream.

## The Challenge of Valuing Supernormal Growth Stocks

Stock valuation can be sufficiently confounded, however putting a value on companies whose growth is speeding up quickly can be precarious. Nonconstant, supernormal growth stocks can't be valued similarly as companies whose earnings are expected to develop at a steady rate — that is, in accordance with the economy — for the foreseeable future. For consistent growth stocks, it is generally fine to stick with the [Gordon Growth Model](/gordongrowthmodel) of valuation. The Gordon Growth Model, otherwise called the [dividend markdown model](/ddm) (DDM), is a method for working out the intrinsic value of a stock, exclusive of current market conditions. The model compares this value to the current value (PV) of a stock's future dividends.

Albeit the Gordon Growth Model is one of the least complex [valuation](/valuation) equations, it factors in no change in dividend growth over the long run. Subsequently, it is hard to utilize this model accurately for supernormal stocks. In these cases, you really want to know how to work out value through the company's initial, high-growth years, and its later, lower steady growth years. To account for the somewhat more unstable dividend/earnings activity of supernormal growth stocks, we can utilize a "two-stage" or "[multi-stage](/multistageddm)" DDM all things considered. The essential two-stage model expects a steady, extraordinary rate for the supernormal growth period followed by a consistent, normal growth rate from that point; and the difference in these two growth rates might be substantial.

A potential limitation of the two-stage model is that the progress between the initial abnormal growth period and the last steady-state growth period might be sudden; and at times, a smoother change to the developed phase growth rate would be more realistic. Subsequently, scholastics and [quantitative analysts](/quantitativeanalysis) have developed varieties of the two-stage model in which growth starts at a high rate and declines in linear additions all through the supernormal growth period until it arrives at a normal rate toward the end.

## Real World Example of a Supernormal Growth Stock

Netflix Inc. had several supernormal growth years in its beginning phases, yet these were fleeting as earnings dropped again with a little while.

A sustained supernormal growth period started in 2016. In 2015 the company made $0.29 in [earnings per share](/eps) (EPS), then, at that point, $0.44 in 2016, a 52% leap. In 2017 EPS came in at $1.29 (193% leap), then, at that point, $2.78 in 2018 (116%). Earnings kept on sloping up in 2019, to $4.28, a 54% leap.

Such growth rates must be sustained for such a long time. On account of Netflix, there are just such countless individuals who wish to buy in, and just a certain price they are will to pay for the service. Increased competition will likewise hurt growth rates over the long-term. That doesn't mean the can't proceed to develop and do well overall, yet earnings will eventually normalize. The growth streak could proceed, or even accelerate, before that occurs. Supernormal growth can last numerous years at times. For different companies, it is brief.

## Highlights
- Supernormal growth periods are unsustainable over the long-term as competition or market saturation eventually bring about lower growth levels.
- Supernormal growth is a period of raising earnings, for one year or more.
- Finding a fair value for a supernormal growth stock is troublesome, frequently requiring a pricing model for both the supernormal growth period and the normal growth period.
