## What Is a Delayed Rate Setting Swap?

The term delayed rate setting swap alludes to a type of [derivative](/derivative) contract that begins immediately however whose [coupon](/coupon) is set sometime not too far off. A delayed rate setting swap is a type of interest rate swap that spotlights on the [spread](/spread) that the gatherings in the agreement can anticipate. At the point when traders execute a delayed rate setting swap, they consent to exchange cash flows or assets, yet just on a fixed date from here on out. The spread is commonly founded on a benchmark interest rate.

## How a Delayed Rate Setting Swap Works

A swap is an over-the-counter agreement that includes two gatherings. Both consent to exchange cash flows for a certain period of time. They utilize a variable, for example, interest rates, commodity or equity prices, or exchange rates, at the onset of the contract. There are various types of swaps, including [interest rate swaps](/interestrateswap), [currency swaps](/currencyswap), [zero-coupon swaps](/zero-coupon-swap), and [commodity swaps](/commodityswap).

A delayed rate setting swap is a type of interest rate swap. This sort of swap is likewise called a deferred rate setting or a forward swap. It includes the utilization of a [fixed-for-floating rate swap](/fixed_floatswap). One depends on a fixed interest rate while the other depends on a floating rate. The spread or difference between these two is determined at the time the swap is initiated. Yet, the genuine rates aren't set until a later date.

For example, the spread on such a delayed rate setting swap might be determined to be 100 basis points (or 1%) when the contract is set. A couple of days after the gatherings enter the swap, the counterparties may consequently characterize the floating interest rate as the [London Interbank Offered Rate](/libor) (LIBOR) + 1%.

Most delayed rate setting swaps start not long after the spread terms are determined. When the genuine swap interest rates are set, a delayed rate setting swap acts like a standard interest rate swap. In any case, the one difference from an ordinary interest rate swap is that a delayed rate setting swap adds an extra element of [risk](/risk) since the two players have contracted for a rate that will be set at a time later on.

## Special Considerations

[Interest rate swaps](/interestrateswap) are financial contract agreements that are exchanged between [institutional investors](/institutionalinvestor). Swaps can be listed on institutional trading exchanges or negotiated straightforwardly between two gatherings.

Interest rate swaps are a form of [risk management](/riskmanagement). Accordingly, they permit institutions to swap fixed-rate obligations for floating-rate cash flows or vice versa. In a standard interest rate swap, the different sides of the transaction will commonly include a [floating rate](/floatinginterestrate) and a fixed rate. The two players have the opportunity to guess on their perspective on the interest rate environment.

The fixed-rate counterpart consents to pay a fixed rate of [interest](/interest) on a predefined amount for the benefit of getting a floating rate. The fixed-rate counterpart generally accepts that the outlook for rates is expanding and tries to lock in a fixed-rate [payout](/payout) in receipt for a possibly rising floating rate that will make profit from the cash flow differential.

A floating rate counterpart takes the contrary view and accepts that rates will fall. In the event that [interest rates](/interestrate) fall, they enjoy the benefit of paying a lower rate of interest that might fall below the fixed rate, with the cash flow differential in support of themselves.

## Benefits of Delayed Rate Setting Swaps

A delayed rate setting swap can be beneficial for several reasons. It gives [liquidity](/liquidity) immediately and later on and permits gatherings to eliminate [volatility](/volatility) from their [balance sheets](/balancesheet). It is likewise beneficial when a counterparty views as the offered spread ideal to market conditions.

Suppose two counterparties consent to fixed and floating rate terms in view of the one-year Treasury plus 50 [basis points](/basispoint). The spread differential between the fixed and floating rates is zero while the genuine base rate is set when the swap starts from here on out.

The fixed-rate payer accepts this rate will be great at the onset of the contract. They likewise accept that rates will rise with the floating rate cash flows giving a [profit](/profit). As is average for swap positions, the floating rate [counterparty](/counterparty) accepts rates will fall in support of themselves.
