## Financial Crisis Examples

Financial crises are normal; they have occurred however long the world has had currency. A few notable financial crises include:

- **Tulip Mania (1637).** Though a few historians contend that this mania didn't muchly affect the Dutch economy, and hence ought not be viewed as a financial crisis, it corresponded with a flare-up of bubonic plague which essentially affected the country. In view of this, it is challenging to discern whether the crisis was hastened by over-speculation or by the pandemic.

Alexander Fordyce, a partner in a large bank, lost a colossal sum shorting shares of the East India Company and escaped to France to stay away from repayment. Panic prompted a run on English banks that left in excess of 20 large banking houses either bankrupt or stopping payments to depositors and creditors.

Historians draw a line from this crisis to the reason for the Boston Tea Party — disliked tax legislation in the 13 states — and the subsequent distress that brought forth the American Revolution.
- **Stock Crash of 1929.** This crash, starting on Oct. 24, 1929, saw share prices collapse after a period of wild speculation and borrowing to buy shares.

One trigger of the crash was a radical oversupply of commodity crops, which prompted a lofty decline in prices. A great many regulations and market-overseeing tools were presented because of the crash.

- **Asian Crisis of 1997-1998.** This crisis [started in July 1997 with the collapse of the Thai baht](/asian-financial-crisis).

## The Global Financial Crisis

As the latest and most harming financial crisis event, the Global Financial Crisis, merits special consideration, as its causes, effects, response, and illustrations are generally applicable to the current financial system.

### Loosened Lending Standards

The crisis was the consequence of a sequence of events, each with its own trigger and finishing in the close collapse of the banking system. It has been contended that the seeds of the crisis were planted as far back as the 1970s with the Community Development Act, which required banks to loosen their credit requirements for lower-pay consumers, making a market for [subprime mortgages](/subprime_mortgage).

> A financial crisis can take many forms, including a banking/credit panic or a stock market crash, however contrasts from a recession, which is much of the time the consequence of such a crisis.

The amount of subprime mortgage debt, which was guaranteed by [Freddie Mac](/freddiemac) and Fannie Mae, kept on venturing into the mid 2000s when the Federal Reserve Board started to cut interest rates radically to stay away from a recession. The combination of loose credit requirements and cheap money prodded a housing boom, which drove speculation, pushing up housing prices and making a real estate bubble.

### Complex Financial Instruments

Meanwhile, the investment banks, searching for simple profits in the wake of the [dot-com bust](/dotcom-bubble) and 2001 recession, made [collateralized debt obligations (CDOs)](/cdo) from the mortgages purchased on the secondary market. Since subprime mortgages were packaged with prime mortgages, it was basically impossible for investors to comprehend the risks associated with the product. At the point when the market for CDOs started to warm up, the housing bubble that had been building for quite a long time had at last burst. As housing prices fell, subprime borrowers started to default on loans that were worth more than their homes, accelerating the decline in prices.

### Failures Begin, Contagion Spreads

At the point when investors realized the CDOs were worthless due to the toxic debt they addressed, they endeavored to empty the obligations. In any case, there was no market for the CDOs. The subsequent cascade of subprime lender failures made liquidity [contagion](/contagion) that arrived at the upper tiers of the banking system. Two major investment banks, Lehman Brothers and Bear Stearns, collapsed under the weight of their exposure to subprime debt, and in excess of 450 banks failed over the course of the next five years. Several of the major banks were near the precarious edge of failure and were saved by a taxpayer-funded bailout.

### Response

The U.S. Government answered the Financial Crisis by lowering interest rates to almost zero, buying back mortgage and government debt, and rescuing a few striving financial institutions. With rates so low, bond yields became undeniably less attractive to investors when compared to stocks. The government response lighted the stock market. By March 2013, the S&P bounced back from the crisis and forged ahead with its 10-year bull run from 2009 to 2019 to move to around 250%. The U.S. housing market recuperated in most major urban areas, and the unemployment rate fell as businesses hired and make more investments.

### New Regulations

One big end result of the crisis was the adoption of the [Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act](/dodd-frank-financial-regulatory-reform-charge), an enormous piece of financial reform legislation passed by the Obama administration in 2010. Dodd-Frank brought wholesale changes to each part of the U.S. financial regulatory environment, which touched each regulatory body and each financial services business. Eminently, Dodd-Frank made the following impacts:

- More exhaustive regulation of financial markets, including more oversight of derivatives, which were brought into exchanges.
- Regulatory agencies, which had been various and once in a while excess, were consolidated.
- Another body, the [Financial Stability Oversight Council](/financial-stability-oversight-council), was concocted to monitor systemic risk.
- Greater investor protections were presented, including another consumer protection agency (the [Consumer Financial Protection Bureau](/consumer-financial-protection-bureau-cfpb)) and standards for "plain-vanilla" products.
- The presentation of processes and tools (like cash implantations) is intended to assist with the winding down of failed financial institutions.
- Measures intended to further develop standards, accounting, and regulation of credit rating agencies.
