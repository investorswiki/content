# Capital Surplus
## What Is Capital Surplus?

Capital surplus, or share premium, most commonly alludes to the surplus resulting after common stock is sold for more than its par value. Capital surplus includes equity or net worth in any case not classifiable as [capital stock](/capitalstock) or retained earnings.

In the past, the account Paid-in Capital in Excess of Par - Common Stock and the account Premium on Common Stock were alluded to as capital surplus. Most balance sheets today call capital surplus paid-in surplus or paid-in capital [in excess of par].

## Understanding Capital Surplus

Five different ways capital surplus can be made include:

1. From stock issued at a premium to par or stated value (generally common)
1. From the proceeds of stock bought back and afterward resold
1. From a reduction of par or stated value or reclassification of capital stock
1. From gave stock
1. From the acquisition of companies that have capital surpluses

Albeit thing 1 is the most common, things 2 and 5 ought not be neglected.

During the last decade, public companies have repurchased critical measures of their common stock through share repurchase programs. Later on, to raise capital, these businesses could reissue treasury stock.

An uptick in [M&A](/mergersandacquisitions) could likewise see more companies adjusting their balance sheets to account for capital surplus related accounting issues.

Capital stock can act as an umbrella term for additional specific arrangements, like acquired surplus, extra paid-in-capital, gave surplus, or reexamination surplus (which could pop up during evaluations).

## Capital Surplus versus Retained Earnings

Albeit capital surplus and retained earnings are parts of stockholders' equity and share comparative qualities, they are fundamentally unique. Retained earnings are a company's earnings or profits remaining after it pays dividends to its shareholders. These profits are retained by the company and are much of the time used to assist the organization with scaling, for example, expanding operations or diversifying a product line.

An organization's final retained earnings balance, which can be negative or positive, is calculated by adding its profits or losses to the beginning retained earnings balance and afterward subtracting dividends paid to shareholders. Retained earnings are reported in a category of similar name in the stockholders' equity section of the balance sheet.

Capital surplus doesn't address earnings and results most commonly when investors pay more than par value for shares. Assuming shares sell at their par value, there is no capital surplus. Capital surplus figures are reported in a category of a similar name or named "extra paid-in capital" in the stockholders' equity section of the balance sheet.

## Capital Surplus Example

Consider the model wherein a company sells 1000 shares of its common stock for $100 per share, totaling $100,000 in proceeds (1000 shares x $100). The common stock par value is $20 per share (total common stock proceeds = $20,000). In this manner, the capital surplus or extra paid-in capital is $80,000 ($100,000 - $20,000). 20,000 dollars will be kept in the Common Stock account of the balance sheet and $80,000 kept in the Additional Paid-In Capital account of the balance sheet.
