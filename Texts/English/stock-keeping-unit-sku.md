## Stock Keeping Units versus Universal Product Codes

This stops contenders from matching advertised prices and poaching customers. Conversely, universal product codes (UPCs) are indistinguishable paying little mind to which business is selling the things.

## Illustration of SKUs in the Modern World

Today, numerous retailers are outfitted with portable scanners empowering salespeople to check back-of-the-store inventory by just filtering a floor sample. This is one of the many benefits of the modern-day SKU system.
