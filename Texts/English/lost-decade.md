# Lost Decade
## What Is the Lost Decade?

The Lost Decade is regularly used to portray the decade of the 1990s in Japan, a period of economic [stagnation](/stagnation) which became perhaps of the longest-running economic crisis in written history. Later decades are additionally remembered for certain definitions, with the period from 1991-2011 (or even 1991-2021) some of the time likewise alluded to as Japan's Lost Decades.

## Understanding the Lost Decade

The Lost Decade is a term initially begat to allude to the decade-long [economic crisis](/financial-crisis) in Japan during the 1990s. Japan's economy rose brilliantly soon after World War II, peaking during the 1980s with the largest per capita gross national product (GNP) in the world. Japan's commodity drove growth during this period pulled in capital and aided drive a [trade surplus](/trade-surplus) with the U.S.

To assist with offsetting global trade awkward nature, Japan joined other major world economies in the [Plaza Agreement in 1985](/plaza-accord). As per this agreement, Japan set out on a period of loose monetary policy in the late 1980s. This loose monetary policy prompted increased [speculation ](/speculation)and a soaring stock market and real estate valuations.

In the mid 1990s, as it became apparent that the [bubble](/bubble) was going to burst, the Japanese Financial Ministry raised interest rates, and eventually the stock market slumped and a debt crisis began, halting economic growth and leading to what is presently known as the Lost Decade. During the 1990s, Japan's [gross domestic product](/gdp) (GDP) averaged 1.3%, significantly lower as compared to other G-7 countries. Household savings increased. However, that increase didn't translate into demand, resulting in that frame of mind) for the economy.

### The Lost Decades

In the following decade, Japan's GDP growth averaged just 0.5% each year as supported sluggish growth carried over right up until the global financial crisis and [Great Recession](/great-recession). Thus, many allude to the period somewhere in the range of 1991 and 2010 as the Lost Score, or the Lost 20 Years.

From 2011 to 2019, Japan's GDP grew an average of just under 1.0% each year, and 2020 denoted the beginning of another global recession as governments locked down economic activity in reaction to the Covid-19 pandemic. Together the years from 1990 to the present are now and again alluded to as Japan's Lost Decades.

The pain is expected to go on for Japan. According to research from the [Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis](/federal-reserve-bank-of-stlouis), recent growth rates suggest that Japan's GDP will double in 80 years when beforehand it doubled like clockwork.

## What Caused The Lost Decade?

While there is a few agreement on the events that hinted at and hastened the Lost Decade, the reasons for Japan's supported economic misfortunes are as yet being discussed. When the bubble burst and the recession occurred, for what reason did it reach out into a whole Lost Decade? (Or on the other hand two? Or on the other hand three?!) Demographic factors, like Japan's aging population, and the geopolitical rise of China and other East Asian contenders might be underlying, non-economic factors. Researchers have created papers delineating potential motivations behind why the Japanese economy sank into prolonged stagnation.

[Keynesian](/keynesianeconomics) financial analysts have offered several demand-side clarifications. Paul Krugman thought that Japan was caught in a [liquidity trap](/liquiditytrap): consumers were holding onto their savings since they feared that the economy was going to get more regrettable. Other research on the subject dissected the pretended by decreasing household wealth in causing the economic crisis. **Japan's Lost Decade**, a 2017 book, faults a "upward speculation saving" curve for Japan's concerns.

[Monetarist](/monetarist) financial analysts have rather pointed to Japan's [monetary policy](/monetarypolicy) before and during the Lost Decade as too restrictive and not accommodative enough to restart growth. Milton Friedman composed, in reference to Japan, that "the surest road to a solid economic recovery is to increase the rate of monetary growth to shift from tight money to more straightforward money, to a rate of monetary growth nearer to that which won in the golden 1980s yet without again overdoing it. That would make genuinely necessary financial and economic changes far simpler to accomplish."

In spite of these different endeavors, Keynesian and Monetarist sees on Japan's extended economic disquietude generally fall short. Japan's government has engaged in rehashed rounds of gigantic fiscal [deficit spending](/deficit-spending) (the Keynesian's solution to economic depression) and expansionary monetary policy (the Monetarist remedy) without eminent achievement. This suggests that either the Keynesian and Monetarist clarifications or solutions (or both) are probable mixed up.

[Austrian economists](/austrian_school) have, going against the norm, argued that a period of extended economic stagnation isn't conflicting with Japan's economic policies that throughout the period acted to prop up existing firms and financial institutions as opposed to letting them fail and allowing [entrepreneurs](/business person) to reorganize them into new firms and industries. They point to the rehashed economic and financial bailouts as a reason for (as opposed to a solution to) Japan's Lost Decade(s).
