# Tertiary Recovery
## What Is Tertiary Recovery?

Tertiary recovery, otherwise called [enhanced oil recovery (EOR)](/enhanced-oil-recovery), is the third stage used to remove oil from an oil reserve.

Since it is more costly and costly than the [primary recovery](/primary-recovery) and secondary recovery stages, tertiary recovery is possibly carried out when the price of oil is adequately high to legitimize the investment.

## How Tertiary Recovery Works

The primary recovery stage of removing oil from a reserve works by taking advantage of the natural disparity in pressure between the surface of the oil well and its underground reserves. Commonly, this is finished by expanding the pressure inside the oil reserve utilizing injections of steam or natural gas.

Despite the fact that there are numerous specific tertiary recovery methods, all varieties of this stage of extraction generally depend on straightforwardly affecting the synthetic structure of the oil staying in the reserve. The course of tertiary recovery depends on injections that are intended to diminish the thickness of the leftover oil, consequently making it simpler to extricate.

While the primary and secondary recovery phases normally separate somewhere in the range of 10% and 40% of the accessible well, tertiary recovery is utilized to recuperate the excess portion. On account of its increased cost, nonetheless, asset extraction companies may intentionally abandon oil wells without advancing to tertiary recovery in the event that the price of oil isn't adequately high to legitimize the expense.

There are three primary methods of tertiary recovery, including the utilization of intensity, gas, and compound injections, individually.

In the warm recovery method, the repository is warmed through the injection of water, which rapidly changes over into steam. The steam then warms the oil, making it lose consistency and in this manner flow all the more effectively toward the lower-pressure area of the surface.

The gas injection method capabilities by pumping gases, like carbon dioxide, nitrogen, or natural gas, into the repository. These gases then extend, expanding the pressure of the supply and in this way pushing the oil toward the surface.

Finally, compound injections include pumping polymers into the repository to bring down the surface pressure of the oil. Similarly as with different methods, this approach permits the oil to flow all the more uninhibitedly toward the surface. Due to its extra complexity and environmental worries, in any case, it is undeniably more uncommon than the warm or gas injection methods.

Some of the time carbon dioxide is utilized in tertiary recovery. In the past, the carbon dioxide utilized for this type of recovery came from naturally-happening carbon dioxide reserves. Notwithstanding, it is currently conceivable to harvest carbon dioxide from natural gas processors, and from manure and ethanol production plants. Pipelines can then move carbon dioxide to the injection site, consequently making tertiary recovery more widely open and efficient than it was in the past. The utilization of carbon dioxide in tertiary recovery shows huge potential for expanding the reasonableness of these recovery methods.

## Highlights
- Specific types of tertiary recovery incorporate warm injection, gas injection, and synthetic injection.
- Since it is more costly and costly than the primary recovery and secondary stages of oil recovery, tertiary recovery is just utilized once the primary and secondary recovery methods have been exhausted.
- Tertiary recovery is a method for extricating oil from an oil reserve.
