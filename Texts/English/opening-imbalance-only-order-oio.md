# Opening Imbalance Only Order (OIO)
## WHAT IS AN Opening Imbalance Only Order (OIO)

Opening Imbalance Only Orders (OIO) are a type of [limit order](/limitorder) that gives liquidity during the opening cross on the Nasdaq. A limit order is an order set with a brokerage to execute a buy or sell transaction at a set number of shares and a predetermined limit price.

## BREAKING DOWN Opening Imbalance Only Order (OIO)

Opening Imbalance Only (OIO) orders are only executable on the [opening cross](/opening-cross) and are not shown or spread. OIO buy orders only execute at or below the 9:30 a.m. [bid](/bid) price, while OIO sell orders only execute at or over the 9:30 a.m. offer price. OIO orders must fundamentally be limit orders, and market OIO orders are not permitted. Since OIO orders are only executable during the opening cross, they are not at risk of being executed prior to market open, dissimilar to continuous market orders.

OIO buy or sell orders priced more forcefully than the 9:30 a.m. Nasdaq highest bid or most minimal offer prior to market open will be re-priced to the Nasdaq bid or offer before the opening cross is executed.

Thus, for instance, on the off chance that an OIO buy order price is $9.95 and the Nasdaq bid is at $9.93, the OIO order will be re-priced to $9.93. This adds [liquidity](/liquidity) to the market and guarantees that Market-On-Open (MOO) and [Limit-On-Open (LOO)](/limitonopenorder) orders are appropriately executed.

OIO orders are accepted on the Nasdaq from 7 a.m. onward. In any case, market participants can't refresh these orders after 9:28 a.m., albeit new OIO orders can in any case be placed after that time.
