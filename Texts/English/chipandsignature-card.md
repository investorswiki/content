# Chip-and-Signature Card
## What Is a Chip-and-Signature Card?

A chip-and-signature card is a type of [credit card](/creditcard) that encodes its information in a magnetic stripe as well as a square microchip. The inclusion of the microchip upgrades the security of the credit card by permitting individual transaction information to be recorded with each purchase. While utilizing the card, customers must enter their card's microchip into the card reader and likewise give their signature on the subsequent receipt.

## How a Chip-and-Signature Card Works

Chip-and-signature cards are a further developed rendition of the simple [magnetic stripe](/magnetic-stripe-card) cards that went before them. While paying utilizing a magnetic stripe card, the customer must sign their check to confirm the transaction. Notwithstanding, this method of payment is generally vulnerable to credit card [fraud](/fraud), since there isn't anything forestalling an eventual credit card cheat from basically utilizing a made-up signature.

To help relieve against this risk, chip-and-signature cards incorporate a small [microchip](/chip-card) that is genuinely embedded into the card. While the magnetic stripe encodes static information about the card and its owner, the microchip produces unique data for every transaction that is made utilizing the card. Consequently, it is far simpler to trace purchases made utilizing chip-and-signature cards, since those cards produce a nitty gritty history of their transactions.

## Development of Chip-and-Signature Cards

The development of chip-and-signature cards was made possible in part by the [Europay, Mastercard, and Visa](/emv) (EMV) technology standards. As its name recommends, these standards were jointly developed by major credit card companies like Europay, Mastercard (MA), and Visa (V).

Through these standards, manufacturers and service suppliers had the option to guarantee that the rollout of chip-and-signature cards happened quickly and with limited interruptions. For example, partly through these standards merchants' [point of sale](/point-of-sale) (POS) terminals are able to acknowledge payments from numerous types of credit cards.

Proceeding, almost certainly, credit cards will keep on changing as new advances become available. One such model is [near-field communication](/near-field-communication-nfc) (NFC), a technology that permits payments to be made by essentially tapping the credit card on a POS terminal. In these "contactless" transactions, the customer isn't required to enter a [PIN](/individual ID number) or a signature. All things being equal, the transaction is authorized and completed nearly immediately, substantially decreasing the time required to make a sale.

## Liability and Chip-and-Signature Cards

In 2015, it was resolved that the [liability](/liability) of fraud would fall on the party that was the least EMV consistent. In the event that a merchant doesn't take on chip-and-signature card technology, depending just on traditional magnetic stripe technology, it would be responsible for any fraud. This could be seriously damaging to small companies that probably won't have the option to assimilate large costs associated with fraud.

On the off chance that a business is EMV consistent, the liability of fraud falls on the credit card company or the responsible bank. This is important to note in light of the fact that the rollout of chip-and-signature cards at first was a rough road. Consumers initially needed to embed their card into a reader and then sign the receipt, making the payment interaction longer and not quite the same as what they were utilized to with traditional magnetic stripe cards. That requirement is as of now excessive as of April 15, 2018.

Many businesses kept away from and still try not to embrace the technology to offer a simpler support to their customers. Embracing chip-and-signature card technology, however, is turning out to be less of an issue with the increased utilization of contactless payments. While it isn't right now mandatory for merchants, the expected liability for fraud acts as an incentive to take on the technology.
