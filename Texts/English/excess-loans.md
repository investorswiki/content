# Excess Loan
## What Is an Excess Loan?

An excess loan is a loan made by a national or state-contracted bank to an over the individual loan lending limit as laid out by law. The legal lending limit lays out the rule that national banks and savings associations can't loan over 15% of their capital to any one borrower, plus an extra 10% limit assuming they qualify. Regulators maintain that banks should bring down their risk of loan default by not making large loans to individual borrowers along these lines.

## How an Excess Loan Works

By and large, banks must consider [aggregate liability](/aggregate-limit-liability) while computing the lending limit for a single borrower. A borrower's aggregate liability alludes to all of the outstanding loan balances, overdrafts, letters of credit, guidance lines, internal guidance lines, unused commitments, and different liabilities that the borrower conveys with that bank. A bank must consider an individual borrower's whole aggregate liability to keep away from an excess loan.

There are a few special cases for aggregate-liability rules, be that as it may, for the most part founded on combination rules. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation's 12 CFR Part 32.5 characterizes the combination rules and subtleties on what to consolidate and when to decide a borrower's aggregate liability.

The calculation might be more muddled than just adding up a borrower's total debt from all loans, overdrafts, lines of credit, and different obligations. For instance, special rules might be in effect for loans made to business partnerships or with respect to various loans combined to purchase a single asset.

## How Do Banks Use Excess Loans?

In the event that a bank decides to make an excess loan, the bank's board of directors could turn out to be personally responsible for the loan if the borrower goes into default. This means that most banks are very conservative in ascertaining aggregate liability and sticking to lending limits. For most banks, collecting all extensions of credit to individual borrowers or related borrowers — even to inexactly related borrowers — is viewed as a prudent means of keeping away from excess loans and the personal liability that comes connected to them.

In any case, in the event that a bank's director guarantees a loan to utilize their financial strength to upgrade it, that loan might be excluded from those for which they are personally, unexpectedly at risk while computing aggregate liability for adherence to the legal lending limit.

## Features
- An excess loan is a loan made by a financial institution to an over the person loan still up in the air by law.
- Making an excess loan puts the bank's board of directors at risk for being personally obligated for the loan in the event that the borrower defaults. Subsequently, banks are incredibly conservative and will more often than not stick to lending limits.
- National banks or savings associations can loan a maximum of 15% of their capital to an individual borrower, plus up to 10% on the off chance that the person meets certain capabilities.
