# Market Risk
## What Is Market Risk?

Market risk is the possibility that an individual or other entity will encounter losses due to factors that influence the overall performance of investments in the [financial markets](/financial-market).

## Understanding Market Risk

Market risk and [specific risk](/specificrisk) (unsystematic) make up the two major categories of investment risk. Market risk, likewise called "[systematic risk](/systematicrisk)," **cannot** be killed through diversification, however it tends to be hedged in alternate ways. Wellsprings of market risk incorporate [recessions](/downturn), political turmoil, changes in interest rates, natural debacles, and fear monger assaults. Systematic, or market risk, will in general influence the whole market simultaneously.

This can be stood out from [unsystematic risk](/unsystematicrisk), which is unique to a specific company or industry. Otherwise called "nonsystematic risk," "specific risk," "diversifiable risk" or "lingering risk," with regards to an investment portfolio, unsystematic risk can be decreased through [diversification](/diversification).

Market risk exists in view of price changes. The standard deviation of changes in the prices of stocks, currencies, or commodities is alluded to as price volatility. [Volatility](/volatility) is rated in annualized terms and might be communicated as an absolute number, for example, $10, or a percentage of the initial value, for example, 10%.

## Special Considerations

Public corporations in the United States are required by the [Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)](/sec) to uncover how their productivity and results might be linked to the performance of the financial markets. This prerequisite is intended to detail a company's exposure to financial risk. For instance, a company giving derivative investments or foreign exchange futures might be more presented to financial risk than companies that don't give these types of investments. This data assists investors and traders with settling on choices in light of their own risk management rules.

## Different Types of Risk

As opposed to the market's overall risk, specific risk or "unsystematic risk" is tied straightforwardly to the performance of a specific security and can be protected against through investment diversification. One illustration of unsystematic risk is a company bowing out of all financial obligations, in this way making its stock worthless to investors.

The most common types of market risks incorporate interest rate risk, equity risk, currency risk, and commodity risk.

- [Interest rate risk](/interestraterisk) covers the volatility that might accompany interest rate vacillations due to fundamental factors, for example, central bank declarations connected with changes in [monetary policy](/monetarypolicy). This risk is generally applicable to investments in fixed-income securities, like bonds.
- Equity risk is the risk implied in the changing prices of stock investments,
- [Commodity risk](/commodity-price-risk) covers the changing prices of commodities like crude oil and corn.
- [Currency risk](/currencyrisk), or exchange-rate risk, emerges from the change in the price of one currency comparable to another. Investors or firms holding assets in another country are subject to currency risk.

Investors can use hedging strategies to safeguard against volatility and market risk. Targeting specific securities, investors can buy [put options](/putoption) to safeguard against a downside move, and investors who need to hedge a large portfolio of stocks can use index options.

## Measuring Market Risk

To measure market risk, investors and analysts utilize the [value-at-risk (VaR)](/var) method. VaR modeling is a statistical risk management method that evaluates a stock or portfolio's likely loss as well as the likelihood of that potential loss happening. While notable and widely used, the VaR method requires certain suspicions that limit its precision. For instance, it expects that the cosmetics and content of the portfolio being measured are unchanged over a predetermined period. However this might be acceptable for short-term skylines, it might give less accurate measurements to long-term investments.

[Beta](/beta) is one more pertinent risk metric, as it measures the volatility or market risk of a security or portfolio in comparison to the market as a whole. It is utilized in the [capital asset pricing model (CAPM)](/capm) to compute the expected return of an asset.
