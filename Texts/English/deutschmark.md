## What Was the Deutschmark?

The Deutschmark (or "D-mark") was the official currency of the Federal Republic of Germany until 2002. First issued in 1948, it was legal tender in West Germany, and later, the unified German state until the last adoption of the [euro](/euro) (EUR) in 2002. The official currency code was DEM on forex markets.

## Figuring out the Deutschmark

Deutschmark coins and banknotes were left in circulation until 2002, when they were removed from circulation and quit being legal tender. The German central bank, the Deutsche Bundesbank, keeps on permitting the conversion of the Deutschmark into euros.

The Deutschmark was for some time thought about perhaps of the most stable currency, particularly compared to the currencies of other European countries.

The presentation of the Deutschmark came toward the finish of World War II in 1948. The currency was a feasible alternative currency to the Metallurgische Forschungsgesellschaft (MEFO) bills and the reichsmark utilized in the Western Occupation Zone.

MEFO bills were a [promissory note](/promissorynote) issued to finance German rearmament in 1934. To conceal its illegal rearming, Germany sold the MEFO bills as funding for fanciful organizations. The MEFO bills themselves were technically promissory notes from such non-existing organizations.

At the same time, the German economy and industrial spine had fallen. During the immediate post-war period, most transactions happened through [barter](/barter).

The Federal Republic of Germany, referred to commonly as West Germany, adopted the D-Mark formally in 1949. Because of this adoption at a [exchange rate](/exchangerate) of 1 D-Mark to 10 R-Marks, was the quittance of almost 90% of both public and private debt. This action helped the economy rebound and stayed away from the pre-war [hyperinflation](/hyperinflation) and wartime and post-war black market which choked the country during the war years.

The Soviet Union, in control of the eastern portion of the region, saw the presentation of the D-Mark as a threat. This threat caused the closing of all road, stream, and rail joins between the Allied zones and prompted the Berlin Blockade.

## D-Mark Stability and Its East German Counterpart

The Deutschmark earned a reputation as a dependable, stable currency during the last half of the twentieth century. This stability was because of a few factors, including the judiciousness of the [Bundesbank](/bundesbank), the national bank of Germany, and the intelligent political obstruction with the currency.

Compared to the French franc (F) and the Italian lire, German currency retained its value even in times of economic disturbance. As a matter of fact, the policies which prompted the stability of the Deutschmark form the basis of the current European Central Bank's policies towards the euro.

In the mean time, in the socialist German Democratic Republic, commonly alluded to as East Germany, the Ostmark coursed. This currency was carefully controlled and regulated by the socialist government. It was rarely widely accepted and was immediately sidelined.

With the 1990 reunification of the two Germanys, the more grounded Deutschmark turned into the common currency. The unified country started conversion to the euro (EUR) in 1999 and became legal tender in 2002.
