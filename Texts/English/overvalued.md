## Understanding Overvalued Stocks

Relative earnings analysis is the most common method for identifying an overvalued stock. This metric compares earnings to some comparable market value, like price. The most popular comparison is the [P/E ratio](/price-earningsratio), which analyzes a company's stock price relative to its earnings.

Analysts searching for stocks to short might seek overvalued companies with high P/E ratios, particularly when compared to other companies in the same sector or [peer group](/peer-group). For example, assume a company has a stock price of $100 and [earnings per share](/eps) of $2. The calculation of its P/E ratio is determined by separating the price by the earnings ($100/$2 = 50). Thus, in this example, the security is trading at 50 times earnings.

In the event that that same company has a banner year and makes $10 in EPS, the new P/E ratio is $100 divided by $10, or 10 times ($100/$10 = 10). The vast majority would consider the company to be overvalued at a P/E of 50, yet possibly undervalued at 10.
