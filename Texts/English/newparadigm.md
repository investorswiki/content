# New Paradigm
## What's going on Paradigm?

In investing, another paradigm is a progressive new concept or approach to doing things that replaces old convictions and approaches to getting things done.

## Seeing New Paradigm

New paradigms are established in the possibility of [paradigm shifts](/paradigm-shift), in which technology or new findings totally change the manner in which individuals think about or interact with a subject. Investors can observe new paradigms unfurl before their eyes as they track companies that are on the frontier of innovation. A stock might take off in view of its progressive approach to getting things done.

New paradigms might stem from a political or economic event, another finding in scholarly world, new technology or innovation, another business or business leader, or another important occurrence. New paradigm thoughts are progressive to the point that many individuals accept how we think and act proceeding will fundamentally change.

Investors should know, however, that not all new paradigms pan out. While companies like Amazon (AMZN) — which anticipated the demand for internet shopping and capitalized on it — saw great achievement, not all companies do. The drug [sector](/sector) is filled with companies "almost there" making world-evolving revelations, yet numerous medicines never leave the formative stage. Their stocks may (or may not) pop higher on speculative demand, just to fall right back to where they began, or lower.

Investors who bet on the companies that really start another paradigm, or capitalize on one, can rake in some serious cash over an extended time, yet it isn't not difficult to track down these companies. These companies are frequently highly speculative, have negative [earnings](/earnings), and are misunderstood in their beginning phases. It is just during later stages, when the price of the stock has climbed fundamentally, that most investors recognize the paradigm shift and begin to hop on. This can make a great deal of [volatility](/volatility), making it difficult for investors to stick with new paradigm stocks for the long take.

Amazon is a case in point. Somewhere in the range of 1997 and 2009, Amazon stock had seven drops of 60% or more, and the stock dropped by 95% somewhere in the range of 2000 and 2001. After its [initial public offering (IPO)](/ipo) the stock dropped by 46% before mobilizing off its lows of $1.50 per share. A few early investors might have profited liberally yet would have likely been [shaken out](/shakeout) by the numerous serious drops a long time before the stock price obscured $3,500 in 2020.

While Amazon flourished emerging from the [dotcom bubble](/dotcom-bubble) — which depended on the new paradigm of the internet — large numbers of the other internet stocks didn't. It took numerous years for dotcoms to recover price levels accomplish in 2000. Even Amazon didn't absolutely move over its year 2000 high until 2009.

> New paradigms don't necessarily in every case initially succeed. Numerous dotcom companies failed after the dotcom bubble, for instance, and those that endure did as such at altogether lower stock prices.

New paradigms are many times followed by a retribution since investors misjudge how much will change. They drive up [valuations](/valuation) too high, and the prices fall altogether after reality sets in. Eventually, companies need to create profits to legitimize high stock prices. On the off chance that the companies can't create profits, regardless of how novel their thought or product, investors will eventually become exhausted and abandon the stock.

## New Paradigm Examples

The term "new paradigm" turned into a widely involved phrase during the 1990s, as marketing firms and businesses started to involve the term for practically any new product or campaign. It was prominently utilized during the [dotcom](/dotcom) boom years. On occasion, it appeared to be that everything under the sun engaged with the internet was portrayed as "another paradigm" or a "paradigm shift."

The years in the late 1990s were characterized by high-flying tech stocks that eventually crashed. From 1995 to 2000, the technology-overwhelmed [NASDAQ](/nasdaq) index rose from below 1,000 points to in excess of 5,000 points. Technology companies turned into another paradigm for investors and analysts as their products and methods of thinking been able to fundamentally change the way that businesses worked and developed. The internet surely changed things, yet investors initially valued the companies too high. Their real value, at that point, was significantly lower than the pinnacle prices to which investors drove these companies.

The [Great Recession](/great-recession) likewise gave another paradigm to numerous investors, as the thought of uncovering and supporting more sustainable investments came into the spotlight. It became important to certain investors and asset managers to consider [environmental, social, and governance (ESG)](/environmental-social-and-governance-esg-models) factors while investing. As became obvious with the housing bubble and crisis, complex financial instruments like mortgage-backed securities without sound underlying assets proved tragic.
