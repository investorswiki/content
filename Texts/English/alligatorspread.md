# Alligator Spread
## What Is an Alligator Spread?

An alligator spread is a trading [position](/position) that is bound to be unprofitable from the very outset due to the onerous fees and transaction costs associated with it.

Each [leg](/leg) of the spread might accompany its own set of trading costs.

Assuming the fees from these transactions become too large, the investor could lose money on the transaction, even on the off chance that the market moves in a generally profitable bearing. In such cases, the potential profits are "eaten" by fees, similar to an alligator.

## Understanding Alligator Spreads

Investors as a rule utilize the term "alligator spread" while alluding to trades made in the options market, particularly corresponding to convoluted positions including put and call options. These types of trades are intended to profit from the movement of a [underlying asset](/underlying-asset) inside a specific reach.

In that scenario, the investor faces a somewhat narrow window inside which to profit on the position; assuming that the different fees associated with that position are too exorbitant, it could be unimaginable for them to understand a profit on an after-fees basis, even on the off chance that the security moves in a great heading.

In theory, investors can stay away from this problem via carefully auditing the fees associated with the investment position they are thinking about. Notwithstanding, this can be challenging to do in practice, as there can be various sorts of fees included.

## Illustration of an Alligator Spread

Charlie is an options trader who is thinking about opening a position with shares in XYZ Corporation as the underlying asset. As of now, XYZ is trading at $20 per share, yet Charlie anticipates that the shares should experience greater volatility throughout the next six months. Specifically, he thinks there is a decent chance that XYZ shares will either rise to $30 or decline to $10 throughout that time period.

To profit from this anticipated volatility, Charlie purchases a call option that terminates in six months and has a strike price of $25. To get this option, he pays a $2 premium.

Albeit this call option permits him to profit assuming XYZ's share price builds, Charlie needs to position himself so he profits on increased volatility whether or not the price goes up or down. With that in mind, he purchases a subsequent choice, this one a put option which terminates in six months and has a strike price of $15 per share. To acquire it, he pays another $2 premium.

Seeing his position, Charlie feels he has achieved his goal. On the off chance that the price climbs to $30, he can exercise his call option and net a profit of $5 per share (buying for the exercise price of $25, and afterward selling for the market price of $30). Since every option addresses a ton size of 100 shares, that works out to a $500 profit. On the off chance that then again prices decline to $10, he can exercise his put option and furthermore net a $5 per share profit (buying for the market price of $10, and afterward selling at the exercise price of $15).

Despite the fact that Charlie's position looks sound on paper, it has one urgent flaw. Charlie failed to keep track of his transaction fees. In the wake of accounting for his premium payments, his representative's commissions, his [tax liability](/taxliability), and different costs, Charlie finds that these expenses will total more than $5 per share. Charlie, at the end of the day, has coincidentally found an alligator spread — because of the high costs of his position, he can't bring in money even assuming he is right in his prediction about XYZ.
