## What Is Preferred Stock and How Does It Differ From Common Stock?
Preferred stock is a unique type of [equity](/equity) that grants shareholders priority over common stockholders in terms of dividend distribution and — in the event a company goes bankrupt — asset distribution.
Additionally, most preferred stock comes with a fixed, regular [dividend](/dividend), unlike [common stock](/commonstock), for which dividends might possibly be paid at some random interval at the company's discretion. Companies can, however, lower or discontinue dividend payments on preferred shares assuming earnings slump, yet solely after discontinuing any dividend payments on common shares.
Unlike common stock, preferred stock generally does not bestow shareholders with voting rights (and when it does, these rights are normally limited). Additionally, because of the fixed income payments preferred stock regularly comes with, it is typically less [volatile](/unpredictability) in price than common stock, as less of its value is derived from company performance.
Preferred stock shares don't mature similarly [corporate bonds](/corporatebond) do, however for the most part, they do have a date after which they are callable. This means they can be returned to the company by investors for their par value. Like common shares, preference shares do have market value, yet it doesn't typically wander particularly distant from par value, which is the original share value based on which [dividend yield](/dividendyield) is calculated.
Overall, preferred stock can be considered a cross between common stock and a corporate bond in that it has characteristics of both an equity instrument (like company ownership) and a debt instrument (like fixed income payments).
## What Are the Advantages of Owning Preferred Stock?
Because its value comes generally from its fixed dividend payments, preferred stock is normally more stable in price than common stock, and this stability can be advantageous during times of economic uncertainty. Additionally, the dividends paid to preferred shareholders are ordinarily higher than those paid (if any) to common stockholders.
In some cases, preferred shares are convertible, meaning they can be exchanged for a predetermined number of shares of common stock. This can permit investors to switch gears, in a manner of speaking, from fixed income payments to potential [capital gains](/capitalgain).
In the event a company can't afford to pay dividends to all shareholders, preferred shareholders take priority over common stockholders. Essentially, in the event that a company goes bankrupt and must liquidate its [assets](/assets) to pay creditors, preferred shareholders are paid before common stockholders.
## What Are the Disadvantages of Owning Preferred Stock?
Preferred shares generally don't come with voting rights (and when they do, they are normally limited), so preferred stockholders don't ordinarily have a lot of say in a company's elections and major business decisions.
Additionally, because preferred shares aren't very volatile, they are less likely to go up fundamentally in value in response to company success. Of course, in the event that an investor is holding convertible preferred shares, they could exchange them for shares of common stock to make a profit assuming share price goes up fundamentally, however not all preferred shares are convertible.
## For what reason Do Companies Issue Preferred Stock?
Companies issue preferred stock for the same general reason they take out loans or issue corporate bonds or common stock — to raise capital. That being said, preference shares do have some advantages over these other money generating activities.
In the first place, preference shares, despite their similitude to corporate bonds, count as equity, so giving them lowers a company's [debt-to-equity ratio](/debtequityratio), the most famous [leverage ratio](/leverageratio) investors and analysts use to evaluate company debt-related health. Giving corporate bonds, then again, raises a company's D/E ratio, which doesn't send as good of a signal to the public.
Additionally, preference shares don't come with voting rights, so giving them doesn't take any decision-production power away from management.
