# A-Credit
## What Is A-Credit?

A-Credit is a designation that a lender may assign to a borrower with a high credit score. It is part of a letter-grading system a few lenders use to qualify borrowers. The better the borrower's grade, the lower the interest rate they are probably going to be charged on a loan or credit card.

## Understanding A-Credit

Lenders base A-Credit grade (or any other grade) on a number of factors. A major one is the borrower's credit score. The most widely utilized credit score is the [FICO score](/ficoscore) from Fair Isaac Corporation. It ranges from 300 to 850.

Lenders can utilize different grading scales, so letter grades are not always associated with the exact same FICO scores. For example, a few lenders should seriously mull over a FICO score of 650 to be an, some time some others could not. A few lenders will apply pluses or minuses to their letter grades, while others utilize stringently A, B, C, D, and so on. A plus or minus grade gives more depth to the score. For lenders that utilization pluses and minuses, a grade of A+ would indicate the highest [creditworthiness](/credit-worthiness).

## Why A-Credit Matters

Borrowers needn't bother with a perfect credit score to qualify for a loan, yet their scores do matter. Higher scores or letter grades can assist them with qualifying for lower interest rates, making loans more affordable, which thusly makes it easier to keep up with their payments and maintain their strong credit scores. Lower scores or grades can mean higher interest rates and make it harder to get a loan at all.

## Step by step instructions to Get A-Credit

FICO scores are based on a set of factors: payment history, total debt owed, length of [credit history](/credit-history), types of credit, and new credit. Lenders typically reward high FICO scores with a higher letter grade.

To achieve a high score, borrowers need to pay their bills on time, keep a low amount of debt, and show they are making reliable progress toward paying off any debts they have. It also assists with having more than one type of credit, for example, a credit card plus a mortgage or car loan. A more extended credit history can assist with supporting a score because it shows how well the borrower has handled debt over the long haul.

Under federal law, consumers can obtain at least one free [credit report](/creditreport) each year from each of the three major credit bureaus. The official website for that purpose is AnnualCreditReport.com.

Checking these free reports can assist borrowers with seeing where they stand and decide if they need to move along. It's also worth checking credit reports periodically to check whether they contain any errors or traces of [identity theft](/identitytheft), like unfamiliar accounts. The credit bureau websites explain how to challenge erroneous information.

After landing his most memorable position, Daniel applies for and is granted a [secured credit card](/securedcard). He makes regular utilization of the card and pays his bill on time each month. His credit score moves along. Therefore, he is approved for a conventional, unsecured credit card that offers more flexible terms and a higher credit limit. Daniel is focused and keeps on paying his month to month bill on time.

Over the long haul, Daniel's credit score ascends to 700, placing him in A-credit an area. Presently he ought to have the option to get his apartment and take out different loans in the event that he at any point needs to.
