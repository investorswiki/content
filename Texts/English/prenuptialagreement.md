# Prenuptial Agreement
## What is a Prenuptial Agreement?

A prenuptial agreement is a type of contract made by two individuals before going into marriage. This contract could frame each party's liabilities and property rights however long the marriage might last. All the more normally, prenuptial agreements frame terms and conditions associated with sharing financial assets and obligations in the event that the marriage breaks up.

## Figuring out Prenuptial Agreements

Prenuptial agreements have forever been a disputable subject for couples. Media depictions of prenuptial agreements show them as gadgets that VIPs and other comparative high net worth individuals use to cap the amount of wealth that an ex-spouse can claim.

Nonetheless, when carefully arranged and utilized accurately, a prenuptial agreement can be a fair approach to dispensing assets and obligations.

## How Prenups Work

Each state has rules for prenups, yet the American Bar Association notes that "all order that such agreements be procedurally and considerably 'fair.' Determining whether an agreement is fair requires information on essential principles of contract law like capacity, duress, fraud, and [undue influence](/undue-influence)."

Explanations behind going into these agreements shift, however wealthier spouses normally start prenuptial agreements to [protect property](/maritalproperty). What's more, more seasoned couples may each need such an agreement since they might have assets or retirement income to safeguard and secure and might need to see that children from prior marriages are granted part of their estate.

Prenups can be a source of conflict for couples, particularly in the event that one partner has substantially more wealth than the other. A percentage of prenups end up in court when the marriage disintegrates. A judge will be approached to conclude whether the agreement was fair and not forced. Courts generally take a dim perspective on prenups that are sprung on a spouse on or close to the big day.

A prenup generally contains a listing of each partner's individual assets, some sign of which individual assets will stay the property of every spouse in the event of a divorce, rules on how property acquired during the marriage will be separated in a divorce, language on responsibility for obligations acquired before and during the marriage, and some blueprint of spousal support, for example, [alimony](/alimony) should the marriage end.

Whether a prenup makes divorce simpler or faster is an open inquiry. Assuming one spouse requests that the court negate the prenup, that can open long and expensive litigation. Then again, an uncontested prenup means less discovery on things listed in the agreement and in this manner less sharpness all around. This means the court and lawyers will have less to do to.
