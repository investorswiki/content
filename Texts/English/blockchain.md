## What Is a Blockchain in Simple Terms?
A blockchain, at its generally fundamental level, is a digital ledger of transactions stored on a wide range of computers (called nodes) that are linked by a network. It is made out of a series of "blocks," which are basically digital bushels that can be filled with records of transactions. When the transactions in a block are confirmed by means of a consensus between nodes in the network, that block is "closed" and added to the existing, unalterable, ordered chain of previous blocks.
Most frequently, blockchains are utilized to buy, sell, trade, and record the ownership of cryptocurrencies (like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana) or other digital assets like NFTs. They can be utilized for different purposes also, however we'll get to those later on.
You can think of a blockchain similar to a chain-of-custody record for a piece of evidence in an investigation. Each time the piece of evidence (or on account of a blockchain, a digital asset like a Bitcoin or a NFT) changes hands, this transaction is recorded on an unalterable ledger.
Though a chain of evidence log can be altered or fashioned, a blockchain can't on the grounds that there are many duplicates of it on a wide range of networked computers that need to give on the authenticity of a transaction for it to be permanently recorded on the blockchain in any case.
The appeal of a blockchain is that it is a secure, unchangeable record of transactions that relies upon no central authority, similar to a bank. As such, nobody person, entity, or institution must be relied upon or depended upon for the blockchain to stay safe and secure.
At any point anybody that operates a node for a blockchain (or utilizes a blockchain explorer application) can see each of the transactions recorded on that blockchain, so the history and chain of ownership of any digital asset traded on it involves public record.
## How Do Blockchains Work?
Blockchains do two central things — work with transactions and keep records of those transactions.
Each blockchain client has their own cryptographic keys — one public and one private. At the point when a transaction happens, one party sends an asset to another party involving the last's public key as a kind of address. The beneficiary's private key is then used to demonstrate their identity so they can "open" and acknowledge the asset.
The nodes in the peer-to-peer network then, at that point, work to check the legitimacy of this transaction as per a protocol agreed to by the users of the network. When the transactions in a block are all checked, and there is a consensus regarding the order where they happened, the block is closed and linked to the previous block in the chain, and each node's copy of the blockchain is refreshed.
## How Are Blockchains Used?
Blockchains are most commonly used to conduct and record transactions including cryptocurrencies like Ethereum and Bitcoin, however blockchain technology can be helpful in numerous different settings too.
### In Cryptocurrency
At the point when people make purchases utilizing cryptocurrency, their transactions are worked with through a blockchain. A buyer utilizes a seller's public key to send them crypto, and the seller's private key opens the funds. This transaction is checked by nodes inside the network then embedded permanently on the blockchain.
### In NFT Trading
A NFT, or non-fungible token, is similar to a certificate of ownership and genuineness for a digital or physical collectible — frequently a piece of art. At the point when a NFT is made, it is "stamped" on a blockchain and can then be sold by its creator.
Whenever it is purchased, its ownership becomes associated with its buyer's identity on the blockchain, and this ownership stays in salvageable shape, publicly apparent, and irrevocable until the NFT is sold again, at which point the sale and new owner are recorded on the blockchain, etc.
### Outside of Decentralized Finance (DeFi)
Currently, blockchains are utilized principally for the transfer of cryptocurrencies and NFTs, yet they have numerous other likely applications and may become famous in various industries sooner rather than later.
One potential utilization of blockchain technology is inventory and transportation management. Since blockchains are great at tracking assets through time and between parties, they would without a doubt be helpful for large companies that deal with a ton of production and freight work, particularly when products or product parts must change hands commonly among manufacturer and consumer.
Another area numerous DeFi lovers accept could benefit from blockchain is voting. Electoral cheating is extremely uncommon, yet that doesn't stop pundits from stressing over it and even making allegations, and this situation isn't helped buy the way that current voting technology is fairly defenseless. Whether utilized in state or federal decisions, inside organizations, or across shareholders of public companies, blockchains could permit votes to be effortlessly recorded, chronicled, and checked through public and private keys.
Medical records present yet another utilization case — Most people move a number of times, and once in a while, records slip through the breaks between various urban communities, states, facilities, doctors, and insurance providers. In the event that every individual's medical record was embedded on a blockchain, everybody's data could be recorded sequentially, permanently safeguarded, and accessed by any doctor or provider with access to a patient's account by means of their private key.
Numerous other possible applications for blockchain exist, and we'll probably see the technology increase in conspicuousness across a number of industries in years to come.
## Are Blockchains Infallible? Could They at any point Be Hacked?
Blockchain technology is new an adequate number of that its weaknesses are as yet being investigated, however obviously money can be stolen in certain cases. As indicated by an article from MIT Technology Review, more than $2 billion worth of cryptocurrency was stolen between the beginning of 2017 and February 2019, yet the vast majority of these attacks have targeted crypto exchanges, where users can trade crypto without interfacing straightforwardly with a blockchain.
In terms of taking advantage of a blockchain itself, the primary threat is a supposed 51% attack. This happens when the greater part of the nodes on a blockchain work thick as thieves to split or "fork" a blockchain and fraudulently change its history, which can consider the double-spending of cryptocurrency.
51% attacks are conceivable on the grounds that, as a rule, just a simple majority of a network's nodes should be in consensus all together make changes. For larger, more well known blockchains, this is probably not going to happen, as such countless various users operate such countless various nodes that it is very impossible that a party could gain control of the greater part of them. For more modest blockchains with less users, in any case, 51% attacks address a real threat.
## When Was the First Blockchain Created and by Whom?
The first famous, decentralized, and notable blockchain was made as a transaction ledger for the cryptocurrency Bitcoin by an anonymous person or group utilizing the moniker "Satoshi Nakamoto" in 2009.

## Features
- Decentralized blockchains are changeless, and that means that the data entered is irreversible. For Bitcoin, this means that transactions are permanently recorded and visible to anybody.
- Various types of data can be stored on a blockchain, yet the most common use up until this point has been as a ledger for transactions.
- Blockchain is a type of shared database that varies from a common database in the manner that it stores data; blockchains store data in blocks that are then linked together by means of cryptography.
- As new data comes in, it is placed into a new block. When the block is filled with data, it is chained onto the previous block, which makes the data chained together in sequential order.
- In Bitcoin's case, blockchain is utilized in a decentralized way so that no single person or group has control — rather, all users by and large hold control.
## FAQ
### What number of Blockchains Are There?
The number of live blockchains is developing consistently at a steadily expanding pace. Starting around 2022, there are in excess of 10,000 active cryptocurrencies in view of blockchain, with several hundred more non-cryptocurrency blockchains.
### What Is a Blockchain Platform?
A blockchain platform permits users and designers to make novel purposes on top of an existing blockchain infrastructure. One model is [Ethereum](/ethereum), which has a native cryptocurrency known as [ether](/ether-cryptocurrency) (ETH). Yet, the Ethereum blockchain likewise permits the creation of smart contracts and programmable tokens utilized in [initial coin offerings](/initial-coin-offering-ico) (ICOs), and non-fungible tokens (NFTs). These are undeniably developed around the Ethereum infrastructure and secured by nodes on the Ethereum network.
### What Is a Blockchain in Simple Terms?
Basically, a blockchain is a shared database or ledger. Bits of data are stored in data structures known as blocks, and every node of the network has a careful imitation of the whole database. Security is guaranteed since assuming someone attempts to alter or erase an entry in one copy of the ledger, the majority won't mirror this change and it will be dismissed.
### Who Invented Blockchain?
Blockchain technology was first framed in 1991 by Stuart Haber and W. Scott Stornetta, two mathematicians who wanted to carry out a system where document timestamps couldn't be messed with. In the late 1990s, Cypherpunk Nick Szabo proposed utilizing a blockchain to secure a digital payments system, known as [bit gold](/bit-gold) (which was rarely executed).
### What's the Difference Between a Private Blockchain and a Public Blockchain?
A public blockchain, otherwise called an open or permissionless blockchain, is one where anyone can join the network uninhibitedly and lay out a node. As a result of their open nature, these blockchains must be secured with cryptography and a consensus system like proof of work (PoW).A private or permissioned blockchain, then again, requires every node to approved before join. Since nodes are viewed as trusted, the layers of security needn't bother with to be as robust.
