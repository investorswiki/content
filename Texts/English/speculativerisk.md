# Speculative Risk
## What Is Speculative Risk?

Speculative risk is a category of [risk](/risk) that, when embraced, brings about an uncertain degree of gain or loss. Specifically, speculative risk is the possibility that an investment won't see the value in value. Speculative risks are pursued as conscious decisions and are not just a consequence of uncontrollable conditions. Since there is the chance of a large gain regardless of the high level of risk, speculative risk isn't a [pure risk](/purerisk), which involves the possibility of just a loss and no potential for gains.

Practically all investment activities imply some degree of speculative risk, as an investor has no clue about whether an investment will be a blasting achievement or a total disappointment. A few resources —, for example, a [options contract](/optionscontract) — convey a combination of risks, including speculative risk, that can be [hedged](/fence) or limited.

## Figuring out Speculative Risk

A speculative investment is one where the [fundamentals](/fundamentals) don't show immediate strength or a sustainable business model. All things considered, the trader expects that the price might rise due to different reasons, or that future possibilities will dominate the current conditions. Such a security might have a high level of conceivable upside yet additionally a great deal of risk. This might be a [penny stock](/pennystock) or an emerging market stock that the trader hopes to turn out to be significantly more good later on.

A few investments are more speculative than others. For instance, investing in [government bonds](/government-bond) has considerably less speculative risk than investing in [junk bonds](/junkbond) on the grounds that government bonds have a much lower risk of default. By and large, the greater the speculative risk, the higher the potential for profits or returns on the investment.

A speculative risk can possibly bring about a gain or a loss. It requires input from the person hoping to accept the risk and is accordingly completely voluntary in nature. Simultaneously, the consequence of a speculative risk is difficult to expect, as the specific amount of gain or loss is obscure. All things considered, different variables —, for example, company history and market trends while buying stocks — are utilized to estimate the potential for gain or loss.

## Speculative Risk versus Pure Risk

As opposed to speculative risk, pure risk implies circumstances where the main outcome is loss. Generally, such risks are not willfully taken on and, all things considered, are many times out of the control of the investor.

Pure risk is most generally utilized in the assessment of [insurance](/insurance-inclusion) needs. For instance, should a person damage a vehicle in an accident, there is no way that the consequence of this will be a gain. Since the outcome of that event can bring about a loss, it is a pure risk.

## Instances of Speculative Risk

Most financial investments, for example, the purchase of [stock](/stock), imply speculative risk. It is feasible for the share value to go up, bringing about a gain, or go down, bringing about a loss. While data might permit certain suppositions to be made with respect to the probability of a specific outcome, the outcome isn't guaranteed.

Sports betting additionally qualifies as having speculative risk. On the off chance that a person is betting in which team will dominate a football match, the outcome could bring about a gain or loss, contingent upon which team wins. While the outcome can't be known ahead of time, it is realized that a gain or loss are both conceivable.

Assuming that you buy a [call option](/calloption), you realize in advance that your maximum downside risk is the loss of the [premium](/premium) paid in the event that the option contract terminates worthless. Simultaneously, you don't have any idea what your potential upside gain will be since no one can know what's to come.

Then again, selling or composing a call option conveys unlimited risk in exchange for the premium collected. In any case, a portion of that speculative risk can be hedged with different strategies, for example, claiming shares of the stock or by purchasing a call option with a higher strike price. Eventually, the amount of speculative risk will rely upon whether the option is bought or sold and regardless of whether it is hedged.
