# Load Fund
## What Is a Load Fund?

A load fund is a mutual fund that accompanies a [sales charge](/salescharge) or commission. The fund investor pays the load, which goes to remunerate a sales intermediary, like a broker, [financial planner](/financialplanner), or investment advisor, for his time and mastery in choosing a proper fund for the investor. The load is either paid upfront at the hour of purchase (front-end load), when the shares are sold (back-end load), or as long as the fund is held by the investor (level-load). Load funds might be diverged from [no-load funds](/no-loadfund), which don't carry a sales charge.

## Understanding Load Funds

On the off chance that a fund limits its [level load](/levelload) to no over 0.25% (the maximum is 1%) it can call itself a "no-load" fund in its marketing writing. Front-end and [back-end loads](/back-end-load) are not part of a mutual fund's [operating expenses](/operating_expense) and are typically paid out to the selling broker and the broker-dealer as a commission. Notwithstanding, level-loads, called [12b-1 fees](/12b-1fees), are incorporated as operating expenses. Funds that don't charge a load are called no-load funds, which are typically sold straight by the mutual fund company or through their partners.

Investors may automatically expect no-load funds are the better decision over load funds, however that may not be the case. Fees on load funds go to pay the investor or fund manager who does research and pursues investment choices for the client's sake. These specialists can figure out mutual funds and assist investors with pursuing smart investment choices they might not have the expertise or knowledge to make all alone. Paying upfront fees can likewise dispense with the need to sap investment returns by paying nonstop expense fees on the returns the fund accomplishes.

The fundamental hindrance, of course, is the load itself. No-load mutual funds now exist as options that carry no sales charge.

During the 1970s, mutual fund companies went under analysis for the high front-end sales loads they charged along with over the top fees and other hidden charges. Subsequently, they presented different share classes giving investors several options for paying sales charges.

- Class A Shares: Class A shares are the traditional front-end load funds that charge an upfront sales charge on the amount invested. Most class A funds offer breakpoint discounts that reduce the sales charge for purchases at higher edges. For investors with bigger amounts of money to invest over a long period of time, class A shares can be the lowest cost option due to the breakpoint discounts.
- [Class B Shares](/bshare): Class B shares incorporate a back-end load or [contingent deferred sales charge](/cdsc) (CDSC), which is deducted while selling the shares. Class B share funds don't offer breakpoint discounts, albeit the CDSC diminishes more than a five-to an eight-year time span. By then, the shares are switched over completely to class A shares with no back-end load. Some class B share funds additionally charge annual 12b-1 fees, which can increase investment costs after some time. At the point when Class B shares are switched over completely to Class A shares, the 12b-1 fees disappear. Class B shares with a low expense ratio can be a better option when more modest investments are made with a long holding period.
- [Class C Shares](/cshare): Class C share funds likewise charge a CDSC, yet it is typically lower than Class B shares. Class C shares depend all the more intensely on 12b-1 fees, which tend to be higher than Class B shares, and they can last endlessly. Class C share funds don't offer any breakpoint discounts. Due to higher 12b-1 fees, Class C shares can be the most costly option over the long term.
