# Variance Swap
## What Is a Variance Swap?

A variance swap is a financial [derivative](/derivative) used to [hedge](/hedge) or estimate on the extent of a price movement of an underlying asset. These assets incorporate exchange rates, interest rates, or the price of an index. In plain language, the variance is the difference between an expected outcome and the genuine outcome.

A variance swap is very like a [volatility swap](/volatilityswap), which uses realized volatility rather than variance.

## How a Variance Swap Works

Like a [plain vanilla swap](/plain-vanilla-swap), one of the two gatherings engaged with a var swap transaction will pay an amount in light of the genuine variance of price changes of the underlying asset. The other party will pay a fixed amount, called the strike, determined toward the beginning of the contract. The strike is normally set at the onset to make the [net present value](/npv) (NPV) of the payoff zero.

Toward the finish of the contract, the net payoff to the [counterparties](/counterparty) will be a hypothetical amount duplicated by the difference between the [variance](/variance) and a fixed amount of volatility, settled in cash. Due to any margin requirements determined in the contract, a few payments might happen during the life of the contract should the contract's value move past agreed limits.

The variance swap, in mathematical terms, is the arithmetic average of the squared differences from the mean value. The square root of the variance is the [standard deviation](/standarddeviation). Along these lines, a variance swap's payout will be bigger than that of a volatility swap, as the basis of these items is at variance instead of the standard deviation.

A variance swap is an unadulterated play on an underlying asset's [volatility](/volatility). Options likewise give an investor the possibility to estimate on an asset's volatility. However, [options](/option) carry directional risk and their prices rely upon many factors, including time, expiration, and implied volatility. In this way, the equivalent options strategy requires extra risk hedging to complete. Variance swaps are likewise less expensive to put on since the equivalent of an option includes a strip of options.

There are three fundamental classes of users for variance swaps.

1. Directional traders utilize these swaps to estimate on the future level of volatility for an asset.
1. Spread traders just bet on the difference between realized volatility and [implied volatility](/iv).
1. Hedger traders use swaps to cover [short](/short) volatility positions.

## Extra Variance Swap Characteristics

Variance swaps are appropriate for [speculation](/speculation) or hedging on volatility. Dissimilar to options, variance swaps don't need extra hedging. Options might require [delta-hedging](/deltahedging). Likewise, the payoff at [maturity](/maturity) to the long holder of the variance swap is consistently positive when realized volatility is more huge than the strike.

Purchasers and merchants of volatility swaps ought to know that any huge leaps in the price of the [underlying asset](/underlying-asset) can skew the variance and produce unexpected outcomes.

## Features
- In the event that realized volatility is more huge than the strike, payoffs at maturity are positive.
- A variance swap is a derivative contract where two gatherings exchange payments in view of the underlying asset's price changes, or volatility.
- Directional traders use variance trades to conjecture on future levels of volatility for an asset, spread traders use them to wager on the difference between realized volatility and implied volatility, and hedge traders use swaps to cover short volatility positions.
