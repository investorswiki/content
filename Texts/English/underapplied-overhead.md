# Underapplied Overhead
## What Is Underapplied Overhead?

The term underapplied overhead alludes to a situation that emerges when [overhead](/overhead) expenses amount to more than whatever a company really budgets for to run its operations. Underapplied overhead is ordinarily reported as a prepaid expense on a company's balance sheet and is balanced by inputting a debit to the [cost of goods sold](/cogs) (COGS) section before the year's over. Costs of goods sold are the [direct cost](/directcost) associated with the production of goods sold by a company. The amount of underapplied overhead is alluded to as an unfavorable variance.

## Figuring out Underapplied Overhead

Before taking a gander at how underapplied overhead functions, characterizing overhead costs is important. The term overhead is utilized to portray the costs associated with running a business. All the more explicitly, these are [expenses](/expense) that a business causes for its everyday operations except are not directly linked to the creation of a product or service. Overhead is important for businesses for a number of reasons including budgeting and the amount to charge their customers to understand a [profit](/profit).

Underapplied overhead happens when a business doesn't [budget](/budget) enough for its overhead costs. This means the budgeted amount is not exactly the amount the business really spends on its operations. For instance, when a company causes $150,000 in overhead in the wake of budgeting just $100,000, it has an underapplied overhead of $50,000. This is alluded to as a [unfavorable variance](/unfavorable-variance) since it means that the budgeted costs were lower than real costs. Put just, the business went over budget making the cost of goods sold more than expected.

As indicated above, underapplied overhead is reported on a company's [balance sheet](/balancesheet) as a [prepaid expense](/prepaidexpense) or a short-term asset. This debit thing on the balance sheet must be offset sometime not too far off. To accommodate this, the company's accounting department generally inputs a debit before the year's over to the COGS section and a credit to the prepaid expenses section.

When underapplied overhead shows up on [financial statements](/financial-statements), it is generally not thought about a negative event. Rather, analysts and intrigued managers search for designs that might point to changes in the business environment or [economic cycle](/economic-cycle). Should unfavorable variance or results emerge — in light of the fact that insufficient product was delivered to retain all overhead costs incurred — managers will initially search for feasible reasons. These might be made sense of by expected hiccups in production, business, or seasonal variation.

## Special Considerations

Dissecting underapplied overhead takes on greater significance for certain businesses, for example, [manufacturing](/manufacturing). Frequently as part of standard financial planning and analysis (FP&A) activities, careful survey on underapplied overhead can point to significant changes in operational and financial conditions. These can be valuable in evaluating [capital](/capital) budgeting choices and the allocation of limited resources from time, money, and [human capital](/humancapital).

Progressions in electronic [inventory](/inventory) and production management systems have extraordinarily facilitated the burden of complete operational reporting, frequently including underapplied overhead analysis. These improvements permit managers to better evaluate key operational [metrics](/metrics).

## Underapplied Overhead versus Overapplied Overhead

Underapplied overhead is something contrary to overapplied overhead. Overapplied overhead happens when expenses incurred are not as much as what a company accounts for in its budget. This means that a company comes in under budget and accomplishes a lower amount of overhead costs during the [accounting period](/accountingperiod).

Businesses must account for overapplied overheads too. This is kept in the contrary way that underapplied overhead is on the balance sheet — first noted as a [credit](/credit) to the overhead section, which is then offset by a credit on the COGS section and [debit](/debit) on the overhead section toward the fiscal year's end.
