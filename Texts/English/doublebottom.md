# Double Bottom
## What Is a Double Bottom?

A double base pattern is a technical analysis charting pattern that depicts a change in trend and a momentum reversal from prior leading price action. It depicts the drop of a stock or index, a rebound, one more drop to something similar or comparative level as the original drop, lastly another [rebound](/rebound). The double base seems to be the letter "W". The two times contacted low is viewed as a support level.

## What Does a Double Bottom Tell You?

Most [technical analysts](/technical-examiner) accept that the advance of the main base ought to be a drop of 10 to 20%. The subsequent base ought to form inside 3 to 4% points of the previous low, and volume on the resulting advance ought to increase.

Likewise with many chart patterns, a double base pattern is best appropriate for investigating the intermediate-to longer-term perspective on a market. Generally talking, the longer the duration between the two lows in the pattern, the greater the likelihood that the chart pattern will find success. Essentially a three-month duration is viewed as suitable for the lows of the double base pattern, for the pattern to yield a greater likelihood of progress. It is, thusly, better to utilize daily or week after week data price charts while breaking down markets for this specific pattern. Albeit the pattern might show up on intraday price charts, it is truly challenging to determine the legitimacy of the double base pattern when intraday data price charts are utilized.

The double base pattern generally follows a major or minor down trend in a specific security, and signs the reversal and the beginning of a potential uptrend. Subsequently, the pattern ought to be approved by market fundamentals for the security itself, as well as the sector that the security belongs to, and the market overall. The fundamentals ought to mirror the qualities of an impending reversal in market conditions. Likewise, volume ought to be closely observed during the formation of the pattern. A spike in volume commonly happens during the two vertical price developments in the pattern. These spikes in volume are a strong indication of up price pressure and act as additional confirmation of an effective double base pattern.

When the closing price is in the subsequent rebound and is moving toward the high of the primary rebound of the pattern, and an observable expansion in volume is by and by combined with fundamentals that demonstrate market conditions that are helpful for a reversal, a long position ought to be taken at the price level of the high of the main rebound, with a stop loss at the second low in the pattern. A profit target ought to be taken at two times the stop loss amount over the entry price.

## Illustration of a Double Bottom

Double tops frequently lead to a bearish reversal in which traders can profit from selling the stock on a downtrend.
