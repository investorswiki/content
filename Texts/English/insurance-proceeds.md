# Insurance Proceeds
## What Are Insurance Proceeds?

Insurance proceeds are benefit proceeds paid out by any [insurance](/insurance) policy because of a [claim](/insurance_claim). Insurance proceeds are paid out once a claim has been checked, and they financially reimburse the insured for a loss that is covered under the policy. Insurance proceeds are in some cases paid straightforwardly to a care provider (similarly as with medical coverage), however ordinarily, it is shipped off the insured as a check.

## Understanding Insurance Proceeds

At the point when an individual or business purchases insurance, they are protecting themselves against any adverse situation that could bring about a financial loss. The insured pays [premiums](/insurance-premium) to an insurance company for this service and as part of the arrangement, the insurance company is responsible to [payout](/payout) proceeds against checked claims that the insured documents. Insurance proceeds are the monies an insurance company pays to cover any financial loss.

Insurance proceeds are not just distributed when an insured individual records a claim. A whole course of assessing the claim, the contract, the degree of the damage, and once in a while police reports are required before proceeds can be paid.

Proceeds can be paid as one lump sum by the insurance company or in numerous portions throughout a specific time span, contingent upon the policy.

## Accounting for Insurance Proceeds

Insurance proceeds require some specific [accounting](/accounting) procedures. For instance, assuming that an insurance company pays for the loss, an accountant ought to record the full amount of the insurance proceeds and the full amount of the loss.

This is the secret: consider a fire that obliterates $15,000 of inventory that has a place with Company X. Since the insurance company covers the whole loss, the principal entry is a $15,000 [debit](/debit) to fire damage, and a $15,000 [credit](/credit) to inventory to eliminate the inventory from your accounting books. The subsequent entry is a $15,000 debit to cash-fire damage reimbursement, and a $15,000 credit to fire damage. This system zeroes out the amount of the fire damage loss on Company X's books.

In view of the amount of the insurance proceeds, a person might have a gain or loss. For instance, if $10,000 of [inventory](/inventory) is damaged in a fire and the proceeds are $7,000, the transaction ought to be recorded as a $7,000 debit to cash-fire damage reimbursement, a $3,000 debit to loss on insurance proceeds, and a $10,000 credit to inventory.

In the event that the proceeds check is bigger than the loss, the surplus is recorded as a gain. On the off chance that $10,000 of inventory is damaged, and the insurance proceeds are $12,000, record the transaction as a $12,000 debit to cash-fire damage reimbursement, a $10,000 credit to inventory, and a $2,000 credit to gain on insurance proceeds.

## Insurance Proceeds and Taxes

Insurance proceeds are tax-free as a rule, no matter what the type of insurance or policy. One exception is [disability insurance](/disability-insurance), which is taxable to the insured as income in the event that the insured utilized pretax income to pay premiums. Another is the point at which a homeowner receives insurance proceeds for a damaged or obliterated home that surpasses the property's adjusted basis. In this case, the profit is taxed as a [capital gain](/capital_gains_tax) except if a replacement property is purchased inside a predetermined period of time.

Generally, when a person receives insurance proceeds from a [life insurance](/lifeinsurance) policy because of the death of the insured person, the payout isn't taxable, and you're not required to report it as income. Be that as it may, [interest income](/net-interest-income) is taxable and reportable as interest received.

On the off chance that a life insurance policy was moved to you for cash or other significant consideration, the insurance proceeds exclusion is limited to the sum of the consideration you paid, extra premiums you paid, and certain different amounts. A few exceptions apply to this rule, yet generally, you report the taxable amount in view of the type of income document you receive.
