# The Wealth Effect
## What is The Wealth Effect?

The wealth effect is a [behavioral economic](/behavioraleconomics) theory recommending that individuals spend more as the value of their [assets](/asset) rise. The thought is that consumers have a solid sense of safety and certain about their wealth when their homes or investment [portfolios](/portfolio) increase in value. They are caused to feel more extravagant, even if their income and [fixed costs](/fixedcost) are equivalent to before.

## How The Wealth Effect Works

The wealth effect mirrors the mental effect that rising asset values, for example, those that happen during a [bull market](/bullmarket), have on [consumer spending](/consumer-spending) behavior. The concept focuses on how the convictions that all is well with the world, alluded to as consumer confidence, are reinforced by sizable increases in the value of investment portfolios. Extra confidence adds to higher levels of spending and lower levels of saving.

This theory can likewise be applied to organizations. Companies will more often than not increase their hiring levels and [capital expenditures](/capitalexpenditure) (CapEx) in response to rising asset values, likewise to that saw on the consumer side.

This means [economic growth](/economicgrowth) ought to fortify during bull markets â€” and disintegrate in [bear markets](/bearmarket).

## Special Considerations

From the start, the idea that the wealth effect spurs personal consumption checks out. It is reasonable to expect that anybody sitting on tremendous gains from a house or stock portfolio would be more disposed to sprinkle out on a costly holiday, new vehicle, or other [discretionary items](/discretionary-cost).

By and by, pundits claim that rising asset wealth ought to smallerly affect consumer spending than different factors, for example, tax, household expenses, and employment trends. Why? Since a gain in the value of a financial backer's portfolio doesn't really compare to higher [disposable income](/disposableincome).

Initially, [stock market](/stockmarket) gains must be considered [unrealized](/unrealizedgain). An unrealized gain is a profit that exists on paper, however that still can't seem to be sold in return for cash. A similar applies to soaring property prices.

## Illustration of The Wealth Effect

Defenders of the wealth effect can point to several events when critical [interest rate](/interestrate) and [tax](/taxrate) increases during bull markets failed to put the brakes on consumer spending. Events in 1968 offer a genuine model.

Taxes were climbed by 10%, yet individuals kept on spending more. Even however disposable income declined due to the extra tax burden, wealth kept on developing as the stock market constantly moved higher.

## Analysis of The Wealth Effect

In any case, there is significant discussion among market savants about whether the wealth effect really exists, especially inside the setting of the stock market. Some accept the effect has more to do with [correlation](/correlation) and not causation, suggesting that increased spending prompts asset appreciation, not the reverse way around.

## Housing versus Stock Market Wealth Effect

While it still can't seem to be authoritatively associated, there is more robust evidence connecting increased spending to higher home values.

Economic lights Karl Case and Robert Shiller, the engineers of [the Case-Shiller home price indices](/sandp_case_shiller_index), along with John Quigley set out to research the wealth effect theory by arranging data from 1982 to 1999. The outcomes, introduced in a paper named "Looking at Wealth Effects: the Stock Market versus the Housing Market," found, "best case scenario, weak evidence" of a stock market wealth effect, however strong evidence that varieties in housing market wealth have important effects upon consumption.

The creators later extended their study of wealth and consumer spending in a panel of U.S. states to an expanded 37-year period, from 1975 to the second quarter of 2012. The outcomes, delivered in January 2013, revealed that an increase in housing wealth, like the rise somewhere in the range of 2001 and 2005, would help household spending by a total of around 4.3% over the four years. Conversely, a fall in housing wealth comparable to the crash somewhere in the range of 2005 and 2009 would cause a spending drop of generally 3.5%.

Several different financial experts have upheld claims that an increase in housing wealth energizes extra spending. Notwithstanding, others dispute these speculations and claim that previous research on the point has been exaggerated.
