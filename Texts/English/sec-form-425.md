# SEC Form 425
## What Is SEC Form 425?

SEC Form 425 is the [prospectus](/prospectus) document companies must file to uncover information about their business combinations. A business combination might allude to a merger between at least two companies, or a [consolidation](/consolidation).

Companies are required to file Form 425 as per Rule 425 and Rule 165 of the [Securities Act of 1933](/securitiesact1933), otherwise called the Truth in Securities law.

## Understanding Form 425

The Securities Act of 1933 covers SEC Form 425 and other [Securities and Exchange Commission](/sec) (SEC) filings for public companies. The act was developed after the [Stock Market Crash of 1929](/stock-market-crash-1929) and has two major points. The first expects that investors receive nitty gritty and exhaustive financial information about any securities offered for public sale. The second is to disallow misleading and deceptions that might occur during the sales of securities.

[Public companies](/publiccompany) must reveal essential information about their businesses, particularly with regards to changes that might influence shareholders. This information might incorporate things like changes in ownership, [annual reports](/annualreport), security sale proposition, initial registration, and even business combinations.

Companies might utilize SEC [Form 8-K](/8-k) to fulfill its obligations to give information compliant with Rule 425 in regards to written communications connected with business combinations.

## Types of Business Combinations Under Form 425

usiness combinations take place when at least two businesses join or converge to form a single entity. This means one business gets control over the other. Rather than [growing organically](/organicgrowth), it very well might be simpler for businesses to grow by combining. Companies must file Form 425 when they go through certain business combinations or [mergers](/merger), the absolute most common are made sense of in more detail below. The type of merger relies upon the economic function, purpose of the business transaction, and relationship between the consolidating companies.

There are generally five fundamental types of business combinations that require a SEC Form 425 filing:

- Conglomerate merger
- Market extension merger
- Product extension merger
- Horizontal merger
- Vertical merger

### Conglomerate Merger

A [conglomerate merger](/conlgomeratemerger) includes two companies that are unrelated in their business activities. Conglomerate mergers are genuinely rare. They can be unadulterated — including firms with nothing in common — or blended — including firms that look for product extensions or market extensions. One illustration of a conglomerate merger is the one that took place among Amazon and Whole Foods. The online business goliath purchased the supermarket for $13.7 billion of every 2017.

### Market Extension Merger

A market extension merger comprises of the combination of two companies that build and send similar products, yet in separate markets. We should utilize the acquisition of Eagle Bancshares by RBC Centura Banks. At the hour of the merger, Eagle Bancshares had very nearly 90,000 accounts and [assets under management](/aum) (AUM) of US $1.1 billion. The acquisition permitted RBC to fundamentally extend its financial services operations in the Atlanta area, as well as the North American market as a whole.

### Product Extension Merger

In a product extension merger, two businesses that operate in similar market with comparative products combine. This type of merger permits the two companies to access a bigger set of consumers and increase their [earnings](/earnings).

### Horizontal and Vertical Mergers

In a [horizontal merger](/horizontalmerger), business consolidation happens between firms that operate in a similar space. Since competition inside an industry will in general be high, a horizontal merger can offer participating firms certain [synergies](/collaboration) and expected gains in market share. This type of merger happens much of the time in view of bigger companies endeavoring to make more efficient [economies of scale](/economiesofscale).

A [vertical merger](/verticalmerger), then again, takes place when firms from various parts of the [supply chain](/supplychain) consolidate to make the production interaction more efficient or cost-powerful. These organizations will generally have a similar type of good or service in production or on the market. By going through a vertical merger, companies reduce the amount of competition. For instance, an automaker might choose to converge with a tire manufacturer, permitting the former to reduce the cost of tires for its cars.
