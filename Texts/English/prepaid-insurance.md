A prepaid expense is carried on an insurance company's balance sheet as a current [asset](/asset) until it is consumed. That is on the grounds that most prepaid assets are consumed inside a couple of months of being recorded.

At the point when the insurance coverage becomes effective, it is moved from an asset and charged to the expense side of the company's balance sheet. Insurance coverage, however, is in many cases consumed more than several periods. In this case, the company's balance sheet might show relating charges recorded as expenses.

As of November 30, none of the $2,400 has expired and the whole $2,400 will be reported as prepaid insurance. In any case, that changes once coverage starts.

On December 31, a changing passage will show a [debit](/debit) insurance expense for $400 — the amount that expired or one-6th of $2,400 — and will [credit](/credit) prepaid insurance for $400. This means that the debit balance in prepaid insurance on December 31 will be $2,000. This means five months of insurance that has not yet expired times $400 each month or five-sixths of the $2,400 insurance premium cost.
