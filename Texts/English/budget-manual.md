# Budget Manual
## What is a Budget Manual?

A budget manual is a set of rules and guidelines utilized by large organizations to prepare their budgets and related reports. As organizations become larger and more complex, it is at this point not feasible for just one person to prepare a budget.

All things considered, budgeting across the enterprise must be carefully organized among different entertainers. Financial [analysts](/examiner) work closely with each group to collect budget data on a pre-set schedule and afterward send data up through higher rings of financial [controllers](/regulator) until it very well may be collected by the [chief financial officer's](/cfo) (Cfo's) office.

## The Basics of a Budget Manual

Budgeting inside large organizations is a very complex task. Financial analysts must make presumptions about what the future will resemble in view of past data. This means that even the best budgeting process is subject to impressive errors. Then, at that point, as the year advances, each group is held to a predefined budget, which might become insufficient due to evolving conditions.

Then again, a few groups will find that they have more money than they require, and may decide to secretly go through the "extra" budget with pointless expenditures to keep away from budget cuts.

The budget manual is normally developed and changed by a [budget committee](/budget-committee). A budget committee is a group that makes and manages the standards for, practices to carry out, and maintenance of an organization's fiscal responsibility.

Budget committees play key jobs in the achievement or end of a company or other corporate entity. The budget committee has a unique point of view in that they are conscious of the financial comings in general and goings of an organization. They appreciate the situation from start to finish, though individuals in individual departments just see their segment of the company.

Committees try to keep their organizational budgets on target, which then guarantees smooth operation and financial solvency. Organizations that can't before long experience financial issues. Financial issues frequently adversely affect the valuation of a company.

For instance, the quality assurance department of the speculative XYZ company is permitted a budget of $500,000 each year. This money can be spent on salaries, extra training, gear and different things the quality assurance department needs. Cindy, a longtime veteran of the quality assurance department, has left the company. The quality assurance department can cover the responsibility and keep running just fine without her, however to guarantee they don't lose part of their budget for keeping up with their headcount, they need to hire someone else and spend the leftover money that would have gone to Cindy's salary on training for the new person.
