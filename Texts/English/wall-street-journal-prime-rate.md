# Wall Street Journal Prime Rate
## What Is The Wall Street Journal Prime Rate?

The Wall Street Journal Prime Rate is an aggregate average of the different [prime rates](/primerate) that 10 of the largest banks in the United States charge to their highest credit quality customers for loans with generally short-term maturities. This combined rate is gotten via a market survey and distributed consistently by The Wall Street Journal (WSJ).

## Understanding the Wall Street Journal Prime Rate

The prime rate is the interest rate that commercial banks charge to their most creditworthy customers. The federal funds overnight rate fills in as the basis for the prime rate, and prime fills in as the starting point for most other interest rates. The WSJ prime rate is one of the market's leading hotspots for exhaustive average prime rate reporting. The WSJ prime rate gets its name from **The Wall Street Journal**'s practice of surveying the 10 largest U.S. banks to see what their prime lending rate is. At the point when at least seven of the 10 banks surveyed change their prime rate, **The Wall Street Journal** distributes another prime rate. The current rate can be found on the WSJ's Market Page.

The WSJ prime rate has generally varied substantially after some time. In Dec. 2008, it arrived at a then low of 3.25% subsequent to being reported at 9.5% in the mid 2000s. In Dec. 1980, it arrived at a record high of 21.50%. As of Aug. Yet again 2021, it is down to 3.25%. Generally, the rate is directed by changes from the [Federal Reserve's Federal Open Market Committee](/fomc), which meets at regular intervals and reports on the level of the [federal funds rate](/federalfundsrate). The WSJ prime rate gives a measure to the prime rate at banks across the industry. The WSJ prime rate has generally been roughly 3% higher than the federal funds rate. In this way, the rate is vigorously influenced by the [Federal Reserve's](/federalreservebank) monetary policies.

## Lending Products That Utilize the Prime Rate

Generally, a bank's prime rate is the lowest rate it charges on lending to its highest credit quality customers (and furthermore to different banks). Banks can loan a wide range of products to borrowers at their prime rate. They additionally utilize the prime rate as an indexed rate for variable credit products. Products using a prime rate can incorporate [mortgages](/contract), home equity lines of credit and loans, and vehicle loans. Ordinarily a prime rate is most comprehensively utilized in variable credit products with the prime rate filling in as the indexed rate.

Indexed rate products frequently utilize the prime rate as the base rate of interest with a margin or spread determined by the borrower's credit profile. The prime rate is normally used in variable rate products as a [indexed rate](/indexed_rate), since it is widely recognized and followed across the industry. Other comparable indexed rates can incorporate [LIBOR](/libor) and U.S. Treasury.

In the event that a borrower has a variable rate loan or credit card, the terms of the variable rate changes will be revealed in their credit agreement. Lenders ordinarily base their rate spreads for variable rate products on a borrower's credit profile. In this way borrowers with a higher credit score can receive a lower margin while borrowers with a lower credit score will receive a higher margin. In a variable rate credit product, the margin continues as before over the life of the loan; be that as it may, the variable rate is adjusted when there is a change in the underlying indexed rate.

Borrowers with variable rate products will ordinarily need to follow the prime rate, and explicitly the WSJ prime rate, since it is distributed publicly. At the point when a majority of the banks surveyed by WSJ increase their prime rate, then, at that point, it is a decent indication that variable rates are rising.

For one illustration of a prime rate's influence, consider a Bank of America credit card borrower with a credit card balance that is subject to a variable [annual percentage rate](/apr). The borrower's margin is 15.99% plus the indexed rate, which is based on the bank's prime rate. For the borrower, this means that assuming the prime rate is 3.25%, their interest rate will be 19.24%. Assuming the bank's prime rate increases to 4.25%, their interest rate would increase to 20.24%.
