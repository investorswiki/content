# Market Average
## What Is a Market Average?

A market average is an indexed measure of the overall price level of a given market, as defined by a predefined group of stocks or different securities.

A market average computes the sum of all current values of assets in the group and afterward isolates that by the total number of shares in the group, which might incorporate different weighting or standardization factors.

## Understanding Market Averages

A market average measurement is a simple method for assessing the price level of a group of assets like stocks.

For instance, the Dow Jones Industrial Average ([DJIA](/djia)), which is a price-weighted average, covers 30 [blue-chip](/bluechip) stocks listed on the NYSE and is widely used to follow overall U.S. stock market performance. It basically takes the stock prices of its 30 components and afterward partitions them by the "[Dow divisor](/dowdivisor)," which is a number short of what one. The [index divisor](/indexdivisor) is continuously adjusted for corporate activities, like dividend payments and stock splits.

- The DJIA has been trading in the 20,000s for quite some time however couple of stocks at any point trade in dollars of that greatness, even assuming you added each of them 30 together.
- What compels the Dow a five-digit number is that its denominator is adjusted for stock splits, and there have been a ton since the Dow 30 was laid out in 1928.
- Each time a blue-chip stock splits, the denominator goes down to compensate. Today the partitioned by number isn't 30; it is nearer to 0.2.

To additional mess everything up, the components of the Dow today are not what they were the point at which the average was established: General Electric is the main original member still in the club, and Intel and Microsoft have supplanted Union Carbide and Sears Roebuck. Notwithstanding this large number of provisos, the Dow is as yet a widely-respected market average.

## History of the DJIA: The Most Prominent Market Average

Named for pioneer Charles Dow and his business partner Edward Jones, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is viewed as a proxy for the more extensive U.S. economy. At send off, it included just 12 simply industrial 12 companies. The first components worked in quite a while, cotton, gas, sugar, tobacco, and oil. General Electric is the only one of the original Dow components that are as yet a part of the index today.

As the economy changes after some time, so does the composition of the index. The Dow normally makes changes when a company encounters [financial distress](/financial_distress) and becomes less representative of the economy, or when a more extensive economic shift happens and a change should be made to reflect it.

The index developed to 30 components in 1928 and has changed components a total of 51 times. The primary change came just three months after the index was sent off. In 1932, eight stocks inside the DJIA were supplanted. Notwithstanding, during this change, the Coca-Cola Company and Procter and Gamble Co. were added to the index, two stocks that are still part of the DJIA in 2022.

## Features
- A market average is a method for getting an indexed measure of the average price levels in a market.
- Since various market averages are constructed and reported in an alternate fashion, they can give a heuristic relative measure of price levels and price changes.
- A market average is computed by adding up the prices in an index and partitioning it by the number of asset units (e.g., shares), or by an index divisor.
