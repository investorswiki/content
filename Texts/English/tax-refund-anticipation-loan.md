# Tax Refund Anticipation Loan (RAL)
## What is a refund anticipation loan (RAL)?
A refund anticipation loan (RAL) is a loan that advances a person's tax refund. The loan is an equivalent amount to a person's federal [income tax refund](/refund) and is repaid by the refund. The loans are not made by the government; generally, they are made by large tax preparation companies.
## Deeper definition
While RALs ordinarily charge 3 to 5 percent [interest](/interest), they are expensive as they often come with critical fees notwithstanding the interest charged. Assuming that the borrowers' tax refund is miscalculated or on the other hand on the off chance that the borrower does not receive the anticipated refund, the interest charged by the lender increases decisively and can reach 36 percent.
Due to their high costs, numerous financial experts recommend that people stay away from RALs, if possible. The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) permits borrowers to e-file, and most refunds take a few weeks to a month to process and can be naturally deposited into the borrower's bank account.
