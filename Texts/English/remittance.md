## What Is a Remittance?

A remittance is a payment of money that is transferred to another party. In general, payment of an invoice or a bill can be called a remittance. In any case, the term is most frequently utilized these days to portray a sum of money sent by somebody working to another country to their family back home.

The term is derived from the word transmit, and that means to send back.

## Figuring out Remittances

Most remittances are made by foreign workers to family individuals in their nations of origin. The most common approach to making a remittance is by utilizing an electronic payment system through a bank or a money transfer service like Western Union. Individuals who utilize these options are generally charged a fee. Transfers can require just ten minutes to arrive at the beneficiary.

Remittances play an undeniably large job in the economies of small and non-industrial nations. They additionally play an important job in disaster relief, frequently surpassing official development assistance (ODA). They assist with increasing the expectation of living for individuals in low-income nations and assist with combatting global poverty.

Truth be told, since the late 1990s, remittances have surpassed development aid, and at times make up a critical portion of a country's gross domestic product (GDP).

As per the World Bank's 2019 Migration and Development Brief, $529 billion in remittances were shipped off low-and middle-income countries in 2018 â€” an increase of 9.6% over the previous record high of $483 billion out of 2017. This figure is fundamentally larger than the $344 billion of foreign direct investment in these countries, excluding China, in 2018. Counting high-income countries, the total amount of remittances leaps to $689 billion, up from $633 billion of every 2017.

Remittances are likewise used to assist those living in less developed nations with opening bank accounts, a trend that advances economic development.
