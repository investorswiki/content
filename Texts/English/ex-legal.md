# Ex-Legal
## What is Ex-Legal?

Ex-Legal is a [municipal bond](/municipalbond) that is delivered without a bond law firm's legal assessment imprinted on it.

## Understanding Ex-Legal

An investor ought to approach ex-legal bonds with a greater degree of wariness in light of their lack of explicit legal endorsement. Most municipal bonds have the legal assessment of a bond law firm, or [bond attorney](/bondattorney), printed straightforwardly on them.

Bond law firms are locked in to furnish an objective legal assessment with respect to the legitimacy of bonds and different subjects, especially the tax treatment of interest on municipal bonds. The assessment, typically required by the two issuers and investors, is an objective judgment as opposed to the sectarian position of the advocate and approves the municipal security.

The bond assessment generally confirms:

- that the bonds have been appropriately authorized and executed by and are legitimate and binding obligations of the issuer
- the source of payment or security for the bonds
- whether and how much interest on the bonds is exempt from federal income taxes and from different taxes, if any, forced by the state of issue.

Bond attorneys might issue an unqualified legal assessment on a municipal bond where there are no reservations connecting with the issue. This is the best assessment an issuer of municipal securities can get.

An ex-legal bond, on the other hand, has not been checked to guarantee that it has observed all applicable laws in the course of issue. At times, a bond has been explored and the bond attorney has wouldn't underwrite it. Accordingly, ex-legal bonds are more profoundly exposed to legal risk than different bonds.

## What Causes an Ex-Legal Bond

Some bond law firms were awkward giving legal feelings on the tax-free status of municipal bonds while tax reform legislation was working its direction through Congress in the fall of 2017. Bond attorneys find it more attractive to issue sentiments in light of existing laws and regulations as opposed to depending on their own understandings.

Ex-legal bonds might receive a legal assessment, some of the time alluded to as a "contemplated assessment," that is conditional or generally subject to capabilities. A legal assessment generally isn't viewed as qualified in the event that it is subject to customary suppositions, limitations and capabilities or on the other hand assuming that the assessment is generally explained.

In the municipal securities market, legal conclusions have customarily been unqualified. Bond attorneys might deliver an "unqualified" assessment with respect to the legitimacy and tax exemption of bonds assuming they are "firmly persuaded" that, under the law in effect on the date of the assessment, the highest court of the applicable jurisdiction, acting sensibly and appropriately advised on the issues, would arrive at the legal resolutions stated in the assessment.
