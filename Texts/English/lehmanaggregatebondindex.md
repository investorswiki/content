# Bloomberg Aggregate Bond Index
## What Is the Bloomberg Aggregate Bond Index?

The Bloomberg Aggregate Bond Index or "the Agg" is a broad-based fixed-income [index](/index) utilized by bond traders and the managers of mutual funds and exchange-traded funds (ETFs) as a benchmark to measure their relative performance.

The Agg is to the bond market what the [Wilshire 5000 Total Stock Index](/wilshire5000equityindex) is to the equity market.

The index has been known as the Bloomberg Agg just since August 2021. It was for a long time the Barclays Agg. Bloomberg purchased Barclays fixed-income indexes in 2016 and, for the accompanying five years, named them as Bloomberg Barclays indices. All presently carry just the Bloomberg name.

## Understanding the Bloomberg Aggregate Bond Index

The Bloomberg Aggregate Bond Index is widely considered to be one of the most incredible total bond market indices.

The index incorporates government Treasury securities, corporate bonds, mortgage-backed securities (MBS), asset-backed securities (ABS), and munis to reproduce the universe of bonds in the market. It tracks bonds that are of [investment-grade](/investmentgrade) quality or better.

The Agg's history can be followed to before indices established by the Kuhn, Loeb and Co. investment bank in 1973. The investment bank made two indices â€” one that followed U.S. government bonds and a second that followed corporate bonds.

## Composition of the Bloomberg Aggregate Bond Index

The composition of the Agg index is intended to address the full scope of investment-grade bonds traded in the U.S. It is composed of in excess of 10,000 issues. U.S. Treasuries address almost 40% of the index. The excess components address the debt of major industries including real estate, industrial companies, financial institutions, and utilities.
