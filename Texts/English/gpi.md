# Genuine Progress Indicator (GPI)
## What Is Genuine Progress Indicator (GPI)?

A genuine progress indicator (GPI) is a measurement used to measure the [economic growth](/economicgrowth) of a country. It is in many cases considered an alternative measurement to the more notable [gross domestic product](/gdp) (GDP) economic indicator. The GPI indicator considers all that the GDP utilizes however adds different figures that address the cost of the negative effects related to economic activity, like the cost of crime, cost of ozone depletion, and cost of resource depletion, among others.

The GPI nets the positive and negative consequences of economic growth to inspect whether it has benefited individuals overall.

## How the Genuine Progress Indicator Works

The Genuine Progress Indicator is an endeavor to measure whether the environmental impact and social costs of economic production and consumption in a country are negative or positive factors in overall wellbeing and prosperity.

The GPI metric was developed out of the speculations of [green economics](/greeneconomics) (which considers the economic market to be a piece inside an ecosystem). Defenders of the GPI see it as a better measure of the sustainability of an economy when compared to the GDP measure. Starting around 1995, the GPI indicator has filled in height and is utilized in Canada and the United States. In any case, both these countries actually report their economic data in GDP to stay in accordance with the more far reaching practice.

## History of Genuine Progress Indicator

During the 1930s, the Roosevelt administration looked for ways of measuring the United States' economic output subsequent to establishing policies to address a faltering economy utilizing questionable data. The Department of Commerce enlisted National Bureau of Economic Research economist Simon Kuznets to lay out additional suitable economic metrics than what was recently utilized. In response, he presented to Congress his report "National Income 1929-1935", which brought forth the concept of gross domestic product (GDP).

> Prior to the 1930s, it was absolutely impossible to measure national income and output.

In any case, Kuznets cautioned that the GDP wouldn't have the option to measure the welfare of a nation. Thus, exactly 30 years after the fact in 1995, U.S.- put together organization Redefining Progress worked with respect to this thought, making a pathway for Clifford Cobb, Ted Halstead, and Jonathan Rowe to make the Genuine Progress Indicator (GPI), which comprises of 26 indicators. This new measurement was intended to characterize a nation's welfare by its economic measures as well as by the state of its social, environmental, and human conditions.

Since GPI is inexactly defined, specialists developed their own boundaries for which to measure economic welfare. The irregularities made it hard to compare one economy to another and, hence, delivered some negligibly helpful.

Two GPI summits were held to address these irregularities, and, thus, researchers and professionals modified GPI — GPI 2.0 — to streamline the accounting processes and supplant antiquated strategies that didn't give an accurate and complete image of an economy. A pilot is in progress in select U.S. states and Canada to test the viability of GPI 2.0.

## GPI versus GDP

GDP increments two times when pollution is created - once upon creation (as a result of some valuable cycle) and again when the pollution is cleaned up. On the other hand, GPI considers the initial pollution a loss as opposed to a gain, generally equivalent to the amount it will cost to clean up later plus the cost of any negative impact the pollution will have meanwhile. Measuring the costs and benefits of these environmental and social [externalities](/externality) is a troublesome task.

By accounting for the costs borne by the society as a whole to repair or control pollution and poverty, GPI balances GDP spending against outside costs. GPI advocates claim that it can all the more dependably measure economic progress as it recognizes the overall "change in the 'value premise's of a product, adding its environmental impacts into the equation."

The relationship among GDP and GPI impersonates the relationship between the gross profit and net profit of a company. The net profit is the gross profit minus the costs incurred, while the GPI is the GDP (value of all goods and services delivered) minus the environmental and social costs. In like manner, the GPI will be zero assuming that the financial costs of poverty and pollution equivalent the financial gains from the production of goods and services, any remaining factors being consistent.

## Benefits and Disadvantages of GPI

Genuine Progress Indicator (GPI) measures the economy comprehensively by considering economic indicators that the GDP doesn't. For instance, it accounts for negative externalities, like pollution and crime, and other social breakdowns that compromise the economy and the welfare of individuals it serves. These occasions make large cultural costs from the subsequent damages.

Benefits to society, like volunteerism, housework, and higher education are critical contributions to society however were largely disregarded in light of the fact that they were challenging to evaluate. Furthermore, as no consideration is given in exchange for these types of services, they are excluded from the GDP. In any case, to account for their impact on the economy, the GPI endorses values to each.

Accounting for these activities and occasions that usually have no assigned values can be tricky. Counting them expects values to be assigned, and these values can contrast in light of who is attributing them. This level of subjectivity can make it hard to compare GPIs.

Likewise, the broad definition of GPI takes into consideration various understandings and estimations. These irregularities can make it challenging to get an accurate accounting of factors and compare GPIs. They likewise make it challenging for GPI to be adopted as the economic standard of measurement.

## Genuine Progress Indicator FAQs
### How Is GPI Different From GDP?

Genuine Progress Indicator (GPI) factors in every one of the parts of the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and incorporates environmental and social components that impact the economy, like pollution, volunteerism, crime, and climate change. A few economists recommend that GPI is a better measurement than GDP as it gives a comprehensive perspective on the prosperity of a nation's economy.

### How Is GPI Calculated?

The GPI formula is GPI = C~adj~ + G + W - D - S - E - N

Where:

- C~adj~ = personal consumption with income distribution changes
- G = capital growth
- W = unconventional contributions to welfare, like volunteerism
- D = defensive private spending
- S = activities that negatively impact social capital
- E = costs associated with the weakening of the environment
- N = activities that negatively impact natural capital

### What Are the Component Indicators of the GPI?

The GPI comprises of 26 indicators, assembled into three categories (social, economic, and environmental). Each measures an alternate condition of the economy. Inside the social category, you will find crime, family structure, scholastics, and that's only the tip of the iceberg. In the environmental category, you will find pollution, climate change, and different factors that positively or negatively influence the environment.

### Who Created the Genuine Progress Indicator?

Taking on Simon Kuznets' disclaimer that GDP couldn't satisfactorily tell how a nation is faring overall, Clifford Cobb developed the Genuine Progress Indicator (GPI) alongside Ted Halstead and Jonathan Rowe in 1995.

## The Bottom Line

Genuine Progress Indicator (GPI) is an economic tool used to measure the wellbeing of a nation's economy. It consolidates environmental and social factors, for example, family structure, benefits from higher education, crime, and pollution, not thought about in the GDP. GPI decides if these different factors negatively or positively the economy, and can give an all encompassing perspective into what they mean for the lives and welfare of society.

## Features
- GPI is an alternative measurement to GDP however which accounts for externalities like pollution.
- The genuine progress indicator (GPI) is a national-level measure of economic growth and flourishing.
- Pundits propose that some GPI measures are too subjective, delivering it a less effective tool for measuring economic growth.
- In that capacity, GPI is viewed as a better measure of growth according to the viewpoint of green or social economics.
- Defenders recommend that GPI is a better measurement as it gives a full perspective on the strength of a nation.
