# House Maintenance Requirement
## What Is a House Maintenance Requirement?

A house maintenance requirement is the level of least [margin account](/marginaccount) equity that is required by a brokerage firm. House maintenance requirement levels depend on the standards set out in [Regulation T](/regulationt) of the [Federal Reserve](/federalreservebank).

Albeit Regulation T determines the base maintenance requirements permitted by law, [brokerage firms](/brokerage-organization) are free to change their own "home" maintenance requirements given that their standards are more thorough — that is, higher — than the base requirements set out in Regulation T.

## How House Maintenance Requirements Work

The purpose of maintenance requirements is to guarantee that investors utilizing margin accounts to make [leveraged investments](/leverage) don't find themselves unfit to repair their [margin loans](/margin_loan_availability). As such, maintenance requirements are planned to reduce credit risk for the brokerage firms. By extension, they aim to reduce the [systemic risk](/systemic-risk) that could somehow or another emerge from broad [defaults](/default2) by margin traders.

> House maintenance requirements typically range somewhere in the range of 30% and half. While [stocks](/stock) are the [security](/security) most usually purchased in a margin account, numerous different securities like mutual funds, Treasuries, corporate bonds, and options might be purchased "on margin" subject to fluctuating purchase and maintenance requirements.

As per Regulation T, margin traders must keep up with equity levels of no less than 25% of the value of their investments. In the event that they fail to keep up with this level, they might wind up subject to a margin call by their broker.

In this situation, the trader would be required to immediately deposit extra [collateral](/collateral) into their account. Assuming they fail to do as such, their broker can [liquidate](/liquidation) their investment positions to pay back their margin. Any remaining balance of the loan would then should be reimbursed separately by the margin trader.

## Bull versus Bear Markets

During [bull markets](/bullmarket), margin traders might view their maintenance requirements as unduly restrictive. All things considered, when asset prices are generally rising, it very well may be enticing to leverage however much as could reasonably be expected to boost their [return on equity (ROE)](/returnonequity).

Nonetheless, the risk of this rapidly uncovers itself once the market starts to turn. During bear markets or periods of sudden financial shock, for example, happened in the 2007-2008 financial crisis, margin traders are frequently confronted with critical risk.

The decline in portfolio values, combined with the need to repay large margin loans on short notice due to margin calls, can in some cases force margin traders into huge financial duress.

Frequently, these traders will relinquish each of the gains made in previous years, and may even be forced to liquidate other personal assets to repay their margin loans. Hence, according to this point of view, the requirement for maintenance requirements turns out to be substantially more clear.

## Illustration of a House Maintenance Requirement

The house maintenance requirement will frequently be higher than the maintenance margin set out by the Federal Reserve's Regulation T, which specifies that an equity level of something like 25% must be kept up with.

As well as keeping up with house maintenance requirements that are higher than the 25% commanded by Regulation T, brokerage firms frequently additionally have different house maintenance requirements for various account holders. Typically, this definition depends on the size, [creditworthiness](/credit-value), or perceived refinement of the client.

For instance, more modest and less experienced margin traders might be required to stick to a 40% house maintenance requirement, while larger and more experienced clients might receive a 30% threshold.
