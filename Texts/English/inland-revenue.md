# Inland Revenue
## What Is the Inland Revenue?

The Inland Revenue was a department of the British government that existed from 1849 to 2005. The department was responsible for collecting direct taxes, for example, [income tax](/incometax), and overseeing benefits, for example, child tax credits.

## Grasping the Inland Revenue

The Inland Revenue was first settled in the United Kingdom in 1849. In 2005, the department merged with Her Majesty's (HM) Customs and Excise to form [HM Revenue and Customs](/hm-revenue-and-customs-hmrc) (HMRC). The Inland Revenue was a 1849 amalgamation of two former government boards — the Board of Excise and the Board of Stamps and Taxes.

The Board of Excise, laid out in 1643, was in charge of collecting duties that were exacted at the point of manufacturing as opposed to the [point of sale](/point-of-sale) on certain British products. The Board of Stamps and Taxes was gone before by two separate boards that were formally combined in 1834.

- One of the boards was the Tax Board, which was set up in 1665. The previous taxes forced by this board included land and house taxes. Income taxes were presented in the late 1700s and mid 1800s in several distinct formats, generally to support Britain's war efforts. In 1816, due to broad public protest, the government was forced to cancel [income taxes](/incometax). Notwithstanding, they were once again introduced in 1842 and are currently reestablished yearly in the Finance Act.
- The subsequent board was the Board of Stamps laid out in 1694. This board effectively collected [stamp duties](/stampduty), which were forced on different things at the point of sale.

When the Inland Revenue was laid out, it dealt with the collection of taxes, including income and [capital gains tax](/capital_gains_tax), [corporate tax](/corporatetax), [inheritance tax](/inheritancetax), and stamp duty. Until 1909, the Inland Revenue managed the excise affairs of the nation. Be that as it may, matters connecting with excise were moved in 1909 to another board, the Board of Customs and Excise.

The Inland Revenue administered certain payments that were accessible to eligible beneficiaries. Beginning around 2003, a benefit called the [Working Tax Credit](/working-tax-credit-wtc) (WTC) has been given to working people, couples, or families with low income. One more credit system recently dealt with by the Inland Revenue is the [Child Tax Credit](/childtaxcredit), which was paid to families by the Inland Revenue until the origin of Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs (HMRC).

### HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC)

HMRC presently handles every one of the duties recently directed by both the Inland Revenue and the Board of Customs and Excise, bringing the nation's all's taxation-related matters under the protection of one department. A portion of the obligations of the HMRC incorporate bringing in certain that money is accessible to fund the public system in the United Kingdom and accommodating families that need financial assistance, controlling statutory sick pay and statutory maternity leave, facilitating genuine international trade, recuperating student loan repayments, and managing Child Benefit.

HMRC tries to amplify revenues, and one of the manners in which it achieves this objective is by cracking down on [tax avoidance](/tax_avoidance). HMRC planned the [Disclosure of Tax Avoidance Schemes](/dotas-disclosure-tax-avoidance-schemes) (DOTAS) to distinguish what types of tax avoidance schemes are in circulation. This requires the promoter of a scheme (i.e., the person who plans or markets it) to uncover its principal components to HMRC.

HMRC surveys and corrects the current tax policy to block any schemes that the government considers unfair. Along these lines, the tax policy is reliably amended to limit people's and organizations' possibilities keeping away from taxes.
