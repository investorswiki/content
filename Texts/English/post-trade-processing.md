# Post-Trade Processing
## What Is Post-Trade Processing?

Post-trade processing happens after a trade is complete. At this point, the buyer and the [seller](/seller) compare trade details, support the transaction, change records of ownership, and set up for the transfer of [securities](/security) and cash. Post-trade processing is particularly important in markets that are not standardized, like the over-the-counter (OTC) markets.

## How Post-Trade Processing Works

Post-trade processing is important in that it checks the details of a transaction. Markets and prices move fast; [transactions](/transaction) are executed rapidly, often instantaneously. Numerous securities [trades](/trade) are finished over the telephone; the ability for mistakes is inherent, despite traders' expertise. Progressively trades are executed at high frequency by computers as it were. The chance for small mistakes to compound remaining parts high.

Post-trade processing permits the buyer and seller of securities to root out and rectify these errors. In addition to matching the details of the buy and sell orders, post-trade processing incorporates shifting records of ownership and authorizing payment.

## Trade Clearing and Settlement

After a trade is executed, the transaction enters what is known as the [settlement period](/settlement_period). During settlement, the buyer must make payment for the securities they purchased while the seller must deliver the security that was acquired. Contingent upon the type of security, settlement dates will shift. To act as an illustration of how settlement dates work, let's say that an investor buys shares of Amazon (AMZN) on Monday, Jan. 28, 2019. The [broker](/broker) will debit the investor's account for the total cost of the order immediately after its filled, but the status as a shareholder of Amazon won't be settled in the organization's record books for the investor until Wednesday, Jan. 30. At that time, the [investor](/investor) would turn into a [shareholder](/shareholder) of record.

When the trade has settled, and the funds in any sale of stock or another type of security have been credited to your account, the investor might decide to withdraw the funds, reinvest in new security or hold the amount in cash within the account. For those hoping to cash out a portion of the profits (or what's left from a loss), check to check whether your broker offers transfers to your bank account utilizing the Automated Clearing House (ACH) or by utilizing a wire transfer.

[Clearing](/clearing) is the method involved with accommodating purchases and sales of various options, futures, or securities, as well as the direct transfer of funds starting with one financial institution then onto the next. The cycle validates the availability of the appropriate funds, records the transfer, and on account of securities guarantees the delivery of the security to the buyer. Non-cleared trades can result in [settlement risk](/settlementrisk), and on the off chance that trades don't clear accounting errors will emerge where real money can be lost.

A [out trade](/outtrade) is a trade that cannot be placed in light of the fact that it was received by a [exchange](/exchange) with conflicting information. The associated clearinghouse cannot settle the trade in light of the fact that the data submitted by parties on both sides of the transaction is inconsistent or contradictory.
