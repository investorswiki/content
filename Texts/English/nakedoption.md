# Naked Option
## What Is a Naked Option?

A naked [option](/option) is made when the option writer (seller) doesn't currently possess any, or enough, of the [underlying security](/underlying-security) to meet their likely obligation.

## Figuring out a Naked Option

A naked option, otherwise called an "uncovered" option, is made when the seller of a [option contract](/optionscontract) doesn't possess the underlying security expected to meet the potential obligation that outcomes from selling — otherwise called "[writing](/writer)" or "shorting" — an option. As such, the seller has no protection from an adverse shift in price.

Naked options are alluring to traders and investors since they have the expected volatility incorporated into the price. Assuming the underlying security moves toward the path inverse to what the option buyer anticipated, or even moves in the buyer's approval yet insufficient to account for the volatility previously incorporated into the price, then, at that point, the seller of the option will keep any [out-of-the-money](/outofthemoney) (OTM) premium. Typically, that has meant the option seller winning around 70 percent of trades, which can very pursue.

Selling an option makes an obligation for the seller to give the option buyer the underlying shares or futures contract for a relating [long position](/long) (for a call option) or the cash vital for a comparing [short position](/short) (for a put option) at expiration. On account of a put seller option, the ultimate effect is make a long stock position in the option sellers account — a position purchased with cash from the option sellers account.

In the event that the seller has no ownership of the underlying asset or the relating cash important for the execution of a put option, then the seller should get it at [expiration](/expirationdate) in light of current market prices. With no protection from the price volatility, such positions are viewed as highly powerless against loss and consequently alluded to as uncovered, or all the more conversationally, naked.

## Naked Calls

A trader who composes a naked [call option](/calloption) on a stock has accepted the obligation to sell the underlying stock for the [strike price](/strikeprice) at or before expiration, regardless of how high the share price rises. In the event that the trader doesn't possess the underlying stock, the seller should gain the stock, then, at that point, sell the stock to the option buyer to fulfill the obligation assuming the option is worked out. The ultimate effect is that this makes a short-sell position in the option sellers account on the Monday after expiration.

For instance, envision a trader who accepts that a stock is probably not going to rise in value over the course of the next 90 days, however they are not extremely sure that a potential decline would be exceptionally large. Expect that the stock is priced at $100, and a $105 strike call, with an expiration date 90 days later, is selling for $4.75 per share. They choose to open a naked call by "selling to open" those calls and gathering the [premium](/premium). In this case, the trader chooses not to purchase the stock since they accept the option is probably going to lapse worthless and the trader will keep the whole premium.

There are two potential results for a naked call trade:

1. **The stock conventions prior to expiration:** In this scenario, the trader has an option that will be [exercised](/work out). Assuming we expect that the stock rose to $130 on great earnings news, then the option will be practiced at $105 per share as that surpasses the [breakeven point](/breakevenpoint) for the option buyer. This means that the trader must gain the stock at the current market price, and afterward sell it (or short the stock) at $105 per share to cover their obligation. These conditions result in a $20.25 per share loss ($105 + $4.75 - $130). There could be no upper limit for how high the stock (and the option seller's obligations) can rise.
1. **The stock remaining parts flat or lower than $105 per share at expiration:** If the stock is at or below the strike price at expiration, it will not be worked out, and the option seller will keep the premium of $4.75 per share that they initially collected.

## Naked Puts

As you can find in the first results, there is no restriction to how high a stock can rise, so a naked call seller has theoretically unlimited risk. With naked puts, then again, the seller's risk is contained in light of the fact that a stock, or other underlying asset, can drop to zero dollars.

A naked [put option](/putoption) seller has accepted the obligation to buy the underlying asset at the strike price on the off chance that the option is practiced at or before its expiration date. While the risk is contained, it can in any case be very large, so brokers typically have specific rules in regards to naked option trading. Unpracticed traders, for instance, may not be permitted to place this type of order.

Basically, a seller who sold a put option is responsible to have a long stock position in the event that the option buyer works out.

## Highlights
- Naked options run the risk of large loss from quick price change before expiration.
- Naked options allude to an option sold with next to no recently saved shares or cash to satisfy the option obligation at expiration.
- Naked call options that are practiced make a short position in the seller's account.
- Naked put options that are practiced make a long position in the seller's account, purchased with accessible cash.
