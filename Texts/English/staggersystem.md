# Stagger System
## What Is a Stagger System?

A stagger system is a method of choosing a company's [board of directors](/boardofdirectors) that puts up just part of the board for re-appointment in any one year, rather than the system wherein all board individuals go on the ballot every year.

## Figuring out Stagger System

Staggers systems are common practice in the United States. Each group of directors falls inside a predefined "class" — of which three to five classes is the standard — which is the reason [staggered boards](/staggered-board) are likewise called [classified boards](/classifiedboard). Class 1 individuals serve a one-year term on the board, Class 2 individuals serve two years, Class 3 individuals hold their seats for quite a long time, etc.

Staggered boards make hostile takeovers incredibly troublesome. Hostile bidders need to win more than one [proxy fight](/proxyfight) at successive shareholder gatherings to assume command over the target company, which requires years. Therefore stagger systems are a particularly effective anti-takeover measure, particularly when combined with [poison pills](/poisonpill).

Safeguards of staggered boards say they advance stability and continuity in management, and that they likewise foster a long-term strategic vision for corporate drives. Be that as it may, by making it more challenging to supplant directors, and protecting companies from [raiders](/marauder), they can hurt shareholders' ability to hold the board to account. Thus, directors may not necessarily in all cases act in the interests of shareholders, which damages [shareholder value](/shareholder-value).

## Illustration of Stagger System

Company XYZ has 12 directors separated into three classes, each comprising of four directors. Every director serves a five-year term. Class 1 is chosen one year, trailed by Class 2 and Class 3 in subsequent years. Company ABC endeavors a hostile takeover of XYZ.

Notwithstanding, its endeavor is frustrated due to the class system of directorship adopted by XYZ. In one year, it can win the support of just a single class (i.e., four directors). When the next election happens a year after the fact, the conditions of XYZ's business have improved and ABC is forced to call off its bid.
