## What Is a Systemically Important Financial Institution (SIFI)?

A systemically important financial institution (SIFI) is a bank, insurance, or other financial institution (FI) that U.S. federal regulators decide would represent a serious risk to the economy if it somehow managed to collapse. A SIFI is seen as "[too big to fail](/too-big-to-fail)" and forced with extra regulatory burdens to keep it from going under.

## Figuring out Systemically Important Financial Institution (SIFI)

The [Great Recession](/great-recession) was essentially accused on financial companies taking on too much risk. Regulators recognized that nearer examination in the future would be central to forestall a repeat, noticing that many companies in this industry are profoundly imbued in the usefulness of the [economy](/economy) or, as they put it: too big, complex, and interconnected to fail.

The 2010 Dodd-Frank Act laid out the [Financial Stability Oversight Council](/financial-stability-oversight-council) (FSOC), giving it the authority to label banks and other FIs SIFIs. The goal was to forestall a repeat of the 2008 financial crisis, which saw largely unregulated institutions like American International Group Inc. require large citizen financed bailouts. Thinking that financial [contagion](/contagion) could start in unexpected places, lawmakers made the FSOC to look at companies as per the risk presented by their size, financial position, business models, and interconnectedness to different areas of the economy.

The SIFI label forces extra regulatory requirements and increased examination. These incorporate severe oversight by the Federal Reserve (Fed), higher capital requirements, periodic [stress tests](/stresstesting), and the need to create "living wills" — plans to wrap up operations without triggering a financial crisis or requiring a [bailout](/bailout).

## Systemically Important Financial Institution (SIFI) Requirements

The cycle for figuring out which companies are SIFIs has gone through certain changes in recent years. Already, FIs with more than $50 billion in assets were labeled as systemically important.

Then, in 2018, following a wave of protests from more modest banks battling to handle the costs of consenting to enhanced regulation, Former President Donald Trump, who depicted the Dodd-Frank Act as "an extremely negative force," endorsed into law a partial rollback. The bill increased the SIFI threshold to $100 billion and afterward as far as possible up to $250 billion 18 months after the fact.

The changes were expected to free many banks from thorough annual stress tests, bringing the number of institutions facing elevated investigation down to around 12. Those freed look set to save millions in regulatory compliance costs. Less oversight ought to likewise give them greater flexibility to extend their businesses.

All things considered, as indicated by section 401 of the bill, the Fed has the power to place the very limitations that larger banks face on institutions with assets as low as $100 billion.

## Reactions of Systemically Important Financial Institution (SIFI)

In the past, the most common way of deciding if a non-bank institution presents systemic risks has gone under heavy analysis. MetLife Inc. won a lawsuit protesting its systemically important status in 2016, with the judge calling the public authority's decision to label the life insurer in that capacity "erratic and whimsical."

Doubters of the SIFI label and of Dodd-Frank's regulations more generally have contended that instead of keeping companies from being "too big to fail," the assignment just identifies the ones that are. Some contend that the increased regulatory burden has, in fact, exacerbated the risk of financial contagion: since larger banks are better able to bear the extra costs, they come out more grounded — and bigger — thus, unexpectedly bringing about greater concentration in the financial sector.

President Trump's 2018 Crapo bill, also called the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act, was planned to dispose of this threat by liberating fair sized lenders from severe and exorbitant regulatory investigation.
