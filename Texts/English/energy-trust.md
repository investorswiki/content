# Energy Trust
## What Is an Energy Trust?

An energy trust is a type of [investment vehicle](/investmentvehicle) that holds [mineral rights](/mineral-rights) for oil and gas wells, mines, and other natural resource properties. Energy trusts don't operate these properties themselves, all things considered, they depend on third-party companies to create income from their assets.

Energy trusts are notable in that they are not required to pay [corporate income taxes](/corporatetax), gave that they payout no less than 90% of their income to their shareholders. This income is then taxed at the level of the individual shareholders, bypassing the issue of [double taxation](/double_taxation).

## Understanding Energy Trusts

Energy trusts are well known investment vehicles in the United States and Canada. Be that as it may, there are a few notable differences in how these vehicles are regulated in every country.

In the United States, energy trusts are simply permitted to produce income from the mineral rights of existing properties; they are not permitted to gain new properties, for example, by buying extra wells. This means that U.S. energy trusts are required to draw down their existing income streams and in the long run [liquidate](/liquidation) the trust once their mineral rights are completely exhausted.

This makes it particularly important for investors in U.S. energy trusts to figure out the excess reserves of the trust, as this will be critical in precisely assessing how long the trust will actually want to keep making distributions to shareholders.

On the other hand, Canadian energy trusts are permitted to bring continuous capital up in order to purchase new properties. This means that, in principle, a Canadian energy trust could keep paying distributions to shareholders endlessly, gave it plans ahead to guarantee a continuous portfolio of mineral rights.

> ### Assets Held by Energy Trusts
> Energy trusts normally hold portfolios of mature properties that require relatively minimal continuous [capital expenditures](/capitalexpenditure). These properties ought to as of now have the infrastructure in place to remove the applicable resources, empowering the trust to pay large distributions without expecting to reinvest critical capital into new infrastructure.

## Illustration of an Energy Trust

A tremendous change in the energy trust market happened in 2006 when the Canadian government announced plans to alter the tax treatment of Canadian energy trusts.

Already, Canadian energy trusts had the option to keep away from corporate taxation out and out by going through their distributions to shareholders, who were then taxed at the individual level. Be that as it may, this brought about a huge decline in government tax incomes, provoking the government to take out this favorable tax treatment by requiring energy trusts to pay taxes on their distributions too.

This change really killed the relative tax proficiency of Canadian energy trusts as compared to corporations, inciting many trusts to change over themselves into corporations. Amidst this change, shares in numerous Canadian energy trusts declined fundamentally, driven by fears that the more onerous tax burden would require a decline in the energy trusts' [dividend yields](/dividendyield).
