For convertible bonds, the parity price concept is utilized to determine when changing over a bond into shares of common stock is monetarily beneficial.

Assuming two assets are trading at parity, it very well may be gathered they are at a similar price or value.

## Understanding Parity Price

Investors frequently need to arrive at conclusions about the relative value of two distinct investments. Parity is a term used to portray when two things are equivalent to each other. Hence, it very well may be utilized to allude to two securities having equivalent value, for example, a [convertible bond](/convertiblebond) and the value of a stock (in the event that the bondholder decides to change over a convertible bond into common stock).

As well as involving parity price for a [convertible security](/convertible-security), investors can utilize it to settle on investment conclusions about commodities and currencies. Parity price can assist with determining the value of stock options since parity is defined as the price at which an option is trading at its [intrinsic value](/intrinsicvalue). Moreover, the concept of parity is additionally used to compare the value of two currencies.

## Parity Price: Factoring in Commodities

For agricultural commodities, the parity price is the [purchasing power](/purchasingpower) of a specific commodity relative to a rancher's expenses, for example, wages, loan interest, and equipment. The Agricultural Adjustment Act of 1938 characterizes parity price as the average price received by farmers for agricultural [commodities](/commodity) during the previous 10 years; in the event that the parity price for a commodity is below the current market price, the government might give price support through direct purchases.

## Parity in Purchasing Power

Purchasing power parity (PPP) is a method of looking at the purchasing power between countries. PPP compares the cost of a basket of goods in a single country with the cost of similar goods in another country. Nonetheless, purchasing power parity adapts to the exchange rates between the two countries. All in all, purchasing power parity changes two comparative products ought to be similar price in the two countries in the wake of figuring for exchange rates.

For instance, suppose an iPhone costs $600 in the U.S. In Great Britain, the exchange rate is $1.30 (it costs $1.30 for each British pound). In this way, in Britain, assuming an iPhone costs around 460 pounds sterling, there would be parity in purchasing power on the grounds that 460 pounds equals $600 at the exchange rate of $1.30. Nonetheless, on the off chance that the British iPhone costs pretty much than 460 pounds, there wouldn't be parity.

## Parity in the Forex Markets

Parity is additionally found in foreign exchange ([forex](/forex)) markets. Currencies are at parity when the exchange rate relationship is exactly coordinated. Companies situated in the United States that have operations in foreign countries must change over U.S. dollars into different currencies. In the event that a U.S. firm carries on with work in France, for instance, the company can change over U.S. dollars into euros and send those euros to fund its French business operations. Assuming the exchange rate is $1 to \u20ac1, the currencies are at parity.

## Parity Price: How Convertible Bonds Work

A convertible bond offers investors the opportunity to change over expressed bond into a fixed number of shares of [common stock](/commonstock) at a specific price for each share. Investors purchase convertible bonds in light of the fact that the owner can earn interest on a fixed-income investment (and they have the option of changing over into the company's equity). Parity price is the market price of the convertible security separated by the [conversion ratio](/conversionratio) (the number of common stock shares received upon conversion).

## Different Examples of Parity
### Convertible Bonds

Expect, for instance, that a $1,000 IBM convertible bond has a market price of $1,200, and the bond is convertible into 20 shares of IBM common stock. The parity price is: $1,200 bond [market value](/marketvalue))/(20 shares), or $60 per share. Assuming that the market price of IBM common stock is above $60 per share, the investor can profit by changing over it into common stock.

### Stock Options

At the point when an investor purchases a stock option, the owner has the privilege to buy a fixed number of stock shares at a stated price (and the right to buy the shares lapses on a fixed date). One $50 Microsoft call option, for instance, means that the owner can buy 100 shares of Microsoft common stock at $50 per share before the option lapses. Assuming the market price of Microsoft is $60 per share, the intrinsic value of the option is ($60 - $50), or $10 per share. Assuming the price of the stock option is likewise $10, the option trade is at parity.

### Risk Parity

Custom asset allocation strategy splits assets between stocks, bonds, and cash. The goal is to give diversification and reduce risk by utilizing these types of investments. Risk parity, then again, dispenses dollars in view of four parts: equities, credit, interest rates, and commodities.
