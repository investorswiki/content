# Zombie Debt
## What Is Zombie Debt?

Zombie debt will be debt that has fallen off your credit report at the same time, in light of multiple factors, somebody is as yet attempting to collect. Zombie debt has frequently been long neglected and has most likely been written off as uncollectible. Yet, zombie debt can rise from the grave on the off chance that a debt collector endeavors to collect on everything over once more, even when the debt is too old to pursue legally.

## How Zombie Debt Works

Zombie debt generally alludes to debt that is over three years of age, which has either been disregarded, currently paid off, or belonged to another person. It can likewise be the consequence of identity theft, a computer blunder, or a fraudulent endeavor to collect on a debt that doesn't exist.

The original creditor will undoubtedly have given up on the debt and sold it to a debt collection agency. These debt collectors can be very deceitful and frequently make hassling and compromising calls.

### Statute of Limitations

The [statute of limitations](/statute-of-limitations) on how long a lender can endeavor to collect on a debt is three-to-six years in many states and, surprisingly, more limited in some. While the debt is as yet viewed as legitimate even after the statute of limitations has passed, you are not legally required to pay it. Notwithstanding, the companies that buy uncollectible debts are playing a numbers game. They just need a couple of individuals to repay their debts to be productive.

Those on the less than desirable finish of these efforts should watch out. There is no benefit in paying a debt that is past the statute of limitations on the grounds that paying anything will restart the statute of limitations, put the debt back on your credit report, and empower the debt collector to prosecute you.

## What to Do If You Are Contacted About Zombie Debt

Debtors can shield themselves from provocation under the [Fair Debt Collection Practices Act](/fair-debt-collection-practices-act-fdcpa) (FDCPA). This specific law limits the behavior and actions of third-party debt collectors and confines the means and methods by which they can contact debtors, as well as the hour of day and number of times contact can be made.

The important thing isn't to spend any time on the telephone with the debt collector. Ask for their address and send them a certified letter in no less than 35 days of contact. Dispute that you owe the debt and ask them to demonstrate that you owe it.

Assuming you keep on being contacted by the debt collection agency, think of them another letter and illuminate them that they can't contact you except if it is by composing or on the other hand on the off chance that they will sue you. Assuming the debt is past the statute of limitations the collector will presumably disappear.
