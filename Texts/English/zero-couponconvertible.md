# Zero-Coupon Convertible
## What Is a Zero-Coupon Convertible?

A zero-coupon convertible is a fixed income instrument that consolidates the features of a [zero-coupon bond](/zero-couponbond) with that of a [convertible bond](/convertiblebond).

Due to the zero-coupon feature, the bond pays no interest and is thusly issued at a discount to par value, while the convertible feature means that bondholders have the option to change over bonds into common stock of the issuer at a certain conversion price.

## Figuring out Zero-Coupon Convertibles

Zero-coupon convertibles wed two features: zero-coupons and convertibles. A zero-coupon security is a debt instrument which doesn't make interest payments. An investor purchases this security [at a discount](/at-a-discount) and gets the [face value](/facevalue) of the bond on the maturity date. Since there are no payments prior to maturity, zero-coupons have no [reinvestment risk](/reinvestmentrisk). A [convertible security](/convertible-security) is a debt instrument that can be changed over into equity of the responsible company at a given time. This is basically a [embedded put option](/embeddedoption) that gives bondholders the right to change over bonds into shares, and acts as a sweetener for investors who get to participate in any upside in the price of the issuer's stock.

A zero-coupon convertible is, in this manner, a non-interest paying bond that can be changed over into the equity of the responsible company after the stock arrives at a certain price. An investor who purchases this type of security pays a discount for prior any interest income. These bonds, nonetheless, will generally likewise benefit shareholders who can utilize the conversion option to profit on the exchange for shares, and who keep up with [priority](/absolutepriority) ahead of equity holders as a creditor on account of bankruptcy in the event that the bonds are not changed over.

Notwithstanding, these financial instruments have an inherent option which permits the issuer to force the conversion of the bonds when the stock proceeds true to form, capping the investor's upside potential. Also, zero-coupon convertibles will generally be fairly unpredictable in the secondary market in light of the fact that the convertible option could conceivably become significant, contingent upon how the company performs over the life of the debt instrument.

A zero-coupon convertible can likewise allude to a zero-coupon issued by a [municipality](/municipalbond) that can be changed over completely to an interest-paying bond at a certain time before the maturity date. At the point when a municipal government issues these muni convertibles, they are [tax-exempt](/tax_exempt), but at the same time are convertible to different bonds that might yield more.

## Special Considerations

The zero-coupon and convertible features offset each other in terms of the yield required by investors. Zero-coupon bonds are in many cases the most unstable fixed-income investments since they have no periodic interest payments to moderate the risk of holding them. Subsequently, investors demand a somewhat higher yield to hold them. Then again, convertibles pay a lower yield compared to different bonds of a similar maturity and quality since investors might pay a premium for the convertible feature.

The issuer of zero-coupon convertible builds the principal of the convertible security every year to remunerate investors for the shortfall of coupons. A zero-coupon convertible and interest-paying convertible with indistinguishable maturity and [call provisions](/callprovision) will have roughly a similar [conversion premium](/conversionpremium) in spite of the difference in compensation to bondholders.

## Pricing Zero-Coupon Convertibles

Zero-coupon convertibles are priced utilizing option pricing models like the [Black-Scholes](/blackscholes) model; tree-based models(such as the [binomial](/binomial_tree) or [trinomial model](/trinomialoptionpricingmodel)); or the [dividend valuation model](/ddm).

The underlying share price, suppositions about the behavior of the price, assumed equity valuation, and an assumed volatility level are inputs required to price the security. Due to the complexity of zero-coupon convertibles, just sophisticated investors typically trade them.

## Features
- As a result of the zero-coupon feature, these convertibles are sold at a discount and will rather mature to face value on the off chance that they are not changed prior over completely to the maturity date.
- Accordingly, these two features will generally balance each other out in terms of riskiness and benefits to investors, albeit these securities can be very complex to price precisely.
- A zero-coupon convertible is a convertible bond issued by a corporation that pays no customary interest to bondholders.
- Zero-coupon convertibles before they are changed over, in any case, actually favor investors in the event of a bankruptcy as bondholders are given repayment priority ahead of shareholders.
