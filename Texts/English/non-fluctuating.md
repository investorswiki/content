## What Is Non-Fluctuating?

Non-fluctuating is a characteristic of consistency in a security or measurement's value, rate of change, or other measurement. Non-fluctuating is a feature of a [fixed-rate](/fixedinterestrate) asset which has a consistent yield, for example, an officially sanctioned debenture.

An investment that has non-fluctuating returns with little risk will in general have lower returns than investments that are presented to volatility.

Dividends paid on [preferred stock](/preferredstock) are non-fluctuating; that is, they are paid at a fixed rate. Dividends paid on common stock, then again, may vary. Nonetheless, a few secure and stable companies, for example, [blue chips](/bluechipstock), may offer consistent dividends.

All investors ought to fashion a portfolio that brags a solid mix fluctuating and non-fluctuating assets in view of their personal situation.
