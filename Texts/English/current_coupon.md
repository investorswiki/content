# Current Coupon
## What Is a Current Coupon?

A current coupon alludes to a security that is trading closest to its [par value](/parvalue) without going over par. All in all, the bond's market price is at or close to its issued face value.

Put in an unexpected way, a bond has a current coupon status in the event that its coupon is set roughly equivalent to the bond's [yield to maturity](/yieldtomaturity) (YTM) at the hour of issuance. The concept is many times utilized in pricing yield spreads among mortgage-backed securities (MBS).

## Grasping Current Coupon

A current coupon [bond](/bond) is one that is selling at a price at or close to its par value. In particular, the bond must have a coupon rate that falls inside 0.5% above or below current market rates. Current coupon bonds are typically less unstable and are more liquid than different bonds with lower coupons in light of the fact that the coupon rate is closer to that set by the market.

Since a current coupon bond is less unpredictable, it is likewise doubtful to be [called](/callablebond) back by the issuer with the goal that it has implied [call protection](/callprotection) instead of an explicit call provision. Its inherent stability, in any case, additionally means that it won't offer as great of an expected return.

### Current Coupon and Interest Rates

The movement of interest rates in the markets conversely influences the value of a bond. At the point when interest rates increase, the price of a bond falls, and vice versa. This is on the grounds that no matter what the heading of interest rate movements in the economy, the rates on a bond are typically fixed.

These fixed rates, alluded to as [coupon rates](/coupon-rate), decide the interest income a bondholder will receive periodically on their fixed-income investment. On the off chance that interest rates rise, new issues will have a higher coupon rate than existing issues. A bond with a coupon close to the yields currently offered on new bonds of a comparative maturity and [credit risk](/creditrisk) is known as a current coupon bond.

## Mortgage-Backed Securities and Current Coupon

The current coupon is regularly used to comprehend yield spreads of [mortgage-backed securities](/mbs) (MBS) which are guaranteed by U.S. government-sponsored enterprises Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac and the government agency [Ginnie Mae](/ginniemae). As the underlying mortgages of MBSs have different interest rates, different MBSs will have various coupons.

In the MBS market, a current coupon is defined as the [to-be-announced](/tba) (TBA) mortgage security of any issue for the current delivery month that is trading closest to, however not surpassing par value. A TBA qualification means that the pool of mortgages that will back the security has not been assigned, even however the contract is going to be made. A [synthetic](/synthetic) 30-year fixed-rate MBS in the TBA market is the current coupon utilized as a benchmark all through the industry to price and value mortgages.

### Deciding the MBS Current Coupon

To figure out which security is the current coupon, it is important to realize the par value of the mortgages, which is the sum of the outstanding directors on the underlying mortgages. The current coupon is calculated by [interpolating](/addition) the highest coupon below par and the most reduced coupon better than expected, adjusting for the postpone days associated with the securities being referred to.

On the other hand, it is acquired by extrapolating from the least coupon better than expected in case no coupon is trading below par. For instance, TBA mortgage securities frequently trade with interest rates in augmentations of 0.5%. Consequently, assuming a par value of 100, assume that Fannie Mae 8% mortgage securities are trading at 99.5 and Fannie Mae 8.5% mortgage securities are trading at 100.75. In this model, Fannie Mae's 8% security would be the current coupon.

### Special Considerations

A principle of mortgage analysis is that the higher a mortgage-backed security's coupon is relative to the current coupon, the more probable that mortgage-backed security is to [prepay](/prepayment). Mortgage investors make this relative value analysis in computing MBS yields and valuations. Likewise, the current coupon mirrors the state of the mortgage market. Consequently, lenders and borrowers can involve it as an indicator of what the fair rate for new mortgages ought to be.
