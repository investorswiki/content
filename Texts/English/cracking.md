# Cracking
## What Is Cracking?

Cracking is a technique utilized in oil processing plants by which large and complex hydrocarbon particles are broken down into more modest and lighter parts that are more helpful for commercial or consumer use. Cracking is a critical stage during the time spent refining [crude oil](/crude-oil).

Other petroleum products, for example, heating oil, diesel fuel, and gas, depend on cracking.

## How Cracking Works

Following its extraction from a well, crude oil in its raw form contains a blend of large and complex hydrocarbon particles. Albeit the crude oil is significant even in its raw form, its [economic usefulness](/economic_efficiency) is relatively limited until it has been subject to extra refining processes.

To assist with delivering the crude oil into a form that can be all the more widely used, the most importantly stage in the refining system is to break up, or "[crack](/crack)," the natural hydrocarbon particles into more modest parts. This stage — commonly alluded to as "cracking" — makes it conceivable to transform crude oil into various marketable fuels, ointments, and different products.

Albeit the essential concept is similar in all cases, the most common way of cracking can be carried out in different ways. A common application is known as liquid reactant cracking (FCC), which is utilized in the production of gas as well as different distillate fuels.

A single product crack mirrors the difference between the prices of one barrel of crude oil and one barrel of a predefined product. For instance, from crude oil into gas. Purifiers and investors additionally execute crack strategies against numerous products. For instance, a barrel of oil into gas, lamp oil, fly fuel, and heating oil.

## Real World Example of Cracking

Albeit cracking is a common stage in the oil refinery process, a few types of oil —, for example, [light sweet crude](/sweetcrude) oil — requires relatively limited treatment to be sold. In view of the limited amount of investment they expect before being sold, such types of oil are highly pursued and command high prices on international [commodities markets](/commodity-market).

In spite of the fact that many products can be delivered by refining crude oil, the ones most commonly traded on commodities markets are heating oil and fuel. In spite of the fact that their relative prices differ after some time in light of [supply and demand](/law-of-supply-demand), a common heuristic utilized by traders is that the ratio between them ought to regularly change around 3 to 2 to 1. All in all, this ratio accepts that three barrels of oil ought to commonly yield two barrels of fuel and one barrel of heating oil.

At the point when prices veer substantially from these ratios, traders could try to conjecture on a [reversion to the mean](/meanreversion) by buying the commodity that appears [undervalued](/undervalued) relative to this ratio, or selling the one that appears [overvalued](/overvalued). Traders may likewise involve this ratio as a guideline while seeking to hedge against their exposure to these commodities.

## The Crack Spread

The price of a barrel of crude oil and the different prices of the products refined from it are not generally in perfect synchronization. Contingent upon the season, the climate, global supplies, and numerous different factors, the supply and demand for specific distillates brings about pricing changes that can impact the profit edges on a barrel of crude oil for the purifier. This is referred to in the commodities market as the [crack spread](/crackspread).

To alleviate pricing risks, purifiers use futures to [hedge](/hedge) the crack spread. Futures and options traders can likewise utilize the crack spread to hedge different investments or conjecture on potential price changes in oil and refined petroleum products.

Traders can either buy or sell the crack spread. On the off chance that you are buying it, you expect the crack spread will reinforce, meaning the refining edges are developing since crude oil prices are falling as well as demand for refined products is developing. Selling the crack spread means you expect the demand for refined products is debilitating or the spread itself is tightening due to changes in oil pricing, so you sell the refined product futures and buy crude futures.

## Highlights
- A few forms of oil, like light sweet crude, require relatively limited refining to be sold.
- Cracking is a cycle utilized in oil treatment facilities to get saleable byproducts from crude oil.
- Contingent upon factors, for example, the production rate of various petroleum byproducts, the relative value of commodities, for example, heating oil and fuel can change over the long run — setting out speculative or hedging open doors for commodities traders.
