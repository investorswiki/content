1. The second type of cross is a [foreign exchange](/foreign-exchange) (forex) transaction in which the non-U.S. currencies being traded are exchanged straightforwardly for one another rather than first being switched over completely to U.S. dollars.
1. A cross may likewise allude to a [technical analysis](/technicalanalysis) chart pattern, for example, a golden cross or death cross.

## Grasping a Cross

On the off chance that a stockbroker gets separate orders to buy and sell at similar price simultaneously, they must offer the stock in the market at a higher price than the [bid](/bid). Assuming no higher bid is accessible, they can execute the two deals simultaneously and at a similar price.

### Opening and Closing Crosses

The [Nasdaq](/nasdaq) accumulates and posts data on all buy and sell interest in the two minutes prior to its opening; this information is alluded to as the [opening cross](/opening-cross). Traders can post orders to buy at the opening price or to buy on the off chance that there is a [order imbalance](/imbalanceoforders). This spread of pricing interest assists with limiting disturbances in liquidity.

The closing cross on Nasdaq matches bids and offers in a given stock to make a last price of the day. Traders can place orders that can be by the same token "[market at close](/marketonclose)," and that means buy or sell at the official [closing price](/closingprice) or "limit at close."

In the last option case, assuming that the price at the close is better than the predefined limit, the deal will be executed at the market price.

In the past, investors or hedgers who wanted to trade a pair like the euro versus the yen, known as EUR/JPY, expected to do it through the dollar.

This implied that buying [EUR](/euro) and selling [JPY](/jpy-japanese-yen) required the accompanying two stages:

1. Buy EUR and sell USD and
1. Buy a similar amount of USD and sell JPY. Impediments of this approach incorporate paying the bid/offer spread two times (once in every currency pair) and expecting to deal for a USD amount as opposed to an EUR or JPY amount.

In any case, the dollar pairs are more actively traded than the cross, so in times of volatility or diminished liquidity, traders might in any case execute through the parts.

The most actively traded currency crosses are the euro versus the yen, British pound ([GBP](/gbp)), and Swiss franc ([CHF](/chf)). Cross trades should be possible for any [spot](/spottrade), forward, or option transactions.
