# DOP (Dominican Peso)
## What Is the Dominican Peso (DOP)

DOP is the foreign currency exchange (FX) shortening for the Dominican **peso**, the Dominican Republic's official currency. The Central Bank of the Dominican Republic issues and deals with the money, which the symbol, $, or RD$ addresses locally.

One Dominican peso is made out of 100 **centavos** and comes in [banknotes](/banknote) of 50, 100, 200, 500, 1000 and 2000; and coins worth 1, 5, 10, and 25 pesos. As of March 2021, 1 DOP is worth roughly US $0.017.

## A History of the Dominican Economy

The Dominican Peso was first issued for circulation in 1844 after the Dominican Republic acquired independence from its neighbor, Haiti. The two nations share the Caribbean island of Hispaniola. Santo Domingo is the location where Christopher Columbus' more youthful sibling Diego laid out a settlement in 1496. The island would turn into the seat of Spanish rule in the New World.

In 1821, the Dominican public declared their independence from Spain. In any case, rather than independence, the population was effectively added by Haiti. 22 years later, the nation battled and won its independence. Successive changes to government structure and issues with the economy plagued the youthful nation. Haiti kept on undermining the country with extension.

Yet again by 1861, the government agreed to turn into a Spanish state, yet this lasted for just a brief time before declaring independence once more. During this subsequent independence, political instability and despot rule caused the country's [foreign debt](/foreign-debt) to develop. During the 6-year period from 1899 and 1905 there were five unique presidents of the Dominican Republic and four separate upheavals. The Dominican government during this period was regularly broke and was experiencing difficulty paying its obligations to countries like France, the Netherlands, Italy, and Germany.

The deteriorating political situation on the island in the midst of [inflation](/inflation) and a lofty decline in the price of the Dominican Republic's chief export, sugar forced the country to bankruptcy by 1902. Dominica's banks sent warships to the Dominican Republic's capital of Santo Domingo, to guarantee repayment. In any case, in January 1905, President Roosevelt wanting to limit European intervention in the Americas, laid out a protectorate over the island nation. The U.S. assumed command over customs and subbed the U.S. dollar (USD) for the Dominican Peso (DOP) and started to assist the nation with paying off its international debt. The U.S. surrendered rule in 1922, and another Dominican government was chosen.

Once more, long stretches of tyrant like governments drove the nation, however the economy developed as did transportation and education. In 1963, the island nation had a democratically chosen liberal government. The U.S. upheld rebels during a civil war to go against favorable to socialist groups, and a series of governments followed all plagued with party bias and corruption. Be that as it may, the economy of the nation kept on developing with inflation controlled.

The Dominican Republic encountered a 7.9% annual inflation rate in Feb. 2021. The gross domestic product (GDP) declined 7.2% in the second from last quarter of 2020.

## Understanding the Dominican Peso

After independence, the peso replaced the Haitian **gourde** [at par](/at-par). In 1877 the currency switched over completely to the decimal system and was subdivided into 100 centavos. Between 1891 to 1897, the country delivered a subsequent currency, the **franco**, which circulated as an extra parallel currency. Initially, paper money was delivered and distributed by two private banks.

In the mid 1900s, the U.S. momentarily assumed command over the Dominican Republic. Because of the island turning into a U.S. protectorate, the U.S. dollar officially replaced the Dominican peso in 1905. The exchange was [pegged](/currency-stake) at a rate of 5 Dominican pesos to one U.S. dollar. The Dominican Republic started circulating its own currency again in 1937, yet just in coin form, called the **peso oro**. The U.S. dollar stayed in wide circulation through WWII.

In the long run, the Dominican government laid out the Central de la Rep\u00fablica Dominicana as the [central bank](/centralbank) for the nation. The central bank is situated in Santo Domingo and is responsible for keeping up with price stability and protecting the integrity of the Dominican economy and payments system. The bank likewise deals with the country's [foreign exchange reserves](/foreign-exchange-reserves), to guarantee that Dominican organizations have adequate access to foreign currencies.

During economic difficulties during the mid 1960s, the government recalled a portion of the coins in circulation, which were broken down. Later, in 1963, the Peso Oro turned into a [fiat currency](/fiatmoney) where its worth derived from the relationship among supply and demand, not an underlying commodity. Renaming of the peso oro occurred in 2011 returning the name of the currency to just the peso.
