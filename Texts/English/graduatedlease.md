# Graduated Lease
## What Is a Graduated Lease?

A graduated lease is an agreement under which a tenant and [landlord](/landlord) consent to a periodic adjustment of regularly scheduled payments. For instance, the agreement might mirror an increase in the tenant's payments due to market conditions or an increase in the value of the leased property.

## How a Graduated Lease Works

A graduated lease will in general benefit the property owner over the long term, yet the arrangement offers benefits to both the landlord and the tenant. A graduated lease permits the property owner or lessor the opportunity to charge increased rent as property values increase over the long haul. The tenant or lessee can claim a property at what might be a discounted rate in the short term. This can frequently help during the ramp-up stage of another business venture.

Graduated leases are otherwise called graded leases. Graduated leases will generally be structured for longer terms than traditional straight or fixed leases, which regularly have one to two-year terms.

According to a loan specialist's point of view, a graduated lease is a better fit for real estate agreements than equipment agreements since real estate values tend to [appreciate](/value increase) after some time. A lessor would be probably not going to offer a graduated lease on an automobile, for example, on the grounds that the value of a vehicle devalues consistently over the long run. This depreciation could lead to decreasing regularly scheduled payments.

## Triggers for Rent Increase Under a Graduated Lease

Traditionally, adjustments in graduated leases happen due to one of the accompanying four factors:

- An escalator clause. Many graduated lease agreements contain an escalator clause set off by a rise in an economic index. This can likewise be known as an index clause. The Consumer Price Index (CPI) or 10-year U.S. Treasury Bond are common benchmarks. At the point when prices rise, the landlord can raise month to month lease payments.
- A reappraisal clause. A lease agreement may likewise contain a reappraisal clause which considers a climb in rent following an annual appraisal of the property. Once more, this is probable just to bring about an increase in rent.
- A participation clause. This type of clause can force the tenant to add to increases in expenses like utilities, taxes, or maintenance. These hikes can be limited by an expense stop provision.
- A [step-up lease](/step-up-lease). This type of lease is a form of graduated lease by which increases in rent are incorporated into the agreement and might be utilized for the lease of an asset that will deteriorate in value, like machinery. A beginning up may go into a step-up lease to stay away from large payments upfront to buy machinery. The beginning up expects future cash flows emerging from the utilization of the equipment that will permit them to cover larger payments later on.
