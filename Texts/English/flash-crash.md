# Flash Crash
## What Is a Flash Crash?

The term flash crash refers to an event in the electronic [securities](/security) markets wherein stock withdrawal orders quickly enhance price declines before quickly recovering. The result of a flash crash appears to be a fast [sell-off](/sell-off) of securities that can happen over a few minutes, resulting in emotional declines. However, as prices before the day's over, maybe the flash crash never happened.

## How Flash Crashes Work

As noted above, flash crashes happen when securities prices make exceptional drops and [rebound](/rebound) very quickly — all around the same time. It nearly seems like the crash never even happened toward the end of the trading day. This was the case when the U.S. market experienced a sudden drop on May 6, 2010, and recovered before the day's over.

Flash crashes are exacerbated by aberrations in the market, like heavy selling by high-frequency traders in one or numerous securities. Accordingly, computer trading programs naturally react to these conditions and begin selling large volumes of securities at an incredibly quick pace to stay away from losses.

Flash crashes can trigger [circuit breakers](/circuitbreaker) at major stock exchanges like the [New York Stock Exchange](/nyse) (NYSE), which halt trading until buy and sell orders can be matched up evenly and trading can resume in an orderly fashion.

As trading becomes more digitized, flash crashes are generally triggered by computer [algorithms](/calculation) rather than a specific piece of market or company news that causes the quick sell-off. As the price continues to drop and more [benchmarks](/benchmark) are triggered, it can cause a cascading type of influence that sets off a sudden plunge in value. That being said, significantly more research is needed on flash crashes, including any indication of fraudulent activity.

> Albeit the activity of high-frequency traders is directly linked to flash crashes (and is often a primary consideration), it's important to note that there can be numerous other crediting factors — large numbers of which can be difficult to pinpoint.

## Preventing a Flash Crash

The propensity for glitches, errors, and flash crashes is a lot higher, now that securities trading is a heavily computerized industry driven by complicated calculations across global networks. All things considered, global exchanges like the NYSE, [Nasdaq](/nasdaq), and the [Chicago Mercantile Exchange](/cme) (CME) have stronger security measures and mechanisms in place to prevent them and the staggering losses they can lead to.

For example, they have put in place market-wide circuit breakers that trigger a pause or complete stop in trading activity. A decline of 7% or 13% in a market's [index](/index) from its previous close halts trading activity for 15 minutes. A crash of more than 20% halts trading until the end of the day.

The [Securities and Exchange Commission](/sec) (SEC) likewise banned naked access or direct connections to exchanges. High-frequency trading firms, which have been blamed for precipitating the flash crash's effects, often use their broker-dealer's code to directly access exchanges. Such measures can't eliminate flash crashes altogether, however they have been able to mitigate the damages they can cause.

## Examples of Flash Creashes

One of the most popular examples of a flash crash in recent history occurred on May 6, 2010. It began soon after 2:30 p.m. when the [Dow Jones Industrial Average](/djia) (DJIA) fell more than 1,000 points in 10 minutes — the biggest drop in history by then. The index lost practically 9% of its value soon. Over $1 trillion in equity evaporated, albeit the market regained 70% before the day's over.

Initial reports claimed that the crash was caused by a mistyped order that proved to be erroneous. The flash was attributed to Navinder Singh Sarao, a [futures](/futures) trader in the London rural areas, who pled liable for attempting to parody the market by quickly buying and selling hundreds of E-Mini S&P Futures contracts through the CME.

### Other Flash Crashes

There have been other recent events resembling flash crashes, wherein the volume of computer-generated orders outpaced the ability of the [exchanges](/exchange) to keep proper control flow. These include:

- **Aug. 22, 2013:** Trading was halted at the [Nasdaq](/nasdaq) for more than three hours when computers at the NYSE couldn't process pricing data from the Nasdaq.
- **May 18, 2012:** While not a flash crash per se, Meta (formerly Facebook) shares were held up for more than 30 minutes at the opening bell as an error prevented the Nasdaq from accurately pricing shares during its [initial public offering](/ipo) (IPO), causing a reported $500 million in losses.
