# The Political Economy Research Institute
## What Is the Political Economy Research Institute?

The Political Economy Research Institute (PERI) is a progressive, left-inclining [economic think tank](/economic-think-tank) at the University of Massachusetts Amherst, which conducts economic research planned to influence the public discussion and be put into pragmatic policy recommendations to work on the quality of human life. In spite of the fact that PERI's research traverses many fields, from environmentalism to social causes, one of its most notable endeavors is figuring out which companies make the Toxic 100 rundown — the rundown of the best 100 air polluters in the United States.

## Understanding the Political Economy Research Institute

Laid out in 1998, PERI attempts to conduct research that can be executed into policy for everyone's best interests. The economist Robert Heilbroner, known for his conviction that economics ought to assist with further developing the prosperity of individuals at work and of the society they work in, when said that PERI "strive[s] to make a workable science out of ethical quality." PERI teams up with university personnel and understudies as well as other think tanks and researchers from around the globe, and it is closely linked to the UMass at Amherst's Department of Economics, however it is technically an independent unit of UMass.

PERI's objectives include:

- Conducting quality research
- Bringing issues to light of issues that influence human and biological prosperity, for example, [globalization](/globalization), [income inequality](/income-inequality), and [environmentalism](/environmental-economics)
- Developing its network of research colleagues

PERI's research traverses different fortes, however it will in general zero in on economic costs, benefits, and arrangements and finding ways of carrying out policy changes that emphatically affect the biological system and the [economy](/economy).

## Specific Areas of Research

PERI's research is separated into numerous categories:

- **Money, Jobs, and Macroeconomics:** Research centers around the connections between [financial institutions](/financialinstitution) and economic inequality and flimsiness.
- **Environmental and Energy Economics:** Research centers around economic answers for environmental issues.
- **Economics for the Developing World:** Research centers around economic issues looked by agricultural nations.
- **Wellbeing Policy:** Research centers around economic and social factors that influence wellbeing, especially tending to income support, social policies, and wellbeing differences.

These are just a couple of PERI's areas of research, all of which aim to bring issues to light, guide public policy conversations, and offer answers for the issues our world countenances. It has likewise teamed up with the left-wing Center for American Progress in creating and distributing a series of studies on advancing economic growth through government policy to combat climate change.

## The Toxic 100

PERI is maybe generally notable for its research into the Toxic 100, or the main 100 air dirtying companies in the United States. To score and rank each company, PERI pulls data from the [Environmental Protection Agency](/environmental-protection-agency) (EPA), which gives understanding into each company's emissions and toxic waste. Companies must report their synthetic emissions data to the EPA's Toxic Release Inventory (TRI). Data from the TRI is then utilized by the EPA's Risk Screening Environmental Indicators (RSEI) system to decide weighted toxicity levels and the risk to human wellbeing.

Toxic scores are resolved utilizing the accompanying equation:
