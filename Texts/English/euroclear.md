## How Euroclear Works

Euroclear is one the oldest settlement systems and was initially sponsored by Morgan Guaranty Trust Company of New York, which was a part of J.P. Morgan and Co. It was founded in 1968 to settle trades on the then-developing [Eurobond](/eurobond) market. Its computerized settlement and deposit system guaranteed the safe delivery and payment of Eurobonds. In 2000, Morgan Guaranty Trust moved these activities to Euroclear Bank.

Euroclear is publicly owned and represented. Somewhere in the range of 2001 and 2007, the firm acquired Sivocam, the central securities depository (CSD) of France, CIK and Necigef, the CSDs of Belgium and the Netherlands, and CrestCo, the CSD for Irish equities and all U.K. securities.

A [clearinghouse](/clearinghouse) is a financial institution that acts as an intermediary among buyers and sellers of financial instruments. They take the contrary position of each side of a trade, going about as the buyer to the seller and the seller to the buyer.

For instance, in the event that Wendy and Nathan go into a transaction where Wendy consents to sell 100 shares of AMZN to Nathan for $1,180 per share, Nathan should pay $1,180 x 100 shares = $118,000. The clearinghouse credits Nathan's account with 100 AMZN shares and deposits $118,000 to Wendy's account. Clearinghouses, consequently, guarantee that the financial markets operate without a hitch and productively. One of the world's biggest clearinghouses is Euroclear.
