# Futures Equivalent
## What Is Futures Equivalent?

Futures equivalent is the number of [futures contracts](/futurescontract) required to match the [risk profile](/risk-profile) of a [options](/option) position on the equivalent [underlying asset](/underlying-asset). All in all, it is the amount of futures expected to offset the net deltas of an options position.

## Figuring out Futures Equivalent

Futures equivalent just applies to options where the underlying asset is a futures contract, for example, options on stock [index](/marketindex) (S&P 500) futures, [commodity](/commodity) futures, or [currency](/currency) futures.

Futures equivalent is extremely valuable when you need to [hedge](/hedge) exposure to an options position. On the off chance that a trader determines their futures equivalent, they can buy or sell the proper number of futures contracts in the market to hedge their position and become [delta neutral](/deltaneutral). The futures equivalent can be calculated by taking the aggregate [delta](/delta) associated with an options position.

The term futures equivalent is generally used to allude to the equivalent position in futures contracts that is expected to have a risk profile indistinguishable from the option. This delta is utilized in delta-based hedging, [margining](/option-margin), and risk analysis systems.

Delta-based margining is an option margining system utilized by certain exchanges. This system is equivalent to changes in [option premiums](/option-premium) or future contract prices. Futures contract prices are then used to determine risk factors on which to base [margin](/margin) requirements. A margin requirement is the amount of collateral or funds stored by customers with their brokers.

## Illustration of Futures Equivalents in Options Hedging

Most ordinarily, the futures equivalent is utilized in the practice of [delta hedging](/deltahedging). Delta hedging includes diminishing or eliminating the directional risk exposure laid out by an options position by taking a contrary position in the underlying security.

> Being delta neutral means that small changes toward the market produce no profit or loss for the trader.

Assuming that a trader has an options position in gold options that amounts to +30 deltas in terms of futures equivalents, for instance, they could sell 30 futures contracts in the market and become delta neutral. Here, assuming the price of gold increments by 1%, the options position will gain roughly 1%, while the short futures will lose 1% — netting out to zero.

Of course, options are not linear derivatives and their deltas will change as the underlying moves — this is known as the option's [gamma](/gamma). Accordingly, the futures equivalents will change as the market moves. Assuming the gold market climbs by 1%, for instance, while the position might not have made or lost any money, the futures equivalent might have moved from zero for the hedged position to +5. The trader would then have to sell five additional futures contracts to return to delta-neutral. This interaction is called dynamic hedging, or [delta-gamma hedging](/deltagamma-hedging).

## Features
- Futures equivalent is helpful when one needs to hedge exposure to an options position or for computing the number of contracts expected to roll over a lapsing position.
- Futures equivalent alludes to the amount of futures contracts expected to hedge an equivalent options position.
- It just applies to options where the underlying asset is a futures contract, for example, options on an equity index.
