# Non-Interest Income
## What is Non-Interest Income?

Non-interest income is bank and creditor income derived principally from fees including deposit and transaction fees, deficient funds (NSF) fees, annual fees, month to month account service charges, inactivity fees, check and deposit slip fees, etc. Credit card issuers likewise charge penalty fees, including late fees and over-the-limit fees. Institutions charge fees that generate non-interest income as an approach to expanding revenue and guaranteeing liquidity in the event of increased default rates.

## Grasping Non-Interest Income

Interest is the [cost of borrowing](/costofdebt) money and is one form of income that banks collect. For financial institutions, for example, banks, interest addresses [operating income](/operatingincome), which is income from normal business operations. The core purpose of a bank's business model is to loan money, so its primary source of income is interest and its primary asset is cash. All things considered, banks depend intensely on non-interest income when [interest rates](/interestrate) are low. At the point when interest rates are high, sources of non-interest income can be lowered to tempt customers to pick one bank over another.

## Strategic Importance of Non-Interest Income

Most businesses that are not banks depend totally on non-interest income. Financial institutions and banks, then again, make the majority of their money from loaning and once again loaning money. Subsequently, these organizations view non-interest income as a strategic detail on the [income statement](/incomestatement). This is particularly true when interest rates are low since banks profit from the spread between the cost of funds and the average lending rate. Low interest rates make it hard for banks to create a gain, so they frequently depend on non-interest income to keep up with profit edges.

According to a client viewpoint, non-interest income sources like fees and punishments are irritating, best case scenario. For certain individuals, these fees can rapidly add up and cause real financial damage to a budget. According to a financial backer's viewpoint, be that as it may, a bank's ability to dial up non-interest income to safeguard profit edges or even increase edges in great times is a positive. The more drivers of income a financial institution has, the better enduring adverse economic conditions is able.

## Drivers of Non-Interest Income

The degree to which banks depend on non-interest fees to create a gain is a function of the economic environment. Market interest rates are driven by benchmark rates, for example, the [Federal funds rate](/federalfundsrate). The Fed funds rate, or the rate at which banks loan money to each, still up in the air by the rate at which the [Federal Reserve](/federalreservebank) pays banks interest. This rate is alluded to as the interest rate on excess reserves (IOER). As the IOER increases, banks can create a higher gain from interest income. At one point, it turns out to be more worthwhile for a bank to involve the reduction of fees and charges as a marketing device to draw new deposits, as opposed to as a method for expanding profits. When one bank takes this action, the market competition on fees starts over again.
