## What Is the January Barometer?

The term January Barometer alludes to the conviction held by certain traders that the investment performance of the [S&P 500](/sp500) in January can anticipate its performance until the end of the year.

For instance, defenders of this view trust that if the S&P 500 rises between Jan. 1 and Jan. 31, this will predict a positive outcome until the end of the year. Also, that's what it holds assuming the market admissions inadequately in January, it will probably perform ineffectively from there on too.

## Grasping the January Barometer

The possibility of the January Barometer was first advocated in the book **Stock Trader's Almanac**, written by Yale Hirsch in 1967. Be that as it may, it is as yet utilized by certain traders right up to the present day.

Traders who put stock in this theory might utilize it to try and time the market. That is, they may possibly invest in the market in the years when the barometer predicts the market will rise, and avoid the market when it gauges a market [pullback](/pullback).

Defenders of this view will refer to data showing that somewhere in the range of 1966 and 2001, there has without a doubt been a strong correlation between the S&P 500's returns in January and those of the excess year. Notwithstanding, this phenomenon might be to a great extent fanciful. All things considered, somewhere in the range of 1945 and 2017, U.S. equity markets produced a positive annual return generally 75% of the time. Subsequently, the January Barometer could just be a secondary effect of the overall propensity of U.S. equities to creep higher every year, instead of a special phenomenon that can be utilized to additionally further develop one's [market timing](/markettiming).

Pundits of the January Barometer theory will point out that comparable peculiarities have not been in every case found outside of the U.S., and that it might in this way be a brief anomaly specific to U.S. equity markets.

> ### U.S. Phenomenon
> The January Barometer might have a self-building up character. In the event that U.S. investors respond to a strong January by investing all the more vigorously in stocks, this could itself make prices rise. If true, this could make sense of why the correlation among January and annual market returns is more predominant in the U.S. than in different locales where the January Barometer theory is less notable.
