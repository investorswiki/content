# Business Logic
## What Is Business Logic

Business logic is the custom rules or [algorithms](/calculation) that handle the exchange of information between a database and UI. Business logic is basically the part of a computer program that contains the information (as business rules) that characterizes or compels how a business works. Such business rules are operational policies that are generally communicated in true or false pairs. Business logic should be visible in the workflows that they support, for example, in arrangements or steps that determine exhaustively the appropriate flow of information or data, and hence direction. Business logic is otherwise called "space logic."

## Grasping Business Logic

Put another way, business logic is true business rules put into computer code and displayed in a computer program by means of a UI. Business logic is most clear in its part in making workflows that pass data among users and software systems. Business logic decides how data might be shown, stored, made, and altered. It gives a system of rules that guides how business objects (parts of software that control how data is moved) work with each other. Business logic likewise directs how business objects inside software are gotten to and refreshed. It exists at a higher level than the type of code that is utilized to keep up with essential computer infrastructure, for example, how a database is shown to a client or as fundamental system infrastructure.

The calculations engaged with business logic perform in the background data processing that is invisible to the client yet is critical to keeping things running flawlessly in a cutting edge economy.

## Business Logic versus Business Rules

Business rules are futile without business logic to decide how data is calculated, changed, and sent to users and software. Yet, without business rules to make a system, business logic can't exist. Business logic is any part of a business enterprise that makes up a system of processes and procedures, though whatever else is an illustration of a business rule.

## Business Logic Example

A credit card issuer's business logic might indicate that out-of-state credit card [transactions](/transaction) over a certain limit, say $500, be [flagged](/banner) as suspicious and the issuer reached as quickly as time permits to affirm the genuineness of the transaction. The policy of hailing such a transaction is an illustration of a business rule; the genuine course of hailing the transaction is an illustration of business logic. Given that large number of credit card transactions are directed each and every day, business logic empowers such transactions to be checked and handled in an efficient and ideal way.

## Features
- **Business logic exists at a higher level than the type of code that is utilized to keep up with essential computer infrastructure.**
- **Business logic should be visible in the workflows that they support, for example, in groupings or steps that determine exhaustively the legitimate flow of information or data**
- **Business logic alludes to the logic and calculations filling in as the foundation of code in business software.**
