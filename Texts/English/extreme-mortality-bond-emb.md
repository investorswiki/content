# Extreme Mortality Bond (EMB)
## What Is an Extreme Mortality Bond (EMB)?

Extreme mortality bonds (EMBs) are a type of [catastrophe bond](/catastrophebond) (CAT), a high-yield debt instrument that is intended to fund-raise for companies in the insurance industry in the event of a natural disaster that causes excess deaths.

Events like a seismic tremor, a pandemic, or a hurricane that lead to a large-scale loss of life are called extreme mortality events. Such events create a risky situation for insurance companies in light of the fact that the companies wind up paying vigorously for a large number of insurance claims. To relieve these risks, insurers securitize their issued policies as bonds called extreme mortality bonds (EMBs).

Most as of late, the death toll and economic fallout from the global COVID-19 pandemic has put EMBs back into discussion.

## Understanding Extreme Mortality Bonds (EMBs)

Basically, extreme mortality bond (EMB) buyers may completely or partially lose their investment assuming an extreme mortality event happens. The EMB issuer (insurance company) utilizes that amount to offset the losses from the high number of insurance claims it necessities to settle. Assuming no extreme event happens during the investment period, investors receive the interest and principal amount. The insurer pays the high interest from the insurance premiums collected from insurance buyers.

EMBs are sold with a [maturity period](/maturitydate) of three to five years, in spite of the fact that they accompany a condition linked to extreme events. That's what it states in the event that the responsible insurance company faces a loss due to the occurrence of a particular extreme mortality event, then the issuer may presently not be committed to pay the interest or the principal amount, or both.

## EMBs: A Win

EMBs offer a mutually beneficial arrangement for both the bond issuer and the bond investor. The responsible company mitigates the risk of high payments on account of extreme events, while the bond buyer benefits on the off chance that a disaster doesn't happen. For instance, in 2018, the Ebola virus was linked to very nearly 2,300 deaths in the Democratic Republic of Congo, however the casualty amount didn't meet the criteria fundamental for World Bank's EMB to pay out.

Since extreme mortality bonds are not linked to the [stock market](/stockmarket) or other economic conditions, they offer a method for differentiating. The offered interest on EMBs is typically high since disasters are rare. An EMBs require mortality for a specific region to increase as much as 20% to 40% past what is normal for that region before investors lose capital.

In the United States, that would mean an extra 500,000 deaths per year. That would require a major mortality event like a pandemic on par with the 1918 Spanish influenza pandemic, a world war, the explosion of a nuclear bomb, or a huge climate event or psychological militant attack. Just a portion of the casualties of such an event would be insured by a given EMB's issuer, further lessening the risk to investors.

Investors benefit from high returns on an EMB in the event that all works out in a good way, yet in addition face the risk of losing principal and interest in the event that a disaster happens. Investors add EMBs to their portfolios in limited parts to benefit from diversification.

## Highlights
- An extreme mortality bond (EMB) is a high-yield debt instrument that insurers issue to lay out a financial reserve to fund claims from catastrophic events that lead to excess deaths.
- EMBs, however they can be highly risky in the event of a natural disaster or pandemic, are viewed as uncorrelated assets that are unlinked to global stock or bond markets.
- Investors in EMBs can receive an interest rate over the life of the bond that is greater than that of most fixed-income securities.
