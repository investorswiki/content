# Integrated Circuit (IC)
An integrated circuit (IC) is a small chip, typically made of silicon, that holds a set of electronic parts like semiconductors, resistors or capacitors. Such small chips are widely utilized today and are available in a large portion of the electronic devices. They can perform estimations, and furthermore function as microprocessors, intensifiers, oscillators, and data storage. Integrated circuits are solid and can be delivered in exceptionally large scopes. Since they are generally cheap, they played nevertheless play an important job in the proceeded with advancement and development of electronics worldwide.
Integrated circuits can have billions of semiconductors in a tiny area. Due to the technological progressions made with these small chips, modern PCs turned out to be extensively more efficient when compared to more seasoned PCs. PCs utilize digital integrated circuits that work with binary values of 1 and 0. Basically, low signals mean 0 and high signals mean 1. Simple integrated circuits are utilized in radios or sound devices which takes an info value and makes an output value.
Before the creation of integrated circuits, discrete circuits were being utilized. Discrete circuits were individual semiconductors, resistors or capacitors and they were typically wired together which required some investment and they were subject to physical unsteadiness. After integrated circuits were created, they performed better than discrete circuits and they were significantly more affordable. Notwithstanding cost and performance, ICs utilize many less resources to perform comparative tasks.
