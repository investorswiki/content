# Passive Activity
## What is passive activity?
As per IRS regulations, passive activity alludes to a business venture that you don't actively partake in.
## More profound definition
For tax purposes, the IRS groups income into two categories: active and passive. For income to fall into the active category, you must meet certain criteria to demonstrate that you were an active participant in the business.
Conversely, a passive activity is one where you are not a material participant. This doesn't mean that you didn't participate by any stretch of the imagination in the activity. It means that the venture is viewed as a passive activity utilizing IRS standards. The two most common types of passive activities are running non-material businesses and holding rental units.
The qualification between active activities and passive activities is important on the grounds that the IRS treats losses in an unexpected way, contingent upon the classification. You can utilize losses from active activities to reduce your different forms of taxable income, for example, your salary and business profits.
In any case, you just can utilize losses from passive activities to reduce income from other passive activities. In the event that you have no passive income to count the loss against in the current tax year, you can carry over the loss to future tax a long time until you really do have passive income.
## Passive activity model
On the off chance that you choose to invest in a business or purchase a rental unit, this is reasonable a passive activity. For instance, expect that you choose to purchase a restaurant with three other business partners. You don't take an active part in running the restaurant, and as per IRS regulations, this business venture qualifies as a passive activity.
Assuming you understand losses from the restaurant, you can't utilize the losses to reduce your taxable income from your salaried job. Nonetheless, assuming you choose to sell your part in the restaurant, you can utilize your prior passive losses to offset the reported profit from the sale.
