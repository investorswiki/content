## What Is Beneficial Interest?

Parents might set up [Crummey trusts](/crummey-trust), funded through annual gifts, to exploit gift tax prohibitions.

## Different Examples of Beneficial Interest

With these employer-sponsored accounts, the account holder might assign a named beneficiary who can benefit from the account funds in the event of the account holder's death. The rules overseeing beneficiary interest in these cases differ widely contingent upon the type of retirement account and the identity of the beneficiary.

A spouse beneficiary to an IRA has more freedom over the assets than any other individual. The enduring spouse can regard the account as their own, [rollover assets](/rollover-ira) into another arrangement — on the off chance that the IRS permits — or assign themselves as the beneficiary.

A non-spouse beneficiary to an IRA, for instance, can't regard the account as their own. Accordingly, the beneficiary can't make contributions to the account or rollover any assets in or out of the IRA.
