# Double No-Touch Option
## What Is a Double No-Touch Option?

A double no-touch option is a type of [exotic option](/exoticoption) that gives the holder a predetermined payout provided that the underlying asset price stays inside a predefined range until expiration. The buyer arranges the price range — called the barrier levels — with the seller. The seller is frequently a [brokerage firm](/brokerage-organization).

The maximum conceivable loss is the cost of setting up the option. The maximum profit is the negotiated payout amount (minus the cost of purchasing the option). Regularly, the buyer indicates the amount they might want to risk, and the broker gives a percentage payout in view of this amount (and other factors). This keeps the structure of double no-touch options very simple.

Double no-touch and its opposite, [double one-touch](/doublebarrieroption) options, both fall in the binary options category. Binary options have a "yes or no" logic basis. Either they payout the full amount or they pay zero (and the buyer loses their investment).

## Grasping the Double No-Touch Option

Since they have a binary payout, double no-touch options are [binary options](/binary-option). They are wagers that the underlying asset won't move past the barrier levels by a certain date. On account of this structure, they bring an element of gambling into the equation. For sure, these types of options and their sellers are prone to [fraud](/fraud), which is the reason numerous purviews ban these products. The payouts will quite often incline toward the sellers/brokers (like the manner in which gambling games in casinos favor the "house").

The double no-touch option could be valuable on the off chance that an investor accepts the price of an underlying asset will remain [range-bound](/rangeboundtrading) over a predefined period. Double no-touch options will quite often be offered to binary options traders mostly in the [forex](/forex) (FX) markets.

For instance, if the current [EUR/USD](/eur-usd-euro-us-dollar-cash pair) rate is 1.15, and a [trader](/trader) accepts this rate will remain static over the next 15 days, the trader could utilize a double no-touch option with barriers at 1.10 and 1.20. The investor can profit on the off chance that the rate doesn't move past either of the two barriers.

## Special Considerations

A trader could likewise achieve similar goal with traditional options by utilizing a [short strangle](/strangle) strategy or a [short straddle](/shortstraddle) strategy. The advantages of normal options incorporate [liquidity](/liquidity), transparency, and negligible counterparty risk.

With most double-no touch options, there isn't really a cost upfront. All things being equal, the trader just concludes how much money they need to invest in the option, in light of the payout the broker is giving. The broker decides the payout in view of several factors. They will offer lower payouts on the off chance that the barrier levels are more extensive. This is on the grounds that there is a greater probability the levels will not be touched (and that means the buyer receives the payout).

A shorter time span until expiration will likewise lower the payout in light of the fact that, in a short amount of time, the price isn't probably going to move a lot. On the off chance that the price doesn't move a lot — and consequently doesn't arrive at the barriers — the buyer receives a payout. The more probable it is that the price will remain between the barriers, the lower the payout the buyer will receive from the broker. This is on the grounds that the broker needs to safeguard themselves and will, therefore, build their protection into the payouts that they offer.

A double no-touch option is the inverse of a double one-touch option. The holder of the one-touch option receives the payout assuming the price of the underlying asset touches or travels through either of the barrier levels.

## Double No-Touch versus Vanilla Options

As recently mentioned, double no-touch options are not equivalent to standard or [vanilla options](/vanillaoption). No-touch and any remaining binary options are principally [over-the-counter](/otc) (OTC) instruments. The buyer and seller arrange the terms, which incorporate the payoff amount, the upper and lower barrier levels, and the expiration date. In practice, no negotiation goes on. The broker gives the terms and the buyer either acknowledges them or doesn't trade.

Most binary options bring about just two results. The buyer loses what they paid for the option, or they receive a payout. At times, the broker might allow the buyer to exit the trade prior to expiry, typically bringing about a partial loss or profit.

Standard options trade on proper exchanges and give the holder the right, yet not the obligation, to buy or sell the [underlying asset](/underlying-asset) at a predetermined price by or on a specific date. They additionally have normalized [strike prices](/strikeprice), expirations, and contract sizes. This normalization provides them with the advantage of liquidity in a [secondary market](/secondarymarket), and more confirmations for both the buyer and seller that the trade and working out, assuming it happens, will occur expeditiously and easily.

Customary options will more often than not be reasonably priced in view of market conditions in light of the fact that the price is set by the two buyers and sellers. With a double no-touch binary option, everything is set by the broker selling the option, which regularly slants the risk/prize in the broker's approval.

## Illustration of a Double No-Touch Option Trade

Expect a trader is watching the [USD/JPY](/usd-jpy-us-dollar-japanese-yen-cash pair). The current rate is 108.55. The trader accepts that the price is probably going to remain somewhere in the range of 109 and 108 for the next 24 hours.

They purchase a double no-touch option with these barrier levels, terminating in one day, and invest $100. The broker is offering a payout of half. That means that assuming the price stays somewhere in the range of 108.999 and 108.001, the buyer will receive $50 (and their $100 back) in light of the fact that the price didn't touch or surpass the barriers.

Assuming that the price touches 109 or above, or 108 or below, the trader loses their $100. The payout or loss will consequently happen inside the trader's account when the option lapses.

A half payout may sound excellent for full time work, however the trader is risking 100% of their invested capital to just make half. Most traders look to make more on champs than they lose on failures, and this payout is really something contrary to that goal. The trader should win two times for each one loss just to [break even](/breakevenpoint).

Likewise, if the payout is higher, for example, 80%, that means it is exceptionally impossible that the price will remain inside the barriers of that contract. The payout is higher, yet the chance of getting the payout will be exceptionally low.

## Features
