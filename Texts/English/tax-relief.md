# Tax Relief
## What Is Tax Relief?

Tax relief alludes to any government program or policy intended to assist people and organizations with diminishing their tax weights or resolve their tax-related debts.

Tax relief might be as universal tax cuts, targeted programs that benefit specific groups of taxpayers, or drives that reinforce specific goals of the government. For instance, the child tax credit offers a tax reprieve to parents of minor children, while the tax credit for green improvements (e.g., energy-proficient windows) promotes the goal of U.S. energy independence and cleaner air.

## Figuring out Tax Relief

Tax relief programs and drives assist taxpayers with decreasing their tax bills through tax deductions, credits, and exclusions. Different programs help taxpayers who are behind on their taxes settle their tax-related debts, possibly staying away from liens simultaneously.

Government policy goals are in many cases the catalyst for changing the federal tax code. For instance, in response to worries about the general lack of retirement savings in the U.S., Congress made incentives to encourage individuals to put something aside for retirement in tax-advantaged savings accounts — like IRAs and 401(k)s.

Tax relief is likewise accessible for individuals impacted by natural calamities. For instance, the IRS made many tax relief declarations in 2021 to help people and organizations impacted by serious tempests, cyclones, flooding, hurricanes, straight-line winds, wildfires, and dry season. The relief commonly comes through filing and payment extensions, penalty and interest waivers, and deductions for casualty and theft losses supported due to federally declared calamities.

## Tax Deductions

A [tax deduction](/tax-deduction) reduces your taxable income for the year, consequently lowering your tax bill. Taxpayers can take the standard deduction or organize their deductions on Schedule An of Form 1040 or 1010-SR. (You can't do both.)

### Standard Deduction

The standard deduction amount depends on your filing status, age, and whether you are disabled or claimed as a dependent on another person's income tax return. Here are the standard deduction amounts for the 2021 and 2022 tax years:

<tr>
<th> Filing Status</th><th>2021 Standard Deduction</th><th>2022 Standard Deduction</th></tr>

<tr>
<td>Single</td><td>$12,550</td><td>$12,950</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>Married Filing Separately</td><td>$12,550</td><td>$12,950</td></tr>

<td>Head of Household</td><td>$18,800</td><td>$19,400</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>Married Filing Jointly</td><td>$25,100</td><td>$25,900</td></tr>
<tr>

</tbody>
</table>
You can take an extra deduction in the event that you are basically age 65 or legally blind toward the finish of the tax year. For 2021, this "extra standard deduction" is $1,350 ($1,700 if filing as single or head of household) in the event that you are 65 or more established **or** blind. The amount pairs assuming you are 65 or more seasoned **and** blind. The extra standard deduction for 2022 increments to $1,400 ($1,750 if single or head of household).

In the event that another taxpayer can claim you as a dependent, your standard deduction for 2021 is limited to the greater of $1,100 or your earned income plus $350 (the total can't be more than the fundamental standard deduction for your filing status). For 2022, the deduction can't surpass the greater of $1,150 or your earned income plus $400.

### Itemized Deductions

Itemized deductions are expenses that can be deducted from your adjusted gross income to lower your taxable income — and tax bill. You can organize your deductions provided that you don't claim the standard deduction. It appears to be legit to organize in the event that the total amount you can deduct is greater than the standard deduction for your filing status. Common itemized deductions include:

- [Mortgage interest](/home-mortgage-interest) and discount points on the first $750,000 of secured mortgage debt (or $1 million assuming you bought the home before Dec. 16, 2017)
- Charitable gifts
- Unreimbursed medical and dental expenses
- State and neighborhood taxes (SALT)
- Certain gambling losses
- [Investment interest expenses](/investment-interest-cost)

> Tax relief frequently targets specific taxpayers, for example, those facing unforeseen costs due to a hurricane or a wildfire.

## Tax Credits

A tax credit is one more form of tax relief. Dissimilar to tax deductions, which lower your taxable income, tax credits straightforwardly reduce the amount of tax you owe.

Here is a model. Say a taxpayer takes the standard deduction, and their tax bill amounts to $3,000. In the event that the person is likewise eligible for a $1,000 tax credit, their last tax bill would be $2,000. By comparison, with a $1,000 tax deduction, somebody in the 22% tax bracket would save just $220.

This type of tax relief is much of the time depicted as a tax incentive since it repays taxpayers for expenditures the government considers beneficial. For instance, the [American opportunity tax credit (AOTC)](/american-opportunity-tax-credit) and the [lifetime learning credit (LLC)](/lifelearningcredit) programs give tax credits to individuals who sign up for postsecondary education programs. Other well known tax credits include:

- [Earned income tax credit (EITC)](/earnedincomecredit)
- [Child tax credit](/childtaxcredit)
- [Saver's tax credit](/saverstaxcredit)
- Medical coverage Marketplace premium tax credit

## Tax Exclusions

While tax deductions are amounts you deduct from your income, tax exclusions set to the side certain types of income as non-taxable. Thusly, tax exclusions reduce your taxable income — and your tax bill. For instance, you can generally bar from your income any child support payments, life insurance death benefits, and municipal bond income you receive.

A common tax exclusion is the one for employer-sponsored health care coverage. Health care coverage premiums your employer pays are exempt from federal income and payroll taxes, and the portion of premiums you pay is generally excluded from your taxable income. The exclusion of premiums lowers your tax bill, actually decreasing your after-tax cost of health care coverage.

> On the off chance that you earned income overseas, you may be eligible for the [foreign earned income exclusion](/foreign-earned-income-exclusion) and the [foreign housing exclusion](/foreign-housing-exclusion-deduction). To qualify, you must be a U.S. citizen or resident alien who is a resident of a foreign country for a continuous period that incorporates the whole tax year.

Another famous tax exclusion relates to selling a house. Assuming that you have a capital gain from the sale of your primary home, you can reject up to $250,000 ($500,000 whenever married filing jointly) of that gain from your income. To qualify, you must have owned and resided in the home for no less than two out of the previous five years, and you must not have excluded the gain from the sale of one more home inside the last two years.

Now and again, income excluded for tax designs isn't recorded on the return. In different cases, it is kept in one section of the return and afterward deducted in another area.

## Tax Debt Relief

The IRS Fresh Start program assists taxpayers with getting up to speed with back taxes and stay away from tax liens, demands, wage garnishments, and prison time.

- **At present not collectible (CNC):** Under the CNC program, the IRS determines that your gross month to month income is too low to sensibly pay what you owe without triggering financial hardship. Assortment is ended on your debt, and the IRS won't levy your bank accounts, embellish your wages, or hold onto your assets. All things being equal, you concede making payments until you're financially ready to pay.
- **Installment agreement:** An IRS installment agreement lets you pay the taxes you owe by making standard regularly scheduled payments over a specific, extended time period. Interest and punishments might keep accumulating until you pay your balance in full.
