# Ginnie Mae Pass-Through
## What Is Ginnie Mae Pass-Through?

A Ginnie Mae pass-through is an investment issued by the [Government National Mortgage Association](/ginniemae) (GNMA), known as Ginnie Mae, that draws income from pools of [Federal Housing Administration](/federal-housing-administration) (FHA) and [Department of Veterans Affairs](/us-department-veterans-affairs) (VA) mortgages.

Ginnie Mae pass-through securities earn income from the interest and principal payments made on mortgages by mortgage holders.

This type of security turns out month to month revenue throughout some undefined time frame and is generally viewed as safe since it is guaranteed by the government. The mortgages in Ginnie Mae pass-through securities have been guaranteed by the FHA or VA, implying that the government has insured them. So Ginnie Mae pass-through securities have more layers of protection against a default in payment than a customary MBS. The first is the borrower and their own [creditworthiness](/credit-value), likewise with each mb. Also, Ginnie Mae is the ultimate guarantor of the MBS, and behind its own financial strength is the U.S. government backstopping the whole system.

Ginnie Mae I, or GNMA I MBS, is made out of mortgages that pay principal and interest on the fifteenth of each and every month, while the Ginnie Mae II, or GNMA II MBS, does likewise on the 20th of each and every month. The amount of interest might vary, since various mortgages have various rates that are totaled into the pools.

One more difference between the two pools is the maturity, with Ginnie Mae I having a maximum of 30 years for single-family and 40 years for multifamily, while Ginnie Mae II is 30 years max as it does exclude multifamily project or construction loans.

"Midgets" is a shoptalk term alluding to GNMA agency bonds with 15-year maturities, which are secured by mortgages backed by federal agencies. This informal term is once in a while utilized by bond traders and dealers, and not by GNMA itself.
