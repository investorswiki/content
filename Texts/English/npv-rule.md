# Net Present Value Rule
## What is the Net Present Value Rule?

The net present value rule is the possibility that company managers and investors ought to just invest in projects or take part in transactions that have a positive [net present value](/npv) (NPV). They ought to try not to invest in projects that have a negative net present value. It is a legitimate outgrowth of net present value theory.

## Understanding the Net Present Value Rule

As per the net present value theory, investing in something that has a net present value greater than zero ought to consistently increase a company's [earnings](/earnings). On account of an investor, the investment ought to increase the [shareholder](/shareholder's) wealth. Companies may likewise take part in projects with neutral NPV when they are associated with future immaterial and right now tremendous benefits or where they empower continuous investments to occur.

Albeit most companies follow the net present value rule, there are conditions where it's anything but a factor. For instance, a company with critical [debt](/debt) issues might abandon or defer undertaking a project with a positive NPV. The company might accept the other way as it diverts capital to determine a quickly squeezing debt issue. Poor [corporate governance](/corporategovernance) can likewise make a company overlook or miscount NPV.

## How the Net Present Value Rule is Used

Net present value, usually seen in [capital budgeting](/capitalbudgeting) projects, accounts for the [time value of money](/timevalueofmoney) (TVM). Time value of money is the possibility that future money has less value than as of now accessible capital, due to the earnings capability of the current money. A business will utilize a [discounted cash flow](/dcf) (DCF) calculation, which will mirror the expected change in wealth from a specific project. The calculation will factor in the time value of money by discounting the projected cash flows back to the present, utilizing a company's [weighted average cost of capital](/wacc) (WACC). A project or investment's NPV equals the current value of net cash inflows the project is expected to produce, minus the initial capital required for the project.

During the company's dynamic cycle, it will utilize the net present value rule to choose whether to seek after a project, like an acquisition. If the calculated NPV of a project is negative (< 0), the project is expected to bring about a net loss for the company. Subsequently, and as per the rule, the company shouldn't seek after the project. In the event that a project's NPV is positive (> 0), the company can anticipate a profit and ought to consider moving forward with the investment. On the off chance that a project's NPV is neutral (= 0), the project isn't expected to bring about any critical gain or loss for the company. With a neutral NPV, management utilizes non-monetary factors, for example, elusive benefits made, to settle on the investment.
