# Schedule D
## What Is Schedule D: Capital Gains and Losses?

Schedule D is one of the numerous [schedules](/taxschedule) given by the IRS and appended to U.S. Individual Income Tax Return [Form 1040](/1040), which you must complete to report any gains or losses you understand from the sale of your capital assets.

Your capital assets are for tax purposes, basically, all that you own and use for joy or investment purposes. The capital assets you are probably going to report on Schedule D are the stocks, bonds, and homes you sell.

## Figuring out Schedule D: Capital Gains and Losses

Investments or assets that are sold must be recorded for tax purposes. This incorporates [realized capital losses](/realizedloss), which can be deducted from your income tax bill in the event that the shares sold were owned for investment purposes. Capital gains or losses are broken down into either [short-term](/short-term-gain) capital gains/losses (arranged after under 12-months from purchase date) or [long-term](/long-term_capital_gain_loss) capital gains/losses (arranged following 12 months or more from purchase). Long-term capital gains tax is many times better (0%-20% relying upon one's income tax bracket) than short-term gains that are taxed as ordinary income.

All prior forms of Schedule D are available on the IRS website.

Schedule D has guidelines that assist you with collecting information about the current year [capital asset](/capitalasset) sales and prior year capital loss carry-forwards. Contingent upon your tax situation, Schedule D might train you to prepare and bring over information from other tax forms.

- [Form 8949](/form-8949) on the off chance that you sell investments or your home
- [Form 4797](/form-4797) in the event that you sell a business property
- [Form 6252](/form-6252) assuming you have installment sale income
- [Form 4684](/form-4684) in the event that you have a casualty or theft loss
- [Form 8824](/like-kind_exchange) on the off chance that you made a like-kind exchange

Eventually, the capital gain or loss you register on Schedule D is combined with your other income and loss to figure your tax on Form 1040. Schedule D and Form 8949 are incorporated with Form 1040 when you file your federal tax return.

## Instance of Using Schedule D: Capital Gains and Losses

Taking a simple model, expect the main property you sold during the tax year was stock and you received a [Form 1099-B](/form-1099-b) from your broker that reports a $4 net short-term capital gain and a net $8 long-term capital gain from the accompanying sales:

- Stock acquired on 1/1/20 for $4 and sold on 4/27/20 for $6, bringing about a short-term capital gain of $2.
- Stock acquired on 1/1/20 for $3 and sold on 4/28/20 for $7, bringing about a short-term capital gain of $4.
- Stock acquired on 1/1/20 for $9 and sold on 4/29/20 for $8, bringing about a short-term capital loss of $1.
- Stock acquired on 1/1/20 for $9 and sold on 4/30/20 for $8, bringing about a short-term capital loss of $1.
- Stock acquired on 1/1/15 for $1 and sold on 12/31/20 for $9, bringing about a long-term capital gain of $8.
- Stock acquired on 1/2/15 for $1 and sold on 12/30/20 for $3, bringing about a long-term capital gain of $2.
- Stock acquired on 1/3/15 for $4 and sold on 4/29/20 for $3, bringing about a long-term capital loss of $1.
- Stock acquired on 1/4/15 for $4 and sold on 4/30/20 for $3, bringing about a long-term capital loss of $1.

These stock sales are sales of capital assets that you must report on Schedule D. Schedule D teaches you to first complete [Form 8949](/form-8949). Sales of stock you own for under a year are sales of [short-term capital assets](/short-term-gain) reported on Part I of Form 8949 and sales of stock you held for over a year are sales of [long-term capital assets](/long-term_capital_gain_loss) reported on Part II of Form 8949. Helpfully, the categories on Form 1099-B relate to those on Form 8949. You process each stock sale's gain or loss by subtracting its cost basis from its proceeds.

A count of gains and losses gives a total Part I, net short-term capital gain of $4 to transfer to Part I of Schedule D. The total Part II, net long-term capital gain of $8 will transfer to Part II of Schedule D. Schedule D, Part III purposes this information to process your net allowable capital gain or loss. You have a $12 [capital gain](/capitalgain).

If all things being equal, you had a [capital loss](/capitalloss) and, due to limitations on its deductibility, you had an excess capital loss to carry forward to the next year, make a point to keep your records so you can precisely enter your [capital loss carryforward](/losscarryforward) on next year's Schedule D.
