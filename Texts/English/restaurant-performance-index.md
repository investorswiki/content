# Restaurant Performance Index (RPI)
## What Is the Restaurant Performance Index (RPI)?

The Restaurant Performance Index (RPI) is a month to month index that tracks the wellbeing and outlook of the U.S. restaurant industry. The [National Restaurant Association](/home), the world's biggest food-service trade group, distributes the index results on the last business day of every month.

## Understanding the Restaurant Performance Index (RPI)

The Restaurant Performance Index (RPI) mirrors the consequences of a month to month survey of approximately 400 restaurateurs from one side of the country to the other. The survey measures replies in key areas, for example, [same-store sales,](/samestoresales) traffic, labor, and [capital expenditures. ](/capitalexpenditure)

The index, which was sent off in 2002, is contained two similarly weighted parts: the Current Situation Index and the Expectations Index. The Current Situation Index measures changes in same-store sales, customer traffic, the total number of total employees and their average hours worked, as well as capital spending. Every measurement is followed versus the year-prior month.

The Expectations Index, in the mean time, mirrors a six-month outlook for same-store sales relative to the same period the previous year; an outlook for the changes in the number of employees required in the next a half year; capital spending plans; and business administrators' sentiments about overall business conditions.

Every part breaks down survey results into an index value that is estimated comparable to a steady-state of 100. That is, readings below 100 demonstrate business contraction, 100 is the norm, and index values over 100 signal expansion.

The National Restaurant Association offers a significant part of the index data for free on its website and makes more definite data breakdowns accessible through a subscription service called Restaurant TrendMapper.
