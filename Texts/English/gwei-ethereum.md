# Gwei

The term Gwei alludes to a small denomination of ether (ETH), which is the native currency of the Ethereum blockchain. As the name proposes,
Alongside ETH, Gwei is the most commonly utilized denomination of Ethereum's cryptocurrency, and it is especially valuable while discussing [gas](/gas-ethereum). Basically, [gas](/gas-ethereum) is the pricing mechanism utilized on the Ethereum network. Such a mechanism is responsible for working out the fees when users perform a transaction or execute a smart contract operation.
In particular, a unit of Gwei is defined as one-billionth (one Nano) of an Ether. So 1 Gwei equals 0.000000001 or 10-9 ETH. Then again, 1 ETH equals one billion (109) Gwei.
As introduced on the Ethereum [GitHub](/github), there are several different denominations of ether, each addressing a multiple of [wei](/wei) (the smallest unit of ETH).
