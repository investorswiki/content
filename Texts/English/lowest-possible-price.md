# At the Lowest Possible Price
## What Does "At the Lowest Possible Price" Mean?

## Grasping "At the Lowest Possible Price"

At the Lowest Possible Price requests are all the more commonly found in markets with limited [liquidity](/liquidity) or low trading volumes, or among traders of firms with tiny market capitalizations. This is on the grounds that investors trading illiquid securities have less options with regards to executing a buy or sell order. The market for a thinly traded security is more limited and different gatherings are better able to demand pricing that may not be great for the investor.

For instance, investors hoping to trade currency options in [exotic currencies](/exotic_currency) (i.e., currencies other than the dollar, euro, pound, or yen) frequently use At the Lowest Possible Price.

## Special Considerations

At the Lowest Possible Price requests go with market orders. [Market orders](/marketorder) are transactions that include buying or selling a security right away. They guarantee that the order will be executed, yet don't guarantee the execution price. Frequently the transaction goes through at the current market price of the security. At the Lowest Possible Price, on the off chance that it's joined to the order, is a request, yet not a command.

Investors who really do need all the more a guarantee on the security's price, further diminishing their risk of paying too a lot, can utilize a [limit order](/limitorder). Limit orders are orders to buy or sell a security at a specific price or better. A buy limit order must be executed at the limit price or lower, and a sell limit order must be executed at the limit price or higher. Placing in a [buy limit order](/buy-limit-order) would allow the investor to determine a maximum, or limit, to the price they pay. In any case, not at all like with market orders — which go through regardless — the buy-limit order won't be executed except if the asking price is at or below the predetermined limit.

Different kinds of limit orders include:

- A stop order, also known as a[ stop-loss](/stop-lossorder) order, is an order to buy or sell a stock once the price of the stock arrives at the predefined price, known as the stop price. At the point when the stop price is reached, a stop order turns into a market order.
- A [stop-limit order](/stop-limitorder) is a variation on the abovementioned. It requires the setting of two price points: the beginning of the predetermined target price for the trade and the outside of the price target for the trade. A time period must likewise be set. The stop-limit order will be executed at a predefined price, or better, after a given stop price has been reached. When the stop price is reached, the stop-limit order turns into a limit order to buy or sell at the limit price or better
- A [buy-stop](/buystoporder) order is placed at a stop price over the current market price. Investors generally utilize a buy stop order to limit a loss or safeguard a profit on a stock that they have sold short. A sell stop order is placed at a stop price below the current market price. Investors generally utilize a sell-stop order to limit a loss or safeguard a profit on a stock they own.
