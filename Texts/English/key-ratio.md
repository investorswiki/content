# Key Ratio
## What Is a Key Ratio?

Key ratio is the name given to any financial ratio that is considered particularly effective at measuring, illustrating, and summarizing a company's financials in relation to its competitors or peers.

Investors and companies rely on key ratios all the time to get a snapshot of [liquidity](/liquidity), efficiency, profitability, etc. Each key ratio focuses on a particular aspect of the company, meaning it is often necessary to consult several of them to get a more complete idea of how the subject is faring. Those that are in sound [financial health](/financial-health) will have superior ratios to those that are performing poorly.

## How a Key Ratio Works

Key ratios take data from a company's [financial statements](/financial-statements), such as its balance sheet, income statement, and [statement of cash flows](/cashflowstatement), and afterward compare them with other items. These numbers are then calculated together to produce a ratio that represents key aspects of the company's financial picture, such as liquidity, profitability, use of debt, and earnings strength.

There are plenty of financial ratios at one's disposal and determining which are key varies as indicated by opinion and popularity. Some of the most prevalent ratios include:

- **Working capital ratio:** Current assets are divided by current liabilities to establish how capable a company is of meeting its current financial [obligations](/commitment).
- **Price-Earnings (P/E) Ratio:** Divide the current stock price by [earnings per share](/eps) (EPS) to determine the price investors pay for $1 of a company's profit.
- **Return on assets (ROA)**: Divide [net income](/netincome) by total assets to discover the percentage of profit a company earns in relation to the resources it has at its disposal.
- **Return on equity (ROE)**: Divide net income by [shareholders' equity](/shareholdersequity) to see how efficiently investor's capital is being put to use by the company's management.

Not all companies operate similarly, so generally used ratios tend to fluctuate by industry. In other words, the ratios applied to best compare technology companies won't be the same as those used to effectively compare banks.

On account of the latter, it's typical to utilize the capital to assets ratio, the loan [loss reserves](/loss-reserve) to total loans ratio, and the liquidity ratio. For tech stocks, then again, analysts and investors usually prefer to examine price-to-sales (P/S) ratios, [return on research capital](/return-on-research-capital) (RORC, etc.

## Example of a Key Ratio

Sam wants to figure out how efficient ABC Corp is at dealing with its [expenses](/businessexpenses) to generate profits. Taking a gander at net income, sales, operating costs, accounts payable, and net assets figures, Sam computes some of ABC Corp's key profitability ratios, such as ROA and [profit margin](/profitmargin).

All things considered, investors must be careful when using key ratios. Applying just one or two is usually not sufficient enough to get the full picture. A company can seldom be properly evaluated or analyzed using just one ratio in isolation.

Moreover, worth bearing as a primary concern companies might adhere to different [accounting practices](/accounting-practice), making them harder to compare. A combination of ratios should be used related to one another after determining which are the most appropriate for a given case.
