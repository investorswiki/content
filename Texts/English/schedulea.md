# Schedule A (Form 1040 or 1040-SR)
## What Is Schedule A (Form 1040 or 1040-SR): Itemized Deductions?

Schedule A (Form 1040 or 1040-SR): Itemized Deductions is an Internal Revenue Service (IRS) form for U.S. taxpayers who decide to organize their tax-deductible expenses as opposed to take the standard deduction.

The Schedule A form is an optional attachment to the [standard 1040 form](/1040) that U.S. taxpayers use to report their annual income taxes.

## Who Can File Schedule A (Form 1040 or 1040-SR): Itemized Deductions?

Any U.S. taxpayer can file a Schedule A Form. Claiming [itemized deductions](/itemizeddeduction) is an alternative to taking the [standard deduction](/standarddeduction), and taxpayers can utilize whichever option will give them greater savings.

A number of deductions that were once accessible to taxpayers disappeared with the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act passed in 2017. They incorporate deductions for casualty and theft losses not in a disaster area; interest on home equity loans that were utilized for purposes other than buying, building, or working on a home; and "random deductions," which included tax planning fees and occupation related expenses that an employer didn't repay.

The new law likewise limited the amount that taxpayers can deduct for state and nearby taxes to a maximum of $10,000, or $5,000 for married taxpayers filing separately. Simultaneously, the law almost multiplied the standard deduction. The figures are adjusted annually:

- For the 2021 tax year, the standard deduction for single taxpayers and married individuals filing separately is $12,550. For couples filing jointly, it is $25,100. For heads of families, it is $18,800.
- For the tax year 2022, the standard deduction for single taxpayers and married couples filing separately is $12,950. For married couples filing jointly, it is $25,900, and for heads of families, it is $19,400.

As an outcome of these changes, numerous taxpayers who itemized their deductions on Schedule An in years past have found it more advantageous (also simpler) to claim the standard deduction.

## Who Benefits From Filing Schedule A (Form 1040 or 1040-SR): Itemized Deductions?

For inhabitants of high-tax states, the $10,000 limit on deducting state nearby taxes alone might be the game changer. In the event that a married couple can't scrape up essentially another $14,000 in eligible deductions on top of the $10,000, they'll be better off taking the standard deduction.

That was at that point the case for the majority of taxpayers, whose eligible deductions amounted to not exactly the standard deduction even under the old rules. They enjoy the additional benefit of not expecting to keep track of their expenses or collect heaps of receipts. Also, itemized deductions are subject to challenge by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), while taking the standard deduction isn't.

Nonetheless, on the off chance that a taxpayer actually has an adequate number of eligible expenses to surpass the standard deduction, filing Schedule A keeps on checking out. For taxpayers with the highest home prices, mortgage interest is a decent benchmark for choosing which deduction to pick. On the off chance that your annual mortgage interest (as reported to you by your bank on a Mortgage Interest Statement, or Form 1098) is higher than the standard deduction, it is as of now to your advantage to organize deductions as opposed to filing for the standard deduction.

In the event that you're considering buying another home, note that the law currently limits deductible mortgage interest to the first $750,000 of debt for any loans taken out after Dec. 15, 2017. Already, the limit was $1 million.
