## What Is a Price Multiple?

A price multiple is any ratio that uses the share price of a company related to some specific per-share financial metric for a snapshot on valuation. The share price is typically divided by a chosen per-share metric to form a ratio. Price multiples enable investors to evaluate the market value of a company's stock in relation to a fundamental [metric](/metrics), such as earnings, cash flow, or book value.

## Understanding Price Multiples

A price multiple gives investors an opportunity to make a simple [valuation](/valuation) of a company. Price multiples are understood by investors around the world and are accepted as a standard by totally interested parties in a stock.

Investors commonly express a price multiple ratio in the accompanying format: Price multiple = share price/per-share metric.

The numerator in the ratio is the share price, which is the price a single share of a company's stock sells for at a specific time. A company's share price is easily determined simply by taking a gander at a price chart for the company's stock.

The denominator is the per-share metric used at the specific cost multiple calculation. The metric measures some aspect of a company's performance. Investors can calculate these metrics by using data from a company's [financial statement](/financial-statements) or by finding the metrics as part of a company's historical data on a brokerage site.

## Types of Price Multiples

Ratio analysis helps investors determine the financial health of a company by evaluating how a company is performing over time. Price multiples reveal insights to investors that assist them in comparing different companies as potential investment opportunities. Some common price multiples are the [price-to-earnings](/price-earningsratio) (P/E) ratio, [price-to-forward earnings](/forwardpe) (forward P/E), [price-to-book ](/price-to-bookratio)(P/B) ratio, and price-to-sales (P/S) ratio.

Investors and analysts use some ratios to predict earnings and future performance. Other ratios include [price-to-tangible book](/ptbv) (P/TBV), [price-to-cash flow](/price-to-cash-flowratio) (P/CF), price-to-EBITDA (P/EBITDA), and [price-to-free cash flow](/pricetofreecashflow) (P/FCF). These price multiples are easy to compute on the surface, but investors must take care to analyze the components of the denominator to make sure the numbers are accurate.

> When using a price multiple to evaluate a company's performance, investors should ensure there are no extraordinary items, one-offs, or non-recurring factors that might distort the financial metric.

## Benefits of Price Multiples

Price multiples serve an important purpose in providing a static and forward glance at a stock's valuation. The multiples are used to compare present and future (forecasted) valuation multiples of a company with its historical figures and with those of its peers.

Price multiples can assist investors in determining in the event that a stock is [overvalued](/overvalued), undervalued, or genuinely valued. These ratios appeal to investors because they are generally easy to understand and use. Price multiples help investors figure out what a share buys in terms of a measure of value, such as cash flow or earnings.

## Special Considerations

Investors should use just the price multiples that are relevant to a given industry. A P/E ratio would be an appropriate valuation measure for a technology firm, but not necessarily for a capital-intensive utility company that charges a significant amount of depreciation to earnings. In this case, the non-cash charge will lower [generally accepted accounting principles](/gaap) (GAAP) earnings and thus reduce [earnings per share](/eps) (EPS), which might lead to a false impression about the company's valuation. Sometimes P/E is tossed through the window.

For example, non-owners of Amazon stock who have been searching for some reasonable P/E for quite a long time might have come to the realization that the P/E multiple, or lack thereof, in Amazon's case has not mattered one iota. It might from here on out, but owners of Amazon stock who have ignored this price multiple are clear winners.

## Where to Find Price Multiples

Most financial websites display basic price multiples such as P/E, P/B, or P/S. The ratios are typically calculated on a [trailing year (TTM)](/ttm) or last calendar period basis. For the more serious investor, hand calculations of multiples that are relevant to a particular industry should be possible with data provided by companies in their financial reports.
