# STIX
## What is STIX?

The Short Term Index (STIX) is a technical breadth indicator that shows the [exponential moving average](/ema) (EMA) of propelling stocks relative to declining stocks. It is utilized to deliver overbought and oversold readings for a basket of stocks as a whole, and subsequently gives data on whether it is generally a great opportunity to buy or sell stocks.

## The Formula for STIX
<!--D6C7BC3404431610EFEC28B6F7F7A120-->
Where:

Propelling stocks = stocks over the prior [close](/closingprice).

Declining stock = stocks below the prior close.

## Step by step instructions to Calculate the STIX

Utilizing a 21-period EMA is common.

1. Record, every day after the close, the number of stocks that advanced.
1. Record, every day after the close, the sum number of propelling stocks plus the number of declining stocks.
1. Partition the number in step one by the number in step two.
1. Duplicate the outcome by 100.
1. Produce no less than 21 data points, yet ideally more, then, at that point, work out the EMA of the data points.

## Everything that STIX Says to You

STIX is a short-term oscillator that compares the number of propelling stocks to progressing **and** declining stocks. The indicator can be calculated on any basket of stocks by choosing the basket, for example, stocks inside a [sector](/sector) or industry, and afterward playing out the calculation. As a matter of course, the indicator is regularly applied to the S&P 500 or stocks listed on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), giving an outlook to how many stocks are performing.

The STIX wavers around the 50 level, generating values north of 50 while propelling stocks outnumber declining stocks. The short term trading oscillator produces numbers under 50 when advancers are not as much as decliners.

The trading range for the STIX floats generally somewhere in the range of 42 and 58. On the off chance that the STIX shows levels below 42 it demonstrates that stocks as a whole are in an extremely [oversold](/oversold) condition, with levels over 58 signifying extremely [overbought](/overbought) market conditions.

STIX isn't a timing indicator. It demonstrates when the price has taken a big action in one heading or the other and might be ready for a reversal. At the point when that reversal will come is obscure. Different indicators or monitoring price action might aid in such manner. For instance, when the STIX has arrived at an extreme level, watch at a cost action reversal and perhaps a [stochastic](/stochasticoscillator) reversal (of a stock index, like the S&P 500) to assist with affirming the reversal from the extreme condition before acting.

## Illustration of How to Use STIX

STIX isn't commonly accessible on most charting and trading platforms. This means the indicator must frequently be calculated manually.

Watch the STIX indicator for readings that demonstrate an extreme. Greater than 56 is getting overbought, while north of 58 is **very** overbought.

Under 45 is oversold, while under 42 is **very** oversold.

When the price has arrived at one of these levels, it isn't really an opportunity to act. Watch the [price action](/price-action) of the stock indexes to demonstrate they are turning. For instance, in the event that the STIX arrives at 40 and the S&P 500 is declining, hold on until the STIX fires turning up, the S&P 500 turns up, and possibly another indicator, for example, a stochastic oscillator fires turning up and crosses its [signal line](/signal_line).

Assuming that the market is rising into overbought region, it might keep on rising. Hang tight for comparable confirmation of a downturn before acting.

## The Difference Between STIX and the Advance/Decline Line

The [Advance/Decline Line](/advancedeclineline) is cumulative, plotting the difference among progressing and declining stocks consistently. The indicator is unbounded, since it is cumulative. The STIX isn't cumulative; it is an average of recent data points.

## Limitations of Using STIX

The Short Term Index gives overbought and oversold levels. Such levels may not necessarily give practical use. During steep declines the STIX can remain low for extended periods of time while stock prices keep on declining. Also, the STIX can remain overbought while stock prices keep on rallying for extended periods of time.

Hence, the indicator is best utilized related to different indicators or forms of analysis. For instance, waiting at a cost action reversal or reversal in a [oscillator](/oscillator) when an extreme level has been reached on the STIX.

Extreme levels are genuinely rare, and that means the indicator points out when the price has taken a big action. The indicator it is reasonable of little use consistently when the market isn't moving a great deal.

## Features
- The indicator isn't a timing indicator, so its signals are best utilized related to different indicators and price action signals that affirm a reversal from the extreme condition.
- STIX gives overbought and oversold readings, mostly over 58 and below 42.
- STIX is a market breadth indicator that takes a moving average of propelling stocks relative to all stocks.
