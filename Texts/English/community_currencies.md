One of the most discussed community currencies in circulation in the United States is BerkShares, sent off September 2006 in the Berkshires region of Massachusetts. Federal currency can be exchanged for BerkShares at nine branch offices of three neighborhood banks. Today, more than 400 nearby businesses acknowledge the currency.

BerkShares are offered at a slight discount to boost utilization. In shops, $1 equals one BerkShare, yet 100 of them can be bought for $95 of federal currency.

For the present, the currency is pegged to the USD [exchange rate](/exchangerate). Nonetheless, some in the community have examined the possibility of pegging its value to a [basket of neighborhood goods](/basket_of_goods), contending that this would assist with shielding local people from the [volatility](/volatility) of the U.S. economy.

## Advantages and Disadvantages of Community Currency

BerkShares is among the rare examples of overcoming adversity. Most efforts to make "nearby dollars" fall through on the grounds that they fail to accomplish a critical mass of issuance and acceptance by businesses.

The primary disadvantage of community currencies is the test that achieving this acceptance presents.

The key characteristic of any money is that it functions as a generally accepted medium of exchange. Community currencies that don't win general acceptance locally won't function well as money. By their temperament, community currencies face a major obstacle to wide acceptance since they are planned to be utilized locally. Permitting them to leave the community and circle in the larger economy would overcome their purpose. In a modern, interconnected economy where individuals commonly travel and work with a different cluster of businesses inside and outside their neighborhood, currencies can't assume the full function of money.

The advantage and goal of community currencies is to keep ownership of nearby capital goods, fixed investment, and businesses in the hands of neighborhood occupants, helping them rather than outsiders, outsiders, and large, generic corporations.

While business owners might lose money on a purchases due to currency discounts, they gain with repeat business. The effect has been to save a few companies from closing, and maybe even slow down the growth of big-box retailers like Walmart Inc. (WMT) and Best Buy Co. Inc. (BBY).

In any case, there is almost no quantifiable evidence that community currencies really muchly affect regional economic performance or development designs. One study showed that in regions that are vigorously dependent on seasonal economic activity and seasonal credit, and are in this way liquidity constrained in the slow time of year, community currencies might have the beneficial effect of smoothing out the nearby supply of money and credit for general commerce in the neighborhood.

Regional and nearby policymakers find advancing community currencies a convenient method for showing their support for their constituents, while encouraging small business and a community air. Simultaneously, they would rather not distance big box stores like Walmart and Home Depot Inc. (HD) which may employment options and [sales tax](/salestax) revenues. Adjusting [economic growth](/economicgrowth) drives that advance small business-accommodating policies with tax incentives for national chains might be extreme. Since community currencies typically fail to gain a lot of acceptance or have a substantial economic impact, policy creators can elevate them to "score focuses" with nearby electors without really compromising the interests of large corporate retailers or their political supporters.
