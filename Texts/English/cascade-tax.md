# Cascade Tax
## What is a Cascade Tax?

A cascade tax or flowing tax alludes to a system that forces [sales taxes](/salestax) on products at each successive stage in the supply chain from raw material to consumer purchase. Every buyer in the supply chain pays a price in light of its cost, including the previous tax or taxes that have been charged.

## Understanding the Cascade Tax

A cascade tax is fundamentally a tax on top of a tax. There is a compounding effect to a cascade tax, with products that have numerous production stages causing increasingly more tax as it moves along the supply chain to the end client. This outcomes in a real sales tax higher than the official sales tax rate.

Overall, countries with cascade taxes might battle to remain competitive in foreign markets. This is on the grounds that such a tax system brings about inflationary prices in comparison with those of international contenders.

## Illustration of How a Cascade Tax Works

For instance, consider the gift wrap business. It starts with a tree, which is cut down and sold to a paper factory. The factory pulps the wood, straightens it, dries it, and cuts it into sheets and rolls. These rolls are purchased by a company that plans and prints extravagant paper in large clusters and sells them wholesale. The wholesaler then, at that point, offers it to retail stores cross country available to be purchased in individual rolls. At long last, a consumer gets it.

All of those transfers of ownership is a taxable transaction and every transaction incorporates a sales tax. The total cost of the transaction depends on the cumulative business costs, including the sum of all taxes charged for each previous transaction.

## How Cascade Taxes Compound

As referenced, a cascade tax has a compounding effect that makes higher tax incomes than a single-stage tax. This is the equivalent mathematical [compounding](/compounding) that we find in investing, however this type really hurts the consumer eventually.

For instance, suppose a government demands a 2% cascade tax on all goods delivered and distributed. A company sells a section of stone for $1,000 for a tax-comprehensive price of $1,020 ($1000 + 2%) to an artist. The artist makes a sculpture. He desires to make a $2,000 profit on its sale to an art dealer. That means the art dealer will pay $3,020 plus sales tax, carrying the cost to $3,080 ($3020 + 2% tax). The art dealer needs to make $5,000 for the sculpture, so the price in the art exhibition comes to $8,080 plus sales tax, for a fabulous total of $8,242.

In sum, the government has collected taxes of $20 + $60 + $162 = $242, which is really an effective tax rate of $242/$8,000 or 3.025%.

## Alternatives to a Cascade Tax

The fundamental alternative to a cascade tax is a single-stage tax, for example, the [value-added tax](/valueaddedtax) (VAT), likewise called a [goods and services tax](/gst) (GST). This is a tax that is imposed exclusively on the value that its most recent seller has added to the product. Consequently, the tax did not depend on the whole value of the product however on the value that has been added to it by the most recent business in the chain.

The net consequence of a VAT tax is lower overall taxation than comparable rates imposed in a flowing system. A VAT tax doesn't blow up the cost of completed goods.

Around 160 countries utilize a value-added tax system. Most strikingly, member nations of the European Union charge a VAT tax. Starting around 2021, that tax was at least 15%, with member nations permitted to add to it.

Rivals of the VAT tax contend that a regressive tax puts a brutal burden on the lower-pay population. A few nations have endeavored to address this analysis by excluding purchases of goods that are considered essential, for example, supermarket and drug store purchases.

### How a GST Tax Works

At the point when a country forces a GST tax instead of a value-added tax, it combines several taxes into one single tax. These may incorporate central taxes, for example, [sales tax](/salestax), [excise duty tax](/excisetax), and service tax, as well as state-level taxes, for example, amusement tax, entry tax, transfer tax, and luxury tax. These become one single tax.

Thus, when a product is sold, every vendor in the supply chain can deduct the tax paid from tax collected and transmit it to the government. Regardless of how frequently the product changes hands, the last consumer pays the full tax rate yet not a numerous of it. Canada has GST taxes and Mexico has VAT taxes.

## Tax Methods in the United States

The United States has no federal sales tax. Sales taxes are forced by the states, at rates they set individually. They additionally might be forced by urban areas, which might collect 1% or 2% on top of the state rate on some or all goods purchased.

State laws likewise decide the subtleties. A state might collect sales tax on dress however not on food except if it's treats, biting gum, or sweet beverages.

Five states have no sales tax. As of February 2021 they are Alaska, Oregon, Delaware, Montana, and New Hampshire. The highest state sales tax was charged in California, at 7.25%, despite the fact that Indiana, Mississippi, Rhode Island, and Tennessee all were close behind with 7% rates. At the point when nearby taxes are thought about, the combined sales taxes in many states will be higher than the state-level tax.

The outcome is that a customer in Delaware will pay no sales tax while purchasing a California avocado, however that avocado's price might reflect rehashed sales tax transactions during its excursion from farm to wholesaler to supermarket.
