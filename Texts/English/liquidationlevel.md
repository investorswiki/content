# Liquidation Level
## What Is the Liquidation Level?

The liquidation level, regularly communicated as a percentage, is the point that, whenever came to, will start the automatic [closure of existing positions.](/closeposition) It is a security feature developed to keep investors from causing critical losses past a predetermined point and is, not entirely settled by the trader or the brokerage firm.

## Understanding the Liquidation Level

In the [foreign exchange market](/foreign-exchange-markets), the liquidation level is the pre-decided level, generally known as a [margin call](/margincall), at which an automatically-triggered liquidation cycle will start. This value depends on the specific amount of funds in a trader's margin account below which the [liquidation](/liquidation) of the trader's positions is triggered and executed at the common market rates.

Typically, the liquidation level is communicated as a percentage value of the assets in a trader's margin account. On the off chance that a forex trader's positions conflict with them, their account will ultimately arrive at the liquidation level, except if the trader infuses extra funds. One more name for liquidation level is [liquidation margin](/liquidation-margin). These types of forced sales of positions to meet margin requirements don't need customer endorsement.

Most forex traders will [buy on margin](/buying-on-margin), which is the act of borrowing money to purchase securities. The buyer pays just a percentage of the value of the acquired securities and borrows the rest from the bank or broker. The broker acts as a lender and assets, generally cash, in the trader's account act as collateral. In light of one's creditworthiness and different factors, the broker will set the base, or [initial margin](/initialmargin), and [maintenance margin](/maintenancemargin) requirements that must be met before the trader can start buying on margin. Maintenance margin alludes to the base amount of money that must be in the account before the broker forces the investor to deposit more money.

With [cash accounts](/cashaccount), a broker doesn't have a similar ability to liquidate, except if it is due to an outside factor like a personal bankruptcy. A margin account, then again, permits investors to borrow up to the broker-offered percentage of the purchase price of the security. In any case, the exact amount of the margin changes relying upon the security. A normal requirement of a margin account is for the client to keep up with no less than 25% of their own money of the all out market value of the position(s) at some random point.

## Liquidation Level as a Protective Tool

The liquidation level is a safeguard, or security feature, developed to safeguard the two traders and [dealers](/dealer) from causing critical losses past a predetermined point. When a forex trader's account funding arrives at the liquidation level, all positions held by the trader will automatically close at the best accessible rate. The levels that can trigger this action will change by broker or dealer with whom the trader holds their account.

Forex trading utilizes [leverage](/leverage). The initial upfront investment, known as a margin, is required to gain access to the foreign currency market. At the point when prices shift, margin calls force the investor to liquidate some, or every single, vacant position or add more funds to their account to cover margin requirements. In times of extreme market volatility, the wide swings in price could bring about a quick succession of margin calls, which presents the possibility of huge losses.

At the point when a dealer is taking care of trading activity for the benefit of a trader, the dealer is expecting the risk of these likely losses. Consequently, the forex dealer holding an account for a trader assumes on the liability that the trader's positions will lose money. One more risk to the dealer is that the trader will not be able to repay the borrowed funds used to start the [forex](/forex) trades.

In that capacity, a named liquidation level, which the trader consents to while opening their account, will fix the base margin requirement. This margin requirement, communicated as a percentage, is what the forex dealer will tolerate before automatically liquidating the trader's assets to keep away from the possibility of default. This action fills in as a protective measure, which gives the dealer some assurance that they have moderated their exposure to losses.
