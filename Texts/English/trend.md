## How Trends Work

Traders can recognize a trend utilizing different forms of technical analysis, including trendlines, [price action](/price-action), and [technical indicators](/technicalindicator). For instance, trendlines could show the heading of a trend while the [relative strength index](/rsi) (RSI) is intended to show the strength of a trend at some random point in time.

A [uptrend](/uptrend) is set apart by an overall increase in price. Nothing moves straight up for a really long time, so there will continuously be motions, yet the overall heading should be higher for it to be considered an uptrend. Recent swing lows ought to be above prior swing lows, and the equivalent goes for swing highs. When this structure begins to break down, the uptrend could be losing steam or reversing into a [downtrend](/downtrend). Downtrends are made out of lower swing lows and lower swing highs.

While the trend is up, traders center around buying, endeavoring to profit from a proceeded with price rise.

At the point when the trend turns down, traders center more around selling or [shorting](/short), endeavoring to limit losses or profit from the price decline.

In the model over, a drop below the trendline isn't really a sell signal, yet on the off chance that the price likewise drops below a prior swing low as well as technical indicators are turning bearish, then, at that point, it very well may be.
