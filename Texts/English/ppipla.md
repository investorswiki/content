# Public-Private Investment Program For Legacy Assets (PPIPLA)
## What Is PPIPLA?

The Public-Private Investment Program for Legacy Assets (PPIPLA) is a program planned because of the implementation of the [Troubled Asset Relief Program](/troubled-asset-relief-program-tarp) (TARP). It was intended to assist with lightening a portion of the strain brought about by the presence of legacy assets on banks' balance sheets during the 2008 financial crisis. With too a considerable lot of these assets, banks started to experience issues drawing in investors and were unable to issue credit to customers at the required rate. The plan was directed at freeing banks of legacy loans and legacy securities, and to sell the legacy assets to both private and public investors who might share in the risk as well as the profits.

## Grasping PPIPLA

The Public-Private Investment Program for Legacy Assets (PPIPLA) involved $75 billion to $100 billion in private investor capital and TARP capital to buy legacy assets from banks, with a total of $500 billion in initial purchasing power. To keep a fair selling price, every institution chose which assets to sell, however contending private investors concluded the selling price. Yet again it was expected that, with appropriate implementation of the plan, banks would generate adequate capital to start expanding credit.

PPIPLA depended on three fundamental principles:

1. Amplifying the purchasing power of the taxpayer dollar by joining government and private investor funding to capitalize on taxpayer resources.
1. Sharing profits and risks with participants in the private sector.
1. Limiting the possibilities of government excessive charge for assets by permitting private investors to lay out the price of legacy assets available under the program by means of normal market competition.

## How Legacy Assets Were Sold Under PPIPLA

The PPIPLA has two parts, one tending to legacy securities and one tending to legacy loans, the two of which made up the [troubled legacy assets](/legacy-assets) stressing banks financially during the 2008 financial crisis. To partake in the program, banks would figure out which legacy loans and securities they wished to sell. For instance, a bank would pick a pool of legacy loans to sell under PPIPLA. Then, at that point, the [FDIC](/fdic) would examine the pool of legacy loans to conclude how much funding it could guarantee under the PPIPLA. The pool would then be unloaded to the most elevated offering private investor, who might have the option to access the PPIP to cover half the costs of the purchase. When sold, private fund managers would deal with the assets, under oversight from the FDIC, until the asset was at long last liquidated.
