# Federal Farm Credit System (FFCS)
## What Is the Federal Farm Credit System (FFCS)?

The Federal Farm Credit System (FFCS) is a network of government programs and financial institutions made to give financing to agricultural businesses in the United States. The FFCS was made in light of the fact that agricultural businesses frequently battle to secure affordable credit through traditional lenders. Through the FFCS, farmers are given access to credit based on conditions that could somehow or another not be accessible to them from private lenders.

## How the FFCS Works

The FFCS can be a fundamental source of funding for the agricultural sector, which is much of the time saw as a high-risk industry by traditional lenders. All things considered, even on the off chance that a farmer has fantastic credit and a sound business plan, a single season of dry spell could emphatically influence their primary concern. Along these lines, farmers have traditionally battled to secure credit from banks and other mainstream financial institutions dependably.

To address the neglected requirements of farmers, Congress mediated in 1916 by passing the Federal Farm Loan Act. This new legislation was responsible for laying out a network of new financial institutions called [Federal Land Banks (FLBs)](/federal-land-bank). The Act likewise made many National Farm Loan Associations (NFLAs), which, along with the FLBs, framed what might later become known as the FFCS.

In 1985, the United States agricultural sector confronted a period of financial vulnerability brought about by the announcement of serious losses by the institutions of the FFCS. Aggregately, the lending consortium reported losses of almost $3 billion, which at the time was among the most extreme disappointments in the history of the United States financial sector.

These emotional losses, which were driven by a wave of [bankruptcies](/bankruptcy) among farmers in the former years, forced Congress to pass a series of laws during the 1980s: the Farm Credit Amendments Act of 1985, and the Agricultural Credit Act of 1987. Together, these two laws really rescued the FFCS while forcing new federal oversight and regulations. These new laws likewise brought about the [Federal Agricultural Mortgage Corporation (FAMC)](/farmermac), which is casually alluded to as "Farmer Mac".

Today, the modern FFCS is bigger and more complex than any other time, comprising of three FCBS, seventy-two agricultural credit associations (ACAs), one federal land credit association (FLCA), and one agricultural credit bank (CoBank).

The CoBank is authorized to stretch out loans to ACAS as well as the FLCA. Its order additionally incorporates lending to agricultural cooperatives and rural networks, as well as supporting domestic exporters of agricultural products.
