# Voluntary Plan Termination
## What Is Voluntary Plan Termination?

Voluntary plan termination is the discontinuance of a [defined-benefit plan](/definedbenefitpensionplan) by an employer. Since an employer isn't legally required to give a retirement plan to employees, it can fire a laid out plan.

Notwithstanding, an employer can fire a voluntary plan provided that each of the requirements for a standard termination or distress termination are followed by the plan administrator. Section 4041 of the U.S. Code of Federal Regulations tends to voluntary plan terminations.

## Grasping Voluntary Plan Termination

As indicated by the [Internal Revenue Service](/irs) (IRS), since an employer isn't required by law to give a retirement plan to employees, it can fire its retirement plan.

An employer could fire a plan for the following reasons:

- A decision to end the plan
- Assuming the firm is facing bankruptcy
- On the off chance that the business is to be sold to one more company or purchased by another company
- On the off chance that the employer is switching to an alternative retirement plan

Under a voluntary plan termination, the assets must be distributed to participants in a way depicted by federal law. The employer has the unilateral right to adjust or end the retirement plan whenever. This right is set out by the [Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974](/erisa).

The allocation of plan assets is generally finished by the plan administrator or trustee. An employer must disseminate assets from a fired plan when officially plausible after the plan is fired. Impacted participants can generally roll over the distributed money to one more qualified plan or individual retirement account (IRA).

The IRS states: "For ended defined benefit plans with inadequate money to pay the benefits in general, the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation will guarantee the payment of vested pension benefits up to limits set by law.

For ended defined contribution plans (for instance, 401(k), 403(b) or profit-sharing), participants generally receive the full amount of their vested account balance upon plan termination."

In a defined benefit plan termination, Form 6088 (detailing the distributable benefits) must be submitted alongside a marked and dated actuary's certification of the adjusted funding target percentage.

### Partial Plan Termination

A plan might be partially ended if over 20% of plan participants were laid off in a specific year. Partial terminations might be associated with a critical corporate event like a closed office area or because of unfriendly economic conditions.

The law requires all impacted employees to be fully vested in their account balance as of the date of a full or partial plan termination.

## Features
