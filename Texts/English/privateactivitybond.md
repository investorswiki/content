# Private Activity Bond (PAB)
## What Is a Private Activity Bond (PAB)?

Private Activity Bonds are bonds issued by or for a State or Local Government to give special financial benefits to qualified projects. In the event that the bonds meet specific criteria the interest earned might be tax-exempt. The financing is most frequently for ventures of a private client, and the government generally doesn't pledge its credit. Private activity bonds are sometimes alluded to as conduit bonds.

## Understanding Private Activity Bonds (PABs)

Private activity bonds are [municipal bonds](/municipalbond) that are utilized to attract private investment for projects that have some public benefit; in any case, there are severe rules concerning which tasks qualify. Qualified projects that might be financed by private activity bonds incorporate funding and refinancing student loans, air terminals, private universities, hospitals, affordable rental housing, mortgage provision for first-time lower-income borrowers, and so on.

In no event may the proceeds of a private activity bond be utilized to finance a plane, certain fitness center facilities, a gambling facility, arena, fairway, oil refinery, or a liquor store. This type of bond brings about diminished financing costs on account of the exception of federal tax.

Private activity bonds are issued to attract businesses and labor to a region to infer a public benefit, which would qualify the bond for tax-exempt status.

## Special Considerations

Under Section 103(a) of the [Internal Revenue Code](/internal-revenue-code) (IRC), interest on private activity bonds isn't excluded from gross income except if the bond is a qualified bond. Interest from private activity bonds became subject to the [Alternative Minimum Tax](/alternativeminimumtax) (AMT) after the [Tax Reform Act of 1986](/taxreformact1986), with the exception of the hospital and non-benefit college bonds. Everything equivalent, yields on private activity bonds are higher due to this tax treatment.

As per Section 141 of the IRC, a municipal bond will be considered a private activity bond if over 10% of the proceeds from the bond issue are utilized for any private business, and the principal and interest payment on over 10% of the sale proceeds of the issue is secured by a private business property. Furthermore, a municipal bond will be classified as a private activity bond in the event that the amount of proceeds of the issue used to make loans to non-governmental borrowers surpasses 5% of the proceeds or $15 million, whichever is lesser.
