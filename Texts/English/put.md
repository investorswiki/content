## What Is a Put?

A put is an options contract that gives the owner the right, however not the obligation, to [sell](/bullverticalspread) a certain amount of the [underlying asset,](/underlying-asset) at a set price inside a specific time. The buyer of a put option accepts that the underlying stock will drop below the [exercise price](/exerciseprice) before the expiration date. The exercise price is the price that the underlying asset must reach for the put option contract to hold value.

A put can be stood out from a [call option](/calloption), which gives the holder to buy the underlying at a predetermined price at the very latest expiration.

## The Basics of Put Options

Puts are traded on different underlying assets, which can incorporate stocks, currencies, commodities, and indexes. The buyer of a put option might sell, or [exercise](/exercise), the underlying asset at a predefined [strike price](/strikeprice).

Put options are traded on different underlying assets, including stocks, currencies, bonds, commodities, futures, and indexes. They are key to understanding while picking whether to perform a straddle or a strangle.

The value of a put option appreciates as the price of the underlying stock deteriorates relative to the strike price. On the flip side, the value of a put option diminishes as the underlying stock increments. A put option's value likewise diminishes as its expiration date draws near. On the other hand, a put option loses its value as the underlying stock increments.

Since put options, when exercised, give a short position in the underlying asset, they are utilized for the end goal of hedging or to estimate on downside price action. Investors frequently utilize put options in a risk-the executives strategy known as a [protective put](/protective-put). This strategy is utilized as a form of investment insurance to guarantee that losses in the underlying asset don't surpass a certain amount, to be specific the strike price.

As a rule, the value of a put option diminishes as its chance to expiration approaches due to time decay on the grounds that the likelihood of the stock falling below the predetermined strike price diminishes. At the point when an option loses its time value, the [intrinsic value](/intrinsicvalue) is left finished, which is equivalent to the difference between the strike price less the underlying stock price. Assuming that an option has intrinsic value, it is [in the money (ITM)](/inthemoney).

[Out of the money (OTM)](/outofthemoney) and [at the money (ATM)](/atthemoney) put options have no intrinsic value since there would be no benefit of practicing the option. Investors could [short sell](/shortselling) the stock at the current higher market price, instead of practicing an out of the money put option at an unfortunate strike price.

## Puts versus Calls

[Derivatives](/subsidiary) are financial instruments that get value from price developments in their underlying assets, which can be a commodity like gold or stock. Derivatives are to a great extent utilized as insurance products to hedge against the risk that a specific event might happen. The two principal types of derivatives utilized for stocks are put and call options.

A call option gives the holder the right, yet not the obligation, to buy a stock at a certain price from here on out. At the point when an investor buys a call, she anticipates the value of the underlying asset to go up.

A put option gives the holder the right, however not the obligation, to sell a stock at a certain price from now on. At the point when an investor purchases a put, she anticipates that the underlying asset should decline in price; she might sell the option and gain a profit. An investor can likewise [write](/composing an-option) a put option for one more investor to buy, in which case, she wouldn't anticipate that the stock's price should drop below the exercise price.

## Model — How Does a Put Option Work?

An investor purchases one put option contract on ABC company for $100. Every option contract covers 100 shares. The exercise price of the shares is $10, and the current ABC share price is $12. This put option contract has given the investor the right, yet not the obligation, to sell 100 shares of ABC at $10.

Assuming ABC shares drop to $8, the investor's put option is [in the money (ITM)](/inthemoney) — and that means that the strike price is below the market price of the underlying asset — and she can close her option position by selling the contract on the [open market](/open-market).

Then again, she can purchase 100 shares of ABC at the existing [market price](/market-price) of $8, and afterward exercise her contract to sell the shares for $10. Ignoring commissions, the profit for this position is $200, or 100 x ($10 - $8). Recollect that the investor paid a $100 premium for the put option, giving her the right to sell her shares at the exercise price. Calculating in this initial cost, her total profit is $200 - $100 = $100.

As one more approach to working a put option as a hedge, on the off chance that the investor in the previous model as of now possesses 100 shares of ABC company, that position would be called a [married put](/marriedput) and could act as a hedge against a decline in the share price.
