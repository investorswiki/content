# Cloud Mining
## What Is Cloud Mining?

Cloud mining is a mechanism to mine a [cryptocurrency](/cryptocurrency, for example, [bitcoin](/bitcoin), utilizing leased [cloud computing](/cloud-computing) power and without introducing and directly run the hardware and related software. Cloud mining firms permit individuals to open an account and remotely participate in the process of cryptocurrency mining for a fundamental cost, makes mining available to a more extensive number of individuals across the world. Since this form of mining is done through cloud, it reduces issues, for example, maintenance of equipment or direct energy costs.

Cloud miners become participants in a mining pool, where users purchase a certain amount of "hash power." Each participant acquires a pro-rata share of the profits in proportion to the amount of hashing power leased.

## Understanding Cloud Mining

Cloud mining use cloud computing to produce [blockchain](/blockchain)- based cryptocurrencies. Cloud computing, all the more generally, is one of the quickest developing innovation trends wherein computing services, for example, processing, server capacity, database services, software, and file storage are gotten to through the cloud, over the Internet. Such companies charge on a utilization basis just like we pay for our water or power use.

Then again, mining is the foundation of the cryptocurrency model, for example, bitcoin. It is the process by which transactions are confirmed and added to the public ledger, known as the blockchain. It is additionally the means through which new coins are released. A combination of the two opens the world of mining to individuals at far off areas with practically no technical information and hardware infrastructure.

## Cloud Mining Models

Facilitated mining is the most famous form of cloud mining. In this model, the customer purchases or rents mining hardware situated in a miner's facility. The miner is responsible for keeping up with the equipment and guaranteeing that it capabilities as performed. Through this model, customers have direct control over their cryptocurrency. The economies of scale of a mining farm guarantee that costly costs associated with mining, like power and storage, become reasonable. In any case, there is an extensive upfront cost associated with this type of mining.

Leased hash power is one more model that is utilized in cloud mining. In this model, hash power, or computing power associated with a cryptocurrency, is leased from a mining farm. Customers get a share of the farm's overall profits from mining cryptocurrencies. As indicated by reports, leased hash power is a well known form of mining for [altcoins](/altcoin) (i.e., cryptocurrencies other than bitcoin). The process requires a person to open an account with a cloud mining company through its website and select certain things like the contract period and hashing power.

While there are benefits to cloud mining, for example, less investment in hardware and recurring costs, the process additionally has several weaknesses. For instance, industry scams have proliferated quickly with the notoriety of cryptocurrencies. Then there is the prospect of diminishing profits. Altcoins particularly are powerless against demand, and a reduction in their hash power could lead to less profits for miners. Cloud mining models likewise promote the centralization of cryptocurrencies, generally a decentralized ecosystem.

## How Cryptocurrency Mining Works

Mining for cryptocurrencies, for example, bitcoin, whether by means of the cloud or locally, really includes no mining. And keeping in mind that this process creates new cryptocurrency tokens that are granted to miners, the mining operation fills a considerably more pivotal need for keeping up with the security of a distributed ledger, for example, a blockchain. Bitcoin mining is performed by powerful PCs that tackle complex computational math problems; these problems are perplexing to the point that they can't be addressed the hard way and are sufficiently convoluted to tax even amazingly powerful PCs.

At the point when cryptocurrency miners add another block of transactions to the blockchain, part of their job is to check that those transactions are accurate. In particular, bitcoin miners ensure that bitcoin isn't being copied, a unique idiosyncrasy of digital currencies called "[double spend.](/doublespending)" With printed currencies, falsifying is consistently an issue. In any case, generally, when you spend $20 at the store, that bill is in the representative's hands. With digital currency, notwithstanding, it's an alternate story. The miners utilize their computational power to settle cryptographic riddles that prevent double spend in a decentralized way.

## Features
- Cloud mining includes mining for cryptocurrencies by leasing or purchasing mining equipment from a third-party cloud provider, who is responsible for keeping up with the equipment.
- Famous models for cloud mining incorporate facilitated mining and leased hash power.
- The upsides of cloud mining are that they reduce overall costs associated with mining and permit regular investors, who might lack adequate technical information, to mine cryptocurrencies.
- The detriments of cloud mining are that the practice incorporates mining to farms and profits are powerless to demand.
