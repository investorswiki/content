# Summary Plan Description
## What Is a Summary Plan Description?

A Summary Plan Description (SPD) is a document that employers must give free to employees who partake in [Employee Retirement Income Security Act](/erisa)- covered retirement plans or medical advantage plans. The SPD is an itemized manual for the benefits the program gives and how the plan functions. It must portray when employees become eligible to take part in the plan, how benefits are calculated and paid, how to claim benefits, and when benefits become [vested](/vesting).

The SPD ought to be in plain language that employees can comprehend. It must incorporate the plan name and its [Internal Revenue Service](/irs)- doled out number, the employer's name and address, the plan chairman's name and contact data, a statement of [Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act](/hipaa) rights, ERISA exposures, and guidance on how employees can file a complaint or an appeal.

## Figuring out the Summary Plan Description

At the point when you are first recruited, you ought to receive a SPD covering your new employer's medical services and retirement benefits in 90 days or less. The company might circulate the document to you electronically in the event that you routinely utilize a computer at work or as a printed copy. On the off chance that you just receive an electronic copy, you might request a written copy.

## A Summary Plan Description Should Answer Your Questions

A plan ought to incorporate the responses to the accompanying inquiries:

- Is there a base age requirement to take part in the plan?
- Is there a base service requirement to partake in the plan? Provided that this is true, what is it, and how could it be calculated?
- When does the plan year start and end? Does it run from Jan.1 to Dec. 31, or does it have different beginning and end dates? This data is important for wellbeing plans since account holders need to know when your annual [deductible](/deductible) resets.
- Do I make contributions to the plan, or do all contributions come from my employer?
- For retirement plans, does the plan permit [rollover contributions](/rollover) from different plans? For instance, could I at any point roll my [401(k)](/401kplan) from my former employer over into this plan?
- For retirement plans, how are employer and employee contributions invested? Are there default investments that the money will go to on the off chance that I don't choose specific investment options? Provided that this is true, what are they? How would I change my investment selection?
- When do I become vested in the retirement plan? Am I promptly [100% vested](/completely vested), or do I need to work for the company for a certain number of years to turn out to be to some extent or completely vested?
- Am I permitted to borrow from my retirement account? Assuming this is the case, what are the rules?
- What befalls my benefits assuming I become disabled? Assuming that I leave the company? Assuming I retire? On the off chance that I kick the bucket? In the event that I withdraw from nonappearance?

## A Summary Plan Description Offers Employers Protection Against Lawsuits

On the business side, employers ought to guarantee that their SPD covers all that it ought to. With no SPD or an insufficient SPD, employers open themselves to lawsuits from employees. A SPD that adheres to ERISA rules and obviously spreads out rejections and limitations will safeguard the company against conceivable legal action.

The SPD ought to state what characterizes an employee who is qualified for different benefits and whether such employees incorporate [independent contractors](/independent-contractor), transitory workers, mates, domestic partners, and children.

## Special Considerations

Furthermore, in the event that 10% or a greater amount of your employees communicate in a language other than English, you must distribute your SPD in those different languages too. Hiring an attorney who comprehends ERISA law to audit the SPD before you appropriate it can assist with guaranteeing the document is complete, intensive, accurate, and consents to state and federal law. It can require months to make a SPD beginning to end. Ensuring your employees can comprehend it effectively will reduce complaints, lawsuits, and inquiries to human resources from befuddled employees.

Employers might change the benefits they offer occasionally. At the point when this occurs, the employer must tell all employees recorded as a hard copy by giving them an overhauled SPD or a summary of material changes that explains the changes to the SPD. The company must disseminate the warning in the span of 60 days of the change becoming effective in the event that it reduces coverage or benefits. In the event that the changes don't reduce coverage or benefits, the notice ought to be distributed in somewhere around 210 days after the finish of the plan year when the change became effective.
