An associated person is limited by certain regulatory standards in light of their specific job as well as function.

These substances control individuals in certain jobs to ensure that an uneven flow of data, even if normally happening, doesn't block or swindle investors in their trading and research activities. Separate registration with the [National Futures Association](/nfa) (NFA) isn't required for persons previously registered as the following:

- [Futures Commission Merchant](/fcm) (FCM)
- [Introducing Broker](/introducingbroker) (IB)

## Why the Distinction?
