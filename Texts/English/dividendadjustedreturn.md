# Dividend-Adjusted Return
## What Is a Dividend-Adjusted Return?

A dividend-adjusted return is a calculation of a stock's return that depends on [capital appreciation](/capitalappreciation) yet additionally on the [dividends](/dividend) that shareholders receive. This adjustment furnishes investors with a more accurate evaluation of the return of an income-delivering security over a predetermined holding period.

## Understanding a Dividend-Adjusted Return

At the point when investors purchase stocks they expect that the stock price will increase in view of their evaluation of the company, and sooner or later, they can sell the stock for a profit. The price at which they sold it compared to what they paid for it will be the [return on their investment](/returnoninvestment).

This, be that as it may, may not really be the [total return](/totalreturn) on their investment. Assuming the stock likewise paid out dividends during the tenure in which they held the stock, then, at that point, this should be included the return calculation, which is the dividend-adjusted return, which will give the total return on their investment.

For example, an investor might start computing a simple return by taking the difference in [market price](/market-price) and purchase price and partitioning this by the purchase price. Say an investor purchased a share of Amazon (AMZN) on Jan. 1, 2018, for $1,172 and sold it on July 11, 2018, for $1,755. The simple return would be ($1,755 - $1,172)/1,172 = 49.74%.

While Amazon doesn't by and by pay dividends, on the off chance that it gave a $0.50/share quarterly dividend, and the investor received two distributions during the six months they held the stock, they could change their return by adding these to the sale price. Their dividend-adjusted return would be ($1,756 - $1,172)/1,172 = 49.83%.

The dividend-adjusted return is a part of total return, which considers both the changes in market value and some other surges of income, like interest, distributions, and dividends expressed as a percentage (i.e., separated by the share price).

Numerous investors pick their stocks in light of the dividend payout, known as a dividend investment strategy. This type of strategy can be really great for risk-loath investors, for example, investors that are further along in their investment career and close to retirement. These types of investors are not really searching for price appreciation but instead a consistent source of income from their investments.

## Dividends and the Adjusted Closing Price

The dividend-adjusted close, or [adjusted closing price](/adjusted_closing_price), is another valuable data point that considers any distributions or corporate activities that happened between the previous day's closing price and the next day's opening price. It mirrors the true closing price of a stock.

For example, a company's stock price closes at $60 and they declare a dividend of $1. The share price is $60 on the [ex-dividend](/ex-dividend) date and is then reduced by $1, the dividend amount, to $59, which is the adjusted closing price due to the dividend payout.

Dividends bring down the value of a stock since profits are distributed to [shareholders](/shareholder) as opposed to being invested once more into the company, which is accepted to be a degrading of the company and this depreciating is thought about by the reduction in the share price.

## Dividend-Adjusted Return and Taxes

While working out a return on investment, whether that be simply capital appreciation or a dividend-adjusted return, an important part is to determine the value after taxes. Investors need to pay a [capital gains](/capital_gains_tax) tax on any appreciation in the value of a stock from the time they buy to the time they sell.

The current long-term capital gains tax is 0%, 15%, or 20%, contingent upon your tax bracket and marital status. The tax rate for [qualified dividends](/qualifieddividend) is equivalent to the long-term capital gains tax and for non-qualified dividends, it is equivalent to the federal income tax for your tax bracket.
