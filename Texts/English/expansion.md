# Expansion
## What Is Expansion?

Expansion is the phase of the business cycle where [real gross domestic product](/realgdp) (GDP) develops for at least two successive quarters, moving from a trough to a pinnacle. Expansion is ordinarily joined by a rise in employment, consumer confidence, and equity markets and is likewise alluded to as a [economic recovery](/economic-recovery).

## Grasping Expansion

The rise and fall of [economic growth](/economicgrowth) is definitely not a totally random, unexplainable phenomenon. Like the climate, the economy is accepted to follow a cyclical path that keeps on repeating itself after some time. This interaction is called the [business cycle](/businesscycle) and is broken down into four distinct, identifiable phases:

1. **Expansion**: The economy is moving out of recession. Money is cheap to borrow, businesses build up [inventories](/stock) once more and consumers begin spending. GDP rises, [per capita income](/income-per-capita) develops, unemployment declines, and equity markets generally perform well.
1. **Peak**: The expansion phase in the end tops. Sharp demand drives the cost of goods to take off and abruptly [economic indicators](/economic_indicator) stop developing.
1. **Contraction**: Economic growth starts to debilitate. Companies stop hiring as demand eases off and afterward start laying off staff to reduce [expenses](/cost).
1. **Trough**: The economy advances from the [contraction](/contraction) phase to the expansion phase. The economy hits absolute bottom, preparing for a recovery.

[Economists](/financial analyst), policymakers, and investors closely study business cycles. Learning about economic expansion and contraction examples of the past can help with forecasting likely future trends and distinguishing investment opportunities.

Expansions last on average around four to five years however have been known to continue somewhere in the range of 10 months to over 10 years. The [National Bureau of Economic Research](/nber) (NBER) decides the dates for business cycles in the United States.

## Special Considerations

Leading indicators, for example, average week by week hours worked by manufacturing employees, [unemployment claims](/unemployment-guarantee), new orders for consumer goods, and [building permits](/building-permits) all give signs with regards to whether an expansion or contraction is happening sooner rather than later.

In any case, financial specialists and analysts generally concur that there are two primary powers that best decide corporate profits and the state of the overall economy: [capital expenditure](/capitalexpenditure) (CapEx), the money companies spend on keeping up with, improving, and buying new resources; and [interest rates](/interestrate).

### The Credit Cycle

At the point when the economy needs a lift, policymakers try to bring down borrowing costs, empowering businesses and consumers to spend more. At the point when the [Federal Reserve](/federalreservesystem) (Fed) cuts interest rates, saving is as of now not positive and the expansion phase starts. Money flows unreservedly through the economy, companies assume loans to fund expansion, job possibilities improve, and consumer spending rockets.

In the end, the cheap flow of money and subsequent increase in spending will cause [inflation](/inflation) to rise, leading [central banks](/centralbank) to climb interest rates. Abruptly the onus is on empowering individuals to get control over on spending and directing economic growth. Company incomes fall, share prices decline, and the economy contracts once more.

### The CapEx Cycle

A few financial specialists, including Irving Fisher, note that cycles move in tandem with company endeavors to match consistently changing consumer demand. At the point when the economy is developing, customers are buying and borrowing costs are cheap, management groups consistently try to capitalize by sloping up production.

From the beginning, this prompts higher sales and good [returns on invested capital ](/returnoninvestmentcapital)(ROIC). Afterward, the competition gets fiercer and greed causes significant damage. Ultimately, [supply surpasses demand](/law-of-supply-demand), prices fall, early debt gorges become more hard to service, and companies are left with no decision except for to lay off staff.
