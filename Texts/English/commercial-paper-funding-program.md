# Commercial Paper Funding Facility (CPFF)
## What Is the Commercial Paper Funding Facility (CPFF)?

The Commercial Paper Funding Facility (CPFF) was a program founded in October of 2008 to lighten the stress on money market funds during the [Great Recession](/great-recession). The CPFF was intended to increase the liquidity of the commercial paper market by giving funding to issuers. The program explicitly gave a backup measure of liquidity for commercial paper issuers through a [special purpose vehicle](/spv) (SPV).

The Fed again opened the CPFF in March of 2020 in response to the precarious market selloff and economic vulnerability encompassing the beginning of the global COVID-19 pandemic.

## Understanding the Commercial Paper Funding Facility (CPFF)

[Commercial paper](/commercialpaper) is a critical source of funding for some organizations. It is a generally utilized type of unsecured, short-term debt instrument issued by corporations, ordinarily utilized for the financing of payroll, [accounts payable](/accountspayable) and inventories, and meeting other short-term liabilities.

The commercial paper market assumed a big part in the [financial crisis](/financial-crisis) that started in 2007. As investors questioned the financial stability and liquidity of firms like [Lehman Brothers](/lehman-brothers), the commercial paper market froze, and firms were at this point not able to access simple and affordable funding. One more effect of the commercial paper market freezing was some money market funds — substantial investors in commercial paper — "breaking the buck." This implied that the impacted funds had net asset values under $1, mirroring the diminishing value of their outstanding commercial paper issued by firms of suspect financial standing.

The Commercial Paper Funding Facility was hence made by the [Federal Reserve Bank of New York](/federal-reserve-bank-of-new-york) on Oct. 7, 2008, because of the credit crunch looked by financial intermediaries in the commercial paper market. The Federal Reserve Bank of New York closed the CPFF in February 2010 after it no longer became essential as the financial sector and the more extensive economy recuperated.

The SPVs made through the CPFF were financed straight by the [Federal Reserve Bank of New York](/federal-reserve-bank-of-new-york) and were utilized to purchase three-month commercial paper, both secured and unsecured. This financing was then to be secured by the assets set into the SPVs and furthermore by the fees paid by issuers of unsecured paper. The [U.S. Treasury](/ustreasury) department felt that the program was required to forestall further substantial disruption of the financial markets.

## The CPFF and the COVID-19 Pandemic

In March of 2020, a significant part of the world's global markets and economic contraption were tossed into chaos as the COVID-19 pandemic arose and spread all through the world. This forced state run administrations to impose lockdown orders and many individuals remained at home out of fear of contamination. During this time, the Fed restored the CPFF facility on a one-year basis through a SPV to assist with keeping up with stability in the commercial paper market.

The U.S. Treasury likewise gave $10 billion of credit protection to the Federal Reserve regarding the CPFF from the Treasury's Exchange Stabilization Fund (ESF). The Federal Reserve then, at that point, gave financing to the SPV under the CPFF. Its loans were secured by every one of the assets of the SPV.
