# Oil Initially in Place (OIIP)
## What Does Oil Initially in Place Mean?

Oil initially in place (OIIP) is the amount of [crude oil](/crude-oil) first estimated to be in a repository. Oil initially in place contrasts from oil reserves, as OIIP alludes to the total amount of oil that is possibly in a supply and not the amount of oil that can be recuperated. Ascertaining OIIP expects engineers to determine how permeable the stone encompassing the oil is, the means by which high water saturation may be and the net stone volume of the repository. The numbers for the previously mentioned factors are laid out by leading a series of test drills around the supply.

## Figuring out Oil Initially in Place (OIIP)

Oil initially in place is referred to all the more essentially as oil in place (OIP). It is likewise alluded to by a couple of varieties. Stock tank oil initially in place (STOIIP) is a similar volumetric calculation with it being made explicit that the volume being estimated is the volume filled by the separated oil at surface temperature and pressure as opposed to the packed volume the crude oil fills in the supply due to land pressure. Original gas in place (OGIP) is again a similar volumetric calculation yet for natural gas supplies. At last, [hydrocarbons](/hydrocarbon) initially in place (HCIIP) is the generic term that can be utilized for both oil and gas while doing a volumetric calculation to estimate the items in a potential drill site.

## The Importance of Oil Initially in Place (OIIP)

Determining oil initially in place is one of the major parts considered by analysts determining the economics of oil field development. Oil initially in place alludes to the capability of a supply. This is a critical data point, however it is just the beginning of the analysis prior to the decision to bore or sit on a lease. Oil in initially in place gives an oil company an estimate of the total number of barrels sitting under the different leases. In the event that all the oil initially in place was [recoverable](/recoverabel-save), oil companies would just have to begin at their greatest supply and work their direction down to the littlest, attempting to keep [drilling costs](/day-rate-oil-drilling) fixed en route. In reality, just a portion of the oil initially in place will at any point be recuperated and qualities of the formation will impact drilling costs.

So breaking down oil initially in place is the trigger for additional analysis of the amount of the OIIP is recoverable with the current technology. The estimated recoverable oil for a repository will permit the oil company holding the lease to choose if current prices support drilling and production. For instance, assuming an oil company must have the option to remove half of the oil initially in place with current technology, it might seem OK to move those acres into its [probable reserves](/probable-reserves) and hold them for future development. The company can then utilize the money saved by not drilling that supply to tap an alternate one with better overall production for the cost of drilling. On the off chance that, notwithstanding, global oil prices climb, the supply might be put into production basically on the grounds that the new price makes the cost of getting that half out of the ground prudent. Thus, oil companies are continually reexamining their lease holding and the oil initially in place against global prices to go with choices on where and when to penetrate.
