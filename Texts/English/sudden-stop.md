# Sudden Stop
## What Is Sudden Stop?

A sudden stop is an unexpected reduction in net capital flows into an economy, particularly an emerging economy.

## Grasping Sudden Stop

A sudden stop is portrayed by [swift reversals of international capital flows](/capital-outpouring), declines in production and consumption, and rectifications in asset prices. It might likewise be joined by a currency crisis, a banking crisis, or both.

Sudden stops can be set off either by foreign investors when they reduce or stop capital inflows into an economy, as well as by domestic occupants when they pull their money out of the domestic economy, a phenomenon otherwise called [capital flight](/capitalflight), bringing about capital outflows. Since sudden stops are generally gone before by robust expansions that drive asset prices essentially higher, their occurrence can unfavorably affect the economy and tip it into a recession.

As indicated by the fundamental equilibrium of-installments equation, [current account deficits](/currentaccountdeficit) must essentially be financed by net capital inflows. In the event that these capital inflows fundamentally surpass the sums required to finance a country's current account deficits, the excess inflows would go to build up the country's currency reserves. On the off chance that a sudden stop happens, those currency reserves can be utilized to finance the current account deficit.

In practice, be that as it may, those currency reserves rarely demonstrate equivalent to the task, since the vast majority of the reserves might be utilized by the central bank to battle off speculative assaults on the domestic currency. Subsequently, the current account deficit generally shrinks quickly after a sudden stop, since the current account deficit depends on net capital inflow to finance it. In the event that a currency crisis goes with a sudden stop, as is many times the case, the domestic currency devaluation would additionally shrink the current account deficit as it would animate exports and make imports more costly.

The genesis of the term sudden stop in the economic setting is generally credited to economist Rudiger Dornbusch, who, alongside his partners co-wrote a 1995 research paper on the Mexican peso's breakdown named "Currency Crises and Collapses." Dornbusch and his co-creators quoted a banker's proverb in the paper: "not speed kills, it is the sudden stop."

In a 2011 research paper on sudden stops in 82 countries from 1970 to 2007, World Bank economists found the accompanying outcomes.

- Global investors are bound to pull out or stop investing in countries with an unstable export base (like those with plentiful natural resources) and poor economic performance. Inflexible exchange rates and high integration with financial markets make such countries more helpless against sudden stops.
- Neighborhood inhabitants are bound to invest abroad (triggering capital outflows) in the event that there is high domestic inflation and additionally large current account excesses.
- Financial transparency makes an economy more defenseless against sudden stops caused either by foreign investors or nearby inhabitants.

## Sudden Stop Examples

Sudden stops in recent many years will generally be grouped around global financial and economic crises. Recent models incorporate the [Asian contagion](/asian-financial-crisis) of the 1990s, the Euro area following the 2008-09 [Great Recession](/great-recession), and the economic fallout of the 2020 Covid-19 pandemic.

- In the ahead of schedule to mid-1990s, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, and Thailand ran large current account deficits. Fast economic growth driven by investment urged foreign creditors to keep up with capital flows into the region. Simultaneously, fast expansion of the nearby supplies of money credit combined with exchange rates pegged to the dollar and heavy borrowing in U.S. designated assets by governments and central banks, contributed to critical financial irregular characteristics. As investors eventually lost confidence in the sustainability of the regional economy, a series of currency crises arose in these countries leading to an unexpected reversal of capital flows, or sudden stop.
- From 2010-2012, following the global financial crisis, investors and creditors who had for quite a long time financed large [balance-of-payment](/bop) deficits in the fringe of the Euro area — Portugal, Ireland, Italy, Greece, and Spain (PIIGS) — lost confidence in the fiscal and financial stability of these countries in the face of nearby government debt crises. Capital flows form core EU countries, like Germany and France, ceased and afterward switched, prompting a sudden stop.
- In 2020, governments around the world answered the episode of Covid-19 by covering commerce, industry, and travel. Many emerging nations experienced fast outflows of capital as investors tried to move into place of refuge assets in developed nations. Financial and economic contraction in many emerging economies really went before any direct nearby impact of the new disease due to the sudden stop in capital flows that they encountered during this period.

## Highlights
- Sudden stops influence small economies lopsidedly as foreign capital inflows cease even as domestic capital outflows rise.
- Sudden stops may likewise be trailed by a currency crisis, as foreigners lose faith in a country's economy.
- A sudden stop is the unexpected reduction of capital flows into a country's economy, which are much of the time joined by economic recessions and market redresses.
