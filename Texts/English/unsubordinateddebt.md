# Unsubordinated Debt
## What Is Unsubordinated Debt?

Unsubordinated debt, otherwise called a senior security or [senior debt](/seniordebt), alludes to a type of obligation that must be repaid before some other form of debt. Thus, holders of unsubordinated debt have the primary claim over a company's [assets](/resource) or earnings in the event that the debtor fails or ruined. Since unsubordinated debt accompanies a guarantee of repayment, they are thought of as safer than different types of debt.

## How Unsubordinated Debt Works

At the point when a company fails or wiped out, there is typically a chain or positioning of creditors who get compensated in a specific order. Lenders of unsubordinated debt get compensated out in full first by the company. The majority of this type of debt is typically secured by [collateral](/collateral).

Most loans from financial institutions and certain high-grade debt securities, for example, [mortgage bonds](/mortgage_bond) are considered senior debt. Loans are likewise considered unsubordinated in view of the balance and the period of time outstanding in comparison with different loans.

Since senior debt has a somewhat secure claim, it is viewed as safer. Thusly, it pays a lower rate of interest compared to different types of debt. This means lenders will make up for lower borrowing rates by claiming a higher priority over a borrower's assets since they will be repaid first during a liquidation event.

> Since they accompany some security, unsubordinated debt lenders regularly charge lower interest rates to their debtors.

After unsubordinated debt lenders are paid, any leftover money goes to [preferred stock](/preferredstock) holders, subordinated debt, trailed by common shareholders.

## Types of Unsubordinated Debt

Instances of unsubordinated debt incorporate [exchange-traded notes](/etn) (ETNs), collateralized securities, and certificates of deposit (CDs). Collateralized securities, for example, mortgage-backed securities (MBS) are structured with a number of [tranches](/tranches) that bear various risks, interest rates, and maturities. Tranches with a higher claim on underlying assets are more secure than junior tranches with a subsequent lien. Senior tranches likewise have a higher credit rating than junior tranches and are paid first.

## Unsubordinated versus Subordinated Debt

Unsubordinated debt is something contrary to [subordinated debt](/subordinateddebt). This type of debt vehicle is positioned below all senior debts of a company. Subordinated debt is additionally called junior debt, and is subject to subordination in the event of default or [bankruptcy](/bankruptcy).

At the point when a company's assets are [liquidated](/liquidation) to pay off its debt obligations, subordinated debt holders receive payment after all unsubordinated debt lenders and preferred stock holders are paid. Now and again, there is no cash left subsequent to paying the unsubordinated lenders, and that means each and every other creditor stays unpaid.

Since there is more risk associated with subordinated debt, these lenders typically charge higher interest rates compared to unsubordinated debt.
