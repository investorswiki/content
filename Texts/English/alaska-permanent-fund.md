Managed by the Alaska Permanent Fund Corporation, a state-owned corporation, the fund's value was $77.23 billion as of June 17, 2022.

All the Alaska Permanent Fund pays an annual [dividend](/dividend) to Alaska's inhabitants that meet certain qualification requirements.

Management of the fund is by the Alaska Permanent Fund Corporation. After completion of the Trans-Alaska Pipeline System, which acquainted Alaskan oil with the market in 1976, Alaska's government added a state constitutional amendment setting to the side a share of oil revenues for people in the future of Alaskans. The revenues from these natural reserves form the basis of the Alaska Permanent Fund.

The Alaskan constitution determines that something like 25% of all "mineral lease rentals, eminences, royalty sale proceeds, federal mineral revenue-sharing payments, and bonuses received by the State will be put in a permanent fund."

## Dividends of the Alaska Permanent Fund

The Alaska Permanent Fund delivers out annual dividends, called the Permanent Fund Dividend (PFD). To fit the bill for a dividend, the Alaska occupants must have carried on with a full calendar year in the state and must expect to stay in Alaska.

In any case, several factors might reject an individual from qualification. If during the qualifying calendar year, an individual is condemned because of a conviction of a state crime, detained because of a state crime, or sentenced for specific misdeeds, they may at this point not be eligible to collect the PFD.

The dividend payout per person for 2021 is $1,114. This is an increase from the 2020 payout of $992. The highest payout was in 2008 at $2,069. The amount depends on the profits of the fund and can be adjusted by legal intervention. The adjustment is generally a reduction from the expected amount as was seen in 2018.
