# Cheapest to Deliver (CTD)
## What Is Cheapest to Deliver?

The term cheapest to deliver (CTD) alludes to the cheapest security delivered in a futures contract to a [long position](/long) to fulfill the contract specifications. It is pertinent just for contracts that permit various somewhat various securities to be delivered.

This is common in Treasury bond futures contracts, which regularly determine that any treasury bond can be delivered inasmuch as it is inside a certain maturity range and has a certain [coupon rate](/coupon-rate). The coupon rate is the rate of interest a bond issuer pays for the whole term of the security.

## Understanding Cheapest to Deliver (CTD)

A [futures contract](/futurescontract) enters the buyer into an obligation to purchase a specific underlying financial instrument's specific quantity. The seller must deliver the underlying security out on the town agreed upon by the two players. In situations where different [financial instruments](/financialinstrument) can fulfill the contract in light of the way that a specific grade was not determined, the seller who stands firm on the short foothold can recognize which instrument will be the cheapest to deliver.

Keep in mind, a trader generally takes a short position — or a short — when they sell a financial [asset](/asset) fully intent on repurchasing it at a lower price later on. Traders generally take short positions when they accept an asset's price will drop sooner rather than later. Futures markets permit traders to take short positions whenever.

Determining the cheapest to deliver security is important for the short position since there is many times a disparity between a security's market price and the [conversion](/conversion) factor used to determine the value of the security being delivered. This makes it worthwhile for the seller to pick specific security to deliver over another. Since it is assumed that the [short position](/short) gives the cheapest to deliver security, the market pricing of futures contracts is generally founded on the cheapest to deliver security.

## Special Considerations

Choosing the cheapest to deliver gives the investor in the short position the ability to boost their return — or benefit — on the picked bond. The calculation to determine the cheapest to deliver is:

>
> CTD = Current Bond Price - Settlement Price x Conversion Factor

The current bond price is determined in light of the current [market price](/market-price) with any interest due to a total. Furthermore, the calculations are all the more commonly founded on the net amount earned from the transaction, otherwise called the [implied repo rate](/implied_repo_rate). This is the rate of return that a trader can earn when they sell a bond or futures contract and buy a similar asset at the market price with borrowed funds simultaneously. Higher implied repo rates bring about assets that are less expensive to deliver overall.

Set by the [Chicago Board of Trade](/cbot) (CBOT) and the [Chicago Mercantile Exchange](/cme) (CME), the conversion factor is required to adapt to the fluctuating grades that might be getting looked at and is intended to limit certain benefits that might exist while choosing between different options. The conversion factors are adjusted as important to give the most helpful metric while involving the data for calculations.
