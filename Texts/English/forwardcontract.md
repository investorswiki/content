# Forward Contract
## What Is a Forward Contract?

A forward contract is a redone contract between two gatherings to buy or sell an asset at a predetermined price on a future date. A forward contract can be utilized for hedging or speculation, despite the fact that its non-standardized nature makes it especially apt for hedging.

## Figuring out Forward Contracts

Dissimilar to standard [futures](/futures) contracts, a forward contract can be tweaked to a commodity, amount, and [delivery date](/deliverydate). Commodities traded can be grains, precious metals, natural gas, oil, or even poultry. A forward contract settlement can happen on a cash or delivery basis.

Forward contracts don't trade on a centralized exchange and are therefore viewed as over-the-counter (OTC) instruments. While their [OTC](/otc) nature makes it more straightforward to redo terms, the lack of a centralized clearinghouse likewise leads to a higher degree of [default risk](/defaultrisk).

> Due to their true capacity for default risk and lack of a centralized clearinghouse, forward contracts are not as effectively accessible to [retail investors](/retailinvestor) as futures contracts.

## Forward Contracts versus Futures Contracts

Both forward and [futures contracts](/futurescontract) include the agreement to buy or sell a commodity at a set price from now on. However, there are slight differences between the two. While a forward contract doesn't trade on an exchange, a futures contract does.

Settlement for the forward contract happens toward the finish of the contract, while the futures contract settles consistently. Above all, futures contracts exist as [standardized contracts](/contract-theory) that are not redone between counterparties.

## Illustration of a Forward Contract

Think about the accompanying illustration of a forward contract. Expect that an agricultural producer has 2,000,000 bushels of corn to sell six months from now and is worried about a likely decline in the price of corn. It subsequently goes into a forward contract with its [financial institution](/financialinstitution) to sell 2,000,000 bushels of corn at a price of $4.30 per bushel in six months, with settlement on a [cash basis](/cashbasis).

In six months, the [spot price](/spotprice) of corn has three prospects:

1. **It is precisely $4.30 per bushel.** In this case, no monies are owed by the producer or financial institution to one another and the contract is closed.
1. **It is higher than the contract price, say $5 per bushel.** The producer owes the institution $1.4 million, or the difference between the current spot price and the contracted rate of $4.30.
1. **It is lower than the contract price, say $3.50 per bushel.** The financial institution will pay the producer $1.6 million, or the difference between the contracted rate of $4.30 and the current spot price.

## Risks of Forward Contracts

The market for forward contracts is tremendous since large numbers of the world's greatest corporations use it to [hedge](/hedge) currency and [interest rate risks](/interestraterisk). Nonetheless, since the subtleties of forward contracts are restricted to the buyer and seller — and are not known to the overall population — the size of this market is challenging to estimate.

The large size and unregulated nature of the forward contracts market mean that it very well might be helpless to a flowing series of [defaults](/default2) in the worst situation imaginable. While banks and financial corporations alleviate this risk by being exceptionally careful in their decision of [counterparty](/counterparty), the possibility of large-scale default exists.

Another risk that arises from the non-standard nature of forward contracts is that they are just settled on the [settlement date](/settlementdate) and are not set apart to-market like futures. Imagine a scenario in which the [forward rate](/forwardrate) determined in the contract veers widely from the [spot rate](/spot_rate) at the hour of settlement.

In this case, the financial institution that originated the forward contract is presented to a greater degree of risk in the [event of default](/event-of-default) or non-settlement by the client than if the contract were set apart to-market consistently.
