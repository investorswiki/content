# Short Coupon
## What Is a Short Coupon?

A short coupon is a payment made on a [bond](/bond) inside a shorter time interval than is normal for that bond. A short coupon is utilized on the off chance that the issuer wishes to make payments on certain dates — for instance, June 30 and Dec. 31 — as opposed to just after a particular interval from when the bond is sold in the [primary market](/primarymarket).

Most frequently, a short coupon is a bond's most memorable coupon, so that assuming the coupon is due toward the month's end for a semi-annual payment and the bond is issued mid-month, they coupon might be short by about fourteen days' pro-rata interest.

## How a Short Coupon Works

In the United States, most corporate bond [coupon payments](/coupon) are made semi-annually; that is, like clockwork. A short coupon alludes to interest payments on a bond for a period that is shorter than the standard six months. These payments ordinarily apply to the primary coupon payment after a bond's issuance. Subsequent payments after the principal interest payment are distributed following the normal semi-annual cycle.

In certain countries, it is the standard to make coupon payments just one time each year. The schedule by which coupon payments are made doesn't generally influence yields since the price of a bond will rapidly change to such an extent that the [effective yield](/effectiveyield) on some random issue is comparable to comparable bonds in the market. In any case, unusual payment schedules, for example, those in which no payment is made for quite a long time, may require a higher effective yield to tempt purchasers.

## Illustration of a Short Coupon

For instance, let us expect that a 5-year bond is issued on March 15, 2020. The bond is to pay coupons two times per year — on May 15 and November 15 — for each year until it develops. Its most memorable payment date is scheduled for May 15, 2020. On this date, the investor receives [interest that has accrued](/accruedinterest) from the issuance date to the payment date, or at least, from March 15 to May 15, which is under six months. This interest payment covers just two months, as a matter of fact. Be that as it may, subsequent coupon payments will be paid normally and in full, following the conventional half year period.

## Computing the Short Coupon

The short coupon is processed from the accrued interest payable from the issue date until the main coupon payment date. For the principal interest installment, the investor will receive a coupon proportional to its maturity.

Continuing with our model above, expect the interest rate on the bond is 4% and the [par value](/parvalue) is $100,000. The day count between March 15 (issue date) and May 15 (coupon date) is 61. The half year period or the reference period leading up to the payment date (November 15, 2019 to May 15, 2020) has 181 days. The coupon that will be paid on May 15 can be calculated as follows:

>
> (61/181) x (0.04/2) x $100,000 = $674.03
>

Contingent upon how short the coupon is, the accrued interest has an effect in the [value of the bond](/bond-valuation) at the hour of issue, which is reflected in the offering price.

## Features
- A short coupon is the point at which the issuer of a bond makes a payment to bondholders inside a shorter interval than is normal for that bond.
- To work out the value of a short coupon, register the accrued interest payable from the issue date until the primary coupon payment date.
- Frequently on the primary coupon payment after the bond's issuance, a short coupon is paid on a pro-rata basis in light of the standard coupon.
