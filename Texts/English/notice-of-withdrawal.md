## What Is a Notice of Withdrawal?

A notice of withdrawal is a notice given to a bank by a depositor, expressing the depositor's intent to [withdraw](/withdrawal) funds from their bank account. This notice applies to both time-deposits and [negotiable orders of withdrawal](/nowaccount) (NOWs) accounts. Banks may likewise require a notice of withdrawal for savings accounts.

## Figuring out a Notice of Withdrawal

Notices of withdrawal are regularly utilized exclusively for [time-deposit](/timedeposit) endlessly accounts that bear interest, for example, NOW accounts and savings accounts. Banks might expect depositors to give this notice seven days prior to making a withdrawal; notwithstanding, this rule is typically deferred for small cash withdrawals from NOW accounts and savings accounts.

For time-deposit accounts, depositors normally cause a penalty in the event that they wish to pull out funds from the account before it arrives at maturity. Depositors must give a notice of withdrawal if they have any desire to pull out money from the time-deposit account early and cause the penalty fee. A few banks will consequently reestablish a period deposit account when it arrives at maturity, so depositors ought to give a notice of withdrawal before it arrives at maturity so they can get their money in the grace period among maturity and renewal and keep away from another accidental renewal.

Every individual bank will have its own requirements on the limits that can be removed regardless of a notice of withdrawal, as well as what financial products they apply to, and the number of notice days required before the withdrawal happens. This data is normally nitty gritty in the legal documentation that a depositor signs while opening up their accounts.

Withdrawals of $5,000 or more, whether from a [demand deposit](/demanddeposit), NOW, or time-deposit account, may strain a bank office's reserves of close by cash. Therefore, banks might expect no less than seven days' notice of withdrawal for large cash withdrawals. Larger, global banks, commonly will not have this requirement, especially for lower amounts, though smaller, nearby banks could due to their lower levels of deposits.

On account of very large withdrawals, banks might require over seven days' notice. For instance, in 2012, a customer at Dollar Bank, which serves the Pittsburgh and Cleveland areas, endeavored to pull out $600,000 in cash from his bank. The bank couldn't meet that withdrawal request without notice, and ended up requiring over seven weeks to acquire the colossal amount of cash and organize the withdrawal.

This extensive period of notice permitted the bank to investigate whether the elderly customer may be at risk of [fraud](/fraud), to offer the customer an additional prudent and secure means of getting his money, lastly, to do whatever it may take to safeguard the customer, the bank, and its staff upon the arrival of the withdrawal. Tellers were advised on the most proficient method to handle the withdrawal, and two bank security officers plus two city cops were close by to accompany the customer and his cash to his vehicle.
