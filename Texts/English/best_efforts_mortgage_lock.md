## What Is a Best Efforts Mortgage Lock?

A best efforts mortgage lock happens when the sale of a [mortgage](/mortgage) in the secondary mortgage market expects that the seller — normally a mortgage originator — puts forth their best attempt to deliver the mortgage to the buyer.

A [mortgage originator](/mortgage_originator) can be either an institution or an individual that works with a borrower to complete a mortgage transaction. A mortgage originator is the original mortgage lender and can be either a mortgage broker or a mortgage banker.

Best efforts mortgage locks exist to transfer the risk that a loan won't close from the originator to the secondary market. With this sort of lock, on the off chance that the mortgage neglects to close, the cost of this will be borne by the secondary buyer of the mortgage and not the original mortgage lender.

Best efforts mortgage locks can measure up to a [mandatory mortgage lock](/mandatory_mortgage_lock), in which the seller of a mortgage must either deliver the product to the buyers by a specific date or cause a fee, called a couple off fee.

## How a Best Efforts Mortgage Lock Works

A best efforts mortgage lock is a type of sale of a mortgage into the [secondary mortgage market](/secondary_mortgage_market). The secondary mortgage market, where mortgage locks happen, is the market where mortgage loans and [servicing rights](/msr) are bought and sold among mortgage originators, mortgage aggregators, and investors.

The secondary mortgage's very large and liquid market assists make with crediting similarly accessible to all borrowers across geographical areas. Mortgage originators sell a large percentage of their new mortgages into the secondary market, where they are packaged into mortgage-backed securities and sold to investors, including [pension funds](/pensionplan), insurance companies, and hedge funds.

At the point when a person takes out a home loan, the loan is [underwritten](/guaranteeing), funded, and overhauled by a bank. Since the bank has utilized its own funds to make the loan, they then, at that point, sell the loan into the secondary market to get more cash-flow accessible to keep giving loans. The loan is frequently sold to large [aggregators](/aggregator), like Fannie Mae. The aggregator then, at that point, disperses large number of comparable loans in a mortgage-backed security.

Mortgage locks — which incorporate both best efforts mortgage locks and mandatory mortgage locks — determine the penalty that must be paid in the event that a mortgage isn't paid back to the buyer. Basically, a best efforts mortgage lock means that the mortgage originator — in our model here, a bank — must put forth a reasonable attempt to pay back the mortgage to the buyer — in our model here, an aggregator like Fannie Mae. In any case, no fee is due assuming that the seller neglects to meet this payment.

## Mandatory Mortgage Lock versus Best Efforts Mortgage Lock

One more sort of mortgage sale on the secondary market is the mandatory mortgage lock. With a mandatory mortgage lock, the seller of the mortgage is required to make the delivery to the buyer by a certain date or match off out of the trade.

A mandatory mortgage lock or trade generally commands a higher price in the secondary mortgage market than best efforts locks on the grounds that less [hedge](/hedge) costs are associated with mandatory mortgage locks. Since the buyer can be (close to 100%) that the loan amount will be repaid, they need not go to lengths to alleviate the risk of default.

## Benefits and Risks of Best Efforts Mortgage Locks

A few types of organizations buy mortgage debt on the secondary market, including institutional investors, [pension funds](/pensionplan), insurance companies, and hedge funds. For these buyers, best efforts mortgage locks and mandatory mortgage locks address various levels of risk.

Mortgage originators that hedge their own mortgage pipelines and expect fallout risk for the most part sell their mortgages into the secondary mortgage market through mandatory mortgage locks or assignment of [trade transactions](/trade). Since mandatory mortgage locks and assignment of trade transactions don't transfer hedge risks to the buyer, they generally command better pricing on the secondary market than best efforts mortgage locks.

A mandatory mortgage lock conveys more risk for the mortgage seller than the best efforts mortgage lock. Likewise, though the mandatory mortgage lock expects that the mortgage be delivered or matched off out of the trade, the best efforts mortgage lock doesn't. In practice, this means that with a best efforts mortgage lock, the risk is carried by the buyer, though a mandatory mortgage lock conveys risk for the seller.

> Best efforts mortgage locks shift risk away from the seller of mortgages on the secondary market, and mortgages with this sort of lock are accordingly less costly for buyers since they accept more risk.
