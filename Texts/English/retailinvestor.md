## What Is a Retail Investor?

A retail investor, otherwise called an individual investor, is a non-professional investor who buys and sells securities or funds that contain a basket of securities, for example, [mutual funds](/mutualfund) and [exchange traded funds (ETFs)](/etf).

Retail investors execute their trades through traditional or online brokerage firms or different types of investment accounts. Retail investors purchase securities for their very own accounts and frequently trade in decisively smaller amounts as compared to [institutional investors](/institutionalinvestor). An institutional investor is an umbrella term for larger-scale investments by professional portfolio and fund managers who could deal with a mutual fund or pension fund.

## Seeing Retail Investors

Retail investors normally buy and sell trades in the [equity](/equity) and [bond](/bond) markets and will quite often invest a lot smaller amounts than large institutional investors. Nonetheless, more well off retail investors can now access alternative investment classes like private equity and hedge funds. Due to their small purchasing power, most retail investors might need to pay higher fees or commissions for their trades, albeit many brokers have wiped out fees for online trades.

The [U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)](/sec) is accused of protecting retail investors to guarantee the markets function in a fair and orderly way. The SEC aides retail investors by giving education and the enforcement of regulations to guarantee individuals stay certain and happy with investing in the markets.

Retail investors altogether affect [market sentiment](/marketsentiment), which addresses the overall tone in the financial markets. Indicators of investor sentiment incorporate mutual fund flows, the first-day performance of [IPO](/ipo)s, and survey data from the American Association of Individual Investors, which questions retail investors about their expectations for the market. Sentiment is additionally followed by stockbrokers like TD Ameritrade and E*TRADE.

## Reactions of Retail Investors

Pundits say smaller investors don't have the knowledge, discipline, or skill to research their investments. An investor who spreads the word about small size trades is some of the time deprecatorily as a [piker](/piker).

Subsequently, they sabotage the financial markets' job in dispensing resources productively; and through crowded trades, cause [panic selling](/panicselling). These unsophisticated investors are supposed to be helpless against behavioral predispositions and may misjudge the power of the majority that drive the market.

## The Retail Investment Market

The retail investment market in the United States is huge in size and scope, and as per the SEC, in 2020, "American households own $29 trillion worth of values — over 58% of the U.S. equity market — either straightforwardly or by implication through mutual funds, retirement accounts, and different investments."

"43 million U.S. households hold a retirement or brokerage account. 56 million U.S. households (44% of all households) own something like one U.S. mutual fund" starting around 2018.

And keeping in mind that Americans inclined toward savings accounts and passive investing in the aftermath of the 2008 [financial crisis](/financial-crisis), the number of households that own stocks has ascended since. As per the Federal Reserve's survey of consumer finances, around 53% of families owned stocks, and 70% of upper-center pay families owned stocks in 2019.

Dissimilar to institutional traders, retail traders are bound to invest in stocks of smaller companies since they can have lower price points, permitting them to buy a wide range of securities in an adequate number of shares to accomplish a diversified portfolio.

Retail investors now approach more financial data, investment education, and trading instruments than at any other time. Brokerage fees have diminished, and mobile trading has empowered investors to actively deal with their portfolios from their cell phones or other mobile gadgets. An immense scope of retail funds and brokers have humble [minimum investment](/minimum_investment) amounts or [minimum deposits](/minimum_deposit) of a couple hundred dollars, and a few ETFs and [robo-advisors](/roboadvisor-roboadviser) don't need any. All things considered, as democratized as investing becomes, it is still about getting your work done.

## Institutional Investors

Institutional investors are the big players in the market who move big money. Instances of institutional investors include:

- Pension funds
- Mutual funds
- Money managers
- Insurance companies
- Investment banks
- Commercial [trusts](/trust)
- Endowment funds for a university or school
- Hedge funds
- Private equity firms or investors

Institutional investors account for a lot of the trading volume on the [New York Stock Exchange (NYSE)](/nyse). They move large blocks of shares and affect the stock market's developments. Since they are viewed as sophisticated investors who are knowledgeable and, thusly, more averse to make uninformed investments, institutional investors are subject to less of the protective regulations that the SEC gives to your average, ordinary investor.

The money that institutional investors use isn't really money that the institutions own themselves. Institutional investors generally invest for others. In the event that you have a pension plan at work, a mutual fund, or any sort of insurance, you are really profiting from the skill of institutional investors.
