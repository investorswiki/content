# Busted Convertible Security
## What is Busted Convertible Security?

A busted convertible security is a [convertible bond](/convertiblebond) where the underlying stock trades far below its conversion price, making it act exclusively as a bond given that there is an extremely low likelihood that it will at any point arrive at the convertible price before maturity.

## Figuring out Busted Convertible Security

Busted convertible security portrays the behavior of a convertible bond which has lost significant value as a likely convertible option. A convertible bond is a half breed sort of corporate security that owners can exchange for shares of the company's common stock. Each [bond](/bond) has a face ([par](/parvalue)) value that the owner can reclaim for a fixed number of shares. The number of shares depends on the [conversion ratio](/conversionratio).

For instance, in the event that a convertible bond has a face value of $500 and a conversion ratio of 10, each $50 of the face value would be redeemable for one share of company stock. That conversion feature can be helpful to the owner assuming the value of the underlying stock increments before the bond arrives at it's [maturity date](/maturitydate). Say the stock price of the company moves over the [conversion price](/conversionprice) of $50, to $60 per share. The owner could choose for convert their $500 bond (worth ten shares of company stock) into equity worth $600 (10 shares x $60/share). When changed over, the owner can hold that stock or sell it on the market to understand a profit.

In any case, if the price of the underlying stock reductions, falling below half of the conversion price, the security is supposed to be 'busted', subsequently the moniker 'busted convertible security'. In that case, the bond acts similar as a [out-of-the-money](/outofthemoney) option. Take a similar model including a $500 convertible bond. In the event that the value of the underlying stock tumbled to $25, or lower, the benefit of the security's convertible feature is practically worthless since it's far-fetched that stock price will recuperate. There's no incentive for the owner to change the security over completely to equity in light of the fact that its investment value, or what a comparative non-convertible bond would get on the market, is worth more than the conversion value. The conversion value is the amount realized by trading the bond for equity.

## Trading Busted Convertibles

A few investors have found progress in trading busted convertibles. While the likelihood of changing over the security into stock is remote, busted convertibles typically trade at prices and [yields](/yield) like traditional non-convertible bonds of comparable maturities and risk. In the interim, should the underlying company stock end up rebounding before maturity, the bond's convertible value would likewise appreciate, and the security could become significant. Basically, busted convertible securities can be attractive investment opportunities given that they are, basically, a reasonable [call option](/calloption) that procures yield of a customary bond.
