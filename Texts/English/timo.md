1. **The demand for timber is increasing.** As of 2008, the demand for timber has been expanding as forest-related product development develops. Even paper reusing efforts affect demand, and as indicated by the Society Of American Foresters, each American consumes a 100 ft. tree every year.

1. **Timber returns beat stocks.** Measuring returns utilizing the National Council of Real Estate Investment Fiduciaries (NCREIF) Timberland Index, timber investment returns surpassed those of the S&P 500 from 1990 through 2007.

The land supply is limited and demand keeps on developing as the population and commercial development extends. Contingent upon location, some property can be targeted as "higher and better use" land that can be sold to designers at a premium, giving extra appreciation benefits to timber owners. The collapse of markets that require timber as information sources looms as an expected risk. Be that as it may, timberland is a natural warehouse where stock can be stored on the stump until markets and demand rebound. While natural catastrophes, for example, unfavorable climate and fire can likewise reduce stock, even events like the Mount St. Helens ejection in 1980 didn't clear out investors.
