## What Is a Pattern?

Patterns are the unmistakable formations made by the movements of security prices on a chart. A pattern is recognized by a line that interfaces common price points, like closing prices or highs or lows, during a specific period of time. Chartists try to distinguish patterns as a method for expecting the future course of a security's price. Patterns are the foundation of technical analysis.

## How Patterns Work

Patterns in security prices, maybe better known as trading patterns, can happen anytime or measure in time. While price patterns might be simple to identify in hindsight, spotting them in real time is a lot bigger test. There are various types of patterns in technical analysis, including the [cup and handle](/cupandhandle), ascending/descending channels, and the [head-and-shoulders](/head-shoulders) pattern.

There are two primary types of stock analysis: fundamental and technical. Fundamental analysis takes a gander at the specifics of an organization's business, directing research on earnings projections, balance sheets, price-to-book ratios and substantially more. Technical analysis is generally engaged with pattern recognition, paying little heed to performance. These patterns are then used to reveal pricing trends. Fundamental analysis can assist with figuring out what to buy, while technical analysis can help decide when to buy. Balanced investors will apply the two studies.

Technical analysts use chart patterns to track down trends in the movement of an organization's stock price. Patterns can be based on seconds, minutes, hours, days, months or even [ticks](/tick) and can be applied to bar, [candlestick](/candlestick), and line charts. The most fundamental form of chart pattern is a trend line.

## Trend Lines

"The trend is your companion" is a common expression among technical analysts. A trend can frequently be found by laying out a line chart. A trend line is the line formed between a high and a low. Assuming that line is going up, the trend is up. On the off chance that the trend line is slanting downward, the trend is down. Trend lines are the foundation for most chart patterns.

They are additionally valuable for finding support and resistance levels, which can likewise be found through pattern recognition. A line of support is a historical level that a stock price hasn't traded below; a line of resistance is a historical point where a stock hasn't traded previously.

## Pattern Types

There are two fundamental types of patterns: continuation and reversal. [Continuation patterns](/continuationpattern) distinguish opportunities for traders to go on with the trend. There are likewise [retracements](/retracement) or transitory consolidation patterns where a stock won't go on with the trend. The most common continuation patterns incorporate ascending and descending triangles, flag patterns, pennant patterns, and symmetrical triangles.

Something contrary to a continuation pattern is a reversal pattern. These are employed to track down ideal opportunities to base a trade on the reversal of a trend. At the end of the day, reversal patterns try to uncover where trends have ended. "The trend is your companion until it twists" is one more expression for those searching for a reversal in a trend. Common reversal patterns are double tops and bottoms, head-and-shoulders patterns, and triple tops and bottoms.
