Right of first refusal is a contractual agreement that offers a specific party the chance to buy property before the owner can sell it to another person.

Now and again, buyers with right of first refusal pay more than they in any case would, particularly assuming the agreement states that they must match substantial, contending offers on the property. This can be a problem on the off chance that the buyer is as yet building enough [credit](/credit) to fit the bill for a mortgage.
## Right of first refusal model
Occupants some of the time request the right of first refusal while signing a lease with a property owner as a method for getting the property.
