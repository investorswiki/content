# Advertising Injury Coverage
## What Is Advertising Injury Coverage?

Advertising injury coverage is a part of [commercial general liability](/commercial-general-liability-cgl) insurance that safeguards the policyholder against claims of taken thoughts, intrusion of privacy, libel, slander and [copyright infringement](/copyright-infringement) connected with advertising. Advertising injury coverage is a type of personal injury insurance, instead of physical injury insurance, and may likewise be called personal and advertising injury coverage.

## Figuring out Advertising Injury Coverage

Advertising injury coverage safeguards a business from claims of offenses supposedly serious in the course of advertising its goods, products or services. For instance, assume a team of disappointed lawyers leaves the law firm they were employed by and chooses to begin their own firm. The new firm takes out a bulletin, and the board involves text style and variety for its text that is almost indistinguishable from those of the lawyers' former employer. The former employer sues the displeased lawyers for advertising injury and requests that the board be required down in 48 hours or less.

The lawyers' new firm doesn't have the financial resources to guard itself against this claim or to pay a judgment whenever found blameworthy in court. Luckily, they had the foreknowledge to purchase an overall liability insurance policy that contained advertising injury coverage, so they can utilize this insurance policy to fight the lawsuit. Sadly, in light of the fact that the troubled lawyers intentionally disregarded their former employer's [trademark](/trademark), their policy doesn't cover them and they need to shield themselves with their own resources or figure out how to modestly settle.

One more scenario where advertising injury coverage would become an integral factor is if a major vehicle manufacturer, through its TV ads, claimed that its rivals' vehicles utilized broken stopping mechanisms and the contender sued for slander, saying that the claims regarding defective brakes were false. The vehicle manufacturer could depend on its advertising injury coverage to guard itself in court, accepting at least for a moment that its claims depended on accurate data and were not excluded from the policy's coverage in any capacity.

## False Endlessly advertising Injury Coverage

Many companies accept that their advertising injury coverage would coherently safeguard them against false advertising claims also. Notwithstanding, this is never the case. At the point when a business purposely takes part in false advertising, advertising injury coverage is excluded in the most broad liability policies.

We should return to the speculative scenario including the disappointed lawyers. Assuming that their new customers sued them on the grounds that the lawyers' board persuaded customers to think the new firm was some way or another connected with the old firm, the lawyers' advertising injury coverage wouldn't safeguard them, since it doesn't cover false advertising claims. Businesses that are particularly worried about false advertising insurance protection ought to examine a separate policy with their insurance agent. Be admonished, nonetheless, that of all the advertising wounds, false advertising coverage can be the hardest to drop by.
