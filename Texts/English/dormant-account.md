# Dormant Account
## What Is a Dormant Account?

A dormant account is an account that has had no financial activity for a long period of time, with the exception of the posting of interest. Financial institutions are required by state laws to transfer resources held in dormant accounts to the state's treasury after the accounts have been dormant for a certain period of time. The amount of time fluctuates relying upon the state.

Accounts that can become dormant incorporate checking and savings accounts, brokerage accounts, 401(k) accounts, pension fund accounts, and different accounts for financial resources.

## How a Dormant Account Works

To become dormant, the owner of an account must not have initiated any activity for a specific period of time. An activity can incorporate reaching a financial institution by telephone or Internet, signing into the account, or setting aside a withdrawal or installment. Periodic interest or dividends that are posted consequently on funds at checking, savings, or brokerage accounts are not viewed as activity.

After an account has no activity for a specific period of time, state law believes it to be a dormant account. Financial institutions are required by state laws to make an endeavor to contact owners of dormant accounts utilizing the latest contact data via mail. A [statute of limitations](/statute-of-limitations) normally doesn't make a difference to dormant accounts, implying that funds can be claimed by the owner or beneficiary whenever.

If an endeavor to find the owner is fruitless, resources in dormant accounts become unclaimed property and must be transferred to the state's treasury department.

In California, for instance, checking, savings and brokerage accounts must see no activity for something like three years to become dormant. In the state of Delaware, there is a five-year dormancy period for similar types of accounts.

## The Escheatment Process of Dormant Accounts

States have established [escheatment](/escheat) statutes that administer the method involved with transferring unclaimed funds to the state and safeguard the unclaimed funds from being returned to financial institutions.

Escheatment state laws expect companies to transfer unclaimed property from dormant accounts to the general fund of a state for safekeeping. The state assumes control over record-keeping and the returning of lost or failed to remember property to owners or their heirs on the off chance that the owner has died.

Owners can gain back unclaimed property by filing an application with their state at no cost or for a nominal taking care of fee. Since the state keeps custody of the unclaimed property in perpetuity, owners can claim their property whenever.
