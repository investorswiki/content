## What Is a Cash Dividend?

A cash dividend is the distribution of funds or money paid to stockholders by and large as part of the corporation's current earnings or accumulated profits.

Cash dividends are paid straightforwardly in money, rather than being paid as a [stock dividend](/stockdividend) or other form of value. Most brokers offer a decision to reinvest or acknowledge cash dividends.

## How a Cash Dividend Works

Cash dividends are a common way for companies to return [capital](/capital) to their shareholders as periodic cash payments — regularly, quarterly — however a few stocks might pay these bonuses on a month to month, annual, or semiannual basis.

While many firms pay standard dividends, there are special cash dividends that are distributed to shareholders after certain nonrecurring occasions, for example, legal settlements or the borrowing of money for enormous, one-time cash distributions. Each company lays out its dividend policy and periodically evaluates on the off chance that a dividend cut or an increase is justified. Cash dividends are paid on a per-share basis.

## The Timing of Cash Dividends

A company's board of directors reports a cash dividend on a [declaration date,](/declarationdate) which involves paying a certain amount of money per common share. After that warning, the record date is laid out, which is the date on which a firm decides its shareholders on record who are eligible to receive the payment.

What's more, stock exchanges or other suitable securities organizations decide a [ex-dividend](/ex-dividend) date, which is normally two business days before the record date. An investor who bought common shares before the ex-dividend date is qualified for the announced cash dividend.

## Which Companies Pay Dividends?

Companies that pay dividends regularly appreciate stable cash flows, and their businesses are commonly past the growth stage. This business growth cycle partially explains why growth firms don't pay dividends — they need these funds to expand their operations, build processing plants, and increase their personnel.

Certain dividend-paying companies might go similarly as laying out dividend payout targets, which depend on created profits in a given year. For example, banks ordinarily pay out a certain percentage of their profits as cash dividends. Assuming that profits decline, the [dividend policy](/dividendpolicy) can be amended or postponed to better times.

## Accounting for Cash Dividends

At the point when a corporation declares a dividend, it debits its [retained earnings](/retainedearnings) and credits a liability account called dividend payable. On the date of payment, the company switches the dividend payable with a debit entry and credits its cash account for the individual cash outflow.

Cash dividends don't influence a company's income statement. Be that as it may, they shrink a company's shareholders' equity and cash balance by a similar amount. Firms must report any cash dividend as payments in the financing activity section of their [cash flow statement](/cashflowstatement).

The least demanding method for contrasting cash dividends across companies is with take a gander at the [trailing year (TTM)](/ttm) dividend yields, which are registered as a company's dividends per share for the latest year period divided by its current stock price. This calculation normalizes the measure of cash dividends concerning the price of a common share.
