# Non-fungible Token (NFT)

A non-fungible token (NFT) is a type of cryptographic token that addresses a unique asset. NFTs are tokenized variants of digital or genuine assets. They function as undeniable proofs of realness and ownership inside a blockchain network. NFTs are not interchangeable with one another and acquaint scarcity with the digital world.
[Fungibility](/fungibility) alludes to the property of an asset whose individual units are interchangeable and basically undefined from one another. For instance, all [fiat currencies](/fiatmoney) are fungible. To act as a medium of exchange, every individual unit must be interchangeable with some other equivalent individual unit. A one-dollar bill is interchangeable with some other genuine one-dollar bill.
NFTs can be utilized by [decentralized applications (DApps)](/decentralized-applications-dapps) to take into account the creation and ownership of unique digital things and collectibles. While NFTs can be traded in open commercial centers that associate purchasers with venders, it is worth taking note of that the value of each is unique.
Different systems have been made to work with the issuance of NFTs. The most conspicuous of these is [ERC-721](/erc-721), which is a standard for the issuance and trading of non-fungible assets on the Ethereum blockchain. A later, further developed standard is ERC-1155, which empowers a solitary contract to contain both fungible and non-fungible tokens.
The standardization of NFTs permits a higher degree of [interoperability](/interoperability), implying that unique assets can be moved between applications effortlessly.
NFTs can possibly be one of the key parts of a new blockchain-controlled digital economy. They could be utilized in a wide range of fields, for example, video games, digital identity, licensing, certificates, or fine art - and even permit fractional ownership of things. Putting away ownership and identification data on the blockchain would increase data integrity and privacy, while simple, [trustless](/trustless) transfers and management of these assets could reduce friction in trade and the global economy.
