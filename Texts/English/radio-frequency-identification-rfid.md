# Radio Frequency Identification (RFID)
## What Is Radio Frequency Identification (RFID)?

Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) is a technology that utilizations radio waves to distinguish a labeled item passively. It is utilized in several commercial and industrial applications, from tracking things along a supply chain to keeping track of things left a library.

## Grasping Radio Frequency Identification

Radio Frequency Identification is utilized related to a central processor, a powered recieving wire, and a scanner. Albeit commercial purposes for it were first developed during the 1970s, it has become all the more universally accessible in recent years. With headways to the technology used to peruse and store data, it is currently more affordable to purchase and adjust.

Radio Frequency Identification deals with a small electronic gadget, normally a CPU, that has data stored on it. These gadgets are generally very small, at times the size of a grain of rice, and can hold large measures of data. While they don't necessarily in every case transmit power, some can contain a stored power source or batteries. The scanners used to peruse these gadgets can likewise give sufficient power to permit them to peruse the micro processor. There are various purposes for the technology, however it is commonly utilized in tracking products, animals, and currency.

## Special Considerations

The technology isn't without debate. Due to the idea of how these gadgets work it isn't inconceivable that somebody who shouldn't access the data on the microchips would have the option to. There is likewise concern that personal data might become accessible without consent since these frequencies can be sent over larger distances than their more normal counterparts, [barcodes](/barcode). Not at all like barcodes and barcode readers, one needn't bother with to have the option to see the micro processor to access the data on it.

## RFID Use-Case Example

One of the more normal purposes of RFID technology is through the microchipping of pets or pet chips. These microchips are embedded by veterinarians and contain data relating to the pet including their name, medical records, and contact data for their owners. On the off chance that a pet disappears and is transformed into a salvage or shelter, the shelter worker checks the animal for a central processor. On the off chance that the pet has a computer chip, the shelter worker may be a quick call or internet search away from having the option to contact the pet's owners. Pet chips are believed to be more reliable than chokers, which can fall off or be taken out.

With the rise of accessibility of the technology, most veterinarians and shelters currently have the technology to peruse these microchips. Universal scanners and national databases for putting away owner data are likewise rising in notoriety, making it simpler than any time in recent memory for microchipping pets to be an effective method for getting lost pets rejoined with their owners. One downside of the gadget is that the records must be stayed up with the latest. The data is just however reliable as the thing seems to be being imputed by the person setting up the central processor.

## Features
- The technology has been approved since before the 1970s yet has become considerably more pervasive in recent years due to its uses in things like global supply chain management and pet microchipping.
- The system has two fundamental parts: labels and readers. The reader radiates radio waves and gets signals back from the RFID tag, while the label utilizes radio waves to convey its identity and other data.
- Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) is a type of passive remote technology that considers tracking or matching of a thing or individual.
