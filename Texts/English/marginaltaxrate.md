# Marginal Tax Rate
## What is the marginal tax rate?

Each marginal tax rate just applies to all [taxable income](/taxableincome) earned inside that bracket, and every dollar earned past that reach is taxed at the next highest tax rate. That means higher-income earners fall into more tax brackets, paying a higher percentage on all new income earned over the previous bracket.
In the U.S., the most minimal tax rate is 10% and the highest is 39.6%. The marginal tax rate is the highest tax bracket that applies to an individual, while her effective tax rate is sum of the taxes she paid in all brackets.

Claiming certain credits and [deductions](/tax-derivation) can likewise bring down the taxpayer's marginal tax rate by diminishing the amount of taxable income she needs to pay taxes on.
