# Mini-Sized Dow Options
## What Are Mini-Sized Dow Options?

A mini-sized (or 'mini' or 'E-mini') Dow option is a type of [index options](/indexoption) contract for which the underlying assets are [E-mini](/emini) Dow Jones Industrial Average ([DJIA](/djia)) futures contracts. The underlying E-mini Dow is valued at 1/5 the value of the DJIA having a tick size of $5. Dow mini options are traded electronically through the [Chicago Mercantile Exchange's](/cme) (CME) [Globex](/globex) system.

Mini-sized contracts in futures and options make trading indices more down to earth, and furthermore exist for a wide range of other [indexes](/index, for example, the Nasdaq 100, S&P 500, S&P MidCap 400, and Russell 2000, as well as commodities like gold and currencies like the euro.

## Understanding Mini-Sized Dow Options

Mini futures and options contracts permit investors to fine-tune their exposure and position sizes because these mini-sized products cost less than the standard futures contracts. Each one-point move in the E-mini Dow futures contract equates to $5. Options traders keep this as a primary concern in regards to their position's [delta](/delta).

A delta of - 1 on a [put option](/putoption) or +1 on a [call option](/calloption) indicates that the option will move point-for-point with the underlying index. As the delta moves toward zero, even however the underlying futures contract moves $5 per point, the option contract may not.

E-mini options on the Dow Jones Industrial Average index are [American-style](/americanoption) options, meaning that they can be exercised anytime before expiration. Exercising the option results in "physical" [delivery](/physicaldelivery) of a corresponding position in the underlying [cash-settled](/cashsettlement) E-mini futures contract.

Starting around 2020, the E-mini Dow Jones contracts are the third most well known mini contracts on Globex, behind the Nasdaq 100 E-minis in second place and the S&P 500 E-minis as the most famous by volume. There is a relatively little daily volume in the E-mini Dow options compared to other indices.

The mini-sized dow options trade under the symbol OYM, while Dow mini futures trade under the ticker YMM. They have expiries for March, June, September, and December. Trading on the options ceases on at 9:30 AM Eastern Time on the third Friday of the contract month.

## E-Mini Dow Options Pricing

The price of a mini-sized Dow option is the quoted price multiplied by the multiplier. Therefore, in the event that the quoted price of an option is 300, the option costs 300 x 5, or $1,500. This is the [premium](/premium) paid for the option. The premium paid is the most an option buyer (call or put) can lose. A person buying the underlying futures faces losses of $5 per point, which could amount to fundamentally more than the fixed loss of the option premium.

A profit is made on an E-mini Dow call option on the off chance that the price of the underlying index moves above the strike price plus the price of the option. For example, assuming that the option's strike price is 26,000 and the option price is 800, the trader will be bringing in money assuming the underlying index moves above 26,800.

On account of a put option, utilizing the same figures, the trader begins to make money once the index dips under the strike less the premium. In this case, 26,000 - 800, or 25,200.

## Example of a Mini-Sized Dow Option Trade

Assume the underlying E-mini Dow futures, expiring in June, are trading at 25,648. It is currently mid-May, a trader believes that over the next month the underlying E-mini Dow futures will move considerably higher.

They purchase an options contract on the underlying with a strike price of 25,650. The option price is 400, multiplied by $5, for a total premium cost of $2,000 (plus [commissions](/commission)).

To [break even](/breakevenpoint) on the trade, the underlying should rise to 26,050 (25,650 + 400).

- If at the June [expiry](/expirationdate) the underlying futures contract is below 25,650 (strike price), the call option will expire worthless and the trader will lose the $2,000 they paid for the option (yet not more).
- Assuming that the underlying is between 25,650 and 26,050 at expiry, the option will be [in the money](/inthemoney) however the trade will in any case result in an overall loss. The closer the underlying is to 25,650 the more of their $2,000 they will lose. Assuming the underlying is at 26,050 at expiry, they break even.
- For every point above 26,050, the trader makes $5 per point. Thus, in the event that the underlying is at 27,000 at expiry, the option call buyer makes

>
> $4,750 = ((27,000 - 26,050) x $5).
>

Calculated a different way, deduct the value at expiry less the strike price, duplicate by $5, and afterward take away the cost of the option.

>
> 27,000 - 25,650 = 1,350 x $5 = $6,750 - $2,000 = $4,750.
