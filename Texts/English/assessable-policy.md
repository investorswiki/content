# Assessable Policy
## What Is an Assessable Policy?

An assessable policy is a type of insurance policy that might require the owner to pay extra funds to cover an insurer's losses assuming they are greater than its [reserves](/loss-save). Assessable policies, now and again alluded to as assessment insurance, are generally associated with [mutual insurance companies](/mutual-insurance-company), which are groups of people and organizations that pool resources to give insurance coverage to individuals.

## Grasping an Assessable Policy

In the United States, most insurance companies are owned by [shareholders](/shareholder) and must turn a [profit](/profit). As policyholders, we buy protection from these insurers yet don't straightforwardly share in their profits or losses.

A few companies operate under something else entirely. A group of organizations could pool funds and form a corporation explicitly to purchase [insurance coverage](/insurance-coverage) for the group's individuals. The subsequent corporation — called a mutual company or mutual insurance company — permits individuals to get protection against financial loss at a less expensive rate than if they had looked for coverage all alone.

Mutual insurance companies are generally more modest and have less money available to settle [claims](/insurance_claim) than traditional insurers. Subsequently, some are permitted to tap policyholders — their co-owners — for extra funds to meet their obligations, normally as an extra annual [premium](/insurance-premium) payment.

## Assessable Policy versus Non-Assessable Policy

Most insurers are owned by investors instead of policyholders. Thusly, they offer what are known as [non-assessable policies](/nonassessable-policy). Under this type of plan, the [liability](/liability) of the policyholder is limited to the amount of premium owed on the policy — the standard charge for financial protection.

At the end of the day, assuming the insurer is unable to cover losses coming about because of claims, it must then track down funds from different sources, including its investments. Using [investment income](/investmentincome) and other [assets](/asset) to plug deficiencies means the insurer will be less profitable, with the insurance company's investors at last enduring the worst part of these losses.

[State insurance regulators](/nainsurancec) may place limitations on insurers that give non-assessable policies. Such limitations ordinarily apply to the amount of reserves the insurer must set to the side to cover liabilities, the type and number of policies it is permitted to [underwrite](/guaranteeing), and the sort of investments it can invest its dividends in. The limitations are to guarantee that insurance companies are able to cover liabilities with [liquid assets](/liquidasset), as they are not permitted to demand extra funds from policyholders to compensate for losses.

That's what the downside is assuming that the company has a terrible year for claims, policyholders might face the horrendous surprise of being charged a [surcharge](/surcharge) on their premium.

Paying for the mix-ups of others probably won't appear to be fair. In any case, these types of policies really do give savings in premiums. Policyholders ought to see this as everybody being in it together to keep up with great driving records and prevail collectively.
