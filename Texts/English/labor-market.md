# Labor Market
## What Is the Labor Market?

The labor market, otherwise called the [job market](/job-market), alludes to the supply of and demand for labor, in which employees give the supply and employers give the demand. It is a major part of any economy and is complicatedly linked to markets for [capital](/capitalmarkets), goods, and services.

## Understanding the Labor Market

At the macroeconomic level, supply and demand are influenced by domestic and international market dynamics, as well as factors like movement, the age of the population, and education levels. Pertinent measures incorporate unemployment, productivity, [participation rates](/participationrate), [total income](/gross-national-income-gni), and gross domestic product (GDP).

At the [microeconomic](/microeconomics) level, individual firms cooperate with employees, hiring them, terminating them, and raising or cutting wages and hours. The relationship among supply and demand influences the number of hours employees work and the compensation they receive in wages, salary, and benefits.

## The U.S. Labor Market

The [macroeconomic](/macroeconomics) perspective on the labor market can be challenging to capture, yet a couple of data points can give investors, financial specialists, and policymakers a thought of its wellbeing. The first is unemployment. During times of economic stress, the demand for labor lags behind supply, driving unemployment up. High rates of unemployment compound economic stagnation, add to social commotion, and deny large numbers of individuals of the opportunity to lead satisfying lives.

In the U.S. unemployment was around 4% to 5% before [the Great Recession](/great-recession), when large numbers of organizations failed, many individuals lost their homes, and demand for goods and services — and the labor to deliver them — plunged. Unemployment came to 10% in 2009 yet declined pretty much consistently to 3.5% in February 2020. In any case, in excess of 6 million individuals recorded unemployment claims in a single week in April 2020; that number dropped to somewhat more than 1 million individuals in the week ending Aug. 1, 2020, as indicated by the U.S. Department of Labor.

[Labor productivity](/labor-productivity) is one more important check of the labor market and more extensive economic wellbeing, measuring the output created each hour of labor. Productivity has ascended in numerous economies, the U.S. included, due to headways in technology and different improvements in productivity.

In the U.S., growth in output each hour has not converted into comparative growth in income each hour. Workers have been making more goods and services per unit of time, yet they have not been earning substantially more in compensation. An analysis of U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics data by the Economic Policy Institute showed that while net productivity rose 61.8% from 1979 to 2020, wages just became 17.5% (in the wake of adjusting for inflation).

## The Labor Market in Macroeconomic Theory

As per the macroeconomic theory, the way that wage growth lags productivity growth shows that the supply of labor has dominated demand. At the point when that occurs, there is descending pressure on wages, as workers seek a scant number of jobs and employers have their pick of the labor force.

On the other hand, on the off chance that demand dominates supply, there is up pressure on wages, as workers have seriously bargaining power and are bound to have the option to switch to a higher paying job, while employers must vie for scant labor.

A few factors can influence labor supply and demand. For instance, an increase in migration to a country can develop the labor supply and possibly push down wages, especially for unskilled jobs. An aging population can drain the supply of labor and possibly drive up wages.

However, these factors don't necessarily in every case have such direct outcomes. A country with an aging population will see demand for some goods and services decline, while demand for healthcare increases. Only one out of every odd worker who loses their job can essentially move into healthcare work, especially on the off chance that the jobs in demand are highly skilled and specific, like specialists and attendants. Thus, demand can surpass supply in certain sectors, even on the off chance that supply surpasses demand in the labor market as a whole.

Factors affecting supply and demand don't work in segregation, by the same token. If not for movement, the U.S. would be a lot more seasoned — and presumably less unique — society, so while a flood of unskilled workers could have applied descending pressure on wages, it probably offset declines in demand.

Different factors affecting contemporary labor markets, and the U.S. labor market, specifically, incorporate the threat of automation as computer programs gain the ability to do more complex undertakings; the effects of [globalization](/globalization) as enhanced communication and better vehicle joins permit work to be gotten across borders; the price, quality, and availability of education; and a whole exhibit of policies like the lowest pay permitted by law.

## The Labor Market in Microeconomic Theory

The microeconomic theory examines labor supply and demand at the level of the individual firm and worker. Supply — or the hours an employee will work — at first increases as wages increase. No workers will turn out deliberately for no good reason (unpaid assistants are, in theory, working to gain experience and increase their desirability to different employers), and more individuals will work for $20 an hour than $7 60 minutes.

Gains in supply might accelerate as wages increase, as the opportunity cost of not working extra hours develops. In any case, supply may then diminish at a certain wage level: The difference between $1,000 an hour and $1,050 is not really noticeable, and the highly paid worker who's given the option of working an extra hour or spending their money on relaxation activities might well opt for the last option.

Demand at the microeconomic level relies upon two factors: [marginal cost of production](/marginalcostofproduction) and [marginal revenue product](/marginal-revenue-product-mrp). If the marginal cost of hiring an extra employee, or having existing employees work more hours, surpasses the marginal revenue product, it will cut into earnings, and the firm would hypothetically dismiss that option. Assuming that the inverse is true, it seems OK to take on more labor.

Neoclassical microeconomic hypotheses of labor supply and demand have received analysis on certain fronts. Most hostile is the assumption of ["rational" choice](/rational-decision theory) — boosting money while limiting work — which to pundits isn't just critical however not generally upheld by the evidence. Homo sapiens, not at all like [Homo economicus](/homoeconomicus), may have a wide range of inspirations for settling on specific decisions. The presence of certain callings in artistic expression and nonprofit sector sabotages the idea of boosting utility. Protectors of neoclassical theory counter that their expectations might have minimal bearing on a given individual however are helpful while taking large numbers of workers in aggregate.

## The Bottom Line

The labor market is an economic term for the availability and price employment. Like different markets, the price for labor is largely determined by supply and demand, albeit the labor market is additionally vigorously regulated in numerous countries.

## FAQ
### How Does a Minimum Wage Affect the Labor Market?
The effects of a [minimum wage](/minimum_wage) on the labor market and the more extensive economy are dubious. Classical economics and numerous financial specialists recommend that a lowest pay permitted by law, as other [price controls](/price-controls), can reduce the availability of low-wage jobs. Then again, a few financial experts say that a lowest pay permitted by law can increase consumer spending, in this manner raising overall productivity and leading to a net gain in employment.
### How Does Immigration Affect the Labor Market?
The effects of migration are hard to measure exactly, due to the size and complexity of the modern economy. The classical model of economics predicts that high levels of movement might make wages fall due to an increased supply of labor. Notwithstanding, a few studies recommend a more convoluted picture. A few studies recommend that migration can likewise decidedly affect aggregate demand, depending on the range of abilities of the fresh debuts. Since new workers are likewise consumers, the research found that migration can increase the demand for labor as well as the supply.
### How Does the Government Calculate the Unemployment Rate?
The Bureau of Labor Statistics orders a month to month employment report, in light of a survey of around 60,000 representative families in the United States. Data from the survey are utilized to estimate the employment figures for the whole country. The unemployment rate depends on the percentage of individuals who are not employed yet actively searching for a job, as a percentage of the total labor force. The people who have no job and are done looking are excluded from the unemployment rate.
