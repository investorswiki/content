# Indicative Match Price
## What Is the Indicative Match Price?

In the securities market, the indicative match price is the price at which the maximum [volume](/volume) of orders can be executed at the time of an auction. In the event that at least two prices can amplify executable volume or, all in all, there are numerous indicative match prices, the auction happens at the last sale price. The indicative match price works with price discovery and transparency while aiding resolve [order imbalances](/order-imbalance).

## Understanding Indicative Match Price

The indicative match price addresses the best price at which the best number of buy and sell orders can be traded during the applicable [auction](/auction). Stock exchanges will hold a few auctions each trading day. For instance, the [New York Stock Exchange](/nyse) (NYSE) holds open and closing auctions. The NYSE American holds three single-price auctions each trading day: the early open auction, core open auction, and closing auction.

These auctions empower participants to participate in real-time [price discovery](/pricediscovery), which is the cycle for setting the current price of a security. An order imbalance (otherwise called auction imbalance) will happen on the off chance that there are too numerous buyers or sellers for a particular security on a trading exchange. This imbalance prevents the matching of orders from buyers and sellers. Since the indicative match price is the best price that the maximum number of shares could be traded on a security, it addresses an important snippet of information for settling the imbalance.

As part of the auction cycle, the exchange will compute and distribute auction imbalance information to participants. This information could incorporate the indicative match price, total imbalance, market imbalance, matched volume, and auction collar. Utilizing this data, traders will then have the opportunity to change their trades to match up buy and sell orders.

The indicative match price can be understood by considering a closing auction scenario. In this case, assuming that there is no order imbalance, all [market-on-close](/marketonclose) (MOC) orders are executed at the indicative match price. In the event that an order imbalance exists, the maximum MOC orders are executed in light of time priority.

> The imbalance information distributed by an exchange right before [the close](/close) may impact how a stock trades throughout the course of recent minutes of the day. The price might go up or down right before the finish of the trading session to offset the imbalance.

## Instances of Indicative Match Price

The accompanying speculative models demonstrate the concept of indicative match price for XYZ Company stock on the [NYSE Arca](/nyse-arca) exchange.

### Model 1: No Order Imbalance
- [Market order](/marketorder) to buy 2,500 shares of XYZ Company
- Market order to sell 1,000 shares
- Limit order to sell 500 shares at $25.50
- Limit order to sell 1,000 shares at $25.75
- Indicative match price = $25.75

This price will be distributed by NYSE Arca, which will likewise show a matched volume of 2,500 shares without an imbalance.

### Model 2: Order Imbalance
- Market order to buy 10,000 shares of XYZ Company
- [Limit order](/limitorder) to sell 3,000 shares at $26
- Market order to sell 1,000 shares
- Limit order to sell 2,000 shares at $26.25
- Indicative match price = $26.25

This price will be distributed by NYSE Arca, which will likewise show a volume of 10,000 shares and a total imbalance of 4,000 shares.

## Special Considerations

While the indicative match price gives valuable information that can assist with settling order imbalances, it doesn't explain to traders why an imbalance is happening. Imbalances can happen on the off chance that a major news event impacts the fortunes of a company, which is then reflected in the price of its shares. For instance, a poor [earnings report](/earningsreport) or the announcement of a startling merger or [acquisition](/acquisition) could surely be the reason for an imbalance of orders.

An especially large or long-lasting imbalance might really bring about ending or postponing the trading of shares until the imbalance is settled. At times, a [designated market maker](/designated-market-maker-dmm) will respond by buying or selling shares depending on the situation to get out excess orders and keep up with [liquidity](/liquidity) in the market.
