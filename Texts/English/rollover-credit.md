# Rollover Credit
## What Is a Rollover Credit?

A rollover credit is a net payment of interest received by a forex trader who holds a long position on a [currency pair](/currencypair) overnight when the [long](/long) currency pays a higher rate on interest than the [short](/short) currency in the pair.

A [overnight position](/overnight-position) in FX is one that doesn't close around the same time and is as yet open starting around 5 p.m. EST. At 5:00 pm, the trader's account either pays out or earns interest on each position relying upon the two currencies' underlying interest rates.

## Understanding a Rollover Credit

       An unfamiliar exchange (FX) trader receives a rollover credit when they hold a [open position](/vacant position) in a currency trade due to the difference in the interest rates of the two currencies. Assuming that the interest rate on the currency pair held on the long side of the trade is greater than that of the interest rate on the short side currency, the trader will receive a rollover credit in light of the difference in the interest rates associated with the currency pair.

In forex, a [rollover](/rollover) means that a position stretches out past the finish of the trading day without being [sold to close](/selltoclose). Rollovers can result in one or the other credits or debits to the trader's accounts, contingent upon which side of the trade they are holding long (bought) overnight.

      [Forex](/forex) (FX) trades include borrowing in one country's currency to purchase another country's currency, generally at the interest rates set by the central banks who issue those currencies. For trades held overnight, the seller of a currency will owe interest to the buyer of the currency at the settlement of the trade.

Note that most positions are turned over consistently until they close out or settle. Since FX markets trade 24 hours per day, five days out of every week, they randomly picked 5 p.m. EST to be the close of a trading day. In this way, any trade staying open between 5:00 p.m. furthermore, 5:01 p.m. is subject to a rollover credit or debit. The FX market handles ends of the week by adding two extra days worth of rollover adds up to the trades held open by 5 p.m. Wednesday. Extra rollovers likewise ordinarily happen two business days before major occasions.

## How Rollover Credits Occur

Trades between two currencies with various interest rates and moderately stable exchange rates are known as [carry trades](/currencycarrytrade), where traders hope to harvest a surge of rollover credits that exceed any expected losses from vacillations in exchange rates. Assuming interest rates are similar on the two currencies, the net rollover on the two sides of the trade will cancel out. Nonetheless, where rates vary, the trader will earn either a credit or a debit on the currency pair trade rollover.

- Traders selling or having a short position in the lower-interest rate currency would pay the holder of the long position currency in the event that its rate was higher.
- Should the interest rate of the long currency drop and become not exactly the short currency, the trader would owe the difference in the rates to the short position holder.

Brokers naturally apply rollover credits or debits to traders' accounts. A few investors exploit this part of FX trading and try to increase their returns by earning interest with rollover credits.

## Illustration of a Rollover Credit

An investor hoping to bring in money through a rollover credit would search for a currency pair where the interest rate on the currency that trader holds is higher than the rate on the currency on the opposite finish of the trade.

For instance, a trader purchasing [USD/JPY](/usd-jpy-us-dollar-japanese-yen-currency-pair) would buy U.S. dollars (USD) and sell Japanese yen (JPY). If the U.S. dollar's interest rate was 2% and the yen's interest rate 0.5%, the trader would receive [pro-rata](/pro-rata) interest every day equivalent to a 1.5 percent annual percentage rate.
