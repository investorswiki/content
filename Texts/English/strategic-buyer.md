# Strategic Buyer
## What Is a Strategic Buyer?

A strategic buyer is a company that [acquires](/acquisition) one more company in a similar industry to capture [synergies](/synergy). The strategic buyer accepts that the two companies combined will be more prominent than the amount of their separate individual parts and intends to incorporate the purchased entity for long-term [value](/value) creation.

Since a strategic buyer hopes to get more value out of an acquisition than its [intrinsic value](/intrinsicvalue), it can as a rule pay a [premium](/premium) price to close the deal.

## How a Strategic Buyer Works

As the name suggests, strategic buyers purchase companies that they feel fit strategically with what they currently own. A [target company](/targetfirm) is normally either a competitor in a similar industry as the buyer, or a company with complementary credits in another comparable industry. The "procedure" part comes into play whenever the acquirer sees an opportunity to expand [product lines](/product-line) in a similar market, branch out into new districts, secure extra [distribution channels](/distribution-channel), or generally support [operational efficiencies](/operationalefficiency).

Assume a food manufacturer that has made handled foods for a really long time needs to kick off a work to offer organic products. It becomes a strategic buyer when it obtains an organic food company to serve a similar market.

Post-acquisition, the combined company won't just benefit from this [top-line](/topline) synergy, however it will make production and distribution collaborations also by expanding [factory utilization](/capacityutilizationrate) rates and utilizing similar channels to deliver products to customers.

All through the cost structure of the combined firm, overlapping costs can be taken out, for example, an excess factory or office space and outer services. With opportunities to increase total [sales](/deal) and upgrade [productivity](/productivity) simultaneously, the strategic buyer stands a decent chance of transforming two plus two into five.

> The value-creation from these combinations will for the most part be found in sales cooperative energies in the beginning phases â€” different collaborations generally take more time to come to completion.

## Analysis of Strategic Buyers

A strategic buyer frequently generates a large portion of cost savings by [laying off](/cutback) workers. At the point when two companies operating in a similar market combine, a great deal of positions start to overlap or pack, passing on an employees surplus to requirements.

For example, there is no requirement for two [chief financial officers](/cfo) (CFOs), selling and [marketing](/marketing) staff can be diminished, and a layer of mid-level management is presently excessive. Excusing these staff seems OK for the strategic buyer, assisting them with managing costs and lift proficiency, however not every person is so understanding.

Concerns over potential job losses can spark outcry from the public, [trade unions](/trade guild), and the government. Negative publicity could wind up harming the company's reputation. In a few rare cases, it might even lead to the acquisition being rejected, particularly on the off chance that the strategic buyer is a foreign one with the bulk of its operations found abroad.

## Illustration of a Strategic Buyer

In 2017, Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN) stood out as truly newsworthy when it bought staple chain Whole Foods for $13.7 billion. Amazon was a strategic buyer with two major goals: instant and expansive penetration into the basic food item business, and a network of [brick-and-mortar](/brickandmortar) areas that serve a large number of similar types of customers who shop online at Amazon.

One of Amazon's most memorable missions was to support Whole Foods' [revenues](/revenue) by making the organic merchant's products "reasonable for everybody." Amazon burned through no time making some meaningful difference, offering its subscriber base discounts in stores and free two-hour deliveries.

Up to this point, price cuts and other new services haven't converted into Amazon taking a critical piece of basic food item [market share](/marketshare) from industry goliaths Walmart Inc. (WMT) and Kroger Co. (KR). It's worth recalling, however, that this is a long-term project and one, similar to whatever other major acquisition, that will undoubtedly experience a few developing torments. The new venture is as yet a work in progress and immediate achievement wasn't expected to be accomplished overnight.

One more illustration of a strategic buyer is T-Mobile's acquisition of rival Sprint in 2020. The deal between America's third-and fourth-largest remote transporters at the time was valued at $26.5 billion, and the combined company covers around 127 million customers, according to **The Wall Street Journal**. The telecom companies demonstrate that the merger has made a much "fiercer competitor" to AT&T Inc. (T) and Verizon Communications Inc. (VZ).

## Strategic Buyer versus Financial Buyer

Acquirers are frequently depicted as either being strategic or [financial buyers](/financial-buyer). Dissimilar to the former, a financial buyer's goal is to buy businesses for as little as could be expected, with the hope of selling them at a profit five or a decade down the road. The [sector](/sector) the target operates in isn't really important and stakes adequately big to be powerful are normally preferred over full-scale [takeovers](/takeover).

Financial buyers search for potential deals that can be improved and eventually net their investors a good return. Frequently they will be keen on what [cash flow](/cashflow) the investment will create, as well as the sort of [exit strategies](/exitstrategy) it will offer from now on.
