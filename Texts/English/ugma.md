## What is the Uniform Gift to Minors Act?
The Uniform Gift to Minors Act (UGMA) contains state laws in the United States that license the gifting of securities and money to minors. Once conceded, the property turns into the minor's [asset](/assets) and gets certain special tax benefits. A custodian controls the assets until the child arrives at the age of majority. The individual who gifts the assets to the child may likewise act as the custodian for the account.
## More profound definition
Initially established in 1956, the purpose of the UGMA was to make a simple method for passing assets to minors without setting up a trust fund or include an attorney in the transaction.
Custodians for UGMA assets have a legal responsibility to manage the assets capably. Minors take on obligation of the account when they arrive at the stated legal age. For certain states, this is 18 years old, however in others it is 21 or 25.
The custodian might utilize the assets to purchase securities in the interest of the minor. However long the transaction benefits the minor, the custodian can make withdrawals from the account. On the off chance that the giver bites the dust before the minor arrives at the age of majority, the UGMA assets become part of the benefactor's estate.
The [Uniform Transfers To Minors Act](/utma) (UTMA) is a connected law adopted by most states that fulfills Internal Revenue Service (IRS) [gift tax](/gifttax) rules for conceding up to $14,000 in assets tax free. This law broadens the UGMA by permitting gifts of land and other property.
