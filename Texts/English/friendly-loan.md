## What Is a Friendly Loan?

A friendly loan is a financial agreement between partners. This type of financing is a friendly loan in light of the fact that the deal is normally made between friends, family, or colleagues. These types of loan agreements are rarely legally archived, and expectations are normally verbally agreed upon.

## How a Friendly Loan Works

Friendly loans are the most common type of loan agreement, whether it be among friends, family, or work partners. As a rule, inability to repay such loans can't be legally tested, as most friendly loans are made with sincere intentions between closely associated parties. These loans are likewise not reported to any [credit bureaus](/creditbureau) and don't ponder one's credit score.

A personal contact could request a friendly loan as a method for beating the interest rates that financial institutions charge. This should be visible as a benefit for the two players as the borrower can access funding at a discount, and the lender gains an investment opportunity. In any case, any interest collected by a lender in a friendly loan will probably should be reported to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) as [imputed interest](/imputedinterest) for tax purposes.

At the point when a friendly loan is offered and agreed upon, it could incorporate a formal [promissory note](/promissorynote) or loan agreement documentation of the transaction. A promissory note would act as a legal record of the amount borrowed and the terms. It would likewise state that the borrower would pay back the amount borrowed.

The terms might be more nitty gritty with a formal loan agreement, characterizing the loan as secured or unsecured. A friendly loan that is secured means there is some form of [collateral](/collateral) the borrower agreed would be given up assuming they default on the loan. An unsecured friendly loan would lack such collateral, yet on the off chance that the borrower defaults and the two players consent to a formal loan arrangement, it very well may be the basis for legal procedures to recover the debt from the borrower.

## Special Considerations

Friendly loans can appear as cash conceded to a borrower. This might happen when somebody bound to be approved by a bank or financial establishment applies for a line of credit and afterward gives those funds to a relative or companion who could never have been approved. One situation in which this may be done is the point at which a companion dispatches a business venture. In such a case, the person who gets the funding and afterward loans it out is responsible for paying back the bank or establishment â€” regardless of whether the companion or relative pay back the loan.
