# Collusion
## What is collusion?
Collusion is an agreement, either formal or informal, among contending firms to fix prices for goods or services. The goal of collusion is to deflect new contestants from entering a market or to gain the upper hand in a market. Regardless, collusion disturbs the laws of supply and demand and unbalances markets.
## More profound definition
Collusion is most frequently found in markets where there are a couple of dealers. At the point when a small number of organizations are engaged with collusion, it is more straightforward to monitor and control outputs. However not common, collusion might happen when there is a huge number of merchants yet one prevailing gathering of critical dealers, facing numerous lesser venders who control just a part of the market.
The more normalized a product or service is, or the more it is seen as a necessity, the simpler it is for intriguing firms to set a brought together pricing strategy. Pricing is a lot simpler to control as companies might find it a lot harder to form a collusion in light of different factors like quality, design, highlights, or even service.
Without appropriate regulation, collusion can have adverse effects that upset markets, and clients are forced to buy goods or services at higher prices. New firms are discouraged from entering the market via cartels. Innovation might become compromised since the plotting firms can undoubtedly create gains without investing a lot of energy.
**Formal collusion**, otherwise called oligopoly, frequently prompts the formation of cartels. A couple of firms in the market might plot to set the cost or the production levels for a given product or service to increase their profits. Hence, the cost for the product or service is higher than the equilibrium price and total output declines. At the point when a cartel become sufficiently strong, it might hoard an industry and expand the profits every member procures.
**Unsaid collusion** is otherwise called informal collusion. It happens while contending firms settle on informal agreements without talking about it. This typically ends up evading detection.
**Price leadership collusion** happens when an additional prevailing firm sets the prices, otherwise called parallel pricing. For the less prevailing yet contending organizations to gain stability, they will take part in deceitful behavior by selling the goods or services at the set prices. The predominant firm sets the prices so that its profits are augmented. This may not really be the case with lesser companies.

## Collusion model
During the 1950s, General Electric, Westinghouse, Allis-Chalmers and different manufacturers plotted to lay out a famous price-fixing scheme for heavy equipment, for example, turbines and electrical transmission gear. Corporate executives would meet periodically to organize their offers for contracts with electric utility companies, industrial corporations and contractors. At these secret gatherings, the executives agreed to pivot their offers and camouflage collusion: one corporation would quote the low price, others would quote intermediate prices and another would quote the high price. Their positions would turn, and each would know the specific price it and each and every other litigant corporation would quote in fixed offers for contracts.
The Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) loosened up the scheme. While inspecting its records, the TVA found that for a three-year period, 47 manufacturers had been submitting indistinguishable offers for different undertakings. Almost 50 corporate executives were found liable in the collusion scheme, and nine carried out jail punishments.
