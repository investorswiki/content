A ULC is treated as a standard Canadian corporation for tax purposes. In that capacity, it's subject to Canada's 25% withholding tax on the payment of shareholders dividends and interests (however the Canada Revenue Agency permits this to be reduced by considering the [dividend](/dividend) a distribution of capital). Notwithstanding, the U.S. Internal Revenue Code states that the ULC is dismissed as a corporation for U.S. tax purposes, as profits and losses flow through to shareholders — it doesn't pay corporate tax, as such.

So like U.S. partnerships and other flow-through elements, a ULC dodges the issue of double taxation, its primary advantage. Additionally, flowing through the company's losses can assist shareholders with offsetting their income, consequently diminishing their taxes. American shareholders might what's more at any point claim foreign tax credits on their tax returns, offsetting the Canadian withholding tax.

For businesses, one more benefit of shaping an unlimited liability subsidiary might be nondisclosure. Public reports on money the company travels through the ULC — or tax payment amounts — are not required.
