# Cash Commodity
## What Is a Cash Commodity?

A cash commodity is a substantial product to be delivered in exchange for payment and is seen most often with futures options. A contract for a cash commodity will determine the specific amount of the commodity as would be considered normal to be delivered, alongside the delivery date, and the price. Cash commodities can incorporate agricultural products, minerals, oil, and gold. Are treasury bond commodities? Indeed, they are.

Cash commodities are likewise now and again alluded to as actuals.

## Figuring out Cash Commodity

       A cash commodity is an unmistakable commodity for which a person or company has a utilization. Companies go into contracts for cash commodities since they are betting on, or [hedging](/support), the price for a commodity that they need.

For instance, a conspicuous wiener manufacturer might expect the price of pigs going up over the course of the next six months. To lock in a reasonable price on the meat they need for production, they might execute a [futures contract](/futurescontract).

With the futures contract, the frankfurter company consents to buy a certain number of pigs at a set cost at a foreordained date. This date might be, for instance, 90 days later. At that date, the company will receive a delivery of pigs in exchange for their payment commodities. The company was not guessing, since they were relying on the physical delivery of pigs, which they use in the production of their product.

> Contracts genuinely should plainly state whether a real cash commodity is expected for delivery at the contract's end or prior. This requirement is on the grounds that a few commodities and futures contracts are [cash-settled](/cash-settled-options), and that means that no physical goods change hands through the contract.

## Estimating and Hedging Cash Commodities

In cash-settled contracts, just money changes hands, as opposed to the genuine physical commodities. A contract would be cash-settled in the event that the purchaser of the commodities was a [speculator](/speculator) who was not really interested in having the physical commodity but rather has an interest in the price changes.

Speculators may just be interested in profiting by the change of the commodity's price. A speculator might buy a shipment of corn at a low price, for instance, and afterward sell it at a profit when the price of corn goes up. Using a broker, it is feasible for this investor never really to have physical possession of this shipment of corn.

In reality, our frankfurter company model and a speculator might purchase that equivalent part of pigs at similar cost simultaneously through a futures contract. Yet, on account of the speculator, that person doesn't really need 10 loads of pigs delivered to their door.

They are simply attempting to profit off of the change in prices that they expect in the price of pigs. Accordingly, this futures contract would be cash-settled, instead of settled through the cash commodity.
