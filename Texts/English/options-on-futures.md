# Options On Futures
## What Are Options On Futures?

An option on a [futures contract](/futurescontract) gives the holder the right, yet not the obligation, to buy or sell a specific futures contract at a strike price at the latest the option's [expiration date](/expirationdate). These work in basically the same manner to stock options, however differ in that the underlying security is a futures contract.

Most options on futures, for example, [index options](/indexoption), are [cash settled](/cash-settled-options). They likewise tend to be [European-style](/europeanoption) options, and that means that these options can't be exercised early.

## How Options On Futures Work

An option on a futures contract is very like a [stock option](/stockoption) in that it gives the buyer the right, yet not obligation, to buy or sell the underlying asset, while creating a potential obligation for the seller of the option to buy or sell the underlying asset assuming the buyer so desires by [exercising](/exercise) that option. That means the option on a futures contract, or futures option, is a [derivative](/derivative) security of a derivative security. In any case, the pricing and contract specifications of these options does not necessarily add leverage on top of leverage.

A [option](/option) on a S&P 500 futures contract, therefore, can be however of as a second derivative of the S&P 500 index since the futures are themselves derivatives of the index. Accordingly, there are more variables to consider as both the option and the futures contract have expiration dates and their own [supply and demand](/law-of-supply-demand) profiles. Time decay (otherwise called [theta](/theta)), works on options futures the same as options on other securities, so traders must account for this dynamic.

For call options on futures, the holder of the option would enter into the long side of the contract and would buy the [underlying asset](/underlying-asset) at the option's [strike price](/strikeprice). For put options, the holder of the option would enter into the short side of the contract and would sell the underlying asset at the option's strike price.

## Example of Options on Futures

As an example of how these option contracts work, first consider a S&P 500 futures contract. The most prominently traded S&P 500 contract is called the E-mini S&P 500, and it permits a buyer to control an amount of cash worth 50 times the value of the S&P 500 Index. So on the off chance that the value of the index were to be $3,000, this e-mini contract would control the value of $150,000 in cash. On the off chance that the value of the index increased by one percent to $3030, the controlled cash would be worth $151,500. The difference here would be a $1,500 increase. Since the margin requirements to trade this futures contract are $6,300 (as of this composition), this increase would amount to a 25% gain.

Yet rather than tie up $6,300 in cash, buying an option on the index would be altogether less expensive. For example, when the index is priced at $3,000, suppose likewise that an option with the strike price of $3,010 may be quoted at $17.00 with two weeks before expiration. A buyer of this option would have no need to put up the $6,300 in margin maintenance, however would just have to pay the option price. This price is $50 times every dollar spent (the same multiplier as the index). That means the price of the option is $850 plus commissions and fees, around 85% less money tied up compared to the futures contract.

So albeit the option moves with the same degree of leverage ($50 for every $1 of the index), the leverage in the amount of cash used might be altogether greater. Were the index to rise to $3030 in a single day, as mentioned in a previous example, the price of the option could rise from $17.00, to $32.00. This would suggest an increase of $750 in value, less than the gain on the futures contract alone, yet compared to the $850 risked, it would represent a 88% increase instead of a 25% increase for the same amount of movement on the underlying index. Along these lines, depending on which option strike you buy, the money traded might possibly be leveraged to a greater extent than with the futures alone.

## Further Considerations for Options on Futures

As mentioned, there are many moving parts to consider when esteeming an option on a futures contract. One of them is the [fair value](/fairvalue) of the futures contract compared to cash or the [spot price](/spotprice) of the underlying asset. The difference is called the [premium](/premium) on the futures contract.

However, options permit the owner to control a large amount of the underlying asset with a smaller amount of money because of superior [margin](/margin) rules (known as [SPAN margin](/spanmargin)). This provides extra leverage and profit potential. Yet, with the potential for profit comes the potential for loss up to the full amount of the options contract purchased.

The key difference between [futures](/futures) and stock options is the change in underlying value represented by changes in the stock option price. A $1 change in a stock option is equivalent to $1 (per share), which is uniform for all stocks. Utilizing the example of e-mini S&P 500 futures, a $1 change in price is worth $50 for each contract bought. This amount isn't uniform for all futures and futures options markets. It is profoundly dependent on the amount of the [commodity](/commodity), index, or bond defined by each futures contract, and the specifications of that contract.

## Features
- Options on futures work much the same way to options on other securities (like stocks), yet they tend to be cash settled and of European style, meaning no early exercise.
- The key details for options on futures are the contract specifications for both the option contract and the underlying futures contract.
- Futures options can be considered a 'second derivative' and require the trader to pay attention to detail.
