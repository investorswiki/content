Since policies like life insurance, [health insurance](/healthinsurance), and different [annuities](/annuity) might be in effect for extended periods of time, valuation reserves safeguard the insurance company from losses from investments that may not perform true to form. This guarantees that the policyholders are paid for claims and that annuity holders receive income even assuming an insurance company's assets lose value.

## Understanding a Valuation Reserve

Insurance companies receive [premiums](/insurance-premium) for the services they give. In return, when a client records an insurance [claim](/insurance_claim) that should be paid out, an insurance company must guarantee that it has money close by to respect this request.

The very applies to any annuities that an insurance company issues. It must guarantee that it can meet the normal payments of an annuity. Hence it is critical for an insurance company to monitor its reserves and investments so it remains [solvent](/solvency). Valuation reserves help insurance companies do this.

Valuation reserves ensure that an insurance company holds an adequate number of assets to cover any risks that emerge from the contracts it has [underwritten](/guaranteeing). Regulators are centered around utilizing [risk-based capital requirements](/risk-based-capital-prerequisite) to measure the solvency levels of insurance companies, which is a perspective on a company's assets versus its obligations separately instead of its assets versus its liabilities together.

## History of Valuation Reserves

Valuation reserve requirements have changed throughout the long term. Before 1992, a mandatory securities valuation reserve was required by the [National Association of Insurance Commissioners](/nainsurancec) to safeguard against a decline in the value of the securities an insurance company holds.

After 1992, notwithstanding, the mandatory securities valuation reserve requirements were changed to incorporate a [asset valuation reserve](/asset-valuation-reserve-avr) and an interest maintenance reserve. This mirrored the idea of the insurance business, with companies holding various categories of assets and customers purchasing greater annuity-related products.

## Changing Valuation Reserve Requirements

Yet the market for insurance and annuity products had been shifting during the 1980s. The [American Council of Life Insurers](/american-council-of-life-insurance) reported that in 1980, life insurance addressed 51% of reserves held by companies while reserves held for individual annuities represented just 8%. Then, by 1990, reserves for life insurance tumbled to 29% of all reserves while the percentage held for individual annuities scaled to 23%. This mirrored the growth in the notoriety of retirement plans that were administered by insurance companies.

A changing [interest rate](/interestrate) climate can make risk that effects reserves required for progressing annuity payments more than for life insurance benefits that are paid in one lump sum. By prescribing changing regulations to separate asset valuation reserves from interest maintenance reserves, the National Association of Insurance Commissioners recognized the need to safeguard against vacillations in the value of equity and credit-related [capital gains](/capitalgain) and losses uniquely in contrast to interest-related gains and losses.
