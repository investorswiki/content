# Net Foreign Assets (NFA)
## What Are Net Foreign Assets (NFA)?

Net foreign assets (NFA) decide if a country is a creditor or debtor nation by measuring the difference in its outside [assets](/resource) and liabilities. NFA allude to the value of overseas assets owned by a nation, minus the value of its domestic assets that are owned by foreigners, adjusted for changes in valuation and [exchange rates](/exchangerate).

A nation's NFA position is likewise defined as the cumulative change in its [current account](/currentaccount), which is the sum of the [balance of trade](/bot), net income over the long haul, and net current exchanges after some time.

## Grasping Net Foreign Assets (NFA)

The NFA position shows whether the nation is a net [creditor](/creditor) or debtor to the remainder of the world. A positive NFA balance means that it is a net lender, while a negative NFA balance shows that it is a [net borrower](/net-borrower).

An alternative definition of "net foreign assets" from [the World Bank](/worldbank) is that it is the sum of foreign assets held by monetary specialists and deposit money banks, less their foreign [liabilities](/liability).

Relating a nation's NFA position to a cumulative change in its current account is thoughtfully straightforward since an element's debt position anytime is the sum total of its past borrowing and lending activity. In the event that a substance's borrowings total $500, however it has lent out $1,500, it is a net creditor in the amount of $1,000.

Moreover, on the off chance that a nation runs a [current account deficit](/currentaccountdeficit) of, say, $10 billion, it needs to borrow that amount from foreign sources to finance the [shortfall](/shortfall). In this case, borrowing $10 billion would increase its foreign liability and reduce its NFA position by that amount.

## Valuations and Exchange Rates Effect on Net Foreign Assets (NFA)

Notwithstanding the current account position, [valuation](/valuation) and exchange rate changes ought to be considered to get a true image of the NFA position. For instance, foreign governments hold trillions of dollars in U.S. [government bonds](/government-bond). Assuming interest rates rise and U.S. government bonds decline in price, this would diminish the overall value of these nation's U.S. government bond holdings, and their NFA, too.

Exchange rate vacillations can likewise altogether affect the NFA position. Appreciation of a nation's [currency](/currency) against that of different nations will diminish the value of both foreign currency-designated assets and liabilities, while depreciation will increase the value of these overseas assets and liabilities. Subsequently, in the event that the nation is a net debtor, [currency depreciation](/currency-depreciation) will increase its foreign currency debt burden.

The NFA position itself can drive changes in exchange rates since persistent current account [deficits](/deficit) can demonstrate unreasonable over the long run. Currencies of nations with a fundamentally negative NFA position and developing current account deficits can go under attack from currency [speculators](/examiner), who might try to drive it lower.
