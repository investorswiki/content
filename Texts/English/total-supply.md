# Total Supply
Total supply alludes to the number of coins or tokens that presently exists and are either in circulation or locked in some way. The sum of coins were at that point mined (or issued) minus the total of coins that were burned or annihilated.
Subsequently, the total supply incorporates both the [circulating supply](/circulating-supply) and the coins that are yet to stir things up around town market. For example, coins that are being held under a lockup or vesting period, which normally follows a [private sale](/private-sale) or Initial Coin Offering (ICO) event.
Coins or tokens that are eventually burned are excluded from the total supply. This means that when Binance plays out its quarterly coin burn events, the total supply of BNB is decreased for eternity.

### Total Supply versus Circulating Supply
As opposed to the total supply, the circulating supply alludes to all coins that are as of now circulating and accessible for trading in the different [cryptocurrency](/cryptocurrency) markets. The circulating supply alludes to the coins that are as of now in the hands of the public and, thusly, does exclude coins or tokens that are locked up or being held in reserve.
Since the market prices of a cryptocurrency coin can't be straightforwardly impacted by the part of the supply that is locked or reserved, the calculation of market capitalization typically considers just the circulating supply rather than the total supply.

### Total Supply versus Max Supply
While the total supply incorporates all coins that were at that point [mined](/mining) (or issued) minus the ones that were burned, the max supply alludes to all coins that will at any point appear. Dissimilar to the total supply, the max supply incorporates the coins that are yet to be mined (from now on), alongside the ones that are part of the total supply and furthermore the ones that were burned.
According to a cryptoeconomics point of view, many coins are important due to their inherent scarcity. For instance, Bitcoin and other mineable coins are created each time another block is approved by a miner (and confirmed by the remainder of the network). In any case, the generation of new coins is definitely not a boundless cycle as a large portion of the mineable digital forms of money have a cap (max supply) that limits the number of coins that can be produced. The max supply is generally defined at the moment the [genesis block](/genesis-block) is made.
