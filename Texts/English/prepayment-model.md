# Prepayment Model
## What Is a Prepayment Model?

In lending, a prepayment model is utilized to estimate the level of prepayments on a loan portfolio that will happen in a set period of time, given potential changes in interest rates. [Prepayment ](/prepayment)is the settlement of a debt or part of a debt before its official due date. It can either be made for the whole balance or for an impending installment, regardless, the payment is made in advance of the borrower's authoritatively committed date.

Prepayment models depend on mathematical conditions and generally include the analysis of historical prepayment trends to foresee what will occur from here on out. Prepayment models are much of the time used to value [mortgage pools](/mortgage_pool) like [GNMA](/ginniemae) securities or other securitized debt products, including mortgage-backed securities (MBS).

## How a Prepayment Model Works

Prepayment models start with a zero [prepayment](/prepaymentrisk) assumption, a baseline scenario utilized in financial modeling. In this model, a borrower or borrowers make no early debt payments. It gives a point of comparison to more perplexing prepayment models and permits an analyst to look at the effects of different factors on valuation without prepayment risk.

One essential prepayment model is steady percent prepayment (CPP), which is an annualized estimate of mortgage loan prepayments, registered by increasing the average month to month prepayment rate by 12. This is utilized to decide cash flow in structured finance transactions, frequently alluded to as the secondary mortgage market. It models the risk of unscheduled return of principal, which influences fixed income returns. A consistent prepayment is just one of several types of prepayment models that are utilized to assist with computing loan estimates and returns.

While prepayments and prepayment models can be applied to kind of debt or liability, they are normally utilized with [mortgages](/first_mortgage) and mortgage-backed securities. As [interest rates](/interestrate) rise, prepayment models factor in less prepayments since individuals are generally not interested in trading their current mortgage for one with a higher interest rate and regularly scheduled payment. On the off chance that interest rates fall, the contrary effect is represented, as additional individuals will [refinance](/refinance) their loans with an end goal to close out their existing mortgage for one with a lower interest rate and regularly scheduled payment. The prepayment phenomenon is more articulated in the mortgage space than in different loans, for example, vehicle loans or consumer loans is on the grounds that the principal of this loan is large, the tenure is long and the law made it that there is no prepayment punishments. Accordingly, the profile of this loan makes prepayment through refinancing or borrower's own money worth the work.

Increased refinancing of loans brings about the existing mortgages inside the pools being paid off before the anticipated maturity date of the loan. These prepayments eventually reduce the continuous mortgage payments being made into the mortgage pools, decreasing the flood of payments made out to investors.

## Real World Example of a Prepayment Model

One of the most striking prepayment models is the Public Securities Association ([PSA](/psa)) Prepayment Model planned by the [Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association](/sifma) (SIFMA) in 1985. (The Public Securities Association was the trailblazer of SIFMA. The prepayment model is as yet alluded to by the association's original name. The model additionally is in some cases called the Bond Market Association PSA, in reference to one more association that merged with SIFMA in 2006.)

The PSA model expects expanding prepayment rates for the initial 30 months and afterward steady prepayment rates a while later. The standard model, which is additionally alluded to as 100% PSA or 100 PSA, accepts that prepayment rates will increase by 0.2% for the initial 30 months until they top at 6% in month 30.

Strikingly, 150% PSA would expect to be 0.3% (1.5 x 0.2%) increases to a pinnacle of 9%, and 200% PSA would expect to be 0.4% (2 x 0.2%) increases to a pinnacle of a 12% prepayment rate.
