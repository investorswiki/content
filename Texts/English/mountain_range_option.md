# Mountain Range Options
## What Are Mountain Range Options?

Mountain range options are a family of [exotic options](/exoticoption) in light of various underlying [securities](/security). Mountain range options were first marketed by French securities firm Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale in 1998. These options blend a portion of the key qualities of [basket-style](/baskettrade) or [rainbow options](/rainbowoption) — the two of which have more than one underlying security or asset — and range options with long term time ranges.

## Understanding Mountain Range Options

[Options](/option) are derivatives. Their values depend on the value of the [underlying asset](/underlying-asset) they address like stocks. With a [options contract](/optionscontract), the investor has the open door — yet not the commitment — to buy or sell the underlying asset prior to a predetermined date.

Trading generally happens [over-the-counter](/otc) (OTC) by [financial institutions](/financialinstitution) and private, [institutional investors](/institutionalinvestor). Mountain range options take highlights from both basket options and reach options — the former addresses a basket or group of assets, while the last option allows traders to benefit from the difference between the high and low level of the option. The performance of the underlying assets has a big impact in the payoff an investor receives.

The price of a mountain range option depends on various factors, the most important of which are the connections between's the individual securities in the [basket](/basket). A few options have discrete [payout](/payout) levels, like double the investment or triple the investment, if certain performance [metrics](/metrics) are hit by the underlying securities while the option is in effect.

Mountain range options can't be priced with standard shut structure draws near. These exotic instruments rather require [Monte Carlo simulation](/montecarlosimulation) methods. Effects, for example, [volatility skew](/volatility-skew), which is found in many options, can be even more articulated inside mountain range options.

Certain types of mountain range options have recalculation or sampling dates, at which the best-or most horrendously awful performing [stocks](/stock) from the basket are taken out. Therefore, options holders must continually reconsider the boundaries influencing their current or [present value](/presentvalue) (PV).

Given their esoteric nature, how might mountain go options be traded? A genuine model could incorporate a scenario when a hedger doesn't like to monitor different options written on individual assets. A basket option can give similar protection by covering several positions with a single [derivative](/derivative).

This approach's combined [volatility](/volatility) might be lower than the net volatility of individual assets, thereby bringing about an otherwise lower option price, which can be exorbitant for a rather sophisticated position. These highlights assisted make mountain with going options an appealing option for traders seeking a sensibly priced strategy requiring negligible capital guarantees.
