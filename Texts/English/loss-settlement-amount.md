# Loss Settlement Amount
## What is Loss Settlement Amount?

Loss settlement amount is a term used to signify the amount of a property insurance settlement, whether real estate or personal property. The loss settlement amount generally relies upon which type of loss cost settlement option a policyholder has agreed to in their [homeowner's insurance](/homeowners-insurance) policy.

## How Loss Settlement Amount Works

The loss settlement amount is the funds that an insurance company pays out to the homeowner in the event of a homeowner's insurance claim. On account of homeowner's insurance, homeowners are commonly required to carry insurance that will cover somewhere around 80% of the replacement value of their home.

Be that as it may, the loss settlement amount might be not exactly the amount of full coverage on the off chance that the 80% coinsurance requirement isn't met.

Each homeowner's insurance policy contains a loss-settlement provision that subtleties how a claim will be paid. This provision applies to the replacement cost payment for both the dwelling and the personal property.

Tragically, the provision might permit the insurance company to postpone full payment of the claim by paying just the **actual cash value** of the loss, and in certain occurrences, forego full payment out and out on the grounds that the insured doesn't have adequate funds to repair or supplant.

## Instances of Loss Settlement Amount Options

The three loss settlement options are [actual cash value](/genuine cash-value), [replacement cost](/replacementcost), and [agreed value](/agreed-amount-statement). Genuine cash value (ACV) typically conveys less expensive charges than replacement cost, which is the reason many individuals end up with his type of loss cost settlement option. For a vehicle, ACV would be defined as "honest evaluation" or the cost for another vehicle minus depreciation.

For instance, on the off chance that a vehicle was $20,000 brand new, and a policyholder added up to it subsequent to claiming it for a couple of years, they wouldn't get the full $20,000, yet rather a lower amount, maybe just $10,000 or even less relying upon how old it is.

Replacement cost coverage, then again, is an unrivaled loss cost settlement option for homeowners. Albeit more costly, it will pay whatever is important to supplant your harmed property with property of a like kind and condition, up to the policy limits.

The agreed value loss cost settlement option is regularly held for unique things, or things of high worth where the value won't be quickly assessed. For instance, on the off chance that you are safeguarding a rare coin or a costly painting, you and the insurance company should settle on what the thing is worth at the time the policy is written, which is what you will be paid in the event that it is obliterated. Frequently an independent appraisal will fulfill this requirement.
