# Return-on-Capital Gain
## DEFINITION of Return-on-Capital Gain

A return-on-capital gain is a return that one gets from an increase in the value of a capital asset (investment or real estate). The-return-on-[capital gain](/capitalgain) is the measure of the investment gain for an asset holder, relative to the cost at which an asset was purchased. All the more explicitly, return-on-capital gains are a measure of return-on-realized gains, after consideration for any taxes paid, [commissions](/commission) or interest.

How capital gains are [distributed](/distribution-cascade) is an alternate question, be that as it may.

## BREAKING DOWN Return-on-Capital Gain

Return-on capital-gains are measured on [realized gains](/realizedprofit) recognized from the sale or maturity of an investment asset, net of costs. For instance, selling a stock for $10, which was purchased for $5, while accounting for a total of $2.50 in commissions and applicable taxes, would liken to a half return-on-capital gain. Other investment measurements will generally measure returns of [unrealized gains](/unrealizedgain), which is the reason some might like to utilize return-on-capital gains all things being equal.

The formula for computing a return on capital gains can be communicated as follows:

(Capital gain/Base price of investment) x 100

The return is communicated as a percentage to show the yield on the original investment. A return-on-capital gain can be utilized to show the rate that wealth derived from the sale or maturity of assets increases. For instance, the percentage is some of the time used to demonstrate the pace at which personal holdings develop as assets are sold or become mature relative to the growth of the economy. The calculation can be utilized to evaluate the performance of an asset as it matures or the owner considers making a sale in the current market.

## Implications of a Return on Capital Gains

The return can likewise be utilized to show the disparity of the wealth gap, as the yield from asset maturity and sales heighten all the more exponentially for the people who hold the best amount of wealth compared with individuals from lower asset brackets.

For example, a wealthy individual could see a return-on-capital gain of 5 percent on the capital assets in their estate, while the overall economy could experience a growth rate of just 3 percent. This can additionally broaden the distance between those whose income and assets are tied all the more straightforwardly to the economy - specifically, salaried workers and lower-income households. In the mean time, the people who hold capital assets that can develop at a more accelerated pace through maturity and sales and could see their estates compound in value, no matter what the cycles that influence the overall development of the economy.
