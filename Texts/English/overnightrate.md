# Overnight Rate
## What Is the Overnight Rate?

The overnight rate is the interest rate at which a [depository](/depository) institution (generally banks) loans or borrows funds from one more depository institution in the overnight market. In numerous countries, the overnight rate is the interest rate the central bank sets to target monetary policy. By and large, the overnight rate is the lowest accessible interest rate, and in that capacity, it is simply accessible to the most trustworthy institutions.

## How the Overnight Rate Works

The amount of money a bank has varies daily in view of its lending activities and its customers' withdrawal and deposit activity. A bank might experience a shortage or surplus of cash toward the finish of the [business day](/business-day).

Those banks that experience a surplus frequently loan money overnight to banks that experience a shortage of funds in order to keep up with their [reserve requirements](/requiredreserves). The requirements guarantee that the banking system stays stable and liquid.

The overnight rate gives an efficient method to banks to access short-term financing from central bank depositories. As the overnight rate is impacted by the central bank of a nation, it tends to be utilized as a decent predictor for the movement of short-term interest rates for consumers in the more extensive economy. The higher the overnight rate, the more costly it is to borrow money.

> As of May 2022, the Federal Funds rate sits at a rate of 0.77%; an increase from the previous month's rate of 0.33%.

In the United States, the overnight rate is alluded to as the [federal funds rate](/federalfundsrate), while in Canada, it is known as the policy interest rate. The rate increases when [liquidity](/liquidity) diminishes (when loans are more hard to get a hold of) and falls when liquidity increases (when loans are all the more promptly accessible). Subsequently, the overnight rate is a decent indicator of the soundness of a country's overall economy and banking system.

## FAQ
### Is the Bank Rate the Same as the Overnight Rate?
No, the bank rate and the overnight rate are not something very similar. The bank rate is otherwise called the discount rate, which is the rate that banks can borrow from the central bank. The overnight rate, otherwise called the federal funds rate, is the rate at which banks can borrow from each other.
### For what reason Do Banks Borrow Overnight?
Banks are required by the central bank to keep a base amount of reserves to guarantee liquidity in the banking sector. The reserves of banks change contingent upon customer withdrawals and deposits. At the point when banks have a shortfall and can't meet their reserve requirement, they will borrow from banks with a surplus to do as such.
### How Does the Overnight Rate Affect the Prime Rate?
At the point when the overnight rate is increased by the central bank, it turns out to be more costly for banks to borrow money from each other, expanding their total cost. To compensate for this increase in costs, banks increase their prime rates, which makes borrowing money for customers more costly. Basically, banks pass the increased cost onto the consumer.
