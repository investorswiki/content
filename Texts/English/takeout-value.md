# Takeout Value
## What Is Takeout Value?

Takeout value is a company's estimated value if it somehow managed to be taken [private](/going-private) or acquired. Different financial metrics are applied to determine how much the company could go for, including cash flows, assets, earnings, and [multiples](/multiple) used in comparable takeovers.

The current [mergers and acquisitions](/mergersandacquisitions) (M&A) environment can likewise affect the takeout value of a company.

## Understanding Takeout Value

[Acquisitions](/acquisition) are a common occurrence, offering companies one of the quickest ways of expanding into new markets, get new technology, reduce costs, and secure a stranglehold over the competition. However, assuming command over another company requires a ton of due diligence. Aside from ascertaining whether a [target company](/targetfirm) would represent a solid match, it is likewise pivotal to determine a fair price and not overpay.

A decent starting point is to establish how much the target and its [assets](/asset) are worth by examining the cash it generates and is likely to churn out from now on â€” both under the current regime and if it is acquired. This valuation can then be cross-referenced with the target's [market value](/marketvalue): the price that investors are presently able to pay for it.

With this data within reach, the prospective [acquirer](/acquirer) will then need to resolve the amount it will likely need to offer to get a deal over the line. The goal here is to pay as little as possible while additionally fulfilling the demands of [shareholders](/shareholder) in the target company and making the acquisition worth their while.

The takeout value is used by financial analysts to determine a range of possible price levels for takeover bids and by shareholders to estimate the return they could receive on the off chance that their shares are acquired. Acquirers typically pay a [acquisition premium](/acquisitionpremium) to close a deal and avoid competition, despite the fact that, depending on the circumstances, it is likewise possible in some cases to get a discount, securing the target for less than its [fair market value](/fairmarketvalue) (FMV).

## Example of Takeout Value

Takeout valuation uses the metrics of the target company and compares them to multiples used in comparative [takeover](/takeover) transactions. Let's use hypothetical companies ABC and XYZ as an example. ABC initiated a takeover of company XYZ, which has [earnings](/earnings) of $5 million, for an acquisition price of $22.5 million, The implied earnings multiple is therefore 4.5 ($22.5 million/$5 million).

A comparative company, DEF, with earnings of $3 million is currently being considered as a possible takeover target. The takeout value of the new company would be $13.5 million utilizing the same multiple ($3 million \u00d7 4.5).

Of course, earnings aren't the just [metric](/metrics) taken into account. An investor or obtaining company may and probably will use a range of different acquisition valuation gauges to determine a bid.

> ### Important
> There is certainly not an exact formula for takeout valuation since a variety of metrics, like [EBITDA](/ebitda) multiples, [P/E ratio](/price-earningsratio), and, surprisingly, firm-specific data can be taken into consideration.

After the market closed, a [investment bank](/investmentbank) may publish a note estimating a possible takeout value. Involving the acquisitions of comparable companies in the previous 24 months, analysts at the bank estimate a possible takeout price in the range of $35 to $45 per share.
