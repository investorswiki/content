# A Priori Probability
## What Is a Priori Probability?

A priori likelihood alludes to the probability of an event happening when there is a finite amount of outcomes and each is similarly liable to happen. The outcomes in a priori likelihood are not impacted by the prior outcome. Or on the other hand, put another way, any outcomes to date won't give you an edge in foreseeing future outcomes. A coin throw is generally used to make sense of a priori likelihood. The likelihood of ending with heads or tails is half with each coin throw whether or not you have a run of heads or tails. The biggest drawback to this method of characterizing probabilities is that it must be applied to a finite set of events as most real-world events we care about are subject to [conditional probability](/conditional_probability) somewhat at any rate. A priori likelihood is likewise alluded to as classical likelihood.

## Figuring out A Priori Probability

A priori likelihood is to a great extent a hypothetical structure for probabilities that can be compelled to a small number of outcomes. The formula for computing a priori likelihood is exceptionally direct:

A Priori Probability = Desired Outcome(s)/The Total Number of Outcomes

So the a priori likelihood of rolling a six on a six-sided kick the bucket is one (the ideal outcome of six) separated by six. So you have a 16% chance of rolling a six and precisely the same chance with some other number you pick on the dice. A priori probabilities can be stacked inside the outcome set, of course, so your chances of rolling an even number on a similar bite the dust increments to half essentially on the grounds that there are more wanted outcomes.

## Real World Example of A Priori Probability

A regular illustration of a priori likelihood is your chances of scoring a numbers-based sweepstakes. The formula for working out the likelihood turns out to be significantly more complex as your chances depend on the combination of numbers on the ticket being randomly chosen aligned correctly, you can buy various tickets with numerous number combinations. All things considered, there are a finite selection of combinations that will bring about a success. Tragically, the number of potential outcomes predominates the number of wanted outcomes â€” your specific set of tickets. The likelihood of winning the great prize in a lottery like the Powerball Lottery in the U.S. are one of every many millions. Besides, the chances of winning the fantastic prize solely (not splitting) go down as the pot goes up and more individuals play.

## A Priori Probability and Finance

The application of a priori likelihood to finance is limited. Outside of deterring individuals from putting their financial destiny in the hands of the lottery, most outcomes that individuals in finance care about don't have a finite number of outcomes. You can't say that a stock's price has three potential outcomes of going up, down, or remaining flat when these outcomes are impacted by a scope of outside factors that change the probability of every outcome.

In finance, individuals all the more usually utilize empirical or [subjective probability](/subjective_probability) rather than classical likelihood. In empirical likelihood, you take a gander at past data to find out about what future outcomes will be. In subjective likelihood, you overlay your very own experiences and viewpoints over the data to settle on a decision that is unique to you. On the off chance that a stock has been on a tear for three days in the wake of outflanking [analysts'](/examiner) suggestions, an investor may sensibly anticipate that it should proceed with in light of the recent price action. In any case, another investor might see a similar [price action](/price-action) and recall that [consolidation](/consolidation) followed a lofty rise in this stock a long time back, taking the contrary message from similar price data. Depending on the market, the two investors could be not any more accurate than a prediction by means of a priori likelihood, yet we rest easier thinking about choices we can legitimize with some logic past random chance at any rate.

## Features
- A priori likewise eliminates independent users of experience. Since the outcomes are random and noncontingent, you can't reason the next outcome.
- A priori likelihood specifies that the outcome of the next event isn't contingent on the outcome of the previous event.
- A genuine illustration of this is during a coin throw. Regardless of what was flipped prior or the number of flips that have happened, the chances are consistently half since there are different sides.
