This permitted bonds with a maturity greater than a decade to be partitioned into separate principal and coupon payments, which could be traded as separate securities. The next year, the Treasury laid out a facility for re-comprising principal and coupon payments into the original securities.

As the new securities proved famous on the market, qualification was gradually expanded. In 1997, the program was expanded from just the 10-year and 30-year securities to all Treasury notes and bonds. In 2000, it was expanded to incorporate 5-year notes that had previously been ineligible.
