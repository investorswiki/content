## What Is an Investment Center?

An investment center is a business unit in a firm that can use capital to contribute straightforwardly to a company's profitability. You might compare and difference a few equals like the terms "profit center" or "cost center."

Companies evaluate the performance of an investment center as per the [revenues](/revenue) it acquires through investments in [capital assets](/capitalasset) compared to the overall expenses.

An investment center is some of the time called an investment division.

## Understanding Investment Centers

The different departmental units inside a company are classified as either generating profits or running expenses. Organizational departments are classified into three unique units: [cost center](/cost-center), [profit center](/profitcentre), and investment center. A cost center spotlights on limiting costs and is assessed by how much expenses it causes.

Instances of departments that make up the cost center are the human resource and marketing departments. A profit center is evaluated on the amount of profit that is created and endeavors to increase profits by expanding sales or diminishing costs. Units that fall under a profit center incorporate the manufacturing and sales department. Notwithstanding departments, profit and cost centers can be divisions, projects, groups, [subsidiary](/subsidiary) companies, production lines, or machines.

An investment center is a center that is responsible for its own revenues, expenses, and [assets](/resource) and deals with its own [financial statements](/financial-statements) which are ordinarily a [balance sheet](/balancesheet) and a [income statement](/incomestatement). Since costs, revenue, and assets must be distinguished separately, an investment center would normally be a subsidiary company or a division.

One can characterize an investment center as an extension of the profit center where revenues and expenses are estimated. Be that as it may, just in an investment center are the assets employed additionally estimated and compared to the profit made.

## Investment Center versus Profit Center

Rather than seeing the amount of profit or expenses a unit possesses likewise with a firm's profit centers, the investment center spotlights on generating returns on the fixed assets or [working capital](/workingcapital) invested explicitly in the investment center.

Dissimilar to a profit center, an investment center could invest in activities and assets that are not really connected with the company's operations. It very well may be investments or [acquisitions](/obtaining) of different companies empowering diversification of the company's risk. A recent fad is the multiplication of venture arms inside laid out corporations to empower investments in the next wave of trends through gaining stakes in [startups](/startup).

In more straightforward terms, the performance of a department is dissected by looking at the assets and resources given to the department and how well it utilized those assets to produce revenues compared with its overall expenses. By zeroing in on [return on capital](/returnofcapital), the investment center philosophy gives a more accurate image of how much a division is adding to the economic prosperity of the company.

Utilizing this approach of measuring a department's performance, managers have understanding with regards to whether to increase capital to increase profits or whether to close down a department that is wastefully utilizing its invested capital. An investment center that can't earn a return on invested funds in excess of the cost of those funds is considered not economically profitable.

## Investment Center versus Cost Center

An investment center is unique in relation to a cost center, which doesn't straightforwardly add to the company's profit and is evaluated by the cost it causes to run its operations. Besides, dissimilar to a profit center, investment centers can use capital to purchase different assets.

Due to this complexity, companies need to utilize various metrics, including [return on investment](/returnoninvestment) (ROI), [residual income](/residualincome), and [economic value added](/eva) (EVA) to evaluate the performance of a department. For instance, a manager can compare the ROI to the cost of capital to evaluate a division's performance. Assuming the ROI is 9% and the cost of capital is 13%, the manager can reason that the investment center is dealing with its capital or assets ineffectively.
