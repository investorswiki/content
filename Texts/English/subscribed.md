## What Is Subscribed?

The term subscribed alludes to recently issued [securities](/security) that an investor concurs or plans to buy prior to the official issue date. At the point when investors buy in, they hope to possess the number of shares they assign once the offering is complete. This is common with institutional investors who are guaranteed shares by buying into a company's [initial public offering](/ipo) (IPO) before realizing the actual IPO price on the main day of trading.

## Understanding Subscribed

Private companies that need to raise capital can do as such by making an offering, like an IPO, by going to the market and selling shares. Companies hire [investment banks](/investmentbank) to act as underwriters and set the price for the offering. The bank's goal is to have the right number of subscribed investors for the issue. To be subscribed means that an investor either buys or consents to purchase a set number of [shares](/shares) during an offering.

Investors, like institutional investors, and accredited or high-net-worth people (HNWIs) can see a subscription and make orders to purchase destined to-be issued shares from their brokerage firms. These options are generally not available to [retail investors](/retailinvestor).

The investment bank attempts to determine the best [offering price](/offeringprice) that will bring about an optimal number of share subscriptions — too numerous subscriptions won't dazzle the responsible company, as the company is probably going to normally like a higher offering price. On the other hand, too couple of subscriptions might bring about the investment bank being unable to sell its whole inventory of the security issue, presenting it to critical losses.

## Special Considerations

An issue is considered [fully subscribed](/fullsubscribed) when it is subscribed at just the right amount. One more articulation now and again utilized for completely subscribed is the shoptalk term "[pot is clean](/pot)." But there are cases when demand is a lot higher and much lower than expected:

- **Oversubscribed**: This happens when demand for an IPO is greater than the number of shares issued. At the point when another security issue is [oversubscribed](/oversubscribed), the offering entity can adjust the price or offer more securities to mirror the high demand. To redress, companies can offer extra shares, raise the security's price, or offer a combination of the two to fulfill need and raise more capital simultaneously.
- **Undersubscribed**, then again, is a situation wherein the demand for an initial public offering of securities is not exactly the number of shares issued. This situation is otherwise called an "underbooking." [Undersubscribed](/undersubscribed) offerings are much of the time a question of overpricing the securities available to be purchased.

## Subscribed Deals and Prospectus Reports

The [prospectus](/prospectus) for another offering is an itemized document that potential investors study before buying into another issue. A formal legal document required by the [Securities and Exchange Commission](/sec) (SEC), the prospectus gives data about an investment offering available to be purchased to the public. This incorporates essential subtleties, like the name of the issuer, the amount and type of securities available to be purchased, and the number of available shares (for a stock offering).

The prospectus likewise gives other data, for example,

- Whether an offering is a public or [private placement](/privateplacement)
- Any underwriting charges
- The names of the company's administrators

An outline of the company's financial statements, the foundation of its management, a section wherein the management depicts the company's current state and future goals for growth (management discussion and analysis), and the risks section are likewise important.

A [preliminary prospectus](/preliminaryprospectus) is the principal document that a security issuer flows, which contains subtleties of the business and transaction being referred to. This is trailed by the [final prospectus](/finalprospectus), which accompanies foundation data (the exact number of shares or certificates issued and the exact offering price). The last prospectus is printed after the deal becomes effective.

## Stock Subscription Rights

Existing [shareholders](/shareholder) have certain rights available to them, especially with regards to secondary and subsequent offerings. These are called stock subscription rights. These rights furnish existing shareholders with an equivalent percentage of ownership when they buy into any new offerings and [issuances](/issue). Furthermore, it typically comes at or under market prices.

These rights are likewise alluded to as a shareholder's subscription privilege, preemptive right, or anti-dilution right. Yet, keep at the top of the priority list that any stock issued through subscription rights effectively builds the number of shares in the market. This means that shareholder ownership is [diluted](/dilution) similar to the value of each share.

## Illustration of Subscribed

Here is a hypothetical guide to show how subscriptions work. Suppose Company ABC will disclose 100 shares available in a forthcoming offering. The underwriter does its [due diligence](/duediligence) and sets a fair market price of $40 per share. The bank offers these shares up to investors costing that much and the investors consent to buy every one of the 100 shares. The offering for ABC is currently completely subscribed, as there are no excess shares to sell.

On the off chance that the underwriters priced the shares at $45 per share to make a higher [profit margin](/profitmargin), they might have just had the option to sell half of the shares. This would have left the stock undersubscribed. In that capacity, half of the stock would remain unpurchased and dependent upon a reoffering at a lower rate — say at $35 per share.

Assuming the underwriter initially priced the shares at $35 per share to [hedge](/hedge) their wagers (ensuring that all shares sold since they were priced forcefully), they would have shorted the ABC company $500 in this transaction or $5 per share. They would have likewise gambled making a bidding situation where a portion of their potential investors would be priced out of ABC's stock.

## The Bottom Line

Opening up to the world and giving new stock is a great way for private companies to collect the money required to fund their operations and accomplish the growth that they should find success. Companies hire investment banks to advance, guarantee, and connect new investors (and existing ones on account of subsequent offerings) to buy into the offering.

Being subscribed means that there is sufficient demand for the total number of shares available. Investors that decide to buy in ought to make it a point to peruse the fundamental subtleties listed on the prospectus given by the company to the SEC.
