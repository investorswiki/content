## What Is a Digital C-Type Print?

A digital C-type or chromogenic color print is any photographic print that has been created by a digital exposure system, rather than a traditional darkroom, or simple technique. A digital C-type print is developed by uncovering a light-delicate material to either LEDs or lasers, with the material then washed utilizing methods like traditional photography. The C represents chromogenic.

## Digital C-Type Print Explained

In a traditional darkroom or simple setting, an enlarger projects the picture of a photographic negative onto a sheet of photographic paper, while controlling focus, the intensity of the picture and the amount of time it is presented to light. An enlarger is an optical device, a photographic instrument that is like a slide projector.

The traditional darkroom process is unique in relation to a digital c-type or chromogenic print process. With digital c-type prints, the work typically finished by an enlarger is rather finished by a computer, with the technician controlling for similar factors: focus, intensity, and duration of light exposure. In this case, the paper is uncovered utilizing lasers or LEDs as opposed to with a traditional lightbulb. Driven represents light-discharging diode and is a source that emits a light when a current flows through it, rather than a standard bulb.

After the picture has been uncovered, whether by traditional means or digitally, the next step is generally something very similar. It actually includes what is called a wet chemical process. The paper that contains the picture is processed in a photographic engineer, then put through a bleach-fix, before at last being washed in water to eliminate the processing chemicals. The picture is then passed on to dry and can be scanned, cropped, altered and modified.

## Digital C-Type Print Differs From a Gicl\u00e9e print

A digital C-type or chromogenic print is a traditional picture or photographic print that has been produced using a digital file instead of a negative. A chromogenic print is here and there confused with a Gicl\u00e9e print, yet they are unique. A Gicl\u00e9e print is made without utilizing any chemistry or light sensitivity. This type of print combines shade based inks with high-quality archival-type paper that outcomes in an inkjet print of, particularly high quality.

## Digital C-Type Print Versus Inkjet Prints

Digital c-type prints vary from inkjet prints because inkjet prints utilize fine beads of ink instead of light sources, such as a laser. The machines utilized for digital C-type prints can be significantly more costly than inkjet printers and will quite often be utilized in commercial settings. The longevity of digital C-type prints is additionally estimated to be more limited than shade based printing, and the number of materials that can be printed with this process is more limited.

Different terms utilized for digital c-type print include photograph lab, digital C, laser chromogenic, digital RA-4, chemical color, lab print, or C-print.

## Real World Digital C-Type Print Example

Digital C-prints are photographic lab prints. They are produced by what is called minilabs. Common models include the Fuji Frontier, a high-end piece of machinery that seems to be a traditional computer printer yet is intended to make higher-quality prints. The 7700 series can produce up to 2,360 high-goal prints each hour and up to 620 8"X10" prints each hour. Different instances of processors with the capacity to produce high-end digital C-type prints include wide-design photograph printers like the LightJet or Lambda, which use papers such as Fuji Crystal Archive or Kodak Endura.

## Highlights
- With digital printing, the work done traditionally by an optical device called an enlarger, is rather finished by a computer.
- Digital C-type or chromogenic color print is a print that has been created digitally, rather than the traditional way.
- Once the picture has been projected onto a piece of paper, the paper is processed in a designer, then, at that point, bleach, then washed free of the processing chemicals.
