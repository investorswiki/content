## What Is a Zero Plus Tick?

A zero plus tick or zero [uptick](/uptick) is a security trade that is executed at a similar price as the previous trade however at a higher price than the last trade of an alternate price. For instance, in the event that a succession of trades happens at $10, $10.01, and $10.01 once more, the last option trade would be viewed as a zero plus tick, or zero uptick trade, since it is a similar price as the previous trade, however a higher price than the last trade at an alternate price.

The term zero plus tick or zero uptick can be applied to stocks, bonds, commodities, and other traded securities, however most frequently is utilized for listed equity securities. Something contrary to a zero plus tick is a zero minus tick.

## Figuring out a Zero Plus Tick

An uptick, and zero plus tick, means the price of a stock moved higher and afterward remained there, yet momentarily. It was consequently that, for over 70 years, there was an uptick rule as laid out by the U.S. [Securities and Exchange Commission](/sec) (SEC), which stated that stocks must be [shorted](/short) on an uptick or a zero plus tick, not on a [downtick](/downtick).

The uptick rule was expected to settle the market by preventing traders from weakening a stock's price by shorting it on a downtick. Prior to the implementation of the uptick rule, it was common for gatherings of traders to pool capital and sell short to drive down the price of a specific security. The goal of this was to cause a panic among shareholders, who might then sell their shares at a lower price. This manipulation of the market made securities decline even further in value.

It was believed that short selling on downticks might have prompted the stock market crash of 1929, following investigations into short selling that happened during the 1937 market break. The uptick rule was carried out in 1938 and lifted in 2007 after the SEC presumed that markets were advanced and orderly enough to not require the restriction. It is additionally accepted that the coming of decimalization on the major stock exchanges assisted with making the rule superfluous.

During the 2008 financial crisis, boundless calls for the reinstatement of the uptick rule drove the SEC to execute an alternative [uptick rule](/uptickrule) in 2010. That's what this rule stated assuming a stock dropped over 10% in a day, short selling would just be permitted on an uptick. When the 10% drop has been set off the alternate uptick rule stays in effect until the end of the day and the next day.

## Illustration of a Zero Plus Tick

Expect that Company ABC has a bid price of $273.36 and an offer of $273.37. Transactions have happened at both of these prices in the last second as the price holds there. A transaction happening at $273.37 is an uptick. Assuming another transaction happens at $273.37, that is a zero tick plus.

Generally speaking, this doesn't make any difference. Yet, say the stock has fallen by 10% from the [prior close price](/previousclose) at one point in the day. Then the upticks matter on the grounds that a trader could short assuming the price is on an uptick. Basically this means they can get filled on the [offer](/ask) side. They can't cross the market to eliminate liquidity off the [bid](/bid). This is per the alternative uptick rule laid out in 2010.
