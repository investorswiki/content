# FASIT
## What Was a FASIT?

The utilization of a financial asset securitization investment trust (FASIT) was for the securitization of non-mortgage debts with [short maturities](/shorttermdebt). Instances of these short maturity debts incorporate credit card receivables, vehicle loans, or personal loans.

Like real estate mortgage investment conduits (REMICs), which were made as part of the Small Business Job Protection Act of 1996, FASITs became attractive investment opportunities since they offered a high level of flexibility in securitizing short-term debts.

Notwithstanding, the ability to make and operate such trusts ended eight years some other time when provisions of the 1996 act that enabled these types of special purpose elements were revoked in 2004.

## Grasping a FASIT

Financial asset securitization investment trusts (FASITs) were presented as a way for financial organizations to mirror the [securitization](/securitization) benefits of real estate mortgage investment conduits, which were presented as part of the Tax Reform Act of 1986.

This form of securitization permitted financial organizations to make special-purpose vehicles for the pooling of mortgage loans. In the wake of pooling, the issuance of [mortgage-backed securities](/mbs) (MBS), secured by those loans, is sold. Like [collateralized mortgage obligations](/cmo) (CMOs), REMICs organized different mortgages into pools in light of risk to issue bonds or different securities, which could trade on secondary markets.

In any case, REMICs just permit securitization of mortgage-backed debt. Non-mortgage assets without collateral, for example, credit card debt or vehicle loans, are ineligible. FASITs, in any case, permitted the pooling of such debt so financial firms could issue asset-backed securities that could likewise trade on secondary markets.

With the death of the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004, FASITs were revoked.

## Enron Scandal Brings an End to FASITs

The Enron collapse of 2001, the biggest bankruptcy in American history until the [subprime](/subprime-implosion) financial crisis in 2007, is a widely known major accounting and auditing disappointment. The Enron disappointment is one justification behind the section of the [Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002](/sarbanesoxleyact), which has the goal of further developing reporting and regulatory compliance. This bankruptcy is likewise assembled with other high-profile scandals: Tyco and Worldcom.

One major factor recognized as a reason for Enron's bankruptcy was Enron's utilization of special purpose elements, like FASITs. Enron's utilization of financial asset securitization investment trusts (FASITs), as it were, bypassed traditional accounting shows. This evasion permitted the company to downplay its liabilities while exaggerating its earnings and assets.

For instance, Enron unveiled to shareholders that it had [hedged](/fence) downside risk in [illiquid](/illiquid) investments utilizing special purpose elements. Nonetheless, they didn't uncover that those elements incorporated Enron's own stock, so it didn't safeguard the company against downside risk.

As well as utilizing FASITs, Enron utilized an assortment of special purpose vehicles (SPVs) and real estate mortgage investment conduits (REMICs) in various arrangements to modify accounting passages as well as to misrepresent financial information. Enron constantly wouldn't give detail on its SPVs, which sometime later was clear concerning why. This is how things have been that have made reporting requirements more rigid.

The United States Congress Joint Committee on Taxation explored the scandal in 2003. The committee's report notes that FASIT rules "first enacted in 1996, are not widely utilized in the way imagined by the Congress and have failed to additional their intended purposes." That's what the report suggested "the abuse potential inherent in the FASIT vehicle far offsets any beneficial purpose that the FASIT rules might serve, and accordingly suggests that these rules be canceled."

Those nullifications were enacted when President George W. Bush marked the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004.
