## The Secondary Mortgage Market Enhancement Act and the 2007 Housing Market Crisis

The investment and loan prospects made by the Secondary Mortgage Market Enhancement Act at last contributed to the collapse in the U.S. housing market starting in 2007. This collapse was hastened by a confluence of factors, including mortgage-backed securities getting higher credit ratings from rating agencies than was justified by their holdings.

Mortgage-backed securities are made when a mortgage lender offers mortgages to a pool sponsor, who then, at that point, doles out them to a trustee. Investors buy certificates and receive payments created by the [mortgage pool](/mortgage_pool). The initial lender keeps on overhauling the pool's underlying mortgages and gathers regularly scheduled payments. The trustee pays a service fee to the lender in return for the proceeds, which then, at that point, get dispersed to investors.

Prior to the 2007 collapse, many mortgage-backed securities were pooled with lower-quality subprime mortgages. Rating institutions frequently gave these somewhat dangerous pools high ratings, which empowered high levels of investment. Simultaneously, lenders were offering loans to unqualified borrowers. Numerous borrowers wound up defaulting. The defaults eventually brought about the collapse of the secondary mortgage market, which had a ripple effect in the overall economy.
