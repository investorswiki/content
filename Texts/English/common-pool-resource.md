## Illustration of a CPR

Assume a fishery can reasonably yield 100,000 pounds of fish yearly â€” that is, the core population of the fishery every year creates 100,000 pounds. Ten companies consent to harvest 10,000 each. Without any regulation, each company would harvest more than its apportioned quota to sell more fish and gain more profits to the detriment of others. Assuming each company over-harvests by 1,000 pounds, the fishery will be over-harvested by 10,000 pounds, lessening the core fish population and its ability to create a similar level next year, leading to steady [depletion](/depletion). Perceiving that it is in their long-term interest to support the fish population, however, the companies settle on an agreement to stick with their 10,000 quotas and hire an independent [third party](/outsider transaction) to supervise that the agreement is carried out by each.
