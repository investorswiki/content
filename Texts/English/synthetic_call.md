# Synthetic Call
## What is a Synthetic Call?

A synthetic call is an options strategy that utilizations stock shares and put option to reenact the performance of a call option. This gives the investor a theoretically unlimited growth potential with a specific limit to the amount risked.

## How a Synthetic Call Works

A synthetic call, likewise alluded to as a synthetic long call, starts with an investor buying a holding shares. The investor likewise purchases a [at-the-money](/atthemoney) put option on a similar stock to safeguard against depreciation in the stock's price. Most investors think this strategy can be thought of as like an insurance policy against the stock dropping sharply during the duration that they hold the shares.

A synthetic call is otherwise called a married put or protective put. The synthetic call is a bullish strategy utilized when the investor is worried about potential close term vulnerabilities in the stock. By possessing the stock with a protective [put option](/putoption), the investor actually gets the benefits of stock ownership, for example, getting dividends and holding the right to vote. Interestingly, just claiming a [call option](/calloption), while similarly as bullish as possessing the stock, doesn't give similar benefits of stock ownership.

Both a synthetic call and a long call have a similar unlimited profit potential since there is no ceiling on the price appreciation of the [underlying](/underlying) stock. In any case, profit is dependably lower than it would be simply by claiming the stock. An investor's profit diminishes by the cost or [premium](/option-premium) of the put option purchased. Thusly, one ranges breakeven for the strategy when the underlying stock ascents by the amount of the options premium paid. Anything over that amount is profit.

The benefit is from a floor which is currently under the stock. The floor limits any [downside risk](/downsiderisk) to the difference between the price of the underlying stock at the hour of the purchase of the synthetic call and the [strike price](/strikeprice). Put another way, at the hour of the purchase of the option, on the off chance that the underlying stock traded definitively at the strike price, the loss for the strategy is capped at the very price paid for the option.

## When to Use a Synthetic Call

As opposed to a profit-production strategy, a synthetic call is a capital-protecting strategy. To be sure, the cost of the put portion of the approach turns into an inherent cost. The option's cost decreases the profitability of the approach, expecting the underlying stock moves higher, the ideal bearing. In this way, investors ought to involve a synthetic call as an insurance policy against close term vulnerability in an in any case [bullish](/bull) stock, or as protection against an unexpected price [breakdown](/breakdown).

Fresher investors might benefit from realizing that their losses in the stock market are limited. This security net can give them confidence as they dive deeper into various investing strategies. Of course, any protection includes some significant downfalls, which incorporates the price of the [option](/option), [commissions](/commission), and potentially different fees.
