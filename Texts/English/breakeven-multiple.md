# Breakeven Multiple
Breakeven Multiple is the value by which the current price of a [coin](/coin) or asset should be increased by to arrive at its Breakeven Point (BEP). The Breakeven Point is the initial acquisition cost paid by a trader or investor (counting trading fees). Thusly, when the market price of an asset drops below the price paid, the trader would require it to rise again to break even, so they can close their situations without gains or losses.
For instance, assuming that a trader purchases a coin at a market price of $10 per unit, and afterward it falls to $5, he would require that coin value to double (100% increase) to return to its initial purchase price. In this case, the breakeven various would be 2.
Sometimes, the Breakeven Multiple may likewise allude to the numerous by which a cryptocurrency (or some other asset) necessities to rise to arrive at its previous [All-Time High](/all-time-high) (ATH). For instance, we should envision that a cryptocurrency ATH was $1,000, however it is presently being traded for $250 (75% drop). In this case, the breakeven different is 4 since it necessities to experience a 4-overlay gain (300% increase) to arrive at its pinnacle price again.
Note that the breakeven numerous isn't a percentage, yet all at once an absolute number. Assuming we think about the drop percentage of the previous model (75%), the price of that asset would have to increase 300% (4x) to reach $1,000 again.
The breakeven numerous can be effectively calculated by isolating the initial price (ATH or buying price) by the current market price:
x = Initial Price/Current Price
Taking into account our previous model, we would have the accompanying equation:
x = 1000/250 = 4
The concept of Breakeven Multiple delineates that the percentage required to recuperate after a drop is a lot higher than the percentage of the drop itself. This means that an increase of 75% isn't sufficient to break even after a diminishing of 75%. That is the justification for why numerous traders utilize stop-limit orders to keep away from big losses - especially during [bear markets](/bearmarket) that usually present long periods of [capitulation](/capitulation) or panic selling.
