# Supply Curve
## What Is a Supply Curve?

The supply curve is a graphic representation of the correlation between the cost of a decent or service and the [quantity supplied](/quantitysupplied) for a given period. In a normal illustration, the price will show up on the left vertical hub, while the quantity supplied will show up on the horizontal pivot.

## How a Supply Curve Works

The supply curve will move up from left to right, which communicates the [law of supply](/lawofsupply): As the price of a given commodity increases, the quantity supplied increases (all else being equivalent).

Note that this definition suggests that price is the independent variable, and quantity the dependent variable. In many disciplines, the independent variable shows up on the horizontal or x-pivot, yet economics is an exception to this rule.

In the event that a factor other than price or quantity changes, another supply curve should be drawn. For instance, say that some new soybean farmers enter the market, clearing backwoods and expanding the amount of land dedicated to soybean development. In this scenario, more soybeans will be delivered even assuming the price continues as before, implying that the supply curve itself shifts to the right (S~2~) in the graph below. All in all, supply will increase.

> Technology is a leading reason for supply curve shifts.

Different factors can shift the supply curve too, for example, a change in the [price of production](/production-cost). On the off chance that a dry spell makes water prices spike, the curve will shift to one side (S~3~). On the off chance that the price of a [substitute](/substitute) — according to the provider's point of view —, for example, corn increases, farmers will shift to developing that all things considered, and the supply of soybeans will diminish (S~3)~.

On the off chance that another technology, for example, an irritation safe seed, increases yields, the supply curve will shift right (S~2~). In the event that the [future price](/fates) of soybeans is higher than the current price, the supply will briefly shift to one side (S~3~), since producers have an incentive to hold on to sell.

## Supply Curve Example

Should the price of soybeans rise, farmers will have an incentive to plant not so much corn but rather more soybeans, and the all out quantity of soybeans on the market will increase.

The degree to which rising prices convert into rising quantity is called supply elasticity or price elasticity of supply. In the event that a half rise in soybean prices causes the number of soybeans created to rise by half, the supply elasticity of soybeans is 1.

Then again, on the off chance that a half rise in soybean prices just increases the quantity supplied by 10 percent, the supply elasticity is 0.2. The supply curve is shallower (nearer to horizontal) for products with more versatile supply and more extreme (nearer to vertical) for products with less flexible supply.

## Special Considerations

The wording encompassing supply can befuddle. "Quantity" or "quantity supplied" alludes to the amount of the great or service, for example, lots of soybeans, bushels of tomatoes, accessible lodgings, or hours of labor. In regular use, this may be called the "supply," however in economic theory, "supply" alludes to the curve displayed above, meaning the relationship between quantity supplied and price per unit.

Different factors can likewise cause changes in the supply curve, like technology. Any advances that increase production and make it more efficient can make a shift the right in the supply curve. Additionally, market expectations and the number of sellers (or competition) can influence the curve also.

## What Is the Law of Supply and Demand?

The[ law of supply and demand](/law-of-supply-demand) is an economics concept by which the price of a kindness come to a [equilibrium](/equilibrium) in light of the amount of that great accessible (the supply) and customers' desired amount (the demand).

## What Is the Demand Curve?

The [demand curve](/demand-curve) is the supplement to the supply curve, in the law of supply and demand. Dissimilar to the supply curve, the demand curve is descending slanting, since the higher the price of a decent, the less demand there will be for it, all else equivalent.

## What Factors Can Affect the Supply Curve?

The supply curve can shift in view of several factors remembering changes for production costs (e.g., raw materials and labor costs), mechanical progress, the level of competition and number of sellers/producers, and the regulatory and tax environment.

## What Factors Can Affect the Demand Curve?

Demand is affected by the amount of [disposable income](/disposableincome) accessible to consumers alongside consumer inclinations. The presence of suitable [substitutes](/substitute) or alternatives can likewise shift the demand curve.

## Features
- The supply curve is shallower (nearer to horizontal) for products with more flexible supply and more extreme (nearer to vertical) for products with less versatile supply.
- On most supply curves, as the price of a decent increases, the quantity of goods supplied likewise increases.
- Supply curves can frequently show on the off chance that a commodity will experience a price increase or decline in light of demand, and vice versa.
- The supply curve, alongside the demand curve, are the key parts of the law of supply and demand.
