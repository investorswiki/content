## What Is an Insurance Claim?

An insurance claim is a formal request by a policyholder to an insurance company for coverage or compensation for a covered loss or policy event. The insurance company approves the claim (or denies the claim). Assuming it is approved, the insurance company will issue payment to the insured or an approved closely involved individual for the benefit of the insured.

Insurance claims cover everything from death benefits on life insurance policies to standard and far reaching medical exams. At times, a third-party can file claims for the insured person. Be that as it may, in the majority of cases, just the person(s) listed on the policy is qualified for claim payments.

## How an Insurance Claim Works

A paid insurance claim serves to [indemnify](/reimbursement) a policyholder against financial loss. An individual or group pays premiums as consideration for the completion of an insurance contract between the insured party and an insurance carrier. The most common insurance claims include costs for medical goods and services, physical damage, loss of life, liability for the ownership of abodes (homeowners, landowners, and tenants), and liability coming about because of the operation of automobiles.

Canine nibbles, slip-and-fall personal injury claims, water damage, and shape can all act as signs of future liability for an insurer. These things will quite often adversely affect your rates and on your insurer's readiness to keep giving coverage. Shockingly, speeding tickets may not cause a rate climb by any means.

The equivalent goes for a minor automobile accident or a small claim against your property holder's insurance policy.
