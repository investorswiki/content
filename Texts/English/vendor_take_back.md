## Vendor Take-Back Mortgage versus Traditional Mortgage

A vendor take-back mortgage most frequently happens related to a traditional mortgage, in which a homebuyer vows her home to the bank as collateral for the loan. The bank then, at that point, has a claim on the house should the home buyer default on the mortgage. On account of a [foreclosure](/foreclosure), the bank can remove the home's tenants and sell the house, utilizing the income from the sale to clear the mortgage debt, as can the seller or second lienholder on account of a vendor take-back mortgage.

The most common form of traditional mortgage is the fixed-rate mortgage, in which the borrower pays the equivalent [interest rate](/interestrate) for the life of the loan. Most fixed-rate mortgages have between a 10-year and 30-year term, during which the borrower's payment, including interest, won't change in the event that market interest rates rise. The borrower could possibly secure a lower rate by refinancing the mortgage in the event that market interest rates drop fundamentally after the hour of purchase.

Several factors can influence your interest rate on a traditional mortgage, from your credit history to the amount of a down payment you put down to where your property is found. Moreover, several factors will influence the interest rate you'll pay on a vendor take-back mortgage, including the amount of a loan you're requesting that the seller carry. The rate will frequently be higher when the seller's mortgage is the second lien on the property, compensating him for the risk he's taking.
