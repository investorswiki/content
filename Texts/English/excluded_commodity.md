# Excluded Commodity
## What Is an Excluded Commodity?

An excluded commodity is a [commodity](/commodity) that, as per the [Commodity Exchange Act](/cea) (CEA), doesn't fall under the regulations of the CEA. To qualify as an excluded commodity, the asset being referred to must not have any intrinsic cash value and must not be traded on an exchange like a [stock market](/stockmarket).

[Derivatives](/subsidiary) qualify as excluded commodities on the grounds that their value is dependent on variances in different assets. For example, [futures](/futures) contracts rely upon the price variances of physical commodities like oil or grain, while [interest rate swaps](/interestrateswap) rely upon changes in [interest rates](/interestrate).

## Figuring out Excluded Commodities

The CEA is a piece of federal legislation, first presented in 1936, which laid out the U.S. [Commodity Futures Trading Commission](/cftc) (CFTC). As its name proposes, its purpose is to lay out rules and regulations for commodities trading in the U.S. The CEA characterizes "excluded commodities" as financial assets that don't have any intrinsic or cash value outside of the underlying assets they allude to.

One of the principal objectives of this regulatory system is to forestall the undue [manipulation](/manipulation) of commodities prices by market participants. Consequently, the act recognizes three categories of commodities, every one of which receives various levels of regulatory oversight.

"Rural commodities," or basically "commodities", for example, are goods like oil, wheat, or livestock, against which futures contracts are written. These commodities receive the full weight of regulatory oversight by the CFTC.

## Excluded versus Exempt Commodities

[Exempt commodities](/exempt_commodity), which are defined as any commodity that isn't generally distinguished in the CEA. Instances of exempt commodities incorporate energy and metals, like copper and steel. These commodities fall outside the scope of the CEA, albeit separate laws and regulations exist that disallow outright loaded or manipulation.

As stated above, futures contracts and different derivatives are instances of excluded commodities. These assets are exempt from the regulations determined in the CEA, situated in part on the assumption that they are less helpless against manipulation than physical and finite assets, like oil and grain.

## Certifiable Example of an Excluded Commodity

The entry of the [Commodity Futures Modernization Act](/cfma) (CFMA) in 2000 overhauled national commodity futures regulations. As per the CFMA, excluded commodities can incorporate any of the accompanying instruments:

- An interest rate, exchange rate, currency, security, security index, credit risk or measure, debt or equity instrument, index or measure of [inflation](/inflation), or other [macroeconomic](/macroeconomics) index or measure.
- Some other rate, differential, index, or measure of economic risk, return, or value that is (1) not situated in that frame of mind on the value of a narrow group of commodities not depicted above or (2) dependent exclusively upon at least one commodities that have no cash market.
- Any economic or commercial index in light of prices, rates, values, or levels that are not inside the control of any party to the applicable contract, agreement, or transaction.
- An occurrence, degree of an occurrence, or contingency (other than a change in the price, rate, value, or level of a commodity not portrayed over) that is (1) past the control of the parties to the significant contract, agreement, or transaction and (2) associated with a financial, commercial, or economic outcome.

## Features
- An excluded commodity is one that falls outside of the regulatory domain of the Commodities Exchange Act (CEA).
- Excluded commodities are dared to be less helpless against price manipulation and other undue impacts, as compared to commodities like wheat or oil.
- Instances of excluded commodities incorporate futures contracts and different commodities derivatives.
