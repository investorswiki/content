# Quote Currency
## What Is a Quote Currency?

In [foreign exchange](/foreign-exchange) (forex), the quote currency, ordinarily known as the [counter currency](/counter-currency), is the second currency in both a direct and indirect [currency pair](/currencypair) and is utilized to decide the value of the base currency.

In a [direct quote](/directquote), the quote currency is the foreign currency, while in a [indirect quote](/indirectquote), the quote currency is the domestic currency. The quote currency is listed after the base currency in the pair when currency exchange rates are quoted. One can decide the amount of the quote currency they need to sell to purchase one unit of the first or [base currency](/basecurrency).

## Figuring out Quote Currency

Understanding the quotation and pricing structure of currencies is essential for anybody needing to trade currencies in the [forex](/forex) market. Market producers will more often than not trade specific currency pairs in set ways, either direct or indirect, and that means understanding the quote currency is vital.

A currency pair's exchange rate reflects the amount of the quote currency is required to have been sold/purchased to buy/sell one unit of the base currency. As the rate in a currency pair builds, the value of the quote currency is falling, whether the pair is direct or indirect.

For instance, the cross rate between the U.S. dollar and the Canadian dollar is meant as [USD/CAD](/usd-cad-us-dollar-canadian-dollar-currency-pair) and is a direct quote. This means that the CAD is the quote currency, while the USD is the base currency. The CAD is utilized as a reference to decide the value of one USD. From a U.S.- driven point of view, the CAD is the foreign currency.

Then again, the [EUR/USD](/eur-usd-euro-us-dollar-currency-pair) indicates the cross rate between the euro and the U.S. dollar and is an indirect quote. This means that the EUR is the base currency and the USD is the quote currency. Here, the USD is the domestic currency and decides the value of one EUR.

## Special Considerations

Currency pairs — both base and quote currencies — are impacted by a number of various factors. A portion of these incorporate economic activity, the monetary and fiscal policy instituted by [central banks](/centralbank), and [interest rates](/interestrate).

Major currencies, like the euro and U.S. dollar, are bound to be the base currency as opposed to the quote currency in a currency pair, especially with regards to trades in exotic currencies.

The most normally traded currency pairs on the market in 2021 were:

- EUR/GBP
- EUR/USD
- GBP/USD
- USD/CHF
- USD/JPY

As verified over, the first currency in quite a while is the base currency while the subsequent one (after the slice) is the quote currency. In the GBP/USD pairing, the pound is the base currency or the one that is being purchased while the dollar is the quote currency. This is the one that is being sold.

## Illustration of a Quote Currency

To complete the [transaction](/transaction) on that day, the trader needed to sell 564.12 units of the quote currency to get 400 units of the base currency or $564.12 for \u00a3400 = (400 x 1.4103).
