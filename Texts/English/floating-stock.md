# Floating Stock
## What Is Floating Stock?

Floating stock is the number of shares accessible for trading of a specific stock. Low float stocks are those with a low number of shares. Floating stock is calculated by deducting closely-held shares and [restricted stock](/restrictedstock) from a company's total outstanding shares.

Closely-held shares are those owned by insiders, major shareholders, and employees. Restricted stock alludes to insider shares that can't be traded due to a brief restriction, for example, the lock-up period after a [initial public offering](/ipo) (IPO).

A stock with a small float will generally be more unpredictable than a stock with a large float. This is on the grounds that, with less shares accessible, finding a buyer or seller might be more diligently. This outcomes in larger [spreads](/spread) and frequently lower volume.

## Grasping Floating Stock

A company might have a large number of [shares outstanding](/outstandingshares), however limited floating stock. For instance, expect a company has 50 million shares outstanding. Of that 50 million shares, large institutions own 35 million shares, management and insiders own 5 million, and the [employee stock ownership plan](/esop) (ESOP) holds 2 million shares. Floating stock is accordingly just 8 million shares (50 million shares minus 42 million shares), or 16% of the outstanding shares.

The amount of a company's floating stock might rise or fall after some time. This can happen for various reasons. For instance, a company might sell extra shares to raise more capital, which then increases the floating stock. On the off chance that restricted or closely-held shares become accessible, the floating stock will likewise increase.

On the flip side, on the off chance that a company chooses to carry out a [share buyback](/buyback), the number of outstanding shares will diminish. In this case, the floating shares as a percentage of outstanding stock will likewise go down.

## Why Floating Stock Is Important

A company's float is an important number for investors since it shows the number of shares that are really accessible to be bought and sold by the general investing public. Low float is ordinarily an obstacle to active trading. This lack of trading activity can make it challenging for investors to enter or exit positions in stocks that have limited float.

Institutional investors will frequently try not to trade in companies with smaller floats since there are less shares to trade, subsequently leading to limited [liquidity](/liquidity) and more extensive [bid-ask spreads](/bid-askspread). All things considered, institutional investors, (for example, mutual funds, pension funds, and insurance companies) that buy large blocks of stock will hope to invest in companies with a larger float. On the off chance that they invest in companies with a big float, their large purchases won't impact the share price so a lot.

## Special Considerations

A company isn't responsible for how shares inside the float are traded by the public â€” this is a function of the [secondary market](/secondarymarket). In this manner, shares that are purchased, sold, or even shorted by investors don't influence the float on the grounds that these activities don't address a change in that frame of mind of shares accessible for trade. They basically address a reallocation of shares. Likewise, the creation and [trading of options](/choice) on a stock don't influence the float.

## Instance of Floating Stock

As of June 2020, General Electric (GE) had 8.75 billion shares outstanding. Of this, 0.13% were held by insiders. 63.61% were held by large institutions. Thusly, a total of 63.7% or 5.57 billion shares were logical not accessible for public trading. The floating stock is thusly 3.18 billion shares (8.75 - 5.57).

It is important to note that institutions don't hold a stock until the end of time. The [institutional ownership](/institutional-ownership) number will change consistently, albeit not generally by a critical percentage. Falling institutional ownership coupled with a falling share price could signal that institutions are dumping the shares. Expanding institutional ownership shows that institutions are accumulating shares.
