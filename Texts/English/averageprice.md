# Average Price
## What Is an Average Price?

Average price is the mean price of an asset or security saw over some period of time. It is calculated by finding the simple arithmetic average of closing prices throughout a predetermined time span. When adjusted by trading volume, the [volume-weighted average price](/vwap) (VWAP) can be derived on an intraday basis.

The average price of a decent, like a gallon of customary fuel, may likewise be processed by reviewing merchants or producers over a specific period of time.

While frequently related, average price ought not be mistaken for [average return](/averagereturn).

## Figuring out Average Prices

In fundamental mathematics, average price is a representative measure of a scope of prices. It is calculated by taking the sum of the values and partitioning it by the number of prices being inspected. The average price decreases the reach into a single value, which can then measure up to some other point to decide whether the value is higher or lower than what might be generally anticipated.

In circumstances where there is a scope of prices, it very well may be helpful to work out the average price to improve on a scope of numbers into a single value. For instance, if, north of a four-month period, you earn $104, $105, $110, and $115 from your investments, the [average return on your portfolio](/semideviation) will be ($104 + $105 + $110 + $115)/4 = $108.50.

> ### Median versus Average
> The median of a set of values is that value where half of the values in the set are lower and half of the values in the set are higher. The average of a set of values is the total of those values separated by the number of things there.

The average price of a [bond](/bond) is calculated by adding its [face value](/facevalue) to the price paid for itself and separating the sum by two. The average price is in some cases utilized in deciding a bond's yield to maturity (YTM), where the average price replaces the purchase price in the YTM calculation.

## Illustration of Average Price in Bonds: YTM

In the finance sector, average price is for the most part utilized with regards to bond prices. Bondholders that are keen on knowing the total [rate of return](/rateofreturn) from a bond that is held until maturity can work out a measurement known as the [yield to maturity](/yieldtomaturity) (YTM). An estimate of the YTM can be calculated utilizing the bond's average rate to maturity (ARTM). The ARTM decides the yield by measuring the extent of the average return each year to the average price of the bond.

For a [coupon bond](/couponbond), the average YTM can be calculated as follows:
<!--069C1AE82136BC8AD314010659DCF764-->
For instance, consider an investor that purchased a corporate bond with an annual [coupon](/coupon) rate of 5% and six years to maturity at a [premium to par](/premiumbond) for $1,100. Annual coupon payments, or cash flows received, will subsequently be 5% x $1,000 face value of the corporate bond = $50. Its YTM can be calculated as follows:

- $50 + [($1,000 - $1,100)/6] \u00f7 ($1,000 + $1,100)/2
- $33.33/$1,050 = 3.17%

The logic behind the formula is that the premium amount over par (F - P = $1,000 - $1,100 = - $100) is separated over the number of years to maturity. Consequently, - $100/6 = - $16.67 is the amount that decreases the coupon payment each year.

So even however the investor gets a $50 coupon each year, their real or average return is $33.33 each year ($50 - $16.67 = $33.33) in light of the fact that the bond was bought at a cost [above par](/abovepar). Partitioning the average return by the [median](/median) or average price is the bondholder's YTM.

> Albeit the average price of a bond isn't the most reliable method to track down its yield to maturity (YTM), it gives investors an unpleasant and simple check to figure out what a bond is worth.
>

Note that, assuming the bond was purchased at a [discount to par](/at-a-discount), the investor's average return each year will be higher than the coupon payment. Besides, assuming an investor bought the bond [at par](/at-par), the average return each year will approach the coupon rate. In this case, the YTM will likewise rise to the coupon rate in the wake of isolating the average return each year by the average price of the bond.

## Volume-Weighted Average Price (VWAP)

The volume-weighted average price (VWAP) is a trading [benchmark](/benchmark) utilized by traders that uncovers the average price a security has traded at over the course of the day, in light of both [volume](/volume) and price. It is important in light of the fact that it gives traders understanding into both the trend and value of a security.

Large institutional buyers and [mutual funds](/mutualfund) utilize the VWAP ratio to help move into or out of stocks with the smallest market impact. Thusly, whenever the situation allows, institutions will try to buy below the VWAP, or sell above it. This way their activities push the price back toward the average, rather than away from it.

Retail traders will quite often involve VWAP more as a trend confirmation device, like a [moving average](/movingaverage) (MA). At the point when the price is above VWAP they look just to start long positions and when the price is below VWAP they just hope to start [short positions](/short).

VWAP is calculated by adding up the dollars traded for each transaction (price duplicated by the number of shares traded) and afterward partitioning by the total shares traded.
