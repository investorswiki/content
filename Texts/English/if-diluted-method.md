# If-Converted Method
## What Is the If-Converted Method?

Investors utilize the if-switched method over completely to ascertain the value of [convertible securities](/convertibles) assuming they were changed over into new shares. This is finished by taking a gander at the conversion ratio of the convertible security and afterward comparing the conversion price to the current market price of the stock.

The if-changed over method likewise tells investors how a company is doing in terms of [earnings per share](/eps) (EPS) in view of the currency number shares, as well as earnings in the event that all convertible securities were switched over completely to common stock. Assuming all convertible securities are switched over completely to common stock, it is called [diluted EPS](/dilutedeps).

## Grasping the If-Converted Method

Convertibles securities are much of the time bonds or preferred shares that intrinsically have the option to be changed over into [common stock](/commonstock). This is a feature that the issuer will add to the security at the hour of issuance to "add to the arrangement" for investors.

A convertible offers investors greater flexibility and the chance to possibly participate in the growth of the company by changing over their convertible security into common stock. The price of the common stock generally rises when the company is performing great, and the overall market is performing great, giving the opportunity to bigger gains than the interest or dividends received on bonds and preferred shares.

Convertibles are frequently associated with [convertible bonds](/convertiblebond). These permit bondholders to change their creditor position over completely to those of equity holders at a settled upon price. Other convertible securities can incorporate notes and [preferred shares](/preferredstock).

The number of shares an investor might receive is calculated on the basis of the convertible security's [conversion ratio](/conversion-rate). This is the ratio at which investors can change over bonds into stocks; that is, the number of shares an investor gets for each bond. The conversion rate might be fixed or change after some time, contingent upon the terms that the issuer has set for the offering.

For instance, a conversion rate of 25 means that for each $1,000 of par value the convertible bondholder changes over, they receive 25 shares of stock. Investors can decide the price at which it becomes beneficial to change over bonds into equity shares by isolating the selling price of the bond by the discussion rate to decide the [breakeven price](/breakeven-price) or worthwhile conversion price.

$1,000/25 = $40

In this case, assuming the stock price is above $40, changing over the bond might be worthwhile. For instance, assuming the stock is trading at $50, the investor receives 25 shares. Those shares are worth $1,250 (25 x $50), which is 25% more than the $1,000 par value of the bond.

The downside of changing over is that the investor no longer receives the interest they were getting from the bond. They are presently subject to the high points and low points of the stock price; it could fall back below $40, or even a lot of lower. Additionally, the investor loses their higher claim on assets should the company go [bankrupt](/chapter 11). Creditors get compensated before common shareholders, so in the event of financial difficulty, common shareholders are in many cases the hardest hit.

## On the off chance that Converted Method and Earnings

At the point when a company reports earnings they commonly give EPS and diluted EPS, in the event that they have any convertible securities outstanding. EPS is how much was made, per share, in light of shares that were outstanding during the earnings period.

Diluted EPS is how much, per share, the company made on the off chance that every one of the convertible securities were switched over completely to common stock. Since there would be more normal shares in the event that every one of the convertible securities were changed over, the diluted EPS is lower than EPS.

A few investors accept that diluted EPS is a more genuine measure of the value of a company than EPS.

## Illustration of the If-Converted Method

For 2018, Apple Inc. (AAPL) reported earnings per share of $12.28. This depended on the number of weighted average shares outstanding, which was 4.736 billion shares.

Diluted EPS was $12.17. That means that assuming all convertible securities switched over completely to common stock there would be 4.773 billion shares outstanding. Since there would be somewhat more shares outstanding, the earnings would be spread across additional shareholders, weakening the earnings per share.

While calculating for dilution, earnings would have been $0.11 lower had all convertible securities changed over completely to common stock.

## Features
- The if-changed over method is likewise utilized by investors to see whether changing over their convertible security into common stock is worthwhile. On the off chance that the stock price is over the conversion price it could be worthwhile to change over, assuming they will surrender their creditor status and benefits.
- The if-changed over method shows how EPS compares to diluted EPS, which is in the event that all convertible securities became common stock.
