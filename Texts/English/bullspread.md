# Bull Spread
## What Is a Bull Spread?

A bull spread is a hopeful options strategy intended to profit from a moderate rise in the price of a security or asset. An assortment of [vertical spread, ](/verticalspread)a bull spread includes the simultaneous purchase and sale of either call options or put options with various strike prices however with a similar underlying asset and [expiration date](/expirationdate). Whether a put or a call, the option with the lower strike price is bought and the one with the higher strike price is sold.

A bull call spread is likewise called a [debit call spread](/debitspread) on the grounds that the trade produces a net debt to the account when it is opened. The option purchased costs more than the option sold.

## The Basics of a Bull Spread

In the event that the strategy utilizes call options, it is called a [bull call spread](/bullcallspread). On the off chance that it utilizes put options, it is called a [bull put spread](/bullputspread). The functional difference between the two lies in the timing of the [cash flows](/cashflow). For the bull call spread, you pay upfront and look for profit some other time when it lapses. For the bull put spread, you collect money upfront and try to hold on to however much of it as could be expected when it terminates.

The two strategies include collecting a premium on the sale of the options, so the initial cash investment is short of what it would be by purchasing options alone.

## How the Bull Call Spread Works

Since a bull call spread includes composing a [call option](/calloption) for a higher strike price than that of the current market in long calls, the trade typically requires an initial cash outlay. The investor simultaneously sells a call option, otherwise known as a short call, with a similar expiration date; in this manner, he gets a premium, which balances the cost of the first, long call he kept in touch with some degree.

The maximum profit in this strategy is the difference between the strike prices of the long and short options less the net cost of the options — as such, the debit. The maximum loss is simply limited to the net [premium](/premium) (debit) paid for the options.

A bull call spread's [profit](/profit) increments as the underlying security's price builds up to the strike price of the [short call](/short-call) option. From there on, the profit stays stale assuming that the underlying security's price increments past the short call's strike price. On the other hand, the position would have losses as the underlying security's price falls, yet the losses stay stale on the off chance that the underlying security's price falls below the long call option's strike price.

## How the Bull Put Spread Works

A bull put spread is likewise called a [credit put spread](/creditspread) on the grounds that the trade produces a net credit to the account when it is opened. The option purchased costs not exactly the option sold.

Since a bull put spread includes composing a [put option ](/putoption)that has a higher strike price than that of the long call options, the trade typically creates a credit toward the beginning. The investor pays a premium for buying the put option yet in addition gets compensated a premium for selling a put option at a higher strike price than that of the one he purchased.

The maximum profit utilizing this strategy is equivalent to the difference between the amount received from the sold put and the amount paid for the purchased put - the credit between the two, in effect. The maximum loss a [trader](/trader) can cause while utilizing this strategy is equivalent to the difference between the strike prices minus the net credit received.

## Benefits and Disadvantages of Bull Spreads

Bull spreads are not appropriate for each market condition. They work best in markets where the underlying asset is rising respectably and not taking large price leaps.

As referenced over, the bull call limits its maximum loss to the net premium (debit) paid for the options. The bull call additionally covers profits up to the strike price of the short option.

The bull put, then again, limits profits to the difference between what the trader paid for the two puts — one sold and one bought. Losses are capped at the difference between strike prices less the total credit received at the creation of the put spread.

By simultaneously selling and buying options of a similar asset and expiration yet with various strike prices the trader can reduce the cost of composing the option.

## Computing Bull Spread Profits and Losses

The two strategies accomplish maximum profit assuming that the underlying asset closes at or over the higher strike price. The two strategies bring about a maximum loss on the off chance that the underlying asset closes at or below the lower [strike price](/strikeprice).

Breakeven, before [commissions](/commission), in a bull call spread happens at (lower strike price + net premium paid).

Breakeven, before commissions, in a bull put spread happens at (upper strike price - net premium received).

## Genuine Example of a Bull Spread

Suppose a reasonably hopeful trader needs to try doing a bull call spread on the Standard and Poor's 500 Index (SPX). The Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE) offers options on the index.

Expect the S&P 500 is at 4402. The trader purchases one two-month SPX 4400 call at a cost of $33.75, and simultaneously sells one two-month SPX 4405 call and gets $30.50. The total net debit for the spread is $33.50 - $30.75 = $2.75 x 100 contract multiplier = $275.00.

By purchasing the bull call spread the investor is expressing that by the expiration he expects the SPX index to have risen reasonably to a level over the break-even point: 4400 strike price + $2.75 (the net debit paid), or a SPX level of 4402.75. The investor's maximum profit potential is limited: 4405 (higher strike) - 4400 (lower strike) = $5.00 - $2.75 (net debit paid) = $2.25 x $100 multiplier = $225 total.

This profit would be seen regardless of how high the SPX index has risen by expiration. The downside risk for the bull call spread purchase is limited completely to the total $275 premium paid for the spread regardless of how low the SPX index declines.

Before expiration, assuming that the call spread purchase becomes profitable the investor is free to sell the spread in the marketplace to understand this gain. Then again, in the event that the investor's decently bullish outlook demonstrates wrong and the SPX index declines in price, the call spread may be sold to understand a loss not exactly the maximum.
