# Void Transaction
## What Is a Void Transaction?

A void transaction is a transaction that is canceled by a merchant or [vendor](/vendor) before it settles through a customer's debit or [credit card account](/creditcard).

Albeit a [transaction](/transaction) might be void, it doesn't show up on the customer's account statement. It might show up as a pending transaction when the customer checks their account online.

## Grasping Void Transactions

At the point when a transaction happens, the merchant swipes the customer's debit or credit card. Assuming there are an adequate number of funds in the customer's account, the terminal approves the transaction. In any case, the transaction isn't completely settled, as payment must be set free from the customer's account to the merchant.

On the off chance that there is a problem with the transaction, it tends to be voided â€” despite the fact that it hasn't settled. Since the transaction is pending and has not cleared the customer's account, it means the sale can kept from go through.

To void the transaction, the customer must contact the merchant and request the transaction be switched except if the merchant sees a slip-up or issue and proactively voids a transaction at the point of sale. When voided, the transaction will appear on the customer's account as a pending transaction, which vanishes after a certain amount of time.

The hold can last somewhere in the range of 24 hours to several days, causing the customer a bother since they will not have the option to access the money during that time.

## Special Considerations
### Voiding Purchases

Errors can be handily remedied by voiding transactions in the event that they are recognized right away. For example, a buyer might find they were charged mistakenly. A customer who has just paid for their things from a supermarket picks up their bags and understands the cashier unintentionally remembered a portion of the next customer's things for their purchase. The cashier can void the transaction, re-filter the right things, and charge the customer the right amount.

A few merchants might permit a certain window of time to cancel a purchase. This frequently happens with [e-commerce](/online business) merchants. A buyer frequently may have the option to cancel a purchase made online in 24 hours or less. In the event that the purchase is canceled, the seller voids the transaction, and the buyer isn't charged for the purchase.

### Voiding Fraudulent Transactions

Fraudulent charges can likewise be voided. Card giving companies have fraud detection services to flag fraudulent transactions.

Most companies place these transactions on hold. The customer can confirm whether a transaction is fraudulent with the company, which will quickly void the transaction. If a [customer](/customer) can't be gone after verification, many card companies will consequently void a suspicious transaction before guaranteeing the safety and security of the customer is settled.

> Since refunds are issued after the money has proactively gone through a customer's account to the merchant, the interaction can take more time than a voided transaction.

## Void Transactions Versus Refunds

Void transactions are not the same as [refunds](/refund). With void transactions, no money is at any point really moved from the customer's debit or credit card company to the merchant. In any case, refunds are issued after a transaction has settled and the customer has paid for a long term benefit or service.

A few merchants and credit card processing systems may really settle transactions right away. At the point when a transaction settles right away, the seller must issue a refund instead of voiding the transaction.

Dissimilar to void transactions, refunds can take a significantly longer pass through to a customer's account. A few refunds require just 48 hours to consider a customer's account, while others can require up to 30 days.
