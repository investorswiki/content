After a 2017 lawsuit drove by the Sierra Club, a Federal Appeals Court cleared the FERC-issued permit for the Sabal Trail pipeline, saying that the Commission had failed to assess the "downstream" emissions of the natural gas project. FERC was ordered to create another environmental impact statement, considering these extra factors.

In any case, the FERC didn't follow the court's guidelines in later projects, saying that it didn't have the authority to assess the indirect ozone harming substance emissions of the projects they were assessing.
