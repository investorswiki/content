# Delta-Gamma Hedging
## What Is Delta-Gamma Hedging?

Delta-gamma hedging is an options strategy that joins both [delta](/delta) and [gamma](/gamma) hedges to relieve the risk of changes in the [underlying asset](/underlying-asset) and in the actual delta.

In options trading, delta alludes to a change in the price of an option contract for each change in the price of the underlying asset. Gamma alludes to the rate of change of delta. At the point when completely hedged as such, a position is both [delta neutral](/deltaneutral) and [gamma neutral](/gammaneutral).

## Understanding Delta-Gamma Hedging

Both delta and gamma help to measure movement in an option's price relative to how [in the money](/inthemoney) (ITM) or [out of the money](/outofthemoney) (OTM) the option is. Traders hedge delta to limit the risk of small price movements in the underlying security, and hedge gamma to shield themselves from the excess exposure made using a delta hedge. As such, hedging gamma ought to safeguard the trader's position from movement in the option's delta.

Delta moves between - 1 and +1. [Call](/calloption) options have deltas somewhere in the range of 0 and 1, while [put](/putoption) options have deltas among 0 and - 1. At the point when delta changes, gamma is around the difference between the two delta values. Further OTM options have deltas that incline toward zero. Further ITM options have deltas that incline toward 1 (call) or - 1 (put).

A delta-gamma hedge is many times one that is [market-neutral](/marketneutral) (i.e., zero delta and zero gamma); nonetheless, a delta-gamma hedge can, in theory, take on any static level of delta or potentially gamma. Options positions that are delta-gamma hedged are as yet presented to changes in value, due to shifts in volatility, interest rates, and [time decay](/timedecay).

### Characterizing Individual Hedges

Delta hedging means to reduce, or [hedge](/hedge), the risk associated with price movements in the underlying asset by taking offsetting long and short positions. For instance, a long call position might be delta-hedged by [shorting](/shortselling) the underlying stock. This strategy depends on the change in [premium](/premium), or price of the option, brought about by a change in the price of the underlying security.

Delta itself measures the hypothetical change in premium for each $1 change in the price of the underlying. Gamma hedging endeavors to reduce, or take out, the risk made by changes in an option's delta.

Gamma itself alludes to the rate of change of an option's delta with respect to the change in price of the underlying asset. Basically, gamma is the rate of change of the price of an option.

A trader who is trying to be delta-hedged or delta-neutral is typically making a trade that [volatility](/volatility) will rise or fall from here on out. Gamma hedging is added to a delta-hedged strategy to try and shield a trader from larger changes in the portfolio than expected, or time value erosion.

## Utilizing a Delta-Gamma Hedge

With [delta hedging](/deltahedging) alone, a position has protection from small changes in the underlying asset. Nonetheless, large changes will change the hedge (change delta), leaving the position defenseless. By adding a gamma hedge, the delta hedge stays in salvageable shape.

Utilizing a [gamma hedge](/gamma-hedging) related to a delta hedge requires an investor to make new hedges when the underlying asset's delta changes. The number of underlying shares that are bought or sold under a delta-gamma hedge relies upon whether the underlying asset price is expanding or decreasing, and by how much.

Large hedges that include buying or selling huge amounts of shares and [options](/option) may change the price of the underlying asset on the market, requiring the investor to continually and dynamically make hedges for a portfolio to consider greater vacillations in prices.

> Gamma hedging basically includes continually correcting the delta hedge as delta changes (i.e., making the position gamma-neutral).

## Illustration of Delta-Gamma Hedging Using the Underlying Stock

Expect a trader is long one call of a stock, and the option has a delta of 0.6. That means that for each $1 the stock price goes up or down, the option premium will increase or diminish by $0.60, respectively. To hedge the delta, the trader needs to short 60 shares of stock (one contract x 100 shares x 0.6 delta). Being short 60 shares neutralizes the effect of the positive 0.6 delta.

As the price of the stock changes, so will the delta. At-the-money (ATM) options have a delta close 0.5. The more deeply ITM an option goes, the nearer delta gets to one. The more deeply OTM an option goes, the nearer it will zero.

Accept that the gamma on this position is 0.2. That means that for every dollar change in the stock, the delta changes by 0.2. To offset the change in delta (gamma), the prior delta hedge should be adjusted.

On the off chance that delta increases by 0.2, delta is presently 0.8. That means the trader needs 80 short shares to offset delta. They previously shorted 60, so they need to short 20 more. On the other hand, in the event that delta diminished by 0.2, the delta is presently 0.4, so the trader just requirements 40 shares short. They have 60, so they can buy 20 shares back.

## Features
- Delta-gamma hedging neutralizes an options position, so that when the underlying moves the options' value continues as before â€” and the actual delta will continue as before.
- Gamma hedging reduces the risk associated with changes in an option's delta.
- Delta hedging reduces the risk of price movements in the underlying asset by offsetting long and short positions.
