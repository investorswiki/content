# ACCRA Cost Of Living Index (COLI)
## What Is the ACCRA Cost Of Living Index?

The ACCRA Cost of Living Index is a dataset containing key living costs incorporated by the Council for Community and Economic Research. Financial specialists can utilize the index to make logical comparison of the [cost of living](/cost-of-living) between two different urban areas in the United States.

## Figuring out the ACCRA COLI

The ACCRA Cost of Living Index is a quarterly publication put out by the American Chamber of Commerce Researchers Association and the Council for Community and Economic Research. The index utilizes a set of broad categories calculated in view of [consumer spending](/consumer-spending) on food, housing, utilities, transportation, medical care and a miscellaneous assortment of goods and services that don't fit under different categories. The composite index loads costs in light of spending designs distinguished in families with mid-management income, as estimated by government studies.

Price comparison data exist inside the index for more than 300 U.S. urban communities, totaled by province and by [metropolitan statistical area](/msa).

## Utilizing the COLI

The index distributes a national average for the cost of every thing in a category and extrapolates an expected expenditure by different family types in a specific area in light of the variance from the national gauge across categories. For instance, the index takes a gander at an assortment of staple basic food item things to produce its overall category expenditure, including things, for example, ground meat, eggs, bananas, coffee, and facial tissues. Average rental costs for condos and average home deal prices yield a cost for housing. A comparative approach across categories prompted a national average of $5,976 each month in 2017 for a couple with children under six years old.

Job searchers and human resources divisions can utilize the ACCRA Cost of Living Index to think about salaries and salary requirements in different parts of the country by checking out at the deviation from average in a given area. Loft rent averaged $1,037 each month on a national level in 2017 as per the index, essentially lower than the rent one could pay in Manhattan or other major seaside urban areas. Employers could utilize COLI data to guarantee their pay stays competitive with salaries in different areas or to guarantee that job searchers considering a move comprehend how much farther their take-home pay would go.

## COLI versus CPI

The ACCRA Cost of Living Index gives points of comparison between two geographic areas at a single point in time. It has minimal statistical value in terms of tracking prices after some time, or charting inflation, in any case. For those keen on measuring inflation, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics distributes the Consumer Price Index, which utilizes a fairly comparative approach to capture changes in cost of living after some time.
