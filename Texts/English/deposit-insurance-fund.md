# Deposit Insurance Fund - DIF
## What Is the Deposit Insurance Fund?

The Deposit Insurance Fund (DIF) is a private insurance provider gave to guaranteeing the deposits of people covered by the [Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC)](/fdic). The money in the Deposit Insurance Fund (DIF) is set to the side to pay back the money lost due to the disappointment of a [financial institution](/financialinstitution). The DIF is funded by insurance payments made by banks. The organization has north of 6,000 member banks.

## How the Deposit Insurance Fund Works

Account holders at banks have a solid sense of safety assuming their deposits are insured, and the Deposit Insurance Fund gives the assurance that they are. For instance, assuming your bank closed its entryways in 2009, you would be covered for up to $250,000. This diminishes the very type of fear that caused the [bank run](/bankrun) during the 1930s. A common utilization of the DIF account balance is to compare it to the total assets of banks on the "FDIC Problem Banks List," which is issued quarterly. The FDIC can't run out of money since it can borrow from the Treasury Department, however large losses would mean higher [premiums](/premium) for the excess banks before long.

## Recent Reforms of the Deposit Insurance Fund

The [Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010](/dodd-frank-financial-administrative reform-charge) (the Dodd-Frank Act) modified the FDIC's fund management practices by setting necessities for the Designated Reserve Ratio (DRR) and rethinking the assessment base, which is utilized to work out banks' quarterly assessments. The DRR ratio is the DIF balance partitioned by estimated insured deposits. Answering these corrections, the FDIC developed a thorough, long-term plan to deal with the DIF in a manner that diminishes supportive of cyclicality while accomplishing moderate, consistent assessment rates all through economic and credit cycles and keeping a positive fund balance in the event of a banking crisis. As part of this plan, the FDIC Board adopted the existing assessment rate plans and a 2% DRR.

The Federal Deposit Insurance Act requires the FDIC's Board to yearly set a target or DRR for the DIF. Beginning around 2010, the Board has stayed with the 2% DRR every year. Notwithstanding, an examination, utilizing historical fund loss and reenacted income data from 1950 to 2010, showed that the [reserve ratio](/reserveratio) would have needed to surpass 2% before the onset of the two emergencies that happened during the most recent 30 years to have kept up with both a positive fund balance and stable assessment rates all through the two emergencies. The FDIC sees the 2% DRR as a long-term goal and the base level expected to endure future emergencies of comparative greatness.
