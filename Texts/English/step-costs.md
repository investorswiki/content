# Step Costs
## What Are Step Costs?

Step costs are expenses that are steady for a given level of activity, yet increase or decline once a threshold is crossed. Step costs change disproportionately when production levels of a manufacturer, or activity levels of any enterprise, increase or decline. At the point when portrayed on a graph, these types of [expenses](/businessexpenses) will be addressed by a step pattern.

## Understanding Step Costs

Step costs go all over in a step-like way — evenly over a reach, then in an upward direction, then, at that point, on a level plane, etc. For a given level of activity, a business will cause a fixed cost, yet when it arrives at one more level of activity, its cost to oblige the extra business increases disproportionately (i.e., not hardly), with a step up higher. The inverse is true, as well — in the event that business activity loosens, a material portion of costs will drop, with a step-down.

## Instances of Step Costs

A cutting edge gear manufacturer makes 400 virtual reality headsets in a single shift of eight hours with 25 employees and one supervisor. The headsets are all delivered out, and there is no inventory. Wages and benefits for these employees amount to $6,500 per shift.

Then, demand increases by one headset. Since the production line is at full capacity, the company must add one more shift to make 401 units to 800 units. The labor cost to deliver 401 units stepped up from $6,500 to $13,000.

A coffee shop can serve 30 customers an hour with one employee. In the event that the shop gets somewhere in the range of zero to 30 customers each hour, it will just have to pay the cost of having one employee, say $50 ($20 for the employee, $30 for any remaining expenses, fixed and [operating](/operating_expense)). In the event that the shop starts getting at least 31 customers each hour, it must hire a subsequent employee, expanding its costs to $70 ($40 for two employees, $30 for other people).

## Special Considerations

Understanding step costing is critical when a company is going to arrive at a new and higher activity level, where it will be required to navigate a large step cost. At times, the step cost might kill profits that management had been expecting with increased volume.

It might seem OK to bring about higher step costs in the event that revenue is adequate to cover the higher cost and give an acceptable return. In the event that the increase in volume is moderately minor, yet at the same time calls for causing a step cost, profits may really decline. In the event that it's just a small increase in volume, management might try to squeeze out extra productivity from existing operations, rather than causing stepped-up costs.

Just as management might have to step up costs, they may likewise have to step down when the activity level declines below a certain threshold. In such cases, management might decide to reduce or kill the associated step fixed cost.

## Features
- Understanding step costs is especially important during times of demand floods or bottlenecks.
- Step costs stay fixed for a certain level of output, however when they cross a certain threshold they increase (or diminishing) in step-like fashion.
- Companies might adjust their production to operate just below a step cost threshold to keep costs down.
