# Strong Sell
## What Is a Strong Sell?

A strong sell is a type of [stock](/stock) exchanging recommendation given by [investment analysts](/analyst) for a stock that is expected to decisively underperform when compared with the average market return as well as return of comparable stocks in a similar sector or industry. It is a decided negative comment on a stock's possibilities.

## Grasping a Strong Sell

Investment analysts, commonly working at [investment banks](/investmentbank), survey and give their recommendations on company stocks. Their investigations are exhaustive, include an examination of [financial statements](/financial-statements), market and economic factors, and a huge number of other material. Toward the finish of their surveys, they regularly give a recommendation on investing in the stock. The recommendation is a variation on one of three: buy, hold, or sell.

A strong sell is perhaps of the strongest recommendation that an analyst can provide for investors to sell a stock and generally demonstrates that the underlying company as well as significant market conditions will be unfavorable for the stock in the subsequent period of time. They accept that the stock price will diminish going ahead, eroding any value for current holders, or be a poor investment decision for possible investors.

## Strong Sell Variations

The significance of ratings issued by analysts can shift from one firm to another, making it important to see the documentation that obviously subtleties the intent of any recommendation. What one firm calls a "strong sell" could carry similar importance as the accompanying recommendations: "fundamentally underperform," "trade," "long haul stay away from," or "sell."

Moreover, on the grounds that the discoveries and assessments of analysts can fluctuate widely, a "strong sell" recommendation from one firm probably won't match with the recommendations for a similar time period on a similar stock from another firm. At the point when recommendations are delivered, a research report might be incorporated to give corroborating evidence to the new status. On account of a "strong sell" rating, analysts are expected to frame the underlying fundamentals that prompted such a [downgrade](/downgrade).

## Impact of a Strong Sell

With a "strong sell" rating, an analyst is basically suggesting that the whole stock be eliminated from shareholders' portfolios to relieve further losses. Even assuming the company is generating revenue, there might be different factors that could weaken its forward growth possibilities. The impact of these issues could lead to diminishing value on company shares with no swift recovery projected in the short term.

Instigating actions that can lead to such a recommendation can incorporate recent news from the company, like missed objectives, unexpected losses, or regulatory decisions that influence the core operations of the business, combined with projections on future [earnings](/earnings). A "strong sell" recommendation can consider how the company is situated relative to its industry peers; market changes that might influence the company's operations, [liquidity](/liquidity), and capitalization, and actions contenders are taking.

On the off chance that a company has not introduced a plan of action to ease such issues, or on the other hand assuming there are different factors that would block a close term recovery, analysts could issue a strong sell recommendation, particularly in the event that it is accepted the company will underperform for 12 to 24 months.
