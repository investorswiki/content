# Income Approach
## What Is the Income Approach?

The income approach, at times alluded to as the income capitalization approach, is a type of real estate appraisal method that allows investors to estimate the value of a property in light of the income the property generates. It's utilized by taking the net operating income (NOI) of the rent collected and isolating it by the [capitalization rate](/capitalizationrate).

## How the Income Approach Works

The income approach is ordinarily utilized for income-creating properties and is one of three well known approaches to assessing real estate. The others are the cost approach and the comparison approach. The income approach for real estate valuations is likened to the discounted cash flow (DCF) for finance. The income approach discounts the future value of rents by the capitalization rate.

While utilizing the income approach for purchasing a rental property, an investor considers the amount of income generated and different factors to decide how much the property might sell for under current market conditions. As well as deciding if the investor might profit from the rental property, a lender will need to know its possible risk of [repayment](/repayment) on the off chance that it stretches out a mortgage to the investor.

In the event that rent being collected isn't greater than current [expenses](/cost), the investor will in all probability not purchase the property.

In the event that the units are not filled consistently, rent assortment will be lower than it very well may be, and purchasing the property may not be in the investor's best interest.

## Illustration of the Income Approach

With the income approach, an investor utilizes market sales of comparables for picking a capitalization rate. For instance, while esteeming a four-unit apartment complex in a specific region, the investor takes a gander at the recent selling prices of comparable properties in a similar district. In the wake of working out the capitalization rate, the investor can isolate the rental property's NOI by that rate. For instance, a property with a net operating income (NOI) of $700,000 and a picked capitalization rate of 8% is worth $8.75 million.
