# Personal Income and Outlays
## What Is Personal Income and Outlays?

The Personal Income and Outlays report (likewise called the Personal Consumption Report) comprises of a series of data groupings delivered by the [Bureau of Economic Analysis](/bea) (BEA) that track consumer income and spending. Personal income is the dollar value of income from all sources by people in the U.S.; personal outlay is the dollar value of purchases of [durable](/durables) (consumer goods that are not purchased habitually), and non-durable goods and services by U.S. consumers. These data can give indications of consumer behavior, saving activity, and overall economic performance.

## Grasping Personal Income and Outlays

As an economic indicator, the Personal Income and Outlays report assists with measuring the strength of the U.S. consumer sector. Since consumer spending compares to such a large portion of the country's [Gross Domestic Product](/gdp) (GDP), having the option to measure trends in income and spending is critical to investors since it gives an indication of the overall aggregate demand. The report additionally assists investors with concluding which companies to invest in on the grounds that they can examine and follow whether consumers are spending on durables, non-durables, or services.

The major parts of the BEA's Personal Income and Outlays report are personal income, disposable personal income (income after taxes), and personal consumption expenditures. The difference among income and expenditures can be deciphered as a consumers' gross savings, which can be held as cash or invested. BEA likewise releases data that breaks these categories down even further into different types of income, for example, wages, salaries, interest received, and veterans' benefits. [Personal consumption expenditure](/pce) (PCE) data is available for a huge range of different types of products and services of various types. All data sets are reported in current dollars and real (inflation-adjusted) dollars.

As income and spending increase, it is imagined that equity markets ought to respond decidedly on account of an assumed coming about increase in corporate profits as consumer spending channels through the economy. Nonetheless, increased consumer demand is likewise accepted to lead to wage and price inflation, which could adversely affect bond markets. A larger-than-anticipated month to month increase in income and outlay can make bond prices drop — and yields and interest rates to rise — in light of inflation expectations and investor concern that the Federal Reserve will fix monetary policy in response.

A rise in spending without a proportionate rise in income proposes a dip in the savings rate. This could mean that consumers are spending down savings to finance current purchases. This is a spending situation that ordinarily switches in ongoing months and recommends that spending will decline in later months to modify savings. Then again, a rise in savings demonstrates either that consumers are saving up for future purchases or that they see an increase in economic vulnerability later on and are expanding their liquidity preference.

For May 2021, the BEA's Personal Income and Outlays report indicated that personal income diminished by 2% at a month to month rate, or $414.3 billion. This mirrored a diminishing in social benefit payments.
