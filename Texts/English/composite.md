## What Is a Composite?

In the financial world, a composite is a grouping of [equities](/value), indexes, or other investment securities in a normalized way. When applied to stock prices, a [composite index](/compositeindex) can give a valuable statistical measure to the performance of the overall market, a specific sector, or an industry group. Composites are additionally made for investment examination of economic trends, to forecast market activity, and as benchmarks for the relative performance of professional money managers.

## Figuring out Composite Indexes

A composite index can have a large number of factors that are averaged together to form a statistic representative of an overall market or sector. For instance, the [Nasdaq Composite](/nasdaq) index is a [market capitalization-weighted](/capitalizationweightedindex) grouping of roughly 3,000 common stocks listed on the Nasdaq Stock Market. Market cap-weighted means that the index is made so the companies with the greatest market values address a greater extent of the overall index.

## Instances of Composite Indexes

The goal of an index is to choose stocks that address a specific sector or market, and a committee concludes which stocks to remember for the index. The [Dow Jones 65 Composite Average](/dow_jones_65) is a model. The benchmark incorporates 65 companies that are additionally remembered for three other Dow Jones indexes: the Dow Jones Industrial Average, the Dow Jones Transportation Average, and the Dow Jones Utility Average. A committee at Dow Jones concludes which stocks to remember for the averages, which are developed utilizing a [price-weighted](/priceweightedindex) methodology and the stocks with higher prices have more influence on the daily vacillations in the index.

Most indexes — like the widely watched S&P 500 Index — are weighted by market capitalization instead of price. A company with a large capitalization (which is processed as shares outstanding times the current share price) makes up a larger percentage of the index's total value and biggerly affects the performance of the index. Utilizing a market capitalization approach means that companies with [smaller market caps](/little cap) lessly affect the index.

The [S&P 500 Index](/sp500), for instance, is in many cases utilized as a benchmark for the performance of large cap stocks. Financials destinations, like Morningstar, compare the performance of a fund to a representative benchmark and furthermore compare the fund's outcomes with different funds that utilization a similar benchmark. Notwithstanding stocks, the financial industry likewise gives indexes to bonds, interest rates, commodities, and [currency exchange](/currency-exchange) rates.
