# Aa2
## What Is Aa2?

Aa2 is the third-highest long-term credit rating that ratings agency [Moody's](/moodys) allocates to [fixed-income](/fixedincome) securities, similar to bonds, that are of high quality with exceptionally low credit risk.

## Understanding Aa2

The letters "Aa" is the generic rating classification and the number, in this case "2," alludes to the standing inside this class. As per Moody's, "Aa" means that the fixed income obligation is "decided to be of high quality and are subject to exceptionally low credit risk." The number "2" puts the obligation in the scope of that rating class.

The [credit ratings](/creditrating) assigned by the different ratings agencies, as [Standard and Poor's](/sp), Moody's, and [Fitch Ratings](/fitch-ratings), measure the likelihood that the borrower may [default](/default2). They depend essentially upon the guarantor's or alternately issuer's [creditworthiness](/credit-value). Basically, the higher the rating, the almost certain the issuer is to meet their financial commitments and the lower the risk of default.

Moody's ratings, for instance, begin "Aaa" for [prime](/prime) bond issuers with the lowest risk and go down to "C," which is generally given to securities that are in default with minimal chance of the [principal](/principal) or [interest](/interest) being reimbursed. Aa2 is just below Aaa and Aa1, yet is above all the other things.
