## What Is a Price by Volume Chart (PBV)?

A price by volume (PBV) chart is a horizontal [histogram](/histogram) plotted on a security's chart, showing the [volume](/volume) of shares traded at a specific price level.

## Understanding a Price by Volume Charts

Price by volume charts are utilized to delineate high buying and selling interest at specific price levels, which can be indicative of [support](/support) and [resistance](/resistance) in a given security. It's generally expected to see the price of a security face little resistance while going between levels that have small PBV bars, however the price might experience difficulty moving above or below areas with large PBV bars. Some price by volume charts additionally portray the difference among buying and selling volume by concealing segments green or red. These experiences can be particularly helpful for portraying price points as either heavy resistance or heavy support levels instead of generic levels.
