# Tax Credit
## What Is a Tax Credit?

A tax credit is an amount of money that taxpayers can subtract directly from the taxes they owe. Dissimilar to deductions, which lower the amount of [taxable income](/taxableincome), tax credits reduce the actual amount of tax owed. The value of a tax credit relies upon the idea of the credit; certain types of tax credits are granted to individuals or organizations in specific areas, characterizations, or industries.

## Understanding Tax Credits

Bureaucratic and state governments might grant tax credits to advance specific ways of behaving that benefit the economy, the environment, or whatever else the government considers important. For instance, a tax credit is accessible that rewards individuals for introducing sunlight powered chargers for home use. Other tax credits assist with offsetting the costs of child and dependent care, education, and adoption.

Tax credits are more good than tax deductions since tax credits reduce tax liability dollar for dollar. While a deduction actually reduces the last [tax liability](/taxliability), it just does as such inside an individual's [marginal tax rate](/marginaltaxrate). An individual in a 22% tax bracket, for instance, would save $0.22 for each marginal tax dollar deducted. Notwithstanding, a credit would reduce the tax liability by the full $1.

## Types of Tax Credits

There are three categories of tax credits: nonrefundable, refundable, and partially refundable.

### Nonrefundable tax credits

[Nonrefundable tax credits](/nonrefundabletaxcredit) are things directly deducted from tax liability until the tax due equals $0. Any amount greater than the tax owed, bringing about a refund for the taxpayer, isn't paid out — subsequently, the name "nonrefundable." The excess part of a nonrefundable tax credit that can't be used is lost, in effect.

Nonrefundable tax credits are substantial in the extended period of reporting just, lapse after the return is recorded, and may not be carried over to future years. Along these lines, nonrefundable tax credits can negatively impact low-income taxpayers, as they are frequently unfit to utilize the whole amount of the credit.

As of the 2021 tax year, specific instances of nonrefundable tax credits incorporate the adoption credit, education credit, [child and dependent care credit](/childanddependentcarecredit), retirement savings contribution credit, child tax credit, and the mortgage interest credit, which is intended to assist individuals with lower incomes bear the cost of homeownership.

### Refundable tax credits

[Refundable tax credits](/refundablecredit) are the most beneficial credit since they're paid out in full. This means that a taxpayer — no matter what their income or tax liability — is qualified for the whole amount of the credit. In the event that the refundable tax credit reduces the tax liability to below $0, the taxpayer is due a refund.

As of the 2021 tax year, presumably the most famous refundable tax credit is the [earned income tax credit (EITC)](/earnedincomecredit). The EITC is for low-to moderate-income taxpayers who earn income through an employer or by working as a self-employed individual and meet certain criteria in view of income and number of family individuals.

Other refundable tax credits incorporate the premium tax credit, which assists individuals and families with covering the cost of premiums for medical coverage purchased through the health care coverage marketplace.

### Partially refundable tax credits

Some tax credits are just partially refundable.

One model is the [American Opportunity Tax Credit (AOTC)](/american-opportunity-tax-credit) for post-optional education understudies. On the off chance that a taxpayer reduces their tax liability to $0 before utilizing the whole portion of the $2,500 tax deduction, the rest of be assumed as a refundable praise up to the lesser of 40% of the excess credit or $1,000.

Another model was the [child tax credit](/childtaxcredit), which became refundable (up to $1,400 per qualifying child) in 2018, because of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA). In the event that a taxpayer had a sufficiently large tax liability, the full amount of the child tax credit was $2,000. Be that as it may, up to $1,400 was refundable even on the off chance that it was more than the taxpayer owed. **Important:** For tax years 2020 and 2021, this credit increased and turned out to be fully refundable as part of the American Rescue Plan (see below).

## 2020 and 2021 Stimulus Payments

In 2020, because of the coronavirus pandemic and Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act stimulus bill, taxpayers received up to $1,200 per grown-up and $500 per child as a stimulus check or direct deposit. The stimulus payment was an advance on a refundable tax credit for the 2020 tax year; the amount received didn't add to taxable income in 2020 or any future year.

The equivalent was true of the second $600 stimulus check approved on Dec. 27, 2020, which gave $600 to qualifying individuals ($1,200 for qualifying couples) and $600 for qualifying children. The refundable tax credit for the two checks phased out at a [adjusted gross income (AGI)](/agi) of $75,000 to $99,000 for singles (or $150,000 to $198,000 for joint taxpayers), at a rate of 5% per dollar.

At long last, the recovery rebate isn't taxable. It won't add to taxable income in 2020 (or any future year). This is all in light of the fact that the CARES Act contains no "clawback" mechanism by which the government can reclaim funds that were honestly extended. The equivalent is true of the Consolidated Appropriations Act that incorporates the new stimulus funding.

## 2021 American Rescue Plan Changes

Changes were additionally made to the EITC. Initially capped at $543 for childless households, the maximum earned income tax credit for those equivalent households in 2021 is $1,502. The bill additionally extends qualification for childless households. Already, individuals younger than 25 and beyond 65 years old couldn't claim the credit. The upper limit has been wiped out and the lower limit has been reduced to 19 (i.e., anybody 19 or over without a child who meets income requirements can claim the EITC).

Note a couple of exemptions: Students somewhere in the range of 19 and 24 with half a full-time course load are ineligible.
