In more extensive terms, below the market can likewise be a price or rate that is lower than the current winning conditions in an open market â€” all in all, something underpriced. Goods or services that are offered at a lower price than the "going," or commonplace rate, can be supposed to be below the market.

Assuming something is priced below the market, it suggests that it is underpriced, making it a somewhat decent deal (or "at a bargain"). Assets that trade a discount may hence be below the market.

## Illustration of Below the Market Order

Suppose you are ready to buy shares of XYZ. You open your online trading account and see that XYZ is trading at $50 per share. Since your analysis says that XYZ is worth $49, you put a limit buy order of XYZ at $49. This is below the market and the most you will pay for your shares assuming that they execute.

With a limit order. the investor imparts a maximum price they will pay to purchase a security. Setting a below-the-market limit order will have a lot higher risk of being unfulfilled in the open market. On the off chance that the day's price on the predefined security never falls below its current [trading price](/market-price) or on the other hand assuming it expands, the limit order won't be placed and the investor takes no ownership in the security. Hence, a limit order can mean there is a limited outcome of getting filled.

Be that as it may, assuming the limit order to buy is filled, the order will be placed at the predefined price. In certain trades, just a portion of the shares might be purchased in the event that the broker can't recognize sellers for the whole size mentioned. In the event that this occurs, it is alluded to as a partial fill.

Limit orders that permit investors to determine a below-the-market price for buying a security will contrast from standard market orders. Standard market orders are generally a trading platform's default order type. With a standard market order, an investor in an exceptionally liquid [stock](/stock) would for the most part get the ideal number of shares quickly at the current market price.
