## National Insurance Contributions (NIC): An Overview

National Insurance Contributions (NIC) are taxes paid by British employees and employers to fund government benefits programs, including state pensions. The contributions are made through payroll deductions.

The NIC deduction works similar as the FICA withholding system in the U.S. (FICA represents Federal Insurance Contributions Act. The funds kept pay Social Security and Medicare benefits.)

## Figuring out the NIC

The National Insurance (NI) system was made in 1911 to give assistance to workers who were sick and unemployed. A series of expansions in the 20th century extended its span to add funding for the National Health Service, the public retired person pension plan, and unemployment benefits.

British workers pay their share of NI contributions to build up an entitlement after some time for later payment of a pension and other government benefits, for example, a maternity allowance.

In 2020, the rate was 12% of the laborer's week by week earnings between the equivalent of about $220 every week and about $1,200, dropping to 2% over that maximum.

> The maximum normal pension benefit was about $215 each week starting around 2020.

Employees can make voluntary extra NI contributions to qualify later for a higher pension amount. Self-employed individuals and British residents working outside the country additionally can make voluntary contributions to build towards pension qualification.

An employee who works or hopes to work less than 35 years won't fit the bill for the maximum pension benefit without making extra voluntary payments. The maximum pension benefit in 2020 was about $215 each week. The payout might be higher for employees who make voluntary contributions or concede taking the benefit until a later age.

### A Short History of NIC

The current system of National Insurance in the United Kingdom started with the National Insurance Act 1911 and was limited to a government-funded unemployment benefit.

Around then, health care coverage and pension benefits were administered by private trade unions and "endorsed societies," or professional associations. An Old Age Pension was paid to individuals over age 70, when just a single in four Britons experienced that long.

World War II was approaching its end when the government started considering an expansion of the social safety net in Great Britain. In March 1943, Prime Minister Winston Churchill, in a radio transmission, guaranteed a system of "national compulsory insurance for all classes for all reasons from the support to the grave."

The system was not completely in place until 1948. From that point forward, it has occasionally been overhauled, expanded, and cut back contingent upon the predominant political climate.

Today, British employees pay the National Insurance rate from age 16 through the official retirement age, which is age 65 for most however is slowly increased to age 67.
