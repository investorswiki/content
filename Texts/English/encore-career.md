# Encore Career
## What Is an Encore Career?

An encore career is a subsequent job beginning in the last half of one's life, promoted by creator and social entrepreneur Marc Freedman. An encore career is commonly sought after for its public or social purpose and a feeling of satisfaction as well concerning financial reasons.

While encore careers can be found in any sector, they will generally be bunched in five areas: healthcare, the environment, education, government, and the [nonprofit sector](/non-profitorganization). Freedman depicts the encore career concept in his book **Encore: Finding Work that Matters in the Second Half of Life.**

## Understanding Encore Careers

Freedman contends that encore careers have developed more normal both for economic and social reasons. The traditional [retirement](/retirement) age of 65 emerged from a nineteenth-century manufacturing economy, when workers couldn't physically remain to work longer, and when the average lifespan was not a lot more seasoned. Yet, today, most Americans work in the service sector, where the physical kind of work is far decreased, and frequently live a long time after the age of 65.

Americans are living longer, making exiting the workforce significantly more costly. Workers embrace an encore career since there is more work they are able to do and, generally speaking, since they need to work to support themselves. Further compounding the economic requirement for encore careers is the fact that social security benefits have not stayed up with the cost of retirement.

Even in this way, the large size of the [baby boomer](/baby_boomer) accomplice aging into Social Security means that the program is turning out to be more costly and less liberal. Encore careers are in this way an essential force for keeping up with the relative size of the working population to the retired population.

## Pervasiveness of Encore Careers

Studies have found encore careers turning out to be more normal as the baby boomer accomplice moved toward retirement. A 2011 survey by Penn Schoen Berland found that 9,000,000 Americans were engaged in encore careers, and one more 31 million were keen on starting one. The survey depended on a nationally representative sample of Americans aged 44-70, surveyed online and by telephone.

This addresses a substantial pool of expected labor, which could be turned towards valuable social services projects. The most common encore careers were in education (30%), healthcare (25%), and government (25%), with one more 11% working in the nonprofit sector.

Nonetheless, progressing to an encore career is not exactly simple or easy. 67% of respondents said that they had decreased income or no income by any means while changing to their subsequent careers, and 36% had lessened incomes for more than two years. Financial security was a major factor for those seeking a subsequent career, with 28% of respondents refering to inadequate income as a key motivation. Simply 21% refered to the craving to have a greater effect.

To work with second careers and defeat these financial hardships, "encore cooperations" have been proposed as an expected bridge for those seeking a career change. The Serve America Act, endorsed by President Barack Obama in 2009, incorporates funds for up to ten "encore service programs" in each state.

## Special Considerations

Since more seasoned workers engage in encore careers, these careers will quite often be subjectively not the same as an individual's most memorable career. Numerous workers who have raked in boatloads of cash or accomplished great status in their most memorable career could endeavor to satisfy different values with their encore careers, such as helping other people or propelling a specific political reason.

Freedman contends that encore careers can be comprehensively beneficial to society in light of the fact that numerous more seasoned individuals need to be useful to others as they age. By outfitting this natural inclination, society can both conquer the perceived issues of an aging workforce to the economy, while likewise taking care of social issues with the difficult work and experience more established workers can give.
