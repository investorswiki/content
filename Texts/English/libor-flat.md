# LIBOR Flat
## What Is LIBOR Flat?

LIBOR flat is an interest rate benchmark that is based on the [London Interbank Offered Rate](/libor) (LIBOR). It alludes to the LIBOR rate with no extra spread added. To adapt to credit risk and different factors, banks and different institutions add (or deduct) a spread to the LIBOR flat benchmark while working out the rates to charge different borrowers or the rates that they pay to contributors. LIBOR flat essentially means the base benchmark interbank rate without these changes.

## Grasping LIBOR Flat

LIBOR flat is frequently utilized in interbank lending and interest rate swap contracts. LIBOR flat addresses one of the best global interest rates accessible for short-term lending in the current market. As a universal lending rate, LIBOR is likewise utilized by banks as a base rate for which a risk generated spread level is added for non-interbank lending. This incorporates business loans, home mortgages, or interest paid on savings accounts. Based on the creditworthiness of borrowers and different factors, banks set interest rates that they charge (or pay) based on a reference rate (like LIBOR) plus or minus any changes.

> The Intercontinental Exchange (ICE), the authority responsible for LIBOR, will stop distributing one-week and two-month USD LIBOR after Dec. 31, 2021. Any remaining LIBOR will be discontinued after June 30, 2023.

## LIBOR

LIBOR represents London Interbank Offered Rate. LIBOR is an important [interest rate](/interestrate) continued in the financial services industry. It is generally a check of short-term rates. Global banks principally use LIBOR in their interbank lending as a central interest rate reference. The one-year LIBOR can likewise be utilized as a proxy for savings account rates that pay annual interest.

LIBOR offers seven distinct maturities: overnight, multi week, and one, two, three, six, and 12 months. Consequently, its yield curve formation will change from a more extended curve of yields, for example, the Treasury yield curve which ranges from short term to 20+ years.

Like U.S. Treasury yields, the LIBOR rate changes daily based on the current market environment. Global banks will likewise frequently involve LIBOR with an extra spread as their base rate for commercial and consumer lending.

Due to the [LIBOR scandals](/libor-embarrassment), the Intercontinental Exchange (ICE) has spread out plans to stop the publication of LIBOR. ICE has spread out a speculative date of Dec. 31, 2021, to stop publication of one-week and two-month USD LIBOR, and June 30, 2023, for any remaining LIBOR. The U.K. [Financial Conduct Authority](/financial-conduct-authority-uk-fca) (FCA) and different regulators have been encouraging end-clients to shift away from LIBOR use by 2022.

## LIBOR and Swaps

LIBOR and LIBOR flat are likewise normally utilized in the [interest rate swap](/interestrateswap) market which is vigorously used by banking institutions. Interest rate swaps are developed with a fixed and floating rate component. Counterparties in an interest rate swap will take either a fixed or [floating rate](/floatinginterestrate) position based on their [balance sheet](/balancesheet) exposure and outlook for interest rate levels.

LIBOR flat comprises of a designated LIBOR rate with no extra spread. In a simple interest rate swap model, LIBOR flat can act as the base interest rate. The fixed rate payer might contract to pay interest at the LIBOR rate quoted at the time the transaction begins. This would permit the fixed rate counterparty to pay a fixed LIBOR rate all through the contract.

The floating rate counterparty may consent to pay LIBOR flat over the lifetime of the contract. This would mean the floating rate counterparty pays the market's LIBOR rate of interest at each required interval payment with no extra spread. In this scenario, the floating rate counterparty would benefit when LIBOR diminished while the fixed rate counterparty would benefit when LIBOR increased.
