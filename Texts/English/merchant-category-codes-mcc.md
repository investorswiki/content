# Merchant Category Codes (MCC)
## What Are Merchant Category Codes (MCCs)?

Merchant category codes (MCCs) are four-digit numbers that a credit card issuer utilizations to order the transactions consumers complete utilizing a specific card. Payment brands use merchant category codes to characterize merchants and businesses by the type of goods or services gave to follow and confine transactions.

MCCs can be utilized for tax reporting, interchange promotion, and gathering data about cardholder purchasing behavior.

Frequently, MCCs are recognized by all credit card issuers; be that as it may, not all codes are recognized by all. Issuers much of the time add, take out, or change the codes with routinely planned improvements.

## Understanding Merchant Category Codes

Merchant category codes have several reasons. They frequently decide the rewards that consumers receive for utilizing their credit cards, and decide if a business transaction should be reported to the [IRS](/irs). Besides, they decide the percentage of every transaction a business needs to pay to the credit card processor. The accompanying models are common purposes for merchant category codes.

- Assuming a consumer holds a credit card that offers 5 percent back on airlines, they ought to receive the reward on any purchase that is classified under MCC 4511, which is for airlines and air transporters.
- Companies and government agencies report purchases of services to the IRS so the IRS can ensure those services pay all income taxes owed. On the off chance that businesses make these purchases utilizing a credit card, firms can utilize MCCs to figure out which transactions are classified as services.
- A business classified under the MCC for gas stations some of the time pays different [interchange fees](/interchange-rate) to its credit card processor than a business classified as a vehicle rental company.

## How MCCs Can Boost Credit Card Rewards

People with rewards cards normally earn more rewards in the event that they know their MCCs. Assume you have a credit card offering 5 points for each $1 spent at restaurants. The manner in which the credit card company decides if credit card transactions occurred at a restaurant is by checking the MCCs out. Assuming that you purchase lunch at a small mom-and-pop foundation that consolidates a restaurant with a supermarket, and the MCC orders the foundation as a supermarket, you will not earn 5 points for every $1 on your thought process was a restaurant purchase.

Notwithstanding, on the off chance that you visit this foundation oftentimes and you realize its associated MCC, you can utilize an alternate credit card, maybe one that gives you 3 percent back on supermarket purchases, to boost your cash back.

Another possibility is that a credit card issuer neglects to give you the right amount of points or cash back even for a transaction that has a MCC that ought to trigger the bonus. In this case, you can contact the credit card company and ask them to address the blunder.

To figure out how a transaction is ordered, just glance at your credit card statement. Under "category," you'll perceive the way the credit card company has classified the transaction. As opposed to showing the MCC, the statement normally records the category name, (for example, "supermarkets" or "pharmacies") so you can without much of a stretch understand the data.
