# Management Tenure
## What Is Management Tenure?

Management tenure is the time allotment that an investment manager has been in charge of a [investment fund](/investment-fund). A long-term fund performance record, ideally of five to 10 years, is believed to be a key indicator of a fund manager's investing ability and the fund's future achievement.

## Understanding Management Tenure

Investment managers are the people that run an investment fund, whether that be a [mutual fund](/mutualfund) or a [hedge fund](/hedgefund). Management at a fund can be one person or a group of individuals. They are the most critical part of a fund as they determine its [investment strategy](/investmentstrategy) and, thusly, its prosperity or disappointment.

Investment fund investors are believed to be best served by [investment managers](/investment-manager) who have proved themselves over an extended period of time. The more closely matched a manager's tenure is with a strong fund performance record, the better.

For instance, how about we compare two unique funds: The XYZ Fund has an annualized average 10-year total return of 11% and has been run by the very manager during that period. The ABC Fund has a similar 10-year annualized average total return of 11% however it has had two unique managers.

> A longer management tenure likewise means that investment managers have experienced different [business cycles](/businesscycle), furnishing them with important experience in how to invest on the off chance that the market or economy goes up or down.
>

One's tenure covered the initial nine years, and the second has been at work for just a single year. Will the subsequent manager be just on par with the first? This is an important viewpoint for an investor to choose before investing their capital anticipating a similar performance later on.

Management tenure essentially connects with funds that are [actively managed](/activemanagement) rather than [passively managed](/passivemanagement). Actively managed funds have investment managers that actively buy, hold, and sell investments with an adherence to a specific strategy that tries to outperform a benchmark.

A fund whose history has shown strong performance over an extended period of time with a similar investment manager is probably going to draw in additional investors and thusly more capital as they see the fund's returns because of management's ability. It is many times why somebody investment funds, especially [hedge funds](/hedgefund), have investment managers that are well known and incredibly famous.

## Improves Performance?

Specialists are split on what management tenure demonstrates. A study in the 2014 issue of the **Financial Analysts Journal** named "The Career Paths of Mutual Fund Managers: The Role of Merit," by Gary Porter and Jack Trifts, investigated whether longer-tenured managers delivered [alpha](/alpha), or outperformance, relative to the overall market.

Their study covered the period from 1996 through 2008. The data set incorporated 2,846 funds and 1,825 managers and included 195 funds with managers that had somewhere around 10 years of experience (6.9% of the total). Their research brought about three key discoveries:

- Turnover is somewhat connected with performance. Poor performance prompts terminating.
- At whatever year, even the longest-enduring independent managers are probably not going to create fundamentally more positive style-adjusted month to month returns than negative ones.
- While longer-tenured managers outperformed their friends, they show no ability to deliver alpha, or outperformance, relative to their risk-adjusted benchmarks.

The creators closed: "The key to a long career in the mutual fund industry is by all accounts related more to keeping away from underperformance than to achieving predominant performance."

That being said, management is an important variable in the outcome of a fund. Better investment managers last longer in the industry as they are reliably performing great. Failing to meet expectations investment managers will see their careers cut short as investors won't have any desire to work with them in view of a poor history. The longer the management tenure, the more probable it is that the management has been effective.
