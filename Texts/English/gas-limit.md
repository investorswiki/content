# Gas Limit
The term gas limit alludes to the maximum price a [cryptocurrency](/cryptocurrency) client will pay while sending a transaction, or playing out a smart contract function, in the Ethereum blockchain. These fees are calculated in gas unit, and the gas limit characterizes the maximum value that the transaction or function would be able "charge" or take from the client. Thusly, the gas limit functions as a security mechanism that prevents high fees from being erroneously charged due to a bug or blunder in a smart contract.
Some [wallets](/bitcoin-wallet) and service give setup the gas prices and gas limit consequently, however at times, users are likewise able to adjust them physically, as per their necessities. By and large, a customary Ether (ETH) transaction would be made with, in any event, a 21,000 gas limit. In the event that the gas limit and gas price ([Gwei](/gwei-ethereum)) are set to a higher level, the operation will happen a lot quicker. In any case, quicker operations will probably charge higher fees. Then again, an exceptionally low gas limit and gas price would be dangerous on the grounds that transactions could take too long to be confirmed, or even stall out (fail).
Notwithstanding, what truly characterizes the value paid for transaction fees is the gas price. The gas price is more powerful than the gas limit in light of the fact that the last option is just a definition of the maximum value. All in all, the total cost of a transaction is the gas price (in Gwei) duplicated by the gas limit, which will bring about the amount of Ether to be paid.
