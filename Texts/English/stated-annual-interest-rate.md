# Stated Annual Interest Rate
## What Is the Stated Annual Interest Rate?

The stated annual interest rate, in some cases alluded to as SAR, is the [return on an investment](/returnoninvestment) (ROI) that is communicated as an every year percentage. A simple interest rate calculation doesn't account for any [compounding](/compounding) that happens consistently.

## Understanding the Stated Annual Interest Rate

The stated annual return is the simple annual return that a bank gives you on a loan. Dissimilar to the [effective annual interest rate](/effectiveinterest), or EAR, this [interest rate](/interestrate) doesn't produce the results of compound interest into account.

At the point when banks charge interest, the stated interest rate is frequently utilized rather than the effective annual interest rate to cause consumers to accept that they are paying a lower interest rate. For instance, for a [loan](/loan) at a stated interest rate of 30%, compounded month to month, the effective annual interest rate would be 34.48%. In such situations, banks will ordinarily publicize the stated interest rate rather than the effective interest rate.

For the interest a bank pays on a deposit account, the effective annual rate is advertised on the grounds that it looks more alluring. For instance, for a deposit at a stated rate of 10% compounded month to month, the effective annual interest rate would be 10.47%. Banks will publicize the effective annual interest rate of 10.47% as opposed to the stated interest rate of 10%.

## Stated Annual Interest Rate versus Effective Annual Interest Rate

The effective annual interest rate accounts for intra-year compounding, which can happen on a daily, month to month, or quarterly basis. The more as often as possible compounding happens, the higher the effective interest rate and the difference between the stated interest rate will be. For loans that don't compound interest, the stated rate and the effective rate are something very similar.

Investors can compare products and work out which type of interest will offer the most positive return. Normally, the effective annual interest rate will be higher than the stated annual interest rate due to the power of compounding.

The effective annual rate is a key instrument for assessing the true [return](/return) on an investment or the true interest rate on a loan and is frequently utilized for sorting out the best financial strategies for individuals or organizations.

## Illustration of a Stated Annual Interest Rate

A $10,000, one-year [certificate of deposit](/certificateofdeposit) (CD) with a stated annual interest rate of 10% will earn $1,000 at maturity.

On the off chance that the money was put in an interest-earning [savings account](/savingsaccount) that paid 10% compounded month to month, the account will earn interest at a rate of 0.833% every month (10% separated by a year; 10/12 = 0.833). Throughout the span of the year, this account will earn $1,047.13 in interest, at an effective annual interest rate of 10.47%, which is strikingly higher than the returns on the 10% stated annual interest rate of the CD.

## Ascertaining the Effective Annual Rate

Compound interest is one of the fundamental principles of finance. The concept is said to have originated in seventeenth century Italy. Frequently portrayed as "interest on interest," compound interest causes a sum to develop at a quicker rate than [simple interest](/simple_interest) or going with a stated annual rate â€” as this is just calculated on the principal amount as stated previously.

The specific formula for working out compound interest on the effective annual rate is:

(Where **i** = nominal annual interest rate in percentage terms, and **n** = number of compounding periods.)

## Ascertaining SAR and EAR in Excel

Succeed is a common device for working out compound interest. One method is to duplicate every year's [new balance](/new-balance) by the interest rate. For instance, assume you deposit $1,000 into a savings account with a 5% interest rate that compounds annually and you need to compute the balance in five years.

On Microsoft Excel, enter "Year" into cell A1 and "Balance" into cell B1. Enter years 0 to 5 into cells A2 through A7. The balance for year 0 is $1,000, so you would enter "1000" into cell B2. Next, enter "=B2*1.05" into cell B3. Then enter "=B3*1.05" into cell B4 and keep on doing this until you get to cell B7. In cell B7, the calculation is "=B6*1.05."

At last, the calculated value in cell B7, $1,216.65, is the balance in your savings account following five years. To find the compound interest value, deduct $1,000 from $1,216.65; this provides you with a value of $216.65.

## Features
- Effective annual rates really do account for intra-year compounding of interest.
- Banks will frequently show whichever rate shows up better, as per the financial product they're selling.
- The stated annual rate depicts an annualized rate of interest that doesn't produce into account the results of intra-year compounding.
