## What Is a Qualified Pre-Retirement Survivor Annuity?

A qualified pre-retirement survivor annuity (QPSA) is a death benefit that is paid to the enduring spouse of a deceased employee. Assuming the employee bites the dust before retirement, the qualified pre-retirement survivor annuity is paid to offer compensation to the enduring spouse for the loss of retirement benefits that would have in any case been paid to the employee. As the name suggests, QPSAs are paid exclusively on account of [qualified plans](/qrp).

## Figuring out QPSA

A QPSA gives a way to an individual to accommodate their enduring spouse or one more beneficiary would it be a good idea for them they become deceased prior to the institution of their retirement benefits. QPSA benefits are ones that must be offered with a wide range of qualified plans to vested participants. A portion of these plans incorporate defined-benefit plans and money purchase plans.

The [Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA](/erisa)) commands how the payments for a QPSA ought to be calculated. Both the employee and the spouse must approve a waiver of QPSA benefits and have it seen by either a notary public or an authorized plan representative.

In certain occurrences, a Qualified Domestic Relations Order (QDRO) is required. The QDRO is a judgment or order for a retirement plan to pay child support, alimony, or property rights to a spouse, child, or one more dependent of a participant.

As indicated by the [Internal Revenue Service](/irs) (IRS), a "QPSA is a form of a death benefit paid as a [life annuity](/lifeannuity) (a series of payments, typically month to month, forever) to the enduring spouse (or former spouse, child or dependent who must be treated as an enduring spouse under a QDRO) of a participant," where there are set conditions that must be met.

## Special Considerations for a QPSA

For QPSA payments to be made, the participant must have vested benefits and passed on before retirement. Too, on the off chance that a spouse is to receive QPSA payments, they must be married for no less than one year.

A few types of qualified plans might be exempt from being required to give a QPSA to an enduring spouse. This occurs with [defined-commitment plans](/definedcontributionplan), on the off chance that the plans don't offer a life annuity option, or on the other hand assuming the plans require the benefit be paid in full to the enduring spouse.

A QPSA notice must be shipped off the participant on the off chance that the plan offers a qualified pre-retirement survivor annuity. The notice must be sent when the participant is between the ages of 32 and 35, or in the span of one year from when an employee turns into a plan participant on the off chance that they are more established than 35.
