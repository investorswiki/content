## Grasping Total Tax

The total tax is progressive and in view of the payer's income. The [Internal Revenue Service](/irs) (IRS) distributes income thresholds for seven [tax brackets](/federal_tax_brackets) going from 10% to 37% every year.

The total tax number is the close to-last step in the tax formula, and it accounts for all credits and deductions due to the taxpayer however no tax payments made during the year. Total tax is then compared with payments made to see whether a refund is due or a balance owed.

## Total Tax Examples Under the New Tax Law

For a married couple filing jointly in 2022, the most reduced total tax is 10% and applies to income up to $20,550. Accordingly assuming the couple earned $19,000, they would owe exactly $1,900 in federal income tax. A subsequent speculative couple with an income more than $647,850 would pay the highest percentage of 37%.

Yet, note that the tax is graduated: the high-earning couple would owe just 10% on the first $20,550, equivalent to the first couple, etc through every one of the brackets. The main income taxed at 37 percent would be their earnings more than $647,850. In that capacity, a couple earning $80,000 in 2022 would owe a total tax of $17,600.

## Illustration of How Deductions Affect Total Tax

Total tax incorporates income, the [alternative least tax](/alternativeminimumtax), and [self-employment tax](/selfemploymenttax). It is calculated after deductions, which have been simplified and to some degree increased for most filers with the most recent tax reform.

For instance, under the pre-2018 tax system, married couples filing jointly were qualified for a standard deduction of $13,850. In 2021, they will receive a standard deduction of $25,100, and in 2022, the standard deduction bounces $800 more. While these sums might appear to be critical compared to 2018 figures, the government has likewise dispensed with the individual exemption of $4,050 (or $8,100 for a couple).

The higher standard deduction will mean less homeowners can claim the mortgage interest deduction and other personal deductions, which must be higher than the standard deduction to produce results.

At long last, note that while the total tax is to be sure total, it is not really permanent. Many parts of the 2017 tax reform act have sunset provisions. The most important from the angle of working class taxpayers will be the expiration toward the finish of 2025 of a large portion of the new deduction and exemption rules. Except if Congress acts before then, at that point, the total tax for most filers will then, at that point, return pretty much to the previous levels.
