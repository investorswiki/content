# Different Tops
## What Are Multiple Tops?

Different tops allude to a reversal chart pattern checked by technical traders out. Different tops happen when a security fails to break through to new highs on at least two events. This trend is deciphered as a signal to sell the specific security.

## Grasping Multiple Tops

Numerous tops can be a reference to double or triple tops. A various top generally creates toward the finish of an uptrend in a security or index. As the uptrend becomes dim in similar overall area numerous days or weeks separated, the security returns to each event and lays out a support level, which is the price level at which the bulls shore it up. On the off chance that it keeps on failing to break through the firm resistance offered by the numerous top region, eventually, the bears will prevail with regards to pushing it below the support level. The downside break of this support level would be convincing evidence of the various top pattern formation.

The profit objective equals the $2.50 difference between the triple top and support level (i.e., $15.00 - $12.50). This means that the trader would have a price target of $10 on the short sale, for a profit objective of $2.50 ($12.50 - $2.50).

Of course, aggressive traders who are especially bearish on the stock may not hang tight for the downside break at $12.50 to short it. They might go into the short sale after the stock has failed to break through $15 for the third time, as opposed to hang tight for confirmation of the sell signal on the downside break at $12.50.
