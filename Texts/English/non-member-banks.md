# Non-Member Banks
## What Are Non-Member Banks?

Non-member banks are banks that are not members of the U.S. [Federal Reserve System](/federalreservesystem). Similarly as with member banks, non-member banks are subject to [reserve requirements](/requiredreserves), which they need to keep up with by putting a percentage of their deposits at a [Federal Reserve Bank](/federalreservebank). In spite of the fact that non-member banks are not required to purchase stock in their district Federal Reserve banks, they actually approach services offered by the Federal Reserve, for example, its discount window based on similar conditions as member banks.

## How Non-Member Banks Work

Non-member banks must be state-chartered since all nationally-[chartered banks](/charteredbank) fundamentally must be members of the Federal Reserve System. One explanation that state-chartered banks might choose to shun membership is that regulation can be less onerous, some accept, under the [Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation](/fdic) (FDIC), which administers non-member banks as opposed to the Federal Reserve Banks (member banks report to regional Federal Reserve banks).

Contingent upon where they are found, non-member banks are simply subject to state laws, as opposed to federal laws, so they might opt for less-directed operations in a state like North Dakota. What's more, they are able to keep essentially a part of their reserves in interest-bearing securities. Non-member banks, similar to members, actually receive services from the Federal Reserve System, including check clearing, electronic funds developments, and automated clearing house payments.

Turning into a member is just a question of presenting an application, satisfying the requirements, and going through a waiting period. Some non-member banks purposeful on this decision carefully and take part in the process in estimated advances assuming that they accept that being a member is eventually more beneficial than staying a non-member. There are likewise instances of, in extreme cases, non-member banks choosing to change their status to exploit certain benefits of turning out to be part of the U.S. Federal Reserve System.

## Instances of Non-Member Banks

In 2008, some non-member banks escaped into the arms of the Federal Reserve System for protection. Such was the case with investment bank Goldman Sachs, which confronted economic uncertainty during the financial crisis in 2008. The investment bank modestly looked for and received member status to access the Fed's discount window and start taking government-ensured deposits from the public. In a press release proclaiming its new status, the bank turned it along these lines: "We accept that Goldman Sachs, under Federal Reserve supervision, will be viewed as an even safer institution with an uncommonly clean balance sheet and a greater diversity of funding sources."

Different instances of non-member banks incorporate the Bank of the West, GMAC Bank, and the Bank of North Dakota.
