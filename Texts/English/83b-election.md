# 83(b) Election
## What Is the 83(b) Election?

The 83(b) election is a provision under the Internal Revenue Code (IRC) that gives an employee, or startup pioneer, the option to pay taxes on the total fair market value of [restricted stock](/restrictedstock) at the hour of conceding.

## Understanding the 83(b) Election

The 83(b) election applies to equity that is subject to vesting, and it alarms the [Internal Revenue Service](/irs) (IRS) to tax the balloter for the ownership at the hour of giving, as opposed to at the hour of stock vesting.

The 83(b) election records must be shipped off the IRS in the span of 30 days after the giving of restricted shares. As well as informing the IRS of the election, the beneficiary of the equity must likewise present a copy of the completed election form to their employer.

In effect, a 83(b) election means that you pre-pay your [tax liability](/taxliability) on a low valuation, expecting the equity value increases before very long. Nonetheless, if the value of the company rather declines reliably and persistently, this tax strategy would at last mean that you overpaid in taxes by pre-paying on higher equity valuation.

Commonly, when a pioneer or employee receives compensation of equity in a company, the stake is subject to [income tax](/incometax) as per its value. The [fair market value](/fairmarketvalue) of the equity at the hour of the giving or transfer is the basis for the assessment of tax liability. The tax due must be paid in the genuine year the stock is issued or transferred.

Notwithstanding, generally speaking, the individual receives equity vesting north of several years. Employees might earn company shares as they stay employed after some time. In which case, the tax on the equity value is due at the hour of vesting. Assuming the company's value becomes over the vesting period, the tax paid during each vested year will likewise rise in agreement.

## Illustration of a 83(b) Election

For instance, a fellow benefactor of a company is conceded 1 million shares subject to vesting and valued at $0.001 at the time the shares are allowed. Right now, the shares are worth the [par value](/parvalue) of $0.001 x number of shares, or $1,000, which the fellow benefactor pays. The shares address a 10% ownership of the firm for the prime supporter and will be vested over a period of five years, and that means that they will receive 200,000 shares consistently for quite some time. In every one of the five vested years, they should pay tax on the fair market value of the 200,000 shares vested.

On the off chance that the total value of the company's equity increases to $100,000, the prime supporter's 10% value increases to $10,000 from $1,000. The prime supporter's tax liability for year 1 will be derived from ($10,000 - $1,000) x 20% for example in effect, ($100,000 - $10,000) x 10% x 20% = $1,800.

- $100,000 is the Year 1 value of the firm
- $10,000 is the value of the firm at initiation or the book value
- 10% is the ownership stake of the fellow benefactor
- 20% addresses the 5-year vesting period for the fellow benefactor's 1 million shares (200,000 shares/1 million shares)

On the off chance that, in year 2, the stock value increases further to $500,000, the prime supporter's taxes will be ($500,000 - $10,000) x 10% x 20% = $9,800. By year 3, the value goes up to $1 million and the tax liability will be assessed from ($1 million - $10,000) x 10% x 20% = $19,800. Of course, in the event that the total value of equity continues to move in Year 4 and Year 5, the prime supporter's extra taxable income will likewise increase for every one of the years.

If sometime in the not too distant future, every one of the shares sell for a profit, the prime supporter will be subject to a [capital gains tax](/capital_gains_tax) on his gain from the proceeds of the sale.

## 83(b) Election Tax Strategy

The 83(b) election gives the prime supporter the option to pay taxes on the equity upfront before the vesting period begins. This tax strategy will just expect that tax be paid on the book value of $1,000. The 83(b) election tells the IRS that the voter has selected to report the difference between the amount paid for the stock and the fair market value of the stock as taxable income. The share value during the 5-year [vesting](/vesting) period won't make any difference as the prime supporter won't pay any extra tax and will hold the vested shares. Nonetheless, if the shares for sold for a profit, a capital gains tax will be applied.

Following our model above, if the prime supporter makes a 83(b) election to pay tax on the value of the stock upon issuance, the [tax assessment](/assessedvalue) will be made on $1,000 as it were. Assuming the stock is sold later, say, a decade for $250,000, the taxable capital gain will be on $249,000 ($250,000 - $1,000 = $249,000).

The 83(b) election seems OK when the balloter is certain that the value of the shares will increase throughout the next few years. Additionally, in the event that the amount of income reported is small at the hour of giving, a 83(b) election may be beneficial.

In a reverse scenario where the 83(b) election was set off, and the equity value falls or the company files for bankruptcy, then the taxpayer overpaid in taxes for shares with a lesser or worthless amount. Sadly, the IRS doesn't allow an overpayment claim of taxes under the 83(b) election. For instance, consider an employee whose total tax liability upfront in the wake of filing for a 83(b) election is $50,000. Since the vested stock proceeds to decline north of a 4-year vesting period, they would have been better off without the 83(b) election, paying an annual tax on the decreased value of the vested equity for every one of the four years, it is influential for expect the decline.

Another occurrence where a 83(b) election would end up being a weakness will be in the event that the employee leaves the firm before the vesting period is finished. In this case, they would have paid taxes on shares that sounds received. Likewise, in the event that the amount of reported income is substantial at the hour of stock giving, filing for a 83(b) election won't seem OK.
