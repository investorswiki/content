# Pinning the Strike
## What Is Pinning the Strike?

Pinning the strike is the propensity of an underlying security's market price to close at or extremely close to the strike price of vigorously traded options (in a similar security) as the [expiration](/expiration-time) time approaches. This doesn't necessarily happen, yet it is probably going to happen when there is huge [open interest](/openinterest) in a specific terminating option that is [near the money](/close the-money).

For instance, on the off chance that a stock is trading close $50 and there is heavy trading in the two puts and calls at this strike price, there is a propensity at the stock cost to be "pinned" at $50 as traders unwind their situations at expiration.

## How Pinning the Strike Works

Pinning the strike most frequently happens in stock markets with listed options, however may happen for options with any kind of underlying. Pinning the strike happens most often when there is a large amount of open interest in the [calls](/calloption) and [puts](/putoption) of a specific strike as expiration approaches.

This is on the grounds that options traders become progressively presented to gamma as contracts approach expiration, advancing quickly into the hours just before the expiration date and time. Gamma is the sensitivity of an option's [delta](/delta) to changes in the price of the underlying. The delta, thusly, is the sensitivity of an option's price (or, premium) to changes in the price of the underlying.

As the gamma develops, small changes in the underlying security's price will make increasingly large changes to the option's delta. Options traders, who are frequently [hedging](/hedge) to be [delta neutral](/deltaneutral) (directional neutral), should buy or sell progressively large numbers of shares in the underlying to keep their risk exposure in check.

Pinning a strike forces [pin risk](/pinrisk) for options traders, where they become uncertain whether they ought to [exercise](/exercise) their long options that have expired at the money, or extremely close to being at the money. This is on the grounds that simultaneously, they are uncertain of the number of their comparative short positions they will be [assigned](/task) on.

## Instance of Pinning the Strike

For instance, say XYZ stock is trading at $50.10 and there is a great deal of open interest in the 50 strike calls and puts. Say that a trader is long the calls. As the stock goes from $50.10 to $50.25, deltas will increase, and at a quicker rate as the stock increases â€” thus the trader will hope to sell the stock at prices of $50.25 and lower, pushing its price back toward $50.

The owner of a hedged long put will likewise have to sell shares as the stock ascents from $50.10 to $50.25 in light of the fact that shares are now owned as a hedge against the long put. In any case, as the stock ascents, the put options' deltas decline at a stimulating pace, and too many shares will be held long. This prompts the need to sell, again pushing its price back toward $50.

Say the price rather dips under $50, down to say $49.90. Presently the call holder should buy shares since they will be short too many shares from before since the call's deltas have gotten increasingly small. Moreover, the put owner should buy shares on the grounds that the put deltas would have become increasingly large and they don't possess sufficient stock. This will push the price back to $50.

## The Bottom Line

Pinning the strike is a common occurrence in the market for options. At the point when there is strong open interest in a specific options contract, the price of the underlying security will in general remain nearby the strike price upon the arrival of expiration.

## FAQ
### How Do You Avoid Pin Risk?

### What Happens After a Stock Is Pinned?
Assuming that a stock is pinned at or close to the strike price of certain options contracts, then, at that point, almost certainly, a large number of put or call options on that security might be in the money, leading holders of those contracts to exercise their options. This means that the organizations underwriting those options should buy or sell a large number of shares at an unfavorable price.
