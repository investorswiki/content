# Reverse Repurchase Agreement
## What Is a Reverse Repurchase Agreement (RRP)?

A reverse repurchase agreement, or "reverse repo," is the purchase of [securities](/security) with the agreement to sell them at a higher price at a specific future date. For the party selling the security (and consenting to repurchase it later on), it is a [repurchase agreement](/repurchaseagreement) (RP) or repo. For the party on the opposite finish of the transaction (buying the security and consenting to sell from here on out), it is a reverse repurchase agreement (RRP) or reverse repo.

Outstandingly, [Federal Reserve Bank](/federalreservebank) RRPs and repos are marked in light of the perspective of the counterparty, not their own perspective.

## How Reverse Repurchase Agreements Work

Repos are classified as a money-market instrument, and they are normally used to raise short-term capital. Reverse repurchase agreements (RRPs) are the buyer end of a repurchase agreement. These [financial instruments](/financialinstrument) are likewise called collateralized loans, buy/sell back loans, and sell/buy back loans.

Reverse repos are normally utilized by businesses like lending institutions or investors to loan short-term capital to different businesses during [cash flow](/cashflow) issues. Fundamentally, the lender buys a [business asset](/business-asset), equipment or even shares in the seller's company and at a set future time, sells the asset back at a higher cost.

The higher price addresses the interest to the buyer for advancing money to the seller during the duration of the deal. The asset acquired by the buyer acts as collateral against any default risk it faces from the seller. Short-term RRPs hold more modest [collateral](/collateral) risks than long-term RRPs as over the long term, assets held as collateral can frequently deteriorate in value, causing collateral risk for the RRP buyer.

In a macro illustration of RRPs, the Fed utilizes repos and RRPs to give stability in lending markets through [open market operations](/openmarketoperations) (OMO). The RRP transaction is utilized less frequently than a repo by the Fed, as a repo puts money into the banking system when it is short, though a RRP gets money from the system when there is too much liquidity. The Fed conducts RRPs to keep up with long-term [monetary policy](/monetarypolicy) and guarantee capital liquidity levels in the market.

Quite, the Fed depicts these transactions from the perspective of the other party, not their own perspective. So a Fed RRP or reverse repo agreement is really a RRP for the other party. In a Fed RRP, they are the ones selling securities and the other party is purchasing the securities.

## Special Considerations

Part of the business of repos and RRPs is developing, as third-party collateral management administrators are offering types of assistance to foster RRPs for the benefit of investors and give quick funding to businesses out of luck.

As quality collateral is some of the time hard to track down, businesses are making the most of these assets as a quality method for funding expansion and equipment acquisition using triparty repos, bringing about RRP opportunities for investors. This section of the industry is known as collateral management optimization and productivity.

## RRP versus Buy or Sell Backs

A RRP varies from buy or sell moves in a simple yet clear manner. Buy or sell back agreements legally document every transaction separately, giving clear separation in every transaction. Along these lines, every transaction can legally remain all alone without the enforcement of the other. RRPs, then again, have each phase of the agreement legally documented inside a similar contract and guarantee the availability and right to each phase of the agreement.

In conclusion, in a RRP, albeit collateral is fundamentally purchased, generally the collateral never changes physical location or real ownership. On the off chance that the seller [defaults](/default2) against the buyer, the collateral would should be physically moved.
