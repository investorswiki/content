# Actively-Managed Funds
With actively managed funds, managers pick stocks or different securities considering a certain goal, such as beating a specific index or achieving a certain level of return while expecting a certain level of risk. Since there's stock-picking going on, these funds will generally have higher expense ratios, and higher taxes, than inactively managed funds.
