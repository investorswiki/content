## What Is Kin?

Kin is the [cryptocurrency](/cryptocurrency) for the informing service Kik. Kin includes special purposes inside the Kik courier platform. Users can earn Kin for making contributions to the more extensive Kik community, and afterward spend Kin on different goods and services inside the Kik platform.

## Grasping Kin

Kin originally sent off in September of 2017 through an initial coin offering (ICO), bringing generally $100 million up in investor funds over a period of around fourteen days. Upon its send off, the founders of Kin portrayed the Kin Ecosystem as "planned explicitly to unite individuals in another shared economy," with the cryptocurrency itself going about as a "foundation for a decentralized ecosystem of digital services."

While most companies that send off their own cryptocurrency don't be guaranteed to have an instant client base, Kik enjoyed a key benefit here with a great many active users through its informing platform. Thusly, the platform helped drive consumer adoption of the Kin cryptocurrency. The Kik app can house a considerable lot of the customarily third-party services and highlights for the currency, including the Kin wallet.

Despite the fact that Kin was officially sent off late in 2017, it comes closely following a large experimental campaign done by Kik. Over a period of close to three years, Kik ran a project called Kik Points. This was basically the same as Kin in that it offered Kik users the chance to earn and spend points inside the app itself. At its highest levels, Kik Points arrived at transaction volumes equivalent to three times a greater number of than Bitcoin.

### Kin Rewards Engine

Maybe even more notable about the send off of Kin is its Kin Rewards Engine. Through that, Kik sent off Kin as a daily reward distributed among partners by an algorithm based on the community's contribution to the ecosystem.

Ted Livingston — Kik CEO and pioneer — suggested that the Kin token is an opportunity to disseminate value among designers. The thought is that Kik will offer value, boosting designers to "assemble an open and decentralized ecosystem of apps" on the Kik platform.

### The Kin Foundation

The Kin Foundation centers around the governance of Kin and spotlights on "growing an open ecosystem of digital services." The ecosystem isn't be based around advertising, as numerous social media platforms are, but instead on users having the option to offer some incentive to themselves and each other, and on those users being rewarded for that contribution.

Other than being a digital currency, the Kin website portrays the token as "not quite the same as other digital currencies since it is a cryptocurrency." Kin is like Bitcoin in that it utilizes the public [blockchain ](/blockchain)and has monetary value. The way that Kin is part of a blockchain permits its designers to control the creation and flow of tokens to prevent a flood. Blockchain support likewise permits a token to be guaranteed over the long term.

The informing service stayed in one piece, however this came not long after the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) sued Kik for fund-raising in its Kin ICO without registering the offering.

In 2020, the SEC decided that Kik violated federal securities law by selling Kin in 2017 and was requested to pay a $5 million fine. Be that as it may, the informing service was not required to close down the Kin network, nor required to register Kin with the SEC. Subsequently, sales of Kin can in any case occur.
