# Net Proceeds
## What Are Net Proceeds?

Net proceeds are the amount the seller receives following the sale of a [asset](/asset) after all costs and expenses are deducted from the gross proceeds. Contingent upon the asset sold, the costs might account for a small percentage of the gross proceeds or a substantial percentage of the gross proceeds. [Capital gains taxes](/capital_gains_tax) are paid on the net proceeds of a sale as opposed to the gross proceeds.

## Figuring out Net Proceeds

Net proceeds are the last amount a seller receives from the sale of an asset after all costs have been thought about. Contingent upon the asset, the cost can include:

- Fees, for example, legal and evaluations
- Ability or technology-related fees
- Commissions, for example, brokerage or technology platforms commissions
- Advertising or digital media costs
- Taxes
- Regulatory expenses

It's important to know about every one of the costs that go into a sale of an asset as it will assist with deciding the fitting selling price.

One area that generally influences net proceeds from a sale is the sale of a house. While working out net proceeds on a home sale, the outstanding home loan or different liens on the property, commission for the seller's agent and the purchaser's agent, excise tax, and other closing costs owed by the seller, are deducted from the gross sale price of the home. In the event that negative net proceeds result, the seller must give cash at the hour of closing to pay off the home loan or receive the bank's endorsement for a [short sale](/real-estate-short-sale).

## Net Proceeds and Capital Gains Taxes

Pay from selling stocks, [mutual funds](/mutualfund), property, or different assets is reported on a personal or corporate tax return. Taxes are paid on the asset's capital gains as opposed to on its selling price.

While working out capital gains or losses, the amount paid to get the asset, called its basis, must be known. For instance, consider an investor who purchases $6,000 in stock and pays a $24 commission. The stock's basis is $6,024. At the point when an asset is inherited, its basis is the [fair market value](/fairmarketvalue) on the date of the individual's demise no matter what the amount paid for the asset.

Net proceeds must be calculated also. For instance, a similar investor sells the stock for $8,000 and pays a $32 commission. The net proceeds are $7,968. The basis is deducted from the asset's net proceeds. Since $7,968 - $6,024 = $1,944, the capital gain is $1,944.

## Illustration of Net Proceeds

As referenced, selling a house is an area where costs are changed that decide the net proceeds of the sale. Suppose Jim is selling his home for $100,000. With the sale comes many costs that first should be added to show up at total costs.

The costs associated with the sale of the house are:

- Real estate agent fee: $5,000
- Advertising costs: $1,000
- Closing costs: $6,000
- Total Costs: $12,000

To show up at the net proceeds we would take away the total costs from the sales cost of the house.

Net Proceeds = $100,000 - $12,000 = $88,000

## Features
- The amount that comprises the net proceeds could be marginal or substantial, contingent upon the asset that has been sold.
- Net proceeds are the amount the seller brings back home subsequent to selling an asset, minus all costs and expenses that have been deducted from the gross proceeds.
- Capital gains taxes must be paid on the net proceeds of a sale, not the gross proceeds.
