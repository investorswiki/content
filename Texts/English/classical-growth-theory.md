# Classical Growth Theory
## What Is Classical Growth Theory?

Classical growth theory is a modern category of economic theory that is applied to crafted by several economists who expounded on the cycle and sources of economic growth in their time, generally the eighteenth and nineteenth hundreds of years. Two important scholars associated with these thoughts incorporate Adam Smith and [David Ricardo](/david-ricardo).

## Figuring out Classical Growth Theory

Classical growth theory was developed alongside the Industrial Revolution in Great Britain. Analysis of the course of economic growth was a central focal point of these classical economists. Classical economists tried to give an account of the broad powers that impacted economic growth and of the instruments underlying the growth interaction.

The division of labor, the gains from trade, and the accumulation of capital were viewed as the vitally main impetuses of economic growth. Productive investment and the reinvestment of profits were the systems that delivered continuous economic growth, so changes in the rate of profit were a conclusive reference point for an analysis of the long-term development of the economy.

They contended that individual initiative, under freely competitive conditions to advance individual finishes, would deliver beneficial outcomes to society as a whole. Their decisions upheld the adoption of free trade, respect for private property, and individual free enterprise. In the mean time, clashing economic interests could be accommodated by the operation of competitive market powers and the limited activity of dependable government.

These economists' thoughts veered from previous economic perspectives. Their critique of primitive society that preceded them depended on the perception among others: that a large part of the social product was not really very much invested yet was consumed unproductively by the ruling class. They followed the French physiocrats in concentrating on the economic welfare of a nation as a whole, rather than the [mercantilist](/mercantilism) center around the accumulation of gold for the king. They split from the physiocrats by zeroing in on, and praising, industry and capital accumulation as a source of economic thriving.

## Adam Smith and the Wealth of Nations

Scottish economist Adam Smith was the leading figure of the classical theory of growth. Smith composed that the division of labor among workers into additional particular tasks was the driver of growth in the change to an industrial, capitalist economy. As the Industrial Revolution matured, Smith contended that the availability of specific devices and equipment would permit workers to additionally practice and in this manner increase their productivity. For this to occur, progressing capital accumulation was vital, which relied upon the owners of capital having the option to keep and reinvest profits from their investments. He made sense of this cycle with the allegory of the "[invisible hand](/invisiblehand)" of profits, which would push capitalists to take part in this course of investment, productivity gains, and reinvestment by seeking their very own gain, and by implication the benefit of the whole nation.

## David Ricardo and the Gains from Trade

David Ricardo extended Smith's theory to demonstrate how trade could lead to additional economic flourishing on top of the gains from specialization and the division of labor. He developed the concept of [comparative advantage](/comparativeadvantage) as a basis for specialization and applied this not exclusively to workers in a single economy however to separate nations that could trade with each other. Ricardo contended that by represent considerable authority in activities for which they each had the least [opportunity cost](/opportunitycost) and afterward trading their surplus product, nations (and by extension workers and firms inside an economy) could be generally improved off. Ricardo's theory of comparative advantage fortified the foundation of Smith's theory of specialization and division of labor as a source of economic growth.
