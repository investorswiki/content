# Inflationary Gap
## What Is an Inflationary Gap?

An inflationary gap is a macroeconomic concept that measures the difference between the current level of [real gross domestic product](/realgdp) (GDP) and the [GDP](/gdp) that would exist assuming an economy was operating at [full employment](/fullemployment).

## Figuring out an Inflationary Gap

An inflationary gap exists when the demand for goods and services surpasses production due to factors like higher levels of overall employment, increased [trade](/trade) activities, or raised government expenditure.

Against this scenery, the real GDP can surpass the possible GDP, bringing about an inflationary gap. The inflationary gap is named as such in light of the fact that the relative rise in real GDP causes a [economy](/economy) to increase its consumption, leading prices to move over the long haul.

> For the gap to be viewed as inflationary, the current real GDP must be higher than the economy-at-full-employment GDP â€” otherwise called expected GDP.

The inflationary gap addresses the point in the [business cycle](/businesscycle) when the economy is growing. Due to the higher number of funds accessible inside the economy, consumers are more disposed to purchase goods and services. As demand for goods and services increases yet production has not yet compensated for the shift, prices rise to reestablish market [equilibrium](/equilibrium).

At the point when the potential GDP is higher than the real GDP, the gap is rather alluded to as a deflationary gap. The other type of output gap is the [recessionary gap](/recessionarygap), which portrays an economy operating below its full-employment equilibrium.

## Ascertaining Real Gross Domestic Product (GDP)

As per [macroeconomic](/macroeconomics) theory, the goods market decides the level of real GDP, which is displayed in the accompanying relationship. To work out real GDP, first register the [nominal GDP](/nominalgdp):

Y = C + I + G + NX

Where:

- Y = nominal GDP
- C = consumption expenditure
- I = venture
- G = government expenditure
- NX = [net exports](/netexports)

Then, the real GDP = Y/D, where D is the [GDP deflator](/gdppricedeflator), which takes inflation into effect over the long run.

An increase in consumption expenditure, investments, government expenditure, or net exports makes real GDP rise in the short run. Real GDP gives a measure of economic growth while compensating for the effects of [inflation](/inflation) or [deflation](/deflation). This delivers an outcome that accounts for the difference between real economic growth and a simple shift in the prices of goods or services inside the economy.

## Fiscal and Monetary Policy to Manage the Inflationary Gap

A government might decide to utilize [fiscal policy](/fiscalpolicy) to assist with lessening an inflationary gap, frequently through decreasing the number of funds circulating inside the economy. This can be achieved through reductions in government spending, tax increases, [bond](/bond) and securities issues, and transfer payment reductions.

These acclimations to the fiscal conditions inside the economy can reestablish [economic equilibrium](/economic-equilibrium). As the amount of money in circulation diminishes, the overall demand for goods and services declines, too, decreasing inflation.

Central banks additionally have tools at their disposal to combat inflationary activity. At the point when the [Federal Reserve](/federalreservebank) (Fed) raises [interest rates](/interestrate), it makes borrowing funds more costly.

[Tight monetary policy](/tightmonetarypolicy) ought to hence bring down the amount of money accessible to most consumers, triggering less demand and prices or inflation to withdraw. Whenever equilibrium is reached, the Fed or other [central bank](/centralbank) can then shift interest rates appropriately.

## Features
- For the gap to be viewed as inflationary, the current real GDP must be higher than the possible GDP.
- An inflationary gap measures the difference between the current level of real GDP and the GDP that would exist assuming an economy was operating at full employment.
- Policies that can reduce an inflationary gap remember reductions for government spending, tax increases, bond and securities issues, interest rate increases, and transfer payment reductions.
