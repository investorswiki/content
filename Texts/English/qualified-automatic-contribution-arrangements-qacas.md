# Qualified Automatic Contribution Arrangement (QACA)
## What Is a Qualified Automatic Contribution Arrangement (QACA)?

Qualified automatic contribution arrangements (QACAs) allude to a rule laid out under the [Pension Protection Act](/pensionprotectionact2006) of 2006 to increase worker participation in self-supported retirement plans. Such plans incorporate [401(k)s](/401kplan), [403(b)s](/403bplan), and deferred compensation [457s](/457plan). Companies that utilization QACAs automatically enlist workers in the plans at a deferral rate at or above 3%, except if employees make a move to opt out.

## How Qualified Automatic Contribution Arrangements (QACAs) Work

Empowering retirement savings at work has been a problem for economists and policymakers. Numerous employers offer 401(k) or 403(b) defined contribution plans. Nonetheless, plan enrollment and contribution levels remain generally low in actual practice. Traditional plans require opting-in, and research by Nobel Prize-winning economist Richard Thaler shows that default options impact decisions.

One solution has been to execute a [opt-out plan](/opt-out-plan), where employees are automatically enrolled and must choose for stop participating.

Opt-out plans will more often than not raise participation rates. Notwithstanding, they generally start at employee contribution levels that are unreasonably low to fulfill retirement needs.

Tragically, employees tend not to make any move all alone and proceed to underinvest over the long term. Without instructive efforts, many may not save to the point of covering retirement expenses. For instance, they should be reminded that a 3% contribution is just a starting point.

Some contend that opt-out plans will quite often lower retirement contributions since employees think low preset values are sufficient. To counter this possibility, a few employers raise the employee contribution rate by 1% every year. In any case, that may not be enough for workers to arrive at their retirement objectives.

Starting around 2020, an employer must do one of the following for QACAs:

1. Contribute 100% of an employee's contribution up to 1% of their compensation, along with a half matching contribution for the employee's contributions above 1% (and up to 6%); or
1. Deliver a non-elective contribution of 3% of compensation to all participants.

With a QACA, employer contributions can be subject to a two-year [vesting](/vesting) period. Firms must give their employees adequate notice about the QACA. They must likewise can pick an alternate contribution level or opt out totally.

QACAs additionally have "safe harbor" provisions that exempt 401(k) plans from nondiscrimination testing requirements for actual deferral percentage (ADP). In the event that extra requirements are met, the plan will likewise be exempt from actual contribution percentage (ACP) testing. A QACA likewise may not convey the required employer contributions due to an employee's financial hardship.

## QACAs versus EACAs

The Pension Protection Act characterizes two distinct decisions for employers seeking to add an automatic contribution arrangement: QACAs and EACAs. In an eligible automatic contribution arrangement ([EACA](/eligible-automatic-contribution-arrangements-eacas)), the plan's default percentage must be uniformly applied to all employees in the wake of furnishing them with the required notice. It might allow employees to pull out automatic enrollment contributions with earnings by making a withdrawal election.

This election must be no sooner than 30 days or later than 90 days after the employee's first automatic enrollment contribution was held back. Not at all like a QACA, employees are 100% vested in their automatic enrollment contributions with an EACA.

QACAs furnish employers with safe harbor provisions that exempt them from [ADP and ACP](/actual-deferral-percentage-actual-contribution-percentage) testing requirements under specific conditions. Different plans must go through such testing to guarantee they don't oppress lower-paid employees.

In return, employers must make matching contributions as required by the IRS and must vest matching and non-elective contributions in two years or less. The default deferred contribution for a QACA must likewise increase yearly from no less than 3% the first year to no less than 6%, with a maximum of 15% at whatever year. The maximum was 10% until it was raised to 15% by the SECURE Act of 2019.
