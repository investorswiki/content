# Overall Liquidity Ratio
## What is the Overall Liquidity Ratio?

The overall liquidity ratio is the measurement of a company's capacity to pay its outstanding [liabilities](/liability) with its [assets](/resource) close by. The overall [liquidity](/liquidity) ratio is calculated by splitting total assets by the difference between its total liabilities and [conditional reserves](/conditional-reserves). This ratio is utilized in the insurance industry, as well as in the analysis of financial institutions.

## How the Overall Liquidity Ratio is Used

Regulators utilize financial metrics, similar to the overall liquidity ratio, to determine whether an insurer, bank, or other company is financially sound and [solvent](/dissolvability) enough to cover its liabilities. Financial and insurance companies utilize the cash that their activities create to get a return. A bank, for instance, may utilize funds received from customer deposits to give [mortgages](/contract) and different loans. The balance of customer deposits that are left over might be kept as cash, or might be invested in liquid assets.

Insurance companies receive money as premium payments by policyholders, and they thusly are responsible for the coverage benefits they guarantee by [underwriting](/underwriting) policies. Contingent upon the duration of the policy, the liability can last anyplace from a couple of months to a couple of years. Liabilities that come due inside the following year period are viewed as [current liabilities](/currentliabilities).

The amount of money that a financial institution or insurer needs to keep promptly accessible to cover its liabilities is determined by regulators. Regulators look at [liquidity ratios](/liquidityratios) to determine whether the company is consenting to its legal requirements. The formula to compute the overall liquidity ratio is: [Total Assets/(Total Liabilities - Conditional Reserves)]. In this calculation, conditional reserves allude to stormy day funds held by insurance companies to assist with covering unforeseen expenses during times of financial stress.

## Figuring out the Overall Liquidity Ratio

To conform to legal requirements and guarantee adequate funds to cover its liabilities, most lenders and insurers attempt to further develop their overall liquidity ratio.

Nonetheless, a high overall liquidity ratio isn't great either, particularly on the off chance that current assets address a high percentage of the company's total assets. A large extent of current assets means that the company may not be investing adequately to earn a high [return on assets](/returnonassets), however it might rather be zeroing in exclusively on liquidity.

## Overall Liquidity Ratio versus Quick Ratio versus Current Ratio

Other liquidity metrics incorporate the [quick ratio](/quickratio) and [current ratio](/currentratio). The quick ratio compares a company's assets that are promptly accessible for use, including cash, short-term investments, [government bonds](/government-bond), and [unaffiliated investments](/unaffiliated-investments), to its current obligations (short-term liabilities due inside the impending year period). The current ratio compares a company's total current assets to its current obligations. The quick ratio is more conservative than the current ratio since it doesn't consider current assets, for example, inventory, which are more enthusiastically to transform into usable cash quickly.
