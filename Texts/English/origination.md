## Origination Requirements

[Pre-qualification](/prequalification) is the initial step of the interaction. The loan officer meets with the borrower and acquires every single essential datum and data connecting with income and the property that the loan is expected to cover.

As of now, the lender determines the type of loan for which the individual qualifies, like a personal loan. Fixed-rate loans have a continuous interest rate for the whole life of the loan, while adjustable-rate mortgages (ARMs) have an interest rate that changes comparable to an index or a bond price, like Treasury securities. Hybrid loans feature interest-rate parts of both fixed and adjustable loans. They most frequently start with a fixed rate and in the long run convert to an ARM.

The borrower gets a rundown of data expected to complete the loan application during this stage. This broad required documentation ordinarily incorporates the purchase and sale contract, W-2 forms, benefit and-misfortune statements from the people who are self-employed, and bank statements. It will likewise incorporate mortgage statements in the event that the loan is to refinance an existing mortgage.

The borrower finishes up an application for the loan and presents generally important documentation. The loan officer then, at that point, completes the legally required paperwork to handle the loan.

## Special Considerations

The cycle is now no longer any of the borrower's concern. Everything paperwork submitted and endorsed until this point is filed and run through a [automatic underwriting](/automated_underwriting) program to be approved.

A few files may be shipped off an underwriter for manual approval. The loan officer then, at that point, gets the appraisal, requests insurance data, plans a closing, and sends the loan file to the processor. The processor might request extra data, if fundamental, for reviewing the loan approval.

A few borrowers may be eligible for government loans, like those given by the Federal Housing Authority (FHA) or the Department of Veteran Affairs (VA). These loans are viewed as non-regular and are structured such that makes it simpler for eligible individuals to purchase homes. They frequently feature lower qualifying ratios and can require a more modest or no down payment, and the origination cycle can be somewhat simpler thus.
