# Load-Waived Funds
## What Are Load-Waived Funds?

Load-waived funds are a share class of a [mutual fund](/mutualfund) that forgoes [load fees](/load) normally charged to its investors, (for example, front-end loads). Possessing shares in a load-waived fund is a benefit to investors since it allows them to hold their investment's all's return as opposed to losing a portion of it to fees. By and large, mutual fund companies will limit the number of load-waived funds and make them accessible just to certain investors.

[No-load funds](/no-loadfund) and load-waived funds don't charge a mutual fund load. Nonetheless, there is a difference between the two.
