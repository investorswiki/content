# Balloon Mortgage
A balloon mortgage accompanies major risk for both the borrower and the mortgage lender, however it tends to be worthwhile in certain conditions. To know more, this is what's truly going on with this sort of loan.
## What is a balloon mortgage?
A balloon mortgage is a type of home loan where you make low or no regularly scheduled payments for a short term, generally five or seven years. These initial payments could go exclusively to interest or to both interest and the loan principal, contingent upon how the mortgage is structured. After this low-or no-payment period, you spread the word about a lump sum payment — as a [balloon payment](/balloon-payment) — for the balance in full. This balloon payment can be thousands or a huge number of dollars, and generally multiple times the regularly scheduled payment, as indicated by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.
Most borrowers won't require a balloon mortgage, however it can seem OK in certain situations, particularly in the event that you only hope to hold onto the house you're financing for a brief time frame. This type of loan can be great for house flippers, who can utilize the proceeds from the sale of the home to make the balloon payment.
## Types of balloon mortgages
A balloon mortgage can be structured in more ways than one:
- **Balloon payment** - In this case, the initial regularly scheduled payments may be calculated in view of a common 15-year or 30-year amortization schedule, even however the loan term could only be for five or seven years. At the point when the term closes, you'd have to pay the excess balance in one lump sum. In one more rendition of this type of structure, you make payments on a fixed-rate basis for a while, then your rate increases. Suppose you take out a $250,000 balloon mortgage at 3.5 percent, amortized north of 30 years and with a loan term of seven years.
- **Interest-only payments** - In this scenario, you only pay interest for an initial period. When that period's finished, you owe the leftover balance of the loan.
- **No payments** - For this type, you won't make any regularly scheduled payments for an exceptionally short term, however you'll accrue interest. When the term's up, both the interest and principal are due in one large payment.
