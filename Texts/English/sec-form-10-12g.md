## What Is SEC Form 10-12G?

This form is required when a corporation wishes to register a class of securities as per Section 12(b) or (g) of the [Securities Exchange Act of 1934](/seact1934). Filing a Form 10-12G paves the way for the securities to trade on U.S possibly. exchanges. A company must file Form 10-12G in the event that it has more than $10 million in total assets and at least 750 shareholders on record.

[SEC Form 10-Q](/10q) is a quarterly report that includes a company's unaudited financial statements. The purpose of the 10-Q is to give the public continuous information about the company's financial wellbeing consistently. The company submits the report to the SEC for every one of its first 3/4 of the fiscal year.

[SEC Form 10-K](/10-k) is an annual report that comprehensively details a company's performance. It includes the company's examined financial statements and information on the company's history, organizational structure, equity, holdings, subsidiaries, and other significant data.

A company must file a [SEC Form 8-K](/8-k) to report current corporate events that shareholders and the SEC should know about. Examples of these material events incorporate acquisitions of another company, the resignation of a company director, news from an examiner's survey, or a bankruptcy filing.
