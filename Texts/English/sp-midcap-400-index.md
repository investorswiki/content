As a capitalization-weighted index, the stocks with the largest market capitalization for the most part affect the index's movement while smaller companies with smaller movements affect it. This is for investors who need to differentiate their [portfolios](/portfolio) since market-cap weighted index funds expose investors to the movements of a small group of [stocks](/stock), in spite of the broad name of the index itself.

The index just purposes [free-floating](/freefloatmethodology) or publicly traded shares. The S&P adjusts each company's market cap to compensate for new share issues or [mergers](/consolidation).

We can work out a company's weighting in the index, which can furnish investors with valuable data. In the event that a stock ascents or falls, we can check whether it will impact the overall index.
