Council based on Foreign Relations conditions Venezuela a "petrostate," and breaks down its spiraling economic and compassionate crisis in those terms.

The oil sector is overwhelmed by **Petr\u00f3leos de Venezuela**, the state-owned oil and natural gas company founded in 1976 after the government nationalized the oil industry. The company provides the government of Venezuela with about half of its incomes, and the economic fortunes of most Venezuelans rise and fall in light of the price of oil.

This dependence on oil was a key factor in the collapse of Venezuela's economy that started in 2015 with the decline in global oil prices.
