# Section 1237 Capital Gain Opportunity
## DEFINITION of Section 1237 Capital Gain Opportunity

Section 1237 Capital Gain Opportunity is a specific tax credit that permits taxpayers to receive capital gains treatment on the sale of partitioned loads of land. The purpose is to permit individual taxpayers who are not real estate dealers to escape ordinary income tax treatment on the sale of a sublot of land.

## BREAKING DOWN Section 1237 Capital Gain Opportunity

Section 1237 orders that the part can't have had substantial improvements made to it, meaning any improvement that builds the value of the land by over 10%. This incorporates structures, streets and utilities of any sort. Moreover, the property sold must have been held for somewhere around five years (except if it was inherited), and neither it nor some other sublots can be held available to be purchased to different customers during the extended time of sale.

## Land And Income Taxes

Unchanged land isn't generally regarded the same way as when you sell a property with a house that you've resided in. Under IRS rules, on the off chance that your land incorporates a home and you resided there no less than two of the five years before the sale, you can get a special capital gains tax exemption from ordinary income tax of your first $250,000 in profits ($500,000 on the off chance that you are married filing jointly).

On the off chance that you partition the land and, sell a great deal or parcels, Section 1237 can save you a heap in taxes by applying the [capital gains rate](/capital_gains_tax). However, you must finish these assessments: You must show that you are not a real estate dealer or a C corporation. The land must be owned by you individually or jointly or by implication by means of a partnership or LLC or [S corporation](/subchapters).

You must possess the land for a considerable length of time or more, or acquire the land. On the off chance that it's a gift, you must expect the contributor's holding period as your holding period. The land must not have recently been held available to be purchased to customers as dealer property. You can't make any "substantial improvements" that "substantially upgrade" the value of the parts, in spite of the fact that there are tests for this.

There's a large group of different rules, special cases and limitations, which you can find in [IRS Publication 544](/irs-bar 544) and in section 1237 of the IRS Code.
