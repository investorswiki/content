In spite of the fact that it might make certain goods and services more affordable, price controls can frequently lead to [disruptions](/marketdisruption) in the market, losses for producers, and a noticeable change in quality.

## History of Price Controls

Price controls aren't another concept. They return millennia. As per history specialists, the production and [distribution](/distribution) of grain were regulated by Egyptian experts in the third century B.C. Different developments executed price controls, including the Babylonians, the old Greeks, and the Roman empire.

We can find occurrences of price control in additional modern times, including during times of war and revolution. In the United States, frontier governments controlled the prices of [commodities](/item) required by George Washington's military, which brought about serious shortages.

Governments proceed to mediate and set limits on how producers can price their products and services. For example, municipal governments frequently limit how much rent a [landlord](/landlord) can collect from their [tenants](/tenant) and the amount by which they can increase these rents to make housing more affordable. The U.S. government likewise set price covers on energy prices during times of crisis, including World War I and II and somewhere in the range of 1971 and 1973.

## Types of Price Controls

Price controls come in two forms: Price floors and price roofs. Price floors are the base prices set for goods and services. They might be set by the government or, at times, by producers themselves. Least prices are imposed to help producers when specialists accept that prices are too low, leading to a [unfair market](/market). When set, prices can't fall below the base.

Price roofs or covers are the highest places where goods and services can be sold. This happens when specialists need to help consumers assuming they feel that prices are extremely high. This is particularly true on account of [rent control](/rent-control) when government agencies need to shield tenants from slumlords and enthusiastic landlords. Just like price floors, prices can't go above roofs whenever they're set.

## Illustration of Price Controls

These limits are additionally imposed on annual rent increases. The reasoning behind rent control is that it helps keep housing affordable, particularly for additional vulnerable individuals like those with lower [incomes](/pay) and the elderly.

Governments commonly impose controls on drug prices. This is particularly true for life-saving and specialty prescriptions like insulin. Drug companies frequently go under pressure at setting costs too high. Their reasoning is regularly patent protection and to cover the costly costs of [research and development (R&D)](/randd) and distribution. Consumers and governments say this puts certain meds far off for the average citizen.

[Least wages](/minimum_wage) are viewed as a form of price control too. In this case, it is a price floor or the lowest conceivable salary an employer can pay to their employees. Least wages guarantee that people can keep a specific [standard of living](/standard-of-living).

## Advantages and Disadvantages of Price Controls
### Advantages

Price controls are much of the time imposed when governments feel that consumers can't manage the cost of goods and services. For example, price roofs are laid out to keep producers from [price gouging](/fixing). This is common in the housing/rental industry and in the medication/wellbeing [sector](/sector).

Governments may likewise set price limits on goods and services in the event that they feel that producers aren't profiting from how goods and services are priced in the free market. This allows companies to stay competitive and guarantee that they are profitable.

Controlling how prices are set keeps companies from creating [monopolies](/syndication). Companies are at an advantage and can direct prices when demand is high (and supply is short). In that capacity, they might have the option to blow up prices to support their profits. Governments can intercede and set price roofs to keep providers from continuing to raise prices, allow contenders to enter the market, and crush imposing business models that exploit consumers.

### Disadvantages

Price controls might be instituted with the best of expectations, yet they frequently don't work.

At the point when prices are laid out by commerce in a free market, prices shift to keep up with the balance among supply and demand. Government-imposed price controls can lead to the creation of excess demand on account of price roofs, or excess supply on account of price floors.

That's what pundits say, subsequently, price controls frequently lead to an imbalance among supply and demand. This can, thus, lead to shortages and underground markets. At the point when prices are too low enough for things like housing, there may not be sufficient supply, accordingly expanding demand. For example, landlords might let the condition of their [properties](/property) fall apart on the grounds that they aren't making to the point of keeping up with them.

Price controls can lead to losses and a critical drop in quality. At the point when prices are too low, there's a decent chance that producer [revenue](/revenue) drops. They might need to figure out how to cut down on costs. Some might decide to cut down production or may wind up putting more inferior products out on the market. Subsequently, R&D drops, while fresher and more inventive products stop showing up on the market.
