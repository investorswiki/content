# Zone Of Possible Agreement (ZOPA)
## What is a Zone Of Possible Agreement (ZOPA)?

Not a physical place, the zone of conceivable agreement or bargaining range is viewed as an area where at least two arranging parties might settle on some shared interest. It is this area where parties will frequently compromise and strike a deal.

For arranging parties to find a settlement or agree, they must pursue a common goal and look for an area that integrates in any event a portion of each party's thoughts.

## Grasping Zone Of Possible Agreement

Regardless of how much negotiation happens, an agreement can never be arrived at outside of the zone of conceivable agreement. To arrive at an agreement effectively, arranging parties must grasp each other's necessities, values and interests.

A ZOPA can exist in the event that there is an overlap between the thing all parties will acknowledge from a deal. For instance, for Tom to sell his vehicle to John for a base $5,000, John must pay no less than $5,000. In the event that John will offer $5,500 for the vehicle, there is an overlap among his and Tom's bottom lines. In the event that John can offer $4,750 for the vehicle, then, at that point, there is no overlap, and there can't be a ZOPA.

## Negative Bargaining Zones

While arranging parties can't arrive at a ZOPA, they are in a negative bargaining zone. A deal can't be arrived at in a negative bargaining zone, as the necessities and wants, everything being equal, can't be met by a deal made under such conditions.

For instance, suppose that Dave needs to sell his mountain bicycle and stuff for $700 to buy new skis and ski gear. Suzy needs to buy the bicycle and stuff for $400, and can't go any higher. Dave and Suzy have not arrived at a ZOPA; they are in a negative bargaining zone.

Be that as it may, negative bargaining zones can be survived assuming arranging parties will find out around each other's longings and necessities. For instance, suppose Dave clarifies for Suzy that he needs to utilize the proceeds from the sale of the bicycle to buy new skis and ski gear. Suzy has a pair of previously owned, great skis that she will part with. Dave will take less cash for the mountain bicycle in the event that Suzy tosses the pre-owned skis in. The two parties have arrived at a ZOPA and can, consequently, make an effective deal.
