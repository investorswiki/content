## What Is SEC Form F-N?

SEC Form F-N is a filing required of foreign banks, insurers, [holding companies](/holdingcompany), and [subsidiaries](/subsidiary) to unveil securities offerings in the U.S.

The [Securities and Exchange Commission](/sec) (SEC) form is a notification of the appointment of an agent for service by certain foreign institutions. and is part of the F series of SEC filings that apply to foreign companies making offerings in the United States.

Starting around 2002, SEC Form F-N must be filed electronically.

## How SEC Form F-N Works

SEC Form F-N is formally the "appointment of agent for service of cycle by foreign banks and foreign insurance companies and certain of their holding companies and finance auxiliaries making public offerings of securities in the United States."

The form was secured by the [Securities Act of 1933](/securitiesact1933), "reality in securities" law. Registration forms reveal important information upon registration of a company's securities. This assists the SEC with achieving the act's objectives that investors receive significant information regarding securities offered, and to prevent fraud in the sale of the offered securities.

## SEC Form F-N versus Form F-X

If the foreign issuer has previously filed a SEC Form F-X, it is exempt from having to file this form under the Securities Act of 1933. Forms F-N and F-X are both used to designate a U.S. agent. Issuers are additionally exempt from having to file Form F-N if they are issuing debt securities or non-voting preferred shares.
