## History of the FHLB System

The Federal Home Loan Bank System was developed in response to the [Great Depression](/great_depression), which devastated the U.S. economy — particularly the banking industry. It was made by the [Federal Home Loan Bank Act](/federal-home-loan-bank-act) of 1932, the main in a series of bills that looked to make homeownership a reachable goal for additional Americans. The reasoning was by furnishing banks with low-cost funds to be utilized for mortgages. They would be bound to make loans; accordingly, individuals would find it more straightforward to borrow money to buy homes, in this way animating the residential real estate market.

The FHLB initially comprised of 12 independent, regional wholesale banks (like the 12 regional Federal Reserve Banks). The Act gave them total funding of $125 million. In 2015, however, the Seattle and Des Moines banks merged, diminishing the total number of FHLBanks to its current 11.

The Act additionally made the Federal Home Loan Bank Board to administer the system. It was discontinued in 1989, and oversight responsibility was moved to the Federal Housing Finance Board (FHFB) and regulatory responsibility to the Office of Thrift Supervision (OTS). Beginning around 2008, the FHLB has been regulated by the Federal Housing Finance Agency, made by the [Housing and Economic Recovery Act](/housing-and-economic-recovery-act-hera) (HERA).

For a significant part of the FHLB's 89-year history, [savings and loan institutions](/federal-savings-and-loan) overwhelmed the positions of its member financial institutions. Their numbers started to lessen during the 1980s and '90s, after the [Savings and Loan Crisis](/sl-crisis). In the 21st century, commercial banks (which were allowed to join the system in 1989) and insurance companies have come to make up the greater part of the membership.

Be that as it may, their practices overall stay. During the subprime mortgage-initiated 2008 financial crisis, for instance, the FHLBanks required no government bailouts, as sister GSEs Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac did.
