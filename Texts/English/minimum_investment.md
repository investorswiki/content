# Least Investment
## What Is a Minimum Investment?

A base investment is the littlest dollar or share quantity that an investor can purchase while investing in a specific security, fund, or opportunity. A hedge fund, for instance, may expect that their clients deposit no less than $100,000 with the firm. Or on the other hand, a mutual fund might expect no less than $3,000 to be invested. This is the base investment required for the hedge fund to deal with the client's money.

For instance, many brokers will require a base investment of $5,000 to buy corporate or Treasury bonds. While dealing with larger clients or organizations, the base investment might be $25,000, $100,000, or even $1 at least million.

Numerous mutual funds and hedge funds follow a strategy or essentially track a [index](/index). Most indexes can be invested in today by buying [exchange-traded funds](/etf) (ETFs). ETFs don't have the base investment requirements of numerous mutual and hedge funds, yet may offer comparative returns much of the time.
