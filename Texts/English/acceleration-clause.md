## What Is an Acceleration Clause?

## Acceleration Clause Explained

An acceleration clause permits the lender to require payment before the standard terms of the [loan](/loan) terminate. Acceleration clauses are normally contingent on-time payments.

Acceleration clauses are most common in mortgage loans and assist with alleviating the risk of default for the lender. They are typically founded on payment delinquencies however they can be structured for different events also. Generally speaking, an acceleration clause will require the borrower to immediately pay the full balance owed on the loan in the event that conditions have been breached. With full payment of the loan the borrower is feeling better of any further [interest](/interest) payments and basically pays off the loan ahead of schedule at the time the acceleration clause is summoned.

An acceleration clause is typically founded on payment delinquency, but the number of [delinquent](/delinquent) payments can shift. Some acceleration clauses might summon immediate payoff after one payment is missed while others might consider a few missed payments before demanding that the loan be paid in full. Selling or transferring the property to another party can likewise possibly be a factor associated with an acceleration clause.

For instance, expect a borrower with a long term mortgage loan neglects to make a payment in the third year. The terms of the loan incorporate an acceleration clause which states the borrower must repay the excess balance assuming one payment is missed. The borrower would immediately be reached by the lender to pay the leftover balance in full. On the off chance that the borrower pays, they receive the title to the home and takes full ownership of the property. On the off chance that the borrower can't pay then they are viewed as in breach of contract and the lender can dispossess and hold onto the property for resale.

A lender might decide to incorporate an acceleration clause to relieve expected losses and have greater control over the [real estate](/realestate) property tied to a mortgage loan.
