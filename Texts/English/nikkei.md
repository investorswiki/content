Notwithstanding government bonds, the TSE additionally acted as an exchange for gold and silver currencies. By the 1920s, the TSE developed to incorporate stock trading.

In 1943, during the Second World War, the Japanese government combined the TSE with five others to form a single Japanese Stock Exchange.

Stock prices and land values significantly increased somewhere in the range of 1985 and 1989.
