# Program Evaluation Review Technique (PERT) Chart
## What Is a Program Evaluation Review Technique (PERT) Chart?

A PERT chart is a [project management](/project-management) instrument that gives a graphical representation of a project's course of events. The Program Evaluation Review Technique (PERT) breaks down the individual tasks of a project for analysis. PERT charts are viewed as preferable to [Gantt charts](/gantt-chart) now and again in light of the fact that they recognize task conditions, however they're much of the time more hard to decipher.

## How a PERT Chart Works

A PERT chart assists a project manager with breaking down a project's tasks and estimate the amount of time required to complete each task in the project. Utilizing this data, the project manager can estimate the base amount of time required to complete the whole project. This data likewise assists the manager with fostering a [project budget](/budget) and decide the resources expected to achieve the project.

A PERT chart utilizes circles or rectangles called hubs to address project occasions or milestones. These hubs are linked by vectors or lines that address different tasks. Dependent tasks are things that must be acted in a specific way. For instance, assuming an arrow is drawn from Task No. 1 to Task No. 2 on a PERT chart, Task No. 1 must be completed before work on Task No. 2 starts.

Things at a similar stage of production however on various task lines inside a project are alluded to as parallel tasks. They're independent of one another, however they're intended to happen simultaneously.

A very much developed PERT chart seems to be this:

## Deciphering PERT Charts

A PERT chart is a visual representation of a series of occasions that must happen inside the [scope](/scope) of a project's lifetime. The heading of arrows shows the flow and sequence of occasions required for project completion. Spotted activity lines address dummy exercises â€” things that are situated on another PERT path. Numbers and time allocations are assigned and displayed inside every vector.

These charts have their distinct definitions and terms, the most important of which guess what amount of time it will require to finish a project. "Hopeful time" alludes to the most brief duration. "Skeptical time" is legitimately the longest it could take. The "most probable time" shows a reasonable estimate of the most ideal situation, though "anticipated time" accounts for issues and hindrances.

## Benefits and Disadvantages of PERT Charts

A PERT chart is like a critical path analysis (CPA), which is one more method that project managers use to chart tasks in a project. The principal difference between the two is that a PERT chart utilizes different time periods and probability terms while assessing each project stage. As a project management instrument, PERT charts offer a few distinct benefits and drawbacks.

### Benefits

A PERT chart permits managers to assess the time and resources important to deal with a project. This evaluation incorporates the ability to follow [required assets](/center assets) during any stage of production in the course of the whole project.

PERT analysis consolidates data and data from different departments. This joining of data supports department responsibility and it recognizes all responsible gatherings across the organization. It likewise further develops communication during the project and it permits an organization to resolve to projects that are pertinent to its essential situating.

At long last, PERT charts are valuable for [what-if analyses](/sensitivityanalysis). Understanding the potential outcomes concerning the flow of project resources and milestones permits management to accomplish the most efficient and valuable project path.

### Inconveniences

The utilization of a PERT chart is profoundly subjective and its prosperity relies upon the management's experience. These charts can incorporate unreliable data or unreasonable assessments for cost or time thus.

PERT charts are cutoff time centered and they could not completely impart the financial situating of a project. Since a PERT chart is work serious, the foundation and maintenance of the data demand extra investment and resources. Constant survey of the data gave, as well as the prospective situating of the project, is required for a PERT chart to be valuable.

## Real World Example of PERT Charts

PERT charts were first made by the U.S. Naval force's Special Projects Office in 1950s to direct the Polaris Fleet Ballistic Missile project. Utilizing the PERT model, Navy project managers had the option to assess the progress of their project, decide the legitimacy of timetables, and estimate the effects of proposed changes to laid out plans. The outcome of this initial utilization of PERT charts has made them be utilized since all around the world and in various industries.

## Features
- A PERT chart permits managers to assess the time and resources important to deal with a project.
- PERT charts were first made by the U.S. Naval force's Special Projects Office in 1950s to direct the Polaris nuclear submarine project.
- A PERT chart utilizes circles or rectangles called hubs to address project occasions or milestones. These hubs are linked by vectors, or lines, that address different tasks.
