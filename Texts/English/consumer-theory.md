## Figuring out Consumer Theory

Individuals have the freedom to pick either various bundles of goods and services. Consumer theory looks to foresee their purchasing designs by making the accompanying three fundamental suspicions about human behavior:

- **Nonsatiation:** People are rarely happy with one trip to the shops and consistently need to consume more
- **Diminishing marginal utility:** Consumers lose satisfaction in a product the more they consume it

Dealing with models and additionally cases, consumer theory normally requires the accompanying sources of info:

In the event that a pizza costs $10 and a video game cost $50, Kyle could buy 20 pizzas, or four video games, or five pizzas and three video games.

There could likewise be an emotional part associated with the dynamic cycle that can't be caught in an economic function.

Returning to the case of Kyle, sorting out how he will spend his $200 isn't quite so obvious as it would at first appear. Economics accepts he comprehends his inclinations for pizza and video games and can conclude the amount of every he needs to purchase. It likewise assumes there are sufficient video games and pizzas accessible for Kyle to pick the quantity of every he wants.
