# Investment Advisers Act of 1940
## What Is the Investment Advisers Act of 1940?

The Investment Advisers Act of 1940 is a U.S. federal law that controls and characterizes the job and obligations of a [investment advisor](/investmentadvisor)/adviser.

Provoked in part by a 1935 report to Congress on investment trusts and [investment companies](/investmentcompany) prepared by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the act gives the legal preparation to monitoring the people who exhort pension funds, individuals, and institutions on issues of investing. It determines what qualifies as investment exhortation and specifies who must register with state and federal regulators to apportion it.

## Understanding the Investment Advisers Act of 1940

The original catalyst of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, similarly as with several other milestone financial regulations of the 1930s and 1940s, was the stock market crash of 1929 and its terrible fallout, the [Great Depression](/great_depression). Those catastrophes propelled the [Securities Act of 1933](/securitiesact1933), which prevailed with regards to introducing more transparency in financial statements and laying out laws against misrepresentation and fraudulent activities in the securities markets.

In 1935, a SEC report to Congress cautioned of the risks presented by certain investment guides and supported the regulation of the people who gave investment exhortation. That very year as the report, the Public Utility Holding Act of 1935 passed, allowing the SEC to examine investment trusts.

Those improvements incited Congress to start work on the Investment Advisers Act as well as the [Investment Company Act of 1940](/investmentcompanyact). This connected bill plainly defined the obligations and requirements of investment companies while offering publicly traded investment products, including open-end mutual funds, closed-end mutual funds, and unit investment trusts.

## Financial Advisors and Fiduciary Duty

Investment advisors are bound to a [fiduciary standard](/fiduciary) that was laid out as part of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and can be regulated either by the SEC or state securities regulators, depending on the scale and scope of their business activities.

The Act is specific in characterizing what a fiduciary means. It specifies a [duty of loyalty](/duty-loyalty) and [duty of care](/duty-care), and that means that the advisor must put their client's interests over their own.

For example, the advisor can't buy securities for their account prior to buying them for a client ([front-running](/frontrunning)) and is disallowed from making trades that might bring about higher commissions for the advisor or their investment firm ([churning](/churning)). It likewise means that the advisor must give their all to ensure investment guidance is made utilizing accurate and complete data — essentially, that the analysis is intensive and as accurate as could really be expected.

Moreover, the advisor needs to place trades under a "[best execution](/bestexecution)" standard, implying that they must endeavor to trade securities with the best combination of low-cost and efficient execution.

## Laying out Advisor Criteria

The Investment Advisers Act tended to who is and who isn't an advisor/adviser by applying three criteria: what sort of guidance is offered, how the individual is paid for their recommendation/technique for compensation, and whether the vast majority of the advisor's income is created by giving investment counsel (the primary professional function). Likewise, if an individual persuades a client to think they are an investment adviser — by introducing themselves like that in advertising, for example — they can be viewed as one.

The act specifies that anybody giving counsel or making a recommendation on securities (instead of one more type of investment) is viewed as an advisor. Individuals whose exhortation is simply incidental to their line of business may not be viewed as an advisor, nonetheless. A few financial planners and accountants might be viewed as advisors while some may not, for example.

The nitty gritty rules for the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 can be found in Title 15 of the United States Code.

## Registration as a Financial Advisor

The agency with whom [advisors need to register](/ria) depends for the most part on the value of the assets they make due, alongside whether they prompt corporate clients or just individuals. Before the 2010 reforms, advisors who had somewhere around $25 million in [assets under management](/aum) or gave guidance to investment companies were required to register with the SEC. Advisors overseeing more modest sums commonly registered with state securities specialists.

Those sums were amended by the [Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010](/dodd-frank-financial-regulatory-reform-bill), which allowed numerous advisors who recently registered with the SEC to now do as such with their state regulators since they managed less money than the new federal rules required. Be that as it may, the Dodd-Frank Act likewise initiated registration requirements for the people who exhort private funds, for example, [hedge funds](/hedgefund) and private equity funds. Already, such advisors were exempt from registration, in spite of frequently overseeing extremely large amounts of money for investors.
