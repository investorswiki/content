# Underinsured Motorist Coverage
## What Is Underinsured Motorist Coverage?

Underinsured motorist coverage is an addition to your collision protection policy. It safeguards you in the event that you're in an accident including someone who doesn't have adequate insurance of their own. In an accident, the insurance of the to blame person should remunerate the other harmed person. In the event that the to blame party's policy has a limit below the cost of the damages, the harmed party's underinsured motorist coverage would cover the rest.

Underinsured coverage isn't equivalent to uninsured coverage, which covers cases in which the to blame driver has no insurance by any means, however the two types might be packaged together. A modest bunch of states require underinsured motorist coverage, while more require uninsured motorist coverage.

## Figuring out Underinsured Motorist Coverage

At the point when a person has an accident which isn't their shortcoming, and the other motorist needs more insurance to cover the damages, underinsured coverage kicks in. Once you file a claim with your provider, it will contact the other driver's insurance for payment. On the off chance that the other driver didn't carry sufficient insurance to cover your expenses satisfactorily, the underinsured coverage would fulfill, up to the limit of your policy.

For instance, expect you have medical and automobile damages adding up to $200,000. The other driver has insurance to cover only $100,000. You can claim the balance against your insurance provider, up to the limit of your policy's coverage. You can not request more than the genuine costs you had as a direct consequence of the accident.

Some insurance providers will have a limit on how long you can stand by before you file your underinsured claim. These limits will shift by company and can be just 30 days. As the insurance company settles your claim, it will need duplicates and billings from all medical care received and any automobile repair that came about because of the event. Assuming the insurance provider concludes that the costs submitted with the claim are pointless — or not connected with the accident — it will deny those amounts. Assuming the policyholder contradicts the decision of the insurance provider, the case will generally go to [binding arbitration](/arbitration).
