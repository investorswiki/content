# Platykurtic
## What's the significance here?

The term "platykurtic" alludes to a [statistical distribution](/probabilitydistribution) in which the [excess kurtosis](/excesskurtosis) value is negative. Hence, a platykurtic distribution will have more slender tails than a normal distribution will, bringing about less extreme positive or negative occasions. Something contrary to a platykurtic distribution is a [leptokurtic distribution](/leptokurtic), in which excess kurtosis is positive.

Investors will consider which statistical distributions are associated with various types of investments while choosing where to invest. More [risk-averse](/riskaverse) investors could favor assets and markets with platykurtic distributions since those assets are less inclined to create extreme outcomes.

## Grasping Platykurtic Distributions

There are three fundamental sorts of statistical distributions: leptokurtic, [mesokurtic](/mesokurtic), and platykurtic. These distributions contrast contingent upon their amount of excess kurtosis, which connects with the likelihood of extreme positive or negative occasions. The normal distribution, which is a type of mesokurtic distribution, has a [kurtosis](/kurtosis) of three. Hence, distributions with kurtosis greater than three are said to have "positive excess kurtosis," while those with kurtosis of under three are said to have "negative excess kurtosis."

However mesokurtic distributions have a kurtosis of three, leptokurtic and platykurtic distributions have positive and negative excess kurtosis, separately. Thusly, leptokurtic distributions have a somewhat high likelihood of extreme occasions, though the inverse is true for platykurtic distributions.

The following figures show charts of these three types of distributions, all with a similar standard deviation. Albeit the figure on the left doesn't uncover a large part of the differences between these distributions' tails, the figure on the right gives a clearer view by plotting the quantiles of the distributions against one another. This technique is known as a quantile plot, or Q for short.

## Special Considerations

Most investors accept that [equity market](/equitymarket) returns more closely look like a leptokurtic distribution than a platykurtic one. That is, while most returns are probably going to be like the average return for the market as a whole, returns will sporadically stray widely from the mean. These emotional and eccentric occasions, once in a while alluded to as [black swans](/blackswan), are less inclined to happen in markets that are platykurtic.

Therefore, more careful investors could try not to invest in leptokurtic markets and spotlight on investments offering platykurtic returns. Then again, a few investors intentionally seek after investments with leptokurtic returns, accepting that their extreme positive returns will more than make up for their extreme negative returns.

## Real-World Example of a Platykurtic Distribution

Morningstar distributed a research paper that included data on the excess kurtosis levels of various types of assets, as seen between February 1994 and June 2011. The rundown incorporated a great many investments, from U.S. what's more, international equities to [real estate](/realestate), [commodities](/item), cash, and [bonds](/bond).

The levels of excess kurtosis were correspondingly differed. On the low finish of the range were cash and international bonds, which had excess kurtosis of - 1.43 and 0.58, separately. On the opposite finish of the range were U.S. high-yield bonds and multifaceted investments arbitrage strategies, offering excess kurtosis of 9.33 and 22.59.

Asset classes with intermediate levels of excess kurtosis included international real estate (2.61), equities from international emerging economies (1.98), and commodities (2.29).

An investor taking a gander at this data could rapidly recognize what sorts of assets they wish to invest in, given their tolerance for potential black swan occasions. Risk-disinclined investors who need to limit the probability of extreme occasions could zero in on low-kurtosis investments, while investors more alright with extreme occasions could zero in on high-kurtosis ones.

## Highlights
- To limit the risk of large negative occasions, risk-unwilling investors can zero in on investments whose returns follow a platykurtic distribution.
- Platykurtic distributions are those with negative excess kurtosis.
- They have a lower probability of extreme occasions compared to a normal distribution.
