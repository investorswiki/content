# International Fund
International funds invest in stocks of companies based outside the U.S. This is the thing you need assuming you are enhancing your portfolio and are searching explicitly for overseas exposure. 65 percent of the fund's total assets must invested in companies based outside the U.S. for a fund to qualify, under the Lipper Analytical Services definition.

## Features
- International funds are mutual funds that invest in companies based outside of the country where the fund's investors are based.
- International funds, especially those that invest in emerging markets or other targeted areas, have become progressively famous in recent years, as investors look for diversification.
- International funds are distinct from global funds, which are able to invest in companies around the world, and in the country in which the fund's investors are found.
