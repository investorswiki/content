# Oversupply
## What Is Oversupply?

Oversupply is an unreasonable amount of a product that is the consequence of when demand is lower than supply, bringing about a surplus.

## Figuring out Oversupply

Basically, an oversupply is when there is more product available to be purchased than individuals are prepared to buy at the current price. Albeit the setting can shift, oversupply results from overproduction and leads to the accumulation of unsalable inventories. Price levels and oversupply are firmly corresponded.

There are many motivations behind why oversupply might happen. There can be an oversupply of a current product due to individuals waiting for a superior model in a series, for example, cell phones from a specific maker. Oversupply can likewise happen in situations where the price of the great or service is too high and individuals are just not ready to buy it costing that much. An oversupply may likewise basically be a case of a producer totally misreading the market demand for a product. [Surplus](/surplus) is an equivalent for oversupply.

At the point when a price is too high, the quantity demanded will be not exactly the quantity provided and the unsold quantity will increase except if the producer discounts the great or ends production. Discounting product is the clearest method for dealing with an oversupply, and it is in many cases the best way to clear [unsold inventory](/inventoryturnover), particularly on the off chance that new product is coming. Discounting influences the primary concern of the seller and the producer might need to consent to share that pain with the seller.

In [commodity markets](/commodity-market), oversupply is all the more a market condition rather than a problem to be settled. For commodities like oil, natural gas, precious metals, meat, etc, the production course of events requires a huge lead time and the prices are all market-based. In the event that, for instance, a number of large scale gas fields start production simultaneously, there will be an oversupply of natural gas on the market leading to a lower price. During periods of oversupply, producers may really lose money on the units they are selling.

The intriguing thing about certain types of commodity oversupply is that it's anything but a question of unsold inventory, yet the amount of the commodity can be stored and [stockpiled](/unrefined reserves) before it in the end sells at anything price the market will pay. Since production won't be quickly dialed all over, commodity producers rely upon storage to assist with eliminating oversupply from the market while production cycles acclimate to the brought down longer-term demand. Of course, in the event that too much production is shortened, the market will be undersupplied and greater investment will flow into the production side. This is one of the many reasons that numerous commodities have cyclical [boom and bust](/boom-and-bust-cycle) pricing charts.

## Oversupply Example

Oversupply and its impact on market [equilibrium](/equilibrium) is best understood through a model. Assume the price of a computer is $600 at a volume of 1,000 units, however buyers demand just 300 units costing that much. In such a situation, sellers are seeking to sell 700 additional computers than buyers will purchase.

The oversupply of 700 units puts the market for computers in [disequilibrium](/disequilibrium). Since they're not able to sell every one of the computers at the ideal cost of $600, sellers consider a price reduction to make the product more appealing to buyers. In response to the reduction in the price of the product, consumers demand more computers and producers cut production. Ultimately, the market will accomplish equilibrium price and quantity, missing the presentation of other outside factors.

This cycle might happen rapidly for certain goods, when the prices and amounts that can be offered on the market are somewhat flexible. the more it take prices and amounts to change on the market, the more drawn out the oversupply will persevere. At the point when [prices are sticky](/price_stickiness), due to [menu costs ](/menu-costs)or different issues, or when the government mediates to set a [price floor](/price-controls), then an oversupply of a goods can continue or some time.

## Highlights
- Oversupply can endure longer when prices and amounts are less flexible due to market conditions or government price controls.
- In commodities, an oversupply is a period when over production of a commodity pushes the price for that commodity down to a level where the producers are losing money.
- Oversupply is a situation where there is more product on the market than consumers need to buy.
- Oversupply will in general be revised through decreased production or discounting, yet the time span over which this happens can be longer or more limited contingent upon the dynamics of the market.
