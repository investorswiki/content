# Integrated Oil and Gas Company
## What Is an Integrated Oil and Gas Company?

An integrated oil and gas company is a business entity that participates in the [exploration, production](/exploration-production-company), refinement, and distribution of oil and gas, rather than companies that work in just one segment. Given the high entry costs relating to many oil and gas industry operations, a significant number of the world's biggest oil and gas companies, similar to Chevron and ExxonMobil, are integrated.

Regularly, integrated companies partition their different operations into categories: [upstream](/upstream), which includes all exploration and production endeavors, midstream, which covers transportation and storage, and [downstream](/downstream), which is confined to refinement and marketing activities.

## Understanding an Integrated Oil and Gas Company

Integrated oil and gas companies are alluded to by one or two names; "supermajors" and "large oil" are the two generally common. The defining characteristic of these companies is that they are involved in the whole value chain of the oil industry. Their assets comprise of or are connected with equipment in exploration and drilling, transportation by means of trucks, big haulers, or pipelines, refineries, and even gas stations.

Since integrated oil and gas companies are involved in such countless aspects of the petroleum product industry, frequently their [bottom line](/bottomline) can be counterintuitive. For instance, during times of rising crude prices, an integrated oil and gas company might have lower [profit margins](/profitmargin) than a nonintegrated rival because of having greater downstream than upstream capacities.

The possibility of an integrated oil and gas company can be dated back to the one that began everything, Standard Oil. J.D. Rockefeller's oil company. Standard Oil started in 1870 and was broken separated in 1911 due to [antitrust](/antitrust) legislation. The absolute greatest integrated companies today come from the breakup of Standard Oil, like ExxonMobil, BP, and Chevron.

## Oil and Gas Operations

Oil and gas operations are classified into upstream, [midstream](/midstream), and downstream activities. The upstream activity involves oil and gas exploration and production, the midstream activity centers around oil and gas transportation and storage, and the downstream activity manages oil and gas refinement and marketing.

These seemingly unique business activities normally require specific and dedicated resources to make due, and there are many independent upstream, midstream, and downstream oil and gas administrators. Notwithstanding, integrated oil and gas companies with both upstream and downstream operations are a huge force within the oil and gas industry.

It was J.D. Rockefeller who had confidence in complete integration since he accepted it eliminated inefficiencies in the operations of a business. It was better to do everything yourself than to need to depend on different businesses and their methods of operation. Whenever inefficiencies were taken out, it would permit him to offer the most minimal price feasible for his product.

## Integrated Companies versus Independent Companies

An independent oil and gas company is one that isn't integrated and centers around just a single segment of the oil and gas industry. Advantages and disadvantages to are being either an integrated or independent company. With in an upward direction integrated operations, an integrated oil and gas company is in direct contact with the energy end market and may gain certain market intelligence. This, in turn, assists it with better managing oil and gas productions in light of changing market requests. An integrated oil and gas company can be hard to value when various types of production and operating assets are undeniably lumped together, leading to possibly brought down [market valuation](/marketvalue).

An independent oil and gas company with just a single type of operation brings a more keen concentration to its business activity, for example, eliminating competing resource allocations among various businesses. In any case, the lack of profit offset among upstream and downstream operations could be difficult for independent oil and gas companies in unfavorable market conditions.

## Profitability Diversification

An independent oil and gas company might flourish or shrivel on the rise or fall of oil and gas prices, while an integrated oil and gas company frequently has less concern about price [volatility](/volatility). Balanced by its upstream and downstream operations, the business of an integrated oil and gas company can basically [hedge](/hedge) its profits against market slumps.

For instance, when [crude oil](/crude-oil) production encounters diminished profitability from declining oil prices, refining operations at an integrated oil and gas company would probably see expanded profit margins in view of the lower input costs, ensuring a certain level of locked-in profits.

## Highlights
- The absolute biggest and most influential oil and gas companies in the world are integrated companies, like Chevron, ExxonMobil, and BP.
- Being an integrated company takes into account complete control and further developed productivity. It additionally accommodates different floods of revenue and diversification.
- Integrated oil and gas companies have individual business divisions dedicated to the upstream, midstream, and downstream sectors of the oil and gas industry.
- An integrated oil and gas company is one that is involved in the whole value chain of the oil business.
