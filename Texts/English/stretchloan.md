The company could take out a stretch loan from its bank to finance the inventory purchase. Then, when it gathers on the outstanding accounts receivable, it can pay back the stretch loan.

The maximum loan amount will be limited by the lender and the interest rate will be higher than the rate for a normal working capital loan.
