# Convenience Good
## What Is a Convenience Good?

A convenience decent is a consumer thing that is widely accessible and purchased much of the time with negligible exertion. Since a convenience decent can be found promptly, it doesn't regularly include an intensive decision-production process. Convenience goods, like papers and candy, are not the same as specialty goods, for example, cars, which are more costly and frequently carry a greater [opportunity cost](/opportunitycost) for the consumer.

## Figuring out Convenience Goods

Convenience goods are in many cases purchased through propensity or impulse since they are effectively acquired by consumers and relatively modest. The cheapness of a decent can be dependent on the income of the consumer, so [economists](/financial specialist) frequently utilize the cost of a decent to the average consumer while deciding whether a decent is reasonable.

On the off chance that [discretionary income](/discretionaryincome) falls, consumers might forego purchasing goods incautiously. Therefore, product managers need to decide practical pricing points to guarantee that demand for convenience goods doesn't wind down with flighty market behavior.

Consumers are sensitive to convenience great price changes. Marketers need to consider price increases with respect to [demand](/demand) for things that a buyer might sidestep due to a price climb. The objective for providers is to strike a balance between price movement and demand with the goal that an incremental increase doesn't adversely influence the quantity sold. For example, in the event that the price of a treat is $1 and the provider sells 1,000 bars in a month for $1,000, then a price increase to $1.25 would require the sale of 800 units to rise to a similar amount of [revenue](/revenue).

[Price elasticity of demand](/priceelasticity) equals the percentage change of the quantity demanded/percentage change in price, where the goal is to keep up with relative inelasticity with a resultant value short of what one. Relative inelasticity exists when large price vacillations don't essentially change demand.

## Convenience Goods and Substitutes

The purchase price of a convenience decent largely decides if a consumer decides to buy the thing. These modest, spontaneous purchases result from conspicuous demand that contrasts from the decision to purchase gas and other essential consumer nondurables.

Food and fuel have no [substitutes](/substitute). Convenience goods, paradoxically, give the buyer greater decision. In the event that a consumer purchases a bag of peanuts consistently at a neighborhood shop for $1 and the price of peanuts increases to $2, the purchaser might forego the purchase or opt for a bag of almonds at a price of $1.25.

Dissimilar to essential goods, for example, gas, convenience goods have many substitutes that a consumer can purchase all things being equal assuming prices rise.

## Features
- Pricing is important for convenience goods to guarantee that demand for them among consumers doesn't fade with the rhythmic movements of mainstream markets.
- Convenience goods are much of the time purchased through propensity or impulse and are relatively cheap.
- The cheap price of consumer goods makes them defenseless to being exchanged for substitutes.
