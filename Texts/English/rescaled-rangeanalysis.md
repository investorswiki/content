# Rescaled Range Analysis
## What Is Rescaled Range Analysis?

Rescaled range analysis is a statistical technique used to examine trends in a period series. It was developed by British hydrologist Harold Edwin Hurst to anticipate flooding on the Nile river. Investors have utilized it to search for cycles, designs, and [trends](/trend) in stock and bond prices that could repeat or reverse from now on.

## Grasping Rescaled Range Analysis

Rescaled range analysis can be utilized to distinguish and assess the amount of persistence, randomness, or [mean reversion](/meanreversion) in financial markets time series data. Exchange rates and stock prices don't follow a [random walk](/randomwalktheory), or erratic path, similar to they would in the event that price changes were independent of one another. Markets, all in all, are not entirely efficient, and that means there are opportunities for investors to capitalize on.

On the off chance that a strong trend exists in the data, it will be caught by the Hurst example (H type), which can likewise be utilized to [rate mutual funds](/morningstarriskrating). The H type, which is otherwise called the index of long-range reliance, can extrapolate a future value or average for the data.

The Hurst type ranges somewhere in the range of zero and one, and it measures persistence, randomness, or mean reversion. Time series that display a random stochastic cycle have H types close to 0.5. At the point when H is greater than 0.5, the data is exhibiting a strong long-term trend, and when H is under 0.5, it is probably going to reverse trend throughout the time period considered.

H examples below 0.5 are otherwise called the [Joseph effect](/josepheffect), in reference to the scriptural story of seven years of bounty being followed by seven years of starvation. Low values are probably going to be followed by high values, or vice versa.

## Rescaled Range and the Hurst Exponent

Rescaled range analysis surveys how the variability of times series data changes with the length of the time span being thought of. The rescaled range is calculated by partitioning the reach (maximum value minus least value) of the cumulative mean adjusted data points (sum of every data point minus the mean of the data series) by the [standard deviation](/standarddeviation) of the values over a similar portion of the time series.

As the number of perceptions in a period series expands, the rescaled range increments. By plotting these increments as the logarithm of R/S versus the logarithm of n, one can determine the slant of this line, which is the Hurst example, H.

## Instances of How to Use Rescaled Range Analysis

The Hurst example can be utilized in [trend trading](/trendtrading) investment strategies. An investor would be searching for stocks that show strong persistence. These stocks would have a H greater than 0.5. A H under 0.5 could be paired with [technical indicators](/technicalindicator) to spot price reversals. For instance, to time their investment, a value investor could search for stocks with H under 0.5 whose prices have been declining for quite a while.

Mean reversion trading hopes to capitalize on extreme changes in the price of a security, in view of the assumption that it will return to its previous state. The H type is utilized by [algorithmic traders](/algorithmictrading) to conjecture on mean-returning time series strategies like pairs trading, where the spread between two assets is mean-returning.

The following chart shows a 15-period [moving average](/movingaverage) (MA) of the Hurst Exponent in light of the SPDR S&P 500 (SPY) price chart. The MA can be adjusted, with a longer MA smoothing out variances.

For traders needing to buy during an uptrend in the price, they could search for opportunities where the H is above 0.5 and the price is moving up. Utilized along these lines, the indicator wouldn't be guaranteed to give [trade signals,](/trade-signal) yet it could aid in giving confirmation to other trade signals in view of the trend.

The indicator will not necessarily give great signs. It is likewise important to note that high H values when the price is declining are showing further declines in price, which can make the indicator a bit confounding while first utilizing it.

## The Difference Between Rescaled Range Analysis and Regression Analysis

Rescaled range analysis takes a gander at a data series and determines the persistence or mean-returning inclinations inside that data. Linear regression takes a gander at two factors, like price and time, and tracks down the midpoint or the line of best fit for the data series. Then, standard deviation channels can be added to show when the security is possibly overbought or oversold in view of the data series. Linear regression is part of the bigger field of [regression analysis](/regression).

## Limitations of Rescaled Range Analysis

For the end goal of trading, a rescaled range is the adjusted reach separated by the standard deviation. These computations depend on past data and aren't innately predictive. It depends on the trader to decipher the information the rescaled range or Hurst example is giving.

For the purpose of trading, the Hurst indicator, which is derived from the rescaled range, may work sometimes, however it doesn't work constantly. A strong price trend could be reversed forcefully, which the indicator didn't predict. Reversals announced the indicator may likewise not create.

## Highlights
- The Hurst type changes somewhere in the range of zero and one.
- The rescaled reach can be utilized to register the Hurst type, which can extrapolate a future value or average for the data.
- At the point when the Hurst type is greater than 0.5, the data is exhibiting a strong long-term trend, and when H is under 0.5, a trend reversal is more probable.
- Rescaled range analysis takes a gander at a data series and determines the persistence or mean-returning propensities inside that data.
