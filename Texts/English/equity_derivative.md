# Equity Derivative
## What Is an Equity Derivative?

An equity derivative is a financial instrument whose value depends on the equity movements of the [underlying asset](/underlying-asset). For instance, a [stock option](/stockoption) is an equity derivative, on the grounds that its value depends on the price movements of the underlying stock.

Investors can utilize equity derivatives to [hedge](/hedge) the risk associated with taking long or short positions in stocks, or they can utilize them to conjecture on the price movements of the underlying asset.

## Grasping Equity Derivatives

Equity derivatives can act like an insurance policy. The investor gets a potential payout by paying the cost of the derivative contract, which is alluded to as a [premium](/premium) in the options market. An investor that purchases a stock, can safeguard against a loss in share value by purchasing a [put option](/putoption). Then again, an investor that has [shorted](/shortselling) shares can hedge against a vertical move in the share price by purchasing a [call option](/calloption).

Equity derivatives can likewise be utilized for speculation purposes. For instance, a trader can buy equity options, rather than actual stock, to produce profits from the underlying asset's price movements. There are two benefits to such a strategy. In the first place, traders can cut down on costs by purchasing options (which are less expensive) as opposed to the actual stock. Second, traders can likewise hedge risks by setting [put ](/putoption)and [call](/calloption) options on the stock's price.

Other equity derivatives incorporate stock index futures, equity index swaps, and convertible bonds.

## Utilizing Equity Options

Equity options are derived from a single equity security. Investors and traders can utilize equity options to take a long or short position in a stock without actually buying or shorting the stock. This is beneficial in light of the fact that taking a position with options permits the investor/trader more leverage in that the amount of capital required is considerably less than a comparative outright long or short position on margin. Investors/traders can, hence, profit more from a price movement in the underlying stock.

For instance, buying 100 shares of a $10 stock costs $1,000. Buying a call option with a $10 [strike price](/strikeprice) may just cost $0.50, or $50 since one option controls 100 shares ($0.50 x 100 shares). Assuming that the shares climb to $11 the option is worth something like $1, and the options trader pairs their money. The stock trader makes $100 (position is currently worth $1,100), which is a 10% gain on the $1,000 they paid. Nearly, the options trader makes a better percentage return.

Assuming that the underlying stock moves off course and the options are [out of the money](/outofthemoney) at the hour of their expiration, they become worthless and the trader loses the premium they paid for the option.

Another famous equity options technique is trading [option spreads](/spreadoption). Traders take blends of long and short option positions, with various strike prices and expiration dates, to extract profit from the option premiums with negligible risk.

## Equity Index Futures

A futures contract is like an option in that its value is derived from an underlying security, or on account of an index futures contract, a group of securities that make up a [index](/index). For instance, the S&P 500, the Dow index, and the NASDAQ index all have futures contracts accessible that are priced in view of the value of the indexes.

In any case, the values of the indexes are derived from the aggregate values of the multitude of underlying stocks in the index. In this way, index futures at last get their value from equities, consequently their name "equity index futures". These futures contracts are fluid and flexible financial apparatuses. They can be utilized for everything from intraday trading to hedging risk for large diversified portfolios.

While futures and options are the two derivatives, they function in various ways. Options give the buyer the right, however not the obligation, to buy or sell the underlying at the strike price. Futures are an obligation for both the buyer and seller. Accordingly, the risk isn't capped in futures like it is while buying an option.
