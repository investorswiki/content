# Descending Channel
## What Is a Descending Channel?

A descending channel is drawn by interfacing the lower ups and lower downs of a security's price with parallel [trendlines](/trendline) to show a descending [trend](/trend). Authoritatively, the space between the trendlines is the descending channel, which falls under the broad category of trend channels.

## Figuring out Descending Channels

By and large, channels are utilized broadly by technical traders to distinguish and follow the trends of securities over the long run. A descending channel is one such charting pattern that [technical analysts](/technical-investigator) will use to assess the trend of a security. A channel is drawn from trendlines charted along the support and resistance levels of a security's price series. As a rule, channels can be utilized to pinpoint optimal support and resistance levels to buy or sell securities.

Traders who accept a security is probably going to stay inside its descending channel can start trades when the price varies inside its channel trendline limits. The descending channel trendlines can be extended to give an expected path to the security to cross, should its current trend hold.

A more strong signal happens with a [breakout](/breakout), which is the point at which a security's price penetrates a laid out channel's limits, either on the upper or lower side. At the point when this occurs, a security's price can move rapidly and forcefully toward that breakout. In the event that this move is toward the prior trend, the descending channel would have been a [continuation pattern](/continuationpattern). In the event that the move is counter to the prior trend, the descending channel would have been a preface to a [reversal](/reversal).

Inside a descending channel, a trader could make selling wagers when the security price arrives at its resistance trendline. On the other hand, long buying trades could be placed into when a security starts to arrive at its support trendline. These trading strategies can be beneficial when a security has low to direct volatility that keeps its price action obliged. Trading on channel analysis can likewise be productive after a security's price shows a reversal and breakout, which is typically followed by a series of [runaway gaps](/runawaygap) and a [exhaustion gap](/exhaustiongap) all in a similar course.

A [ascending channel](/ascendingchannel) is something contrary to a descending channel. Both ascending and descending channels are primary channels followed by technical analysts.

> The trendlines in an ascending channel would be positive slanting at the resistant and support levels.

## Envelope Channels

[Envelope channels](/envelope-channel) are another famous channel formation that can consolidate both descending and ascending channel patterns. Envelope channels are regularly used to chart and examine a security's price movement over a longer period of time. Trendlines can be founded on moving midpoints or ups and downs over indicated spans. Envelope channels can utilize trading strategies like both descending and ascending channels. This analysis will commonly be founded on a security's price movement over an extended period of time, while ascending and descending channels can be beneficial for charting a security's price following a reversal.
