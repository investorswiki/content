# Dow Theory
## What Is the Dow Theory?

The Dow theory is a financial theory that says the market is in a vertical trend on the off chance that one of its averages (for example [industrials](/djia) or [transportation](/djta)) advances over a previous important high and is joined or followed by a comparative advance in the other average. For instance, if the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) moves to an intermediate high, the Dow Jones Transportation Average (DJTA) is expected to follow suit inside a reasonable period of time.

## Figuring out the Dow Theory

The Dow theory is an approach to trading developed by Charles H. Dow who, with Edward Jones and Charles Bergstresser, established Dow Jones and Company, Inc. what's more, developed the Dow Jones Industrial Average in 1896. Dow sorted through the theory in a series of publications in the **Wall Street Journal**, which he helped to establish.

Charles Dow kicked the bucket in 1902, and due to his death, he never distributed his complete theory on the markets, yet several followers and partners have distributed works that have expanded on the publications. Probably the main contributions to Dow theory incorporate the following:

- William P. Hamilton's **The Stock Market Barometer** (1922)
- Robert Rhea's **The Dow Theory** (1932)
- E. George Schaefer's **How I Helped More Than 10,000 Investors to Profit in Stocks** (1960)
- Richard Russell's **The Dow Theory Today** (1961)

Dow accepted that the stock market as a whole was a solid measure of overall business conditions inside the economy and that by dissecting the overall market, one could accurately check those conditions and distinguish the course of major market trends and the possible bearing of individual stocks.

The theory has gone through additional improvements in its 100 or more year history, remembering contributions by William Hamilton for the 1920s, Robert Rhea during the 1930s, and E. George Shaefer and Richard Russell during the 1960s. Parts of the theory have lost ground, for instance, its accentuation on the transportation area — or rail lines, in its original form — yet Dow's approach actually forms the core of modern [technical analysis](/technicalanalysis).

## How the Dow Theory Works

There are six principal parts to the Dow theory.

### 1. The Market Discounts Everything

The Dow theory works on the [efficient markets hypothesis (EMH)](/efficientmarkethypothesis), which states that asset prices consolidate all suitable information. At the end of the day, this approach is the absolute opposite of behavioral economics.

Earnings potential, competitive advantage, management skill — these factors and more are priced into the market, even on the off chance that few out of every odd individual knows all or any of these subtleties. In additional severe readings of this theory, even future events are discounted as risk.

### 2. There Are Three Primary Kinds of Market Trends

Markets experience primary trends which last a year or more, for example, a bull or bear market. Inside these more extensive trends, they experience secondary trends, frequently working against the primary trend, for example, a [pullback](/pullback) inside a bull market or a rally inside a bear market; these secondary trends last from three weeks to 90 days. At last, there are minor trends lasting under three weeks, which are to a great extent noise.

### 3. Primary Trends Have Three Phases

A primary trend will go through three phases, as indicated by the Dow theory. In a bull market, these are the accumulation phase, the public participation (or big move) phase, and the excess phase. In a bear market, they are called the distribution phase, the public participation phase, and the panic (or depression) phase.

### 4. Indices Must Confirm Each Other

For a trend to be laid out, Dow proposed indices or market averages must affirm one another. This means that the signals that happen on one index must match or compare with the signals on the other. In the event that one index, like the Dow Jones Industrial Average, is affirming another primary uptrend, yet another index stays in a primary downward trend, traders shouldn't expect that a recent fad has started.

Dow utilized the two indices that he and his partners designed, the [Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA)](/djia) and the [Dow Jones Transportation Average (DJTA)](/djta), on the assumption that in the event that business conditions were, as a matter of fact, sound, as a rise in the DJIA would recommend, the railways would be profiting from moving the freight this business activity required. Assuming asset prices were rising however the railways were enduring, the trend would likely not be sustainable. The opposite likewise applies: in the event that railways are profiting however the market is running against the wind, there is no reasonable trend.

### 5. Volume Must Confirm the Trend

It would be ideal for volume to increase assuming the price is moving toward the primary trend and diminishing in the event that it is moving against it. Low volume signals a weakness in the trend. For instance, in a bull market, the volume ought to increase as the price is rising, and fall during secondary pullbacks. In the event that in this model the volume picks up during a pullback, it very well may be an indication that the trend is switching as more market participants turn bearish.

### 6. Trends Persist Until a Clear Reversal Occurs

Reversals in primary trends can be mistaken for secondary trends. It is challenging to decide if a rise in a bear market is a reversal or a fleeting rally to be followed by still lower lows, and the Dow theory advocates alert, it be confirmed to demand that a potential reversal.

## Special Considerations

Here are a few extra points to consider about Dow Theory.

### Closing Prices and Line Ranges

Charles Dow depended entirely on closing prices and was not worried about the intraday movements of the index. For a trend signal to be formed, the closing price needs to signal the trend, not an intraday price movement.

One more feature in Dow theory is line ranges, additionally alluded to as trading ranges in different areas of technical analysis. These periods of sideways (or horizontal) price movements are viewed as a period of combination, and traders ought to trust that the price movement will break the trend line before reaching a resolution on what direction the market is going. For instance, assuming the price were to move over the line, almost certainly, the market will trend up.

### Signals and Identification of Trends

One troublesome part of carrying out Dow theory is the accurate identification of trend reversals. Keep in mind, a follower of Dow theory trades with the overall bearing of the market, so they must recognize the places where this course moves.

One of the principal strategies used to distinguish trend reversals in Dow theory is pinnacle and-trough analysis. A [peak](/top) is defined as the highest price of a market movement, while a [trough](/trough) is viewed as the lowest price of a market movement. Note that Dow theory expects that the market doesn't move in a straight line however from highs (tops) to lows (troughs), with the overall moves of the market trending toward a path.

A vertical trend in Dow theory is a series of successively higher pinnacles and higher troughs. A downward trend is a series of successively lower pinnacles and lower troughs.

The 6th principle of Dow theory fights that a trend stays in effect until there is an obvious indicator that the trend has reversed. Similar as Newton's most memorable law of movement, an item moving will in general move in a single course until a force disturbs that movement. Likewise, the market will keep on moving in a primary course until a force, for example, a change in business conditions, is sufficiently strong to change the heading of this primary move.

### Reversals

A reversal in the primary trend is signaled when the market can't make one more successive pinnacle and trough toward the primary trend. For an uptrend, a reversal would be signaled by a failure to arrive at another high followed by the powerlessness to arrive at a higher low. In this situation, the market has gone from a period of successively higher highs and lows to successively lower highs and lows, which are the parts of a downward primary trend.

The reversal of a downward primary trend happens when the market no longer falls to lower lows and highs. This happens when the market lays out a pinnacle that is higher than the previous pinnacle, followed by a trough that is higher than the previous trough, which are the parts of a vertical trend.

## Highlights
- The theory is predicated on the thought that the market discounts everything in a manner reliable with the efficient markets hypothesis.
- In such a paradigm, different market indices must affirm each other in terms of price action and volume designs until trends reverse.
- The Dow Theory is a technical system that predicts the market is in a vertical trend in the event that one of its averages advances over a previous important high, joined or followed by a comparative advance in the other average.
