# Zero-Sum Game
## What Is a Zero-Sum Game?

Zero-sum is a situation in [game theory](/gametheory) in which one person's gain is equivalent to another's loss, so the net change in wealth or benefit is zero. A zero-sum game might have as not many as two players or upwards of millions of participants. In financial markets, options and [futures](/futures) are instances of zero-sum games, excluding transaction costs. For each person who gains on a contract, there is a counter-party who loses.

## Understanding Zero-Sum Game

Zero-sum games are found in game theory, yet are more uncommon than non-zero sum games. Poker and gambling are well known instances of zero-sum games since the sum of the sums won by certain players equals the combined losses of the others. Games like chess and tennis, where there is one champ and one loser, are additionally zero-sum games.

The game of [matching pennies](/matching-pennies) is many times refered to act as an illustration of a zero-sum game, as indicated by game theory. The game includes two players, An and B, at the same time putting a penny on the table. The payoff relies upon regardless of whether the pennies match. On the off chance that the two pennies are heads or tails, Player A successes and keeps Player B's penny; in the event that they don't match, then, at that point, Player B wins and keeps Player A's penny.

Matching pennies is a zero-sum game since one player's gain is the other's loss. The payoffs for Players An and B are displayed in the table below, with the first numeral in quite a while (a) through (d) addressing Player A's payoff, and the subsequent numeral addressing Player B's season finisher. As should be visible, the combined season finisher for An and B in every one of the four cells is zero.

Zero-sum games are something contrary to mutual benefit situations —, for example, a trade agreement that essentially increments trade between two countries — or real dilemmas, similar to war, for example. In real life, in any case, things are not generally so self-evident, and gains and losses are frequently hard to measure.

In the stock market, trading is many times considered a zero-sum game. Be that as it may, on the grounds that trades are made on the basis of future expectations, and traders have various inclinations for risk, a trade can be mutually beneficial. Investing longer term is a positive-sum situation since capital flows help production, and occupations that then give production, and occupations that then give savings, and income that then gives investment to proceed with the cycle.

## Zero-Sum Game versus Game Theory

Game theory is a complex hypothetical study in [economics](/economics). The 1944 earth shattering work "Theory of Games and Economic Behavior," written by Hungarian-conceived American mathematician John von Neumann and co-written by Oskar Morgenstern, is the foundational text. Game theory is the study of the decision-production process between at least two intelligent and rational gatherings.

Game theory can be utilized in a wide cluster of economic fields, including [experimental economics](/experimental-economics), which utilizations tests in a controlled setting to test economic speculations with all the more real-world knowledge. When applied to economics, game theory utilizes mathematical recipes and conditions to foresee results in a transaction, considering various factors, including gains, losses, optimality, and individual behaviors.

In theory, a zero-sum game is tackled by means of three arrangements, maybe the most notable of which is the [Nash Equilibrium](/nash-equilibrium) put forward by John Nash in a 1951 paper named "Non-Cooperative Games." The Nash equilibrium states that at least two rivals in the game — given information on every others' decisions and that they won't receive any benefit from changing their decision — will in this way not veer off from their decision.

## Instances of Zero-Sum Games

When applied explicitly to economics, there are various factors to consider while understanding a zero-sum game. Zero-sum game assumes a rendition of [perfect competition](/perfectcompetition) and perfect data; the two rivals in the model have all the important data to settle on an educated choice. Making a stride back, most transactions or trades are intrinsically non-zero-sum games since when two gatherings consent to trade they do as such with the comprehension that the goods or services they are getting are more significant than the goods or services they are trading for it, after [transaction costs](/transactioncosts). This is called positive-sum, and most transactions fall under this category.

> Most other well known game theory strategies like the [prisoner's dilemma](/detainees dilemma), Cournot Competition, [Centipede Game](/centipede-game), and Deadlock are non-zero sum.

Options and futures trading is the closest viable guide to a zero-sum game scenario on the grounds that the contracts are agreements between two gatherings, and, on the off chance that one person loses, the other party gains. While this is an extremely simplified clarification of options and futures, generally, if the price of that commodity or [underlying asset](/underlying-asset) rises (for the most part against market expectations) inside a set time period, an investor can close the futures contract at a profit. In this way, assuming an investor brings in money from that bet, there will be a relating loss, and the net outcome is a transfer of wealth starting with one investor then onto the next.

## Features
- Most transactions are non-zero-sum games in light of the fact that the final product can be beneficial to the two players.
- A zero-sum game is a situation where, in the event that one party loses, the other party wins, and the net change in wealth is zero.
- Zero-sum games can incorporate just two players or a great many participants.
- In financial markets, futures and options are viewed as zero-sum games on the grounds that the contracts address agreements between two gatherings and, on the off chance that one investor loses, the wealth is transferred to another investor.
