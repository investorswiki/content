## What Is a Spot Market?

The spot market is where financial instruments, for example, [commodities](/commodity), currencies, and securities, are traded for immediate delivery. Delivery is the exchange of cash for the financial instrument. A [futures contract](/futurescontract), then again, depends on the delivery of the underlying asset at a future date.

Exchanges and [over-the-counter](/otc) (OTC) markets might give spot trading as well as futures trading.

Spot markets are additionally alluded to as "physical markets" or "[cash markets](/cashmarket)" on the grounds that trades are swapped for the asset effectively immediately. While the official transfer of funds between the buyer and seller might take time, like [T+2](/tplus1) in the stock market and in most currency transactions, both parties consent to the trade "right now." A non-spot, or futures transaction, is consenting to a price now, but delivery and transfer of funds will take place at a later date.

Futures trades in contracts that are about to lapse are additionally sometimes called spot trades since the terminating contract means that the buyer and seller will trade cash for the underlying asset immediately.

## Spot Price

The current price of a financial instrument is called the [spot price](/spotprice). It is the price at which an instrument can be sold or bought immediately. Buyers and sellers create the spot price by posting their buy and sell orders. In [liquid](/liquidity) markets, the spot price might change continuously, as orders get [filled](/fill) and new ones enter the marketplace.

> "Spot" comes from the phrase "on the spot", where in these markets you can purchase an asset on the spot.

- The [New York Stock Exchange](/nyse) (NYSE) is an illustration of an exchange where traders buy and sell stocks for immediate delivery. This is a spot market.
- The [Chicago Mercantile Exchange](/cme) (CME) is an illustration of an exchange where traders buy and sell futures contracts. This is a futures market and not a spot market.

## Spot Market and Over-the-Counter

Trades that happen directly between a buyer and seller are called [over-the-counter](/otc) (OTC). A centralized exchange doesn't facilitate these trades. The [foreign exchange market](/foreign-exchange-markets) (or forex market) is the world's largest OTC market with an average daily turnover of $5 trillion.

In an OTC transaction, the price can be either founded on a spot or a future price/date. In an OTC transaction the terms are not really standardized, and therefore, might be subject to the discretion of the buyer as well as seller. Likewise with exchanges, OTC stock transactions are typically spot trades, while futures or [forward](/forwardcontract) transactions are often not spot.

## Illustration of a Spot Market

Let's say an online furniture store in Germany offers a 30% discount to all international customers who pay within five business days after submitting a request.

Danielle, who operates an online furniture business in the United States, sees the offer and chooses to purchase $10,000 worth of tables from the online store. Since she wants to buy euros for (almost) immediate delivery and is content with the current EUR/USD [exchange rate](/exchangerate) of 1.1233, Danielle executes a foreign exchange transaction at the spot price to buy the equivalent of $10,000 in [euros](/euro), which works out to be \u20ac8,902.34 ($10,000/1.1233). The spot transaction has a settlement date of T+2, so Danielle receives her euros in two days and settles her account to receive the 30% discount.

## Advantages and Disadvantages of Spot Markets

The spot price is the current quote for immediate purchase, payment, and delivery of a particular commodity. This means that it is amazingly important since prices in derivatives markets, for example, for futures and options will be inevitably founded on these values. Spot markets likewise tend to be inconceivably liquid and active consequently. Commodity producers and consumers will take part in the spot market and afterward hedge in the derivatives market.

A disadvantage of the spot market, in any case, is taking delivery of the physical commodity. Assuming you buy spot pork bellies, you presently own a few live hoards. While a meat processing plant might want this, a speculator presumably doesn't. Another downside is that spot markets cannot be utilized effectively to hedge against the production or consumption of goods in the future, which is where derivatives markets are better-suited.
