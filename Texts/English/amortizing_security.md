## What Is an Amortizing Security?

An amortizing security is a class of debt investment where a portion of the underlying principal amount is paid notwithstanding interest with every payment made to the security's holder. The ordinary payment that the security holder receives is derived from the payments that the borrower makes in paying off the debt.

Amortizing securities are debt-backed, meaning a loan or a pool of loans has been [securitized](/securitization). According to the borrower's viewpoint, nothing has transformed from the original loan agreement, yet the payments made to the bank flow through to the investor who holds the security made from the loan. [Mortgages](/endlessly mortgage backed securities are common forms of amortizing securities.

## Amortizing Securities and Prepayment Risk

It isn't uncommon for the underlying borrower to prepay a portion, while perhaps not all, of the debt's principal in the event that interest rates drop to a point where refinancing checks out.

If prepayment happens, the investor will receive the remainder of the principal and no more interest payments will happen. This passes on the investor with dollars to invest in a lower interest environment than was possible the case when they purchased the amortizing security.

## Stripping Amortizing Securities

Due to the unique two-portion payments, an amortizing security can be stripped into interest-only and principal-only products, or some combination where the proportion of the two are inconsistent dispensed to a [tranche](/tranches).

The interest-only strip will take on all the prepayment risk and the principal-only strip really benefits from prepayment in light of the fact that the investor gets the money back sooner, profiting from the time value of money since there is no interest coming at any rate. In this case, the two strips of an amortizing security become intermediaries for the investor's proposition on the future movement of interest rates.
