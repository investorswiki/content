# Volume Discount
## What Is a Volume Discount?

A volume discount is an economic incentive to urge people or organizations to purchase goods in numerous units or in large amounts. The seller or manufacturer rewards those buying in bulk by giving a reduced price to every great or group of goods. Volume discounts permit organizations to purchase extra [inventory](/inventory) at reduced cost and permit sellers or manufacturers to reduce inventories by selling more units to bulk buyers who are boosted by the lower price.

## Understanding Volume Discounts

Volume discounts permit buyers to purchase goods at a discounted rate. These savings are frequently given to consumers. For instance, Walmart can purchase such large amounts of every specific great that it regularly gets volume discounts from its [vendors](/seller). Walmart's customers, thusly, are able to purchase these goods for less money than if they went to a store that didn't buy in such great volume.

In financial markets, some brokerage firms offer volume discounts on commissions charged relying upon the level of investment or trading activity or for large [block order](/blocktrade) trades.

## How Volume Discounts Work

The discounts can take on different structures. Volume discounts are frequently tiered â€” that is, a specific [discount](/discount) is applied to X number of units inside that tier. The discount increments with respect to tiers that incorporate increasingly large numbers of units. For example, a discount could be applied to 50 to 100 units sold, with a greater discount for 101 to 200 units sold, and an even larger discount could apply to 201 to 300 units sold, etc.

One more method of offering volume discounts is to apply a lower rate just when a certain threshold is reached. For instance, the discount could come full circle after 100 units are purchased, and just apply to the units past that threshold. The buyer would in any case pay full price for the initial 100 units they obtained.

Yet another discount structure is to offer reduced prices on bundles of units. A discount price could be offered for each 10 units sold, with a similar rate applied similarly. One more profound discount rate could then be applied for each 25 units sold. To receive the rewards of the lower prices, the buyer must purchase units in the stated augmentations. In the previous model, on the off chance that the buyer purchased 15 units, they would pay the lower rate just for 10 units and full price for the excess five units. A similar would be true in the event that 27 units were purchased; two units would cost full price while 25 units get the lower rate. The volume discount wouldn't matter to the whole order.
