# Employee Stock Option (ESO)
## What Are Employee Stock Options? Where Do They Come From? The amount Are They Worth?
As an incentive to try sincerely and assist their company with developing, employers frequently give their employees equity compensation as stock options.
Just like financial options, employee stock options are contracts that give partners the right to **exercise** a set number of company shares. These shares are valued at a predetermined price, known as the [strike price](/strikeprice), throughout a distinct time span, called the **exercise period**.
The [strike price](/strikeprice) is generally the market price that the stock was valued at when the option was granted. On the off chance that an employee sells the option at a higher price than they paid to exercise it, they will profit. The term that is utilized to depict the difference between the price they paid and the price they exercise is known as the **spread**.
The time period when employees can exercise their options is known as the **vesting schedule**. The equity grant agreement subtleties the grant date, the number of options granted, the strike price, as well as limitations, for example, the base amount of time the options must be held to exercise them. This time span is typically somewhere in the range of one and three years, albeit a few contracts permit a certain percentage of the options to be exercised following one year, an extra percentage following two years, and so forth.
- Options that are valued below the stock's current price are known as being **in the money**.
- Options that are valued over the stock's market price are known as being **underwater**, or [out of the money](/out-of-the-money). Frequently, when this occurs, a company will reprice its options so employees can trade them in profitably.

On the off chance that the employee leaves the company before the options vest, they become canceled.
## How Do Stock Options Work for an Employee?
Here is an illustration of an employee stock options contract.
An employee is granted 1,000 stock options, vesting north of 5 years. The strike price is $100 per share. Under a phased vesting schedule, 20% of the shares (or 200 options) vest each year. On the off chance that the stock price rises above $100 per share, the employee would have the option to exercise them for a profit. On the off chance that they don't rise above $100, it would be better to let them terminate.
## What Are the Two Types of Employee Stock Options and How Are They Taxed?
There are two fundamental categories of employee stock options, and their differences are based on taxation.
1. **Nonqualified Stock Options (NSOs)** are taxed when you exercise the option. The spread gets taxed at normal income rates, as the IRS believes it to be part of an employee's standard income — their compensation.
2. **Incentive Stock Options (ISOs)**, then again, are taxed distinctively on the grounds that they are not taxed when they are exercised. Typically, these options are saved for the company's executive team. On the off chance that these options are held for over 2 years, they are subject to the alternative least tax, which is a better, longer-term tax rate.
## Might Employee at any point Stock Options Be Transferred?
It relies upon the type of stock options, as well as the employer. Employers generally permit stock options transfers on a limited basis.
Stock options that are transferrable are normally treated as NSOs for taxation purposes.ISOs are transferrable to family individuals just in the event of the death of the employee. These stock options are typically subject to the estate tax.
## When Do Employee Stock Options Expire?
Assuming an employee leaves the company, their window to exercise any leftover options is typically 90 days. An equity grant agreement indicates the exercise period for the employee stock options. The maximum length typically doesn't surpass 10 years.
## Are Employee Stock Options Good or Bad? Which Employees Get Them?
Employees at each level of a business are eligible to receive employee stock options, and they can be granted to employees, experts — even board individuals and company investors. Nonetheless, any corporate director who holds greater than 10% of the company's [outstanding shares](/outstandingshares) isn't eligible to receive employee stock options.
Not all employers offer employee stock options, but rather for those that do, it very well may be a great inspiration for an employee to function as tirelessly as they can to increase the company's value as fast as could be expected. In some cases, profits from stock options can surpass a top-level employee's base salary, and they could appreciate tax benefits, too.
For an employer, particularly a startup, employee stock options might be an appealing form of compensation to tempt a gifted employee to join their positions, as they in any case probably won't stand to offer the position at market rates.
In any case, just as there are benefits to employee stock options, likewise gambles — the greatest are being on the off chance that a company neglects to satisfy analyst hopes, and subsequently the employee stock options never surpass their exercise price. At the point when that occurs, the options have no value.
Likewise, on the off chance that a company is on a descending trend in its life cycle, is operating during a bear market, or declares bankruptcy, its employee stock options will in all likelihood be delivered worthless, making it very dangerous for any employee to consent to getting sole compensation as such. Before they make all necessary endorsements, they ought to make certain to get their work done.
