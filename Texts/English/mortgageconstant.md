# Mortgage Constant
## What Is a Mortgage Constant?

A mortgage steady is the percentage of money paid every year to pay or service a debt contrasted with the total value of the loan. The [mortgage](/mortgage) consistent assists with determining how much cash is required annually to service a mortgage loan.

It is calculated as dividing the annual debt service for the loan by the total loan value.

## Understanding a Mortgage Constant

A mortgage consistent is the percentage of money paid to service debt on an annual basis partitioned by the total loan amount. The outcome is communicated as a percentage, meaning it gives the percentage of the total loan paid every year. The mortgage steady can assist borrowers with determining the amount they'll pay every year for the mortgage. The borrower would need a lower mortgage consistent since it would mean a lower annual debt servicing cost.

Real estate investors utilize a mortgage consistent while taking out a mortgage to buy a property. The investor will need to be certain they charge sufficient rent to cover the annual debt servicing cost for the mortgage loan. Banks and commercial lenders utilize the mortgage steady as a debt-coverage ratio, meaning they use it to determine whether the borrower has sufficient income to cover the mortgage consistent.

## Calculating the Mortgage Constant

To compute the mortgage consistent, we would total the regularly scheduled payments for the mortgage for one year and gap the outcome by the total loan amount.

For instance, a $300,000 mortgage has a regularly scheduled payment of $1,432 each month at a 4% annual fixed interest rate. A mortgage calculator can show you the impact of different rates on your regularly scheduled payment.

- The total annual debt servicing cost is $17,184 or (12 months * $1,432).
- The mortgage steady is 5.7% = ($17,184/$300,000).

> The mortgage steady just applies to fixed-rate mortgages since it's basically impossible to foresee the lifetime debt service of a variable-rate loan â€” albeit a consistent could be calculated for any periods with a locked-in interest rate.

## Applications of the Mortgage Constant

A mortgage steady is a helpful device for real estate investors since it can show whether the property will be a productive investment. Meanwhile, debt yield is something contrary to the mortgage consistent. Debt yield shows the percentage of annual income in light of the mortgage loan amount. Assuming the debt yield is higher than the mortgage consistent, the cash flow is positive, making the investment productive.

Using the prior model, suppose an investor wanted to buy the house to rent it out. The month to month [net operating income](/noi) (NOI) received from the rental property is expected to be $1,600 each month. The net income is the month to month rent minus any month to month expenses. The loan amount to purchase the property was $300,000 from our previous model.

- The annual net income is $19,200 or $1,600 x 12 months.
- The debt yield is calculated by taking the annual net operating income of $19,200 and dividing it by the loan amount of $300,000 to show up at 6.4%.
- On the off chance that you recall, the mortgage consistent was 5.7%, and since the debt yield is higher than the steady, it would be a productive investment.

At the end of the day, the annual net income from the property is all that could possibly be needed to cover the annual debt servicing costs or the mortgage steady. As stated before, banks or lenders can likewise utilize the mortgage consistent to determine in the event that a borrower has the annual income to cover the debt servicing costs for the loan.

The calculation would be done likewise as above, however instead of using month to month rental income, the lender would substitute the borrower's month to month earnings. The bank would have to ascertain the borrower's month to month net income or the cash left over after expenses and other month to month debt payments were paid. From that point, the lender could work out the annual net income and the debt yield to determine assuming covering the mortgage constant is sufficient.
