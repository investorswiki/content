# Irredeemable Convertible Unsecured Loan Stock - ICULS
## What Is an Irredeemable Convertible Unsecured Loan Stock (ICULS)?

An irredeemable convertible unsecured loan stock (ICULS) is a [hybrid security](/hybridsecurity) that has a few characteristics of a debt instrument and a few qualities of a [equity warrant](/warrant). Like a bond, an ICULS pays a fixed interest [coupon](/coupon) to the holder semi-yearly or every year at a foreordained rate. Like a warrant or a convertible bond, an ICULS can be changed over into common shares of stock, which can see the value in value for the investor.

ICULs are issued by state run administrations or companies seeking to finance existing operations or new tasks. They are especially common in Malaysia, where youthful or monetarily weak companies use them to gain access to new capital.

## Understanding an Irredeemable Convertible Unsecured Loan Stock

ICULS's are called "[loan stocks](/loan_stock)" on the grounds that investors are basically loaning funds to the issuer. In return, investors appreciate periodic interest income until the ICULS is changed over into equity from which the holders receive [dividends declared](/declarationdate).

The ICULS can be changed over completely to equities whenever up to the expiration date. Some ICULS's require a [mandatory conversion](/mandatoryconvertible) when they mature. On this date, the conversion is done consequently, whether or not the holder of the security gives up them or not.

Upon issuance, the ICULS indicates the [conversion ratio](/conversionratio) at which its underlying loan can be changed over into stock (one of its qualifications from a conventional warrant). For instance, assuming the conversion ratio is 20:1, this means that one ICULS can be changed over into 10 common shares.

The [conversion price](/conversionprice) is the price at which ICULS can be changed over into common shares, and not set in stone by the conversion ratio. In the event that an ICULS is trading for a nominal value of RM1,000 with a conversion ratio of 20, then, at that point, the conversion price is RM1,000/20 = RM50. The holder must choose the option to receive the 10 underlying stocks even assuming the current market price of the stock is under RM50.

## Upsides and downsides of Irredeemable Convertible Unsecured Loan Stock

Assuming the current market price of the stock at the hour of conversion is not exactly the conversion price (RM40, say, utilizing the above model), the ICULS is supposed to be [out of the money](/outofthemoney). In this case, the holder of the security will be required to pay the difference between the conversion price and the stock price to receive the underlying shares. Then again, assuming the stock price is higher than the conversion price, the ICULS is [in the money](/inthemoney), and the holder receives the stipulated number of shares without paying any extra cost.

## Special Considerations for Irredeemable Convertible Unsecured Loan Stock

The loan given to an ICULS issuer isn't secured by [collateral](/collateral). In the event of default, there is no guarantee that holders will actually want to recuperate their principal investments and future coupon payments. Moreover, ICULS can't be reclaimed for cash (consequently the "irredeemable" in their name) â€” a key manner by which they contrast from conventional convertible bonds. Since they are unsecured and can't be cashed in, ICULS are positioned low on the hierarchy of claims and are [subordinate](/subordinateddebt) to any remaining debt obligations of the company.

At the point when irredeemable convertible unsecured loan stock is changed over, new shares are issued. At the point when new shares are issued, this outcomes in [full dilution](/fullydilutedshares) for existing shareholders in the company as the total number of shares outstanding builds, leading to a decline in [earnings for every share](/eps) (EPS).
