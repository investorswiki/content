## A Brief History of Technical Analysis

The technical analysis of stocks and trends has been utilized for many years.

The core principle underlying technical analysis is that the market price mirrors generally available information that could impact a market. Subsequently, there's compelling reason need to take a gander at economic, fundamental, or new developments since they're now priced into a given security. Technical analysts generally accept that prices move in trends and history will in general repeat itself with regards to the market's overall psychology.

These patterns, underpinned by mental factors, are designed to foresee where prices are headed, following a breakout or breakdown from a specific price point and time. For instance, a [ascending triangle](/ascendingtriangle) chart pattern is a bullish chart pattern that shows a key area of resistance. A breakout from this resistance could lead to a critical, high-volume move higher.

Leaving those aside, the technical analysis of stocks and trends has an interesting limitation unique to itself.

As more technical analysis strategies, tools, and methods become widely adopted, these substantially affect the price action. For instance, are those [three black crows](/three_black_crows) forming on the grounds that the priced-in information is legitimizing a bearish reversal or on the grounds that traders generally concur that they ought to be followed by a bearish reversal and achieve that by taking up short positions? Albeit this is a fascinating inquiry, a true technical analyst doesn't really care as long as the trading model keeps on working.
