# End of the week Effect
## What Is the Weekend Effect?

The weekend effect is a phenomenon in financial markets wherein stock returns on Mondays are frequently fundamentally lower than those of the promptly going before Friday.

(The weekend effect is sometimes known as the [Monday effect](/mondayeffect), albeit that theory states that returns on the [stock market](/stockmarket) on Mondays will follow the overall trend from the previous Friday. Assuming the market was up on Friday, it ought to go on as the weekend progressed and, come Monday, resume its rise, and vice versa. )

This is the way the end of the week effect works.

## Understanding the Weekend Effect

One clarification for the end of the week effect is the inclination of people to act unreasonably; the trading behavior of individual investors seems, by all accounts, to be somewhere around one factor adding to this pattern. Confronted with vulnerability, people frequently settle on choices that don't mirror their best judgment. Now and again, the [capital markets](/capitalmarkets) mirror the mindlessness of their participants, especially while thinking about the high volatility of stock prices and the markets; the choices of investors might be impacted by outside factors (and sometimes unknowingly). Likewise, investors are more active venders of stock on Mondays, especially following awful news in the market.

In 1973, Frank Cross originally reported the anomaly of negative Monday returns in an article called "The Behavior of Stock Prices on Fridays and Mondays," which was distributed in the **Financial Analysts Journal**. In the article, he shows that the average return on Fridays surpassed the average return on Mondays, and there is a difference in the patterns of price changes between those days. Stock prices fall on Mondays, following a rise on the previous trading day (typically Friday). This timing means a repetitive low or negative average return from Friday to Monday in the stock market.

A hypotheses that endeavor to make sense of the end of the week effect point to the propensity of companies to release terrible news on a Friday after the markets close, which then pushes down stock prices on Monday. Others state that the end of the week effect may be linked to [short selling](/shortselling), which would influence stocks with high [short interest](/shortinterest) positions. On the other hand, the effect could just be a consequence of merchants' blurring hopefulness among Friday and Monday.

The weekend effect has been an ordinary feature of stock trading patterns for a long time. As per a study by the [Federal Reserve](/federalreservebank), prior to 1987, there was a genuinely huge negative return throughout the ends of the week. In any case, the study referenced that this negative return had disappeared in the period somewhere in the range of 1987 and 1998. Starting around 1998, once more, volatility throughout the ends of the week has increased, and the reason for the phenomenon of the end of the week effect stays a much-discussed subject.

## Special Considerations
### The reverse end of the week effect

Restricting research on the "reverse end of the week effect" has been led by a number of analysts, who show that Monday returns are actually higher than returns on different days. Some research shows the presence of several end of the week effects, contingent upon firm size, in which small companies have smaller returns on Mondays and huge companies have higher returns on Mondays. The reverse end of the week effect has likewise been proposed to happen just in stock markets in the U.S.
