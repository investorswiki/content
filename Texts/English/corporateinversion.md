Income from abroad is taxed in the United States, and U.S. [tax credits](/taxcredit) don't cover all taxes which the company must pay somewhere else. As the percentage of sales coming from foreign operations develops relative to domestic operations, the company pays more in U.S. taxes due to where it is domiciled. Likewise, its U.S. income is taxed at a high domestic rate.

Assuming the business incorporates abroad, it can sidestep paying higher U.S. taxes on income not generated in the United States. The company would advance to a corporate inversion to accomplish this aim.
