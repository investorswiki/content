# Reverse Exchange
## What Is a Reverse Exchange?

A reverse exchange in real estate is a type of property exchange wherein the replacement property is acquired first and afterward the current property is sold. A reverse exchange was made to assist buyers with purchasing another property before being forced to trade in or sell a current property. This might permit the seller to hold a current property until its [market value](/marketvalue) increments, subsequently likewise expanding their timing to sell for boosted profit.

## How a Reverse Exchange Works

Standard [like-kind exchange](/like-kind_exchange) rules ordinarily don't have any significant bearing to reverse exchanges. Such rules regularly permit a property investor to end payment of capital gains taxes on a property they have sold inasmuch as the profit from that sale is applied toward the purchase of a "like-kind" property.

The IRS has made a set of safe-harbor rules that consider like-kind treatment, as long as either the current or new property is held in a [qualified exchange accommodation arrangement](/qeaa), or QEAA. Moreover, the investor can't utilize property previously owned as a replacement for the surrendered property.

Reverse exchanges apply just to [Section 1031 property](/section1031), so it is likewise alluded to as a 1031 exchange. Section 1031 properties are properties that businesses or investors exchange to concede paying taxes on any profit acquired from their sale.

Be that as it may, it's not generally so simple as an individual taxpayer buying one property, selling it, then, at that point, utilizing the profits to buy another property. All things considered, there must be a set standard of exchange as well as the presence of a used to set up the facilitator cycle. Section 1245 or [1250](/section1250) properties are ineligible for this type of transaction.

## Special Considerations

One of the most pivotal parts of an effective reverse exchange relies upon the way that the investor must have the financial means for the new purchase. The old property won't have been surrendered at the hour of the exchange, so the investor must be capable of giving the full funding to the new property without the completed sale of the bygone one. Acquisition of the new property might be worked with a [lender](/lender), albeit just specific lenders will be willing and able to work with a reverse exchange investor.

## Requirements for Reverse Exchanges

A 1031 exchange is limited to real property held for investment or business purposes. There is a maximum holding period that applies to properties in reverse exchanges. On the other hand, in the delayed or deferred exchange, the exchanger must first surrender owned property by trading or selling it before gaining another property. Reverse exchanges are much of the time utilized in situations where a property investor must [close on the sale](/close) of another property before having the option to sell their current property.

The courses of events for a reverse 1031 tax-deferred exchange are equivalent to those for different types of 1031 exchanges permitted by the IRS. There are two critical cutoff times and, assuming that either is missed, taxes will be demanded. The IRS doesn't grant extensions on these cutoff times.

The investor has 45 days from the sell date of a property to distinguish potential replacement property and 180 days from that date of sale to purchase a replacement property. A 1031 exchange can't be executed straightforwardly into a personal residence. Exchanges are limited to real property held rigorously for investment or business purposes; in any case, an exchanger can change over an investment property into a primary, or personal, property keeping the IRS's guidelines.

The IRS issued Rev. Proc. 2000-37 to explain the rules in regards to reverse exchanges. The IRS says it won't challenge a property's capabilities as either replacement property or surrendered property or the treatment of the exchange for federal income tax purposes gave the property owner follows the qualified exchange accommodation arrangement as illustrated in the [revenue ruling](/revenue-ruling).

Even subsequent to distributing the IRS ruling, some confusion remained with respect to how property owners ought to structure a reverse exchange and what the obligations were for the chosen third-party exchange facilitator. In a 2017 ruling (**Estate of Bartell**, 147 T.C. No. 5, 2016), the Tax Court dismissed the IRS's position that the exchange facilitator was required to assume the weights and benefits of the property owners to satisfy a substantial 1031 reverse exchange.

Given that reverse exchange rules are developing and can be trying to decipher, property owners ought to talk with a qualified tax attorney or advisor before embraced a reverse exchange.
