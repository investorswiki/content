## Why Banks Convert to State Charter

A few national banks have come to perceive the benefits of changing over completely to a state bank charter. Normally, it's due to these three reasons: cost savings and higher revenues, access to neighborhood regulators and relationships, and the reduction of national bank powers.

Most national banks pay a lot higher regulatory and examination fees than state banks. Each bank has its own fees at the same time, as an example, a national bank with $250 million in assets might save somewhere in the range of $25,000 and $50,000 or more in annual supervisory assessment fees by changing over. Likewise, many banks, contingent upon the state, may see an increase in their legal lending limit, which will permit them to go after loans and reduce participations. The conversion cycle isn't free. Each state requires filing fees and legal costs, a state regulatory exam, and the costs of rebranding the institution to eliminate its previous national brand identity. Even along these lines, this conversion cost might demonstrate to save money on costs and increase expected earnings.

At the point when national banks convert to a state charter, they can likewise gain further developed access to their nearby primary regulators. At the national level, the OCC has had substantial turnover, making it more difficult for a banks to keep a close continuous relationship with their regulatory associations. With a state charter, all chiefs are neighborhood and ought to be more aware of issues influencing state banks. Likewise, a state charter will make the bank have two regulators: the state, alongside the FDIC to give federal deposit insurance. Be that as it may, it tends to be helpful when under a state charter, to have the option to get an encounter with the state's banking commissioner in person with somewhat short notice to examine any issues.

## Impact of Dodd-Frank

By and large, a key benefit of a national bank charter was the far reaching claim that federal laws overshadowed state laws by their charter. This was advantageous for banks with operations in various states, as the federal laws seized the differences in state laws. In any case, the [Dodd-Frank Act](/dodd-frank-financial-regulatory-reform-bill) brought about cutbacks and a reduction of federal seizure. Most national banks are community banks that are not operating nationally. That being said, national banks must consider whether federal appropriation is genuinely beneficial and whether there are different benefits from the national charter. Each state has its own legal cycle for changing over from a national bank to a state bank. The board and management group of a bank that is contemplating conversion must conclude how best to meet its objectives and purposes. Assuming the state agency imagines that the bank is shopping around for regulators to keep away from issues with the OCC, the state agency might probably decline the conversion request.

The Dodd-Frank act confines the charter conversion of a troubled bank, particularly one with any formal enforcement order or reminder of understanding. Dodd-Frank required a bank searching for a conversion to state charter to file the application with its current and possible controller — so the OCC will be aware in advance of any conversion goal.

In this way, albeit the federal charter can reduce regulatory requirements over a number of state regulators for a bank operating in different states, there can be cost savings, increased earnings potential, and better relationships with regulators in a conversion to state.
