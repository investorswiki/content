# Sharpe Ratio
William F. Sharpe made the Sharpe ratio in 1966. It is a ratio that investors and economists use to survey the potential [return of investment (ROI)](/returnoninvestment). The Sharpe ratio assesses the likely returns according to the risks. The ratio is otherwise called the Sharpe measure, Sharpe index, or prize to-inconstancy ratio.
In simple terms, the Sharpe ratio can be utilized to assess assuming an investment is worth the risks. Technically, it measures the average return of an investment that goes past the risk-free rate per unit of deviation of a specific asset. Subsequently, on the off chance that two different financial instruments are compared concerning their Sharpe ratio, the asset with a higher Sharpe ratio would be viewed as better, meaning it has a higher capability of profits corresponding to the risks.
Thus, the higher the value of the Sharpe ratio, the more appealing the investment or trading strategy is. In any case, even Ponzi schemes might introduce a high Sharpe ratio. Yet, the data contribution of Ponzi schemes are false and don't reflect real returns. So it is important to utilize the Sharpe ratio appropriately (with accurate data).
Many banks and big funds managers utilize the Sharpe ratio, combined with different tools, to assess their portfolio performance. It might likewise be applied to financial markets, like the stock market. Nonetheless, negative values of Sharpe ratio are not extremely helpful in practice, on the grounds that the calculation can draw near to zero when the [volatility](/volatility) is too high or when the returns are continually expanding.

## Highlights
- The Sharpe ratio changes a portfolio's past performance — or expected future performance — for the excess risk that was taken by the investor.
- A high Sharpe ratio is great when compared to comparative portfolios or funds with lower returns.
- The Sharpe ratio has several shortcomings, including an assumption that investment returns are ordinarily distributed.
## FAQ
### How is the Sharpe Ratio Calculated?
To compute the Sharpe ratio, investors initially take away the risk-free rate from the portfolio's rate of return, frequently utilizing U.S. Treasury bond yields as a proxy for the risk-free rate of return. Then, at that point, they partition the outcome by the standard deviation of the portfolio's excess return. Note that, in utilizing the standard deviation, this formula verifiably accepts that the portfolio's returns are typically distributed, which may not as a matter of fact be the case.
### What is a Good Sharpe Ratio?
Sharpe ratios above 1.0 are generally thought of "good," as this would propose that the portfolio is offering excess returns relative to its volatility. Having said that, investors will frequently compare the Sharpe ratio of a portfolio relative to its peers. In this way, a portfolio with a Sharpe ratio of 1.0 may be thought of as deficient on the off chance that the rivals in its peer group have an average Sharpe ratio above 1.0.
