# Redemption
## What is redemption?
Redemption is the return of an investor's principal on a fixed income security like a bond, mutual fund or preferred stock.
## More profound definition
Fixed income securities offer investors normal fixed payments of interest. The payments and interest are known in advance. At the point when fixed-income securities mature, they are recovered at par value.
Par value is the security's face value. Securities can be recovered at the hour of maturity or prior to maturity.
Companies that issue bonds now and again have the option to stop paying the bonds' interest rates and repurchase securities before the bonds' maturity dates.
Redemption value is the price paid to the investor while the responsible company repurchases the security either before or at the maturity date.
At the point when called bonds are reclaimed, they are recovered at a price better than expected value. The previous the bond is called by the issuer, the higher the bond's redemption value.
## Redemption models
Mutual fund companies must repurchase mutual fund shares in no less than seven days of accepting investors' redemption requests. On the off chance that an investor has not held a fund for the assigned holding period, he might cause a redemption fee.
Moreover, the investor might be required to pay a back-end load, which is the deferred sales charge. Back-end fees are equivalent to a percentage of the value of the share being sold. Back-end loads decline over the long haul and typically vanish on the off chance that the investor has held the fund for quite some time or longer.
With regards to preferred stocks, investors have an extra layer of protection. On the off chance that the company can as of now not meet its financial obligations, preferred stockholders can claim assets before common stockholders.
Preferred stock is issued at par value. It pay set dividends at normal spans. Investors normally reclaim preferred stocks inside a couple of dollars of their issue price.
Reclaiming investments generates capital gains or losses. Capital losses offset capital gains around the same time. Capital gains are burdened on an annual basis.
