# Stock Cycle
## What Is a Stock Cycle?

A stock cycle is the run of the mill development of a stock's price from an early uptrend to price high through to a downtrend and price low.

Richard Wyckoff, a conspicuous trader and trailblazer in [technical analysis](/technicalanalysis), developed a buy-and-sell stock cycle that happens north of four distinct stages:

1. Accumulation
1. Markup
1. Distribution
1. Markdown

## How Stock Cycles Work

Stock prices may seem random, however there are repeating price cycles that are prevalently driven by the participation of large [financial institutions (FI)](/financialinstitution). Therefore, following cash flows contemplated to start from these large players can be identified as happening in a cyclical manner.

The Wyckoff stock cycle has expansion and contraction periods, similar as the economic cycle. It very well may be utilized for [portfolio management](/portfoliomanagement) allocation, allowing for increased investment during the accumulation and markup phases and profit-taking during the distribution and markdown phases. Investors measure a stock cycle by contrasting the distance between lows with assistance figure out where prices are in the current cycle.

A trader must have a strategy to exploit [price action](/price-action) as it is working out. Understanding the four phases of price action can maximize returns in light of the fact that only one of the phases offers the investor optimum profit chance in the stock market. Becoming aware of stock cycles and the phases, allows investors to be prepared to profit reliably with less [drawdown](/drawdown). The study of stock cycles surrenders investors a heads on trending conditions for a stock, whether sideways, up, or down. This allows them to plan strategies for profit that exploit what the price is doing.

## Understanding the Wyckoff Stock Cycle Phases
1. **Accumulation:** An uptrend begins with the [accumulation](/accumulation-area) phase. This is where institutional investors slowly start getting large situations in a stock. Investors use support and resistance levels to find suitable entry points at this stage of the stock cycle. For example, investors may begin accumulating a security when it approaches the lower end of a deep rooted trading range.
1. **Markup:** A breakout of the accumulation period begins the markup cycle. Trend and [momentum investors](/momentum_investing) make the bulk of their gains during this phase, as a stock's price proceeds higher. In this part of the stock cycle, traders use indicators, for example, [moving averages (MA)](/movingaverage) and trendlines, to assist with making investment choices. For instance, an investor may buy a stock in the event that it remembers back to its 20-day moving average.
1. **Distribution:** Institutional investors begin loosening up their situations at this stage of the stock cycle. Price action starts to move sideways, as the bulls and bears fight for control. A bearish technical [divergence](/divergence) between a stock's price and technical indicator frequently begins to show up in the distribution phase. For instance, a stock's price may make a higher high while the [relative strength index (RSI)](/rsi) makes a lower high.
1. **Markdown:** Volatility frequently increases during this phase, as investors race to [liquidate](/liquidate) their positions. Investors utilize brief retracements to the upside as an opportunity to sell their shares, while traders hope to open [short positions](/short) to make the most of falling prices. Ordinarily, [margin calls](/margincall) increase close to the finish of the markdown cycle, as stock prices close to their lows, which may assist with making sense of the climactic volume frequently associated with this part of the stock cycle.
