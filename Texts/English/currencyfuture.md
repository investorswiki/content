# Currency Futures
## What Are Currency Futures?

Currency futures are an exchange-traded [futures contract](/futurescontract) that determine the price in one currency at which another currency can be bought or sold sometime not too far off. Currency futures contracts are legally binding and counterparties that are as yet holding the contracts on the [expiration date](/expirationdate) must deliver the currency amount at the predetermined price on the predefined delivery date. Currency futures can be utilized to hedge other trades or currency risks, or to conjecture on price developments in currencies.

Currency futures might be appeared differently in relation to non-normalized [currency forwards](/currencyforward), which trade over-the-counter (OTC).

## Grasping Currency Futures

The principal currency futures contract was made at the [Chicago Mercantile Exchange](/cme) (CME) in 1972 and it is the biggest market for currency futures in the world today. Currency futures contracts are [marked-to-market](/marktomarket) daily. This means traders are responsible for having sufficient capital in their account to cover [margins](/edge) and losses which result in the wake of taking the position.

Futures traders can exit their obligation to buy or sell the currency prior to the contract's [delivery date](/deliverydate). This is finished by closing out the position. With the exception of contracts that include the Mexican Peso and South African Rand, currency futures contracts are physically delivered four times in a year on the third Wednesday of March, June, September, and December.

For instance, buying an Euro FX future on the U.S. exchange at 1.20 means the buyer is consenting to buy euros at $1.20 USD. Assuming they let the contract lapse, they are responsible for buying 125,000 euros at $1.20 USD. Every Euro FX future on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange is 125,000 euros, which is the reason the buyer would have to buy this much. On the flip side, the seller of the contract would have to deliver the euros and would get U.S. dollars.

Most participants in the futures markets are [speculators](/examiner) who close out their positions before the futures expiry date. They don't wind up delivering the physical currency. Rather, they make or lose money in view of the price change in the futures contracts themselves.

The daily loss or gain on a futures contract is reflected in the trading account. It is the difference between the entry price and the current futures price, duplicated by the contract unit, which in the model above is 125,000. Assuming the contract drops to 1.19 or ascends to 1.21, for instance, that would address a gain or loss of $1,250 on one contract, contingent upon which side of the trade the investor is on.

## Difference Between Spot Rate and Futures Rate

The currency [spot rate](/spot_rate) is the current cited rate that a currency, in exchange for another currency, can be bought or sold at. The two currencies included are called a "[pair](/currencypair)." If an investor or hedger leads a trade at the currency spot rate, the exchange of currencies happens at the place where the trade occurred or shortly after the trade. Since currency [forward rates](/forwardrate) depend on the currency spot rate, currency futures will more often than not change as the spot rates changes.

In the event that the spot rate of a currency pair expands, the futures prices of the currency pair have a high likelihood of expanding. Then again, in the event that the spot rate of a currency pair diminishes, the futures prices have a high likelihood of decreasing. However, this isn't generally the case. Sometimes the spot rate might move, yet futures that terminate at far off dates may not. This is on the grounds that the spot rate move might be seen as impermanent or short-term, and consequently is probably not going to influence long-term prices.

## Currency Futures Example

Accept hypothetical company XYZ, which is situated in the United States, is vigorously presented to foreign exchange risk and wishes to hedge against its projected receipt of 125 million euros in September. Prior to September, the company could sell futures contracts on the euros they will get. Euro FX futures have a [contract unit](/contractunit) of 125,000 euros. They sell euro futures since they are a U.S. company, and needn't bother with the euros. Therefore, since they realize they will get euros, they can sell them now and lock in a rate at which those euros can be exchanged for U.S. dollars.

Company XYZ sells 1,000 futures contracts on the euro to hedge its projected receipt. Thus, on the off chance that the euro devalues against the U.S. dollar, the company's projected receipt is protected. They locked in their rate, so they get to sell their euros at the rate they locked in. Notwithstanding, the company forfeits any benefits that would happen assuming the euro appreciates. They are as yet forced to sell their euros at the price of the futures contract, and that means surrendering the gain (relative to the price in August) they would have had on the off chance that they had not sold the contracts.
