# Downstream
"Downstream" alludes to oil and gas operations after the production phase and through to the point of sale, whether it be the gas pump or the home heating oil truck. Most major oil companies are known as "incorporated" since they consolidate the "upstream," or exploration and production parts of the oil industry with downstream operations, including oil refining and marketing or natural gas transmission and distribution.

## Features
- There are upstream, midstream, and downstream operations inside the oil and gas industries.
- Downstream operations are the processes associated with changing over oil and gas into their completed products.
- Companies that handle operations in the downstream sector are substances nearest to the customers.
- Downstream operations can likewise play a part in the medical field and agriculture sector.
- An oversupply of crude oil in the upstream section (i.e., the oil companies) may benefit downstream companies.
