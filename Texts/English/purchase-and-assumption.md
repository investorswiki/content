# Purchase and Assumption (P&A)
## What Is Purchase and Assumption?

Purchase and assumption is a transaction where a sound bank or [thrift](/thrift) purchases assets and expects [liabilities](/responsibility) (counting every insured deposit) from an unfortunate bank or thrift. It is the most considered normal and preferred method utilized by the [Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC)](/fdic) to deal with failing banks. Insured depositors of the ruined institution promptly become depositors of the expecting bank and approach their insured funds.

## Figuring out Purchase and Assumption (P&A)

In a purchase and assumption transaction, the FDIC organizes the sale of a troubled or wiped out financial institution to a solid one. Alongside becoming the depository for personal checking, savings, and other [insured accounts](/fdic-insured-account), the procuring bank might buy different assets (like loans or mortgages) of the failing bank too.

The FDIC and the expecting bank frequently try to make the progress as smooth as feasible for consumers. Direct deposits are consequently re-steered to the new institution, for instance.

Notwithstanding, there is one important difference: The accrual of interest stops on everything accounts once the troubled bank is closed. The expecting bank becomes responsible for restoring interest rates and different terms on accounts and loans, and it might change them â€” it is under no obligation to continue the conditions of its ancestor. Of course, depositors reserve the privilege to pull out their funds from the new institution, with no penalty.

## Alternatives to Purchase and Assumption (P&A)

Purchase and assumption (P&A) is the most common of three fundamental resolution methods the FDIC utilizes. The other two are as per the following:

- **Deposit adjustments and liquidation:** The FDIC pays depositor claims directly with a money order, up to the insured balance in each account. It then, at that point, discards the failed bank's assets to some degree recover its liquidation costs.
- **Open bank assistance:** An insured institution at risk for bankruptcy gets recapitalization assistance before receivership as an injection of cash or noncash capital injection to forestall its failure.

## Types of Purchase and Assumption (P&A) Transactions

Yet again purchase and assumption is a broad category that incorporates different more particular transactions, for example, loss sharing and [bridge banks](/bridge-bank), a makeshift measure, where one institution briefly continues the operations of the indebted bank, giving it a space to breathe to find a buyer so it might become a going concern.

Bridge-bank transactions are considered better than deposit settlements (see below), yet they include additional time, exertion, and responsibility from the [SEC](/sec). In the late 1980s and mid 1990s, the FDIC utilized bridge-bank transactions with financial institutions like Capital Bank and Trust Co., First Republic Bank, and First American Bank and Trust.

In a type of purchase and assumption called an entire bank transaction, the failing bank's all's assets and liabilities are moved to the securing bank. A FDIC asset evaluation decides the worth of the assets being purchased.

In any case, certain categories of assets, for example, subprime loans, are never or rarely moved in purchase and assumption transactions.
