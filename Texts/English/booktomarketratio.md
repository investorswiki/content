## What Does the Book-to-Market Ratio Tell You?

On the off chance that the market value of a company is trading higher than its book value per share, it is viewed as overvalued. In the event that the book value is higher than the market value, analysts believe the company to be undervalued. The book-to-market ratio is utilized to compare a company's net asset value or book value to its current or market value.

The book value of a firm is its historical cost or accounting value calculated from the company's balance sheet. Book value can be calculated by deducting total liabilities, preferred shares, and [intangible assets](/intangibleasset) from the total assets of a company. In effect, the book value addresses how much a company would have avoided in assets in the event that it went with regard to business today. A few analysts utilize the total [shareholders' equity](/shareholdersequity) figure on the [balance sheet](/balancesheet) as the book value.

The market value of a [publicly-exchanged company]) not entirely settled by computing its market capitalization, which is just the total number of shares outstanding increased by the current share price. The market value is the price that investors will pay to secure or sell the stock in the secondary markets.

## Instructions to Use the Book-to-Market Ratio

The book-to-market ratio distinguishes undervalued or overvalued [securities ](/security)by taking the book value and separating it by the market value. The ratio decides the market value of a company relative to its genuine worth. Investors and analysts utilize this comparison ratio to separate between the true value of a public corporation and investor [speculation.](/speculation)

In fundamental terms, on the off chance that the ratio is over 1, the stock is undervalued. Assuming it is under 1, the stock is thought of as overvalued. A ratio over 1 shows that the stock price of a company is trading for not exactly the worth of its assets. A high ratio is preferred by value managers who perceive it to mean that the company is a [value stock](/valuestock) — that is, it is trading efficiently in the market compared to its book value.

A book-to-market ratio below 1 suggests that investors will pay more for a company than its net assets are worth. This could demonstrate that the company has sound future profit projections and investors will pay a premium for that possibility. Technology companies and different companies in industries that have relatively little physical assets will more often than not have a low book-to-market ratio.

## Difference Between the Book-to-Market Ratio and Market-to-Book Ratio

The market-to-book ratio, likewise called the [price-to-book ratio](/price-to-bookratio), is the reverse of the book-to-market ratio. Like the book-to-market ratio, it looks to assess whether a company's stock is finished or undervalued by contrasting the market price of all outstanding shares with the [net assets](/assetvaluation) of the company.

A market-to-book ratio over 1 means that the company's stock is overvalued. A ratio below 1 shows that it could be undervalued; the reverse is the case for the book-to-market ratio. Analysts can utilize either ratio to run a comparison on the book and market value of a firm.
