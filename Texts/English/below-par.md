# Below Par
## What Is Below Par?

Below par is a term portraying a [bond](/bond) whose market price is trading below its face value or principal value, typically $1,000. Bonds are debt instruments that are normally issued by corporations and states to fund-raise. At the point when an investor purchases a bond, the price paid for it is called the [face value](/facevalue). On the off chance that the bond is selling for below par, its price is selling for not exactly its face value. As bond prices are quoted as a percentage of face value, a price below par would commonly be anything short of 100.

## Figuring out Below Par

A bond can be traded at par, better than average, or below par. A bond trading [at par](/at-par) means the bond is trading at the bond certificate's face value. An investor who purchases this bond will be repaid the par value at maturity and may occasionally receive interest payments over the life of the bond. All in all, the maturity date of the bond is the point at which the principal or original amount that was invested is returned to the investor.

A bond with a price [above par](/abovepar) is called a premium bond. In any case, the bond value will slowly diminish over the life of the bond until it is at par on the maturity date. The bondholder will receive the par value of the bond when it develops, which is not as much as what the bond was purchased for by the investor.

A bond trading below par means the bond is trading [at a discount](/at-a-discount). As the discount bond approaches maturity, its value increases and slowly merges towards par over its life. At maturity, the bondholder receives the par value of the bond, which is a higher value than what the bond was purchased for by the investor.

In the event that a bond, for instance, has a $1,000 face value imprinted on its certificate however is selling in the market for $920, being trading below par is said. Albeit the investor paid $920 to secure the bond, $1,000 will be paid to the investor when it develops.

## Why Bonds Trade Below Par

A bond can trade at below par for a couple of reasons, which can incorporate market conditions and changes in the company or entity that has issued the bond.

### Change in Interest Rates

A bond might trade below par when interest rates change in the market. There is an inverse relationship that exists between bond prices and interest rates. On the off chance that common interest rates rise in the economy, the value or price of a bond will diminish. This is on the grounds that the [coupon rate](/coupon-rate) — which is a fixed interest rate — on the bond is presently lower than the market interest rate. Subsequently, market participants will ordinarily sell their existing fixed-rate bonds in an increasing rate environment and opt for recently issued bonds at the current, higher coupon rates.

For instance, we should expect a bond was issued at par. The coupon rate on the bond is 3.5%, and the market interest rate is likewise 3.5%. A couple of months after the fact, powers inside the economy push interest rates higher, and comparable bonds presently offer a 4.0% rate. Since the coupon rate on the existing bond is fixed at 3.5%, it is currently lower than the interest rate that could be earned by buying another bond. At the point when a bond trades below par, its [current yield](/currentyield) (coupon payment separated by market price) is higher than its fixed coupon rate.

### Change in Credit Rating

A bond may likewise trade below par on the off chance that its [credit rating](/creditrating) is downgraded. A [rating agency](/bond-rating-organizations) measures a bond issuer's creditworthiness by looking at the financial performance and stability of the issuer. A credit agency, like [Moody's Corporation (MCO)](/moodys), could downgrade an issuer's credit in the wake of thinking about certain factors, including worries about the issuer's [risk of default](/defaultrisk) — or nonpayment of the principal back to the investors. Different factors that could lead to a credit downgrade could incorporate deteriorating business conditions, more vulnerable economic growth, and excessive amounts of debt on a company's [balance sheet](/balancesheet). A downgrade would reduce the confidence level in the issuer's financial wellbeing, which would probably make the value of the bonds drop below par.

### Supply and Demand

At the point when there is an excess supply of a bond, the bond will trade below par. In the event that interest rates are expected to increase from now on, the bond market might experience an increase in the number of new bonds being issued. Since bond issuers endeavor to borrow funds from investors at the lowest cost of financing potential, they will increase the supply of these low interest-bearing bonds, realizing that bonds issued in the future might be financed at a higher interest rate. The excess supply will, thusly, push down the price for bonds below par.

## Features
- Bonds trade below par as interest rates rise, as the issuer's credit rating falls, or when the bond's supply extraordinarily surpasses demand.
- Below par alludes to a bond price that is currently below its face value.
- Below par bonds are supposed to exchange at a discount, and the price will be quoted below 100.
