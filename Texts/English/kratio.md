# K-Ratio
## What Is the K-Ratio?

The K-ratio is a valuation metric that looks at the consistency of an equity's return over the long run. The data for the ratio is derived from a [value-added month to month index](/vami) (VAMI), which utilizes [linear regression](/regression) to track the progress of a $1,000 initial investment in the security being examined.

## Formula and Calculation of the K-Ratio

The K-ratio can be calculated as:

- where there are **n** return periods in the month to month return data.

## Everything that the K-Ratio Can Say to You

The K-ratio was developed by derivatives trader and analyst Lars Kestner as a method for addressing a perceived gap in how returns had been examined. Since a financial backer's key interests are returns and consistency, Kestner planned his K-ratio to measure risk versus return by breaking down how consistent a security, portfolio, or director's returns are over the long haul.

The K-ratio takes into account the returns, yet additionally the order of those returns in measuring risk. The calculation includes running a linear regression on the logarithmic cumulative return of a Value-Added Monthly Index (VAMI) curve. The aftereffects of the regression are then utilized in the K-ratio formula. The slant is the return, which ought to be positive, while the standard blunder of the incline implies the liability.

In 2003, Kestner presented a modified variant of his original K-ratio, which changed the formula of the calculation to incorporate the number of return data points in the denominator. He presented a further modification, which added a square root calculation to the numerator, in 2013.

## Illustration of How to Use the K-Ratio

The ratio measures the return of the security over the long haul and it is viewed as a decent device to measure the performance of equities since it takes the return trend into account, versus moment depictions.

The K-ratio takes into consideration a comparison of cumulative returns for various equities (and equity managers) returns over the long haul. It varies from the widely utilized [Sharpe](/sharperatio) measure by taking into account the order in which returns happen. In practice, the K-ratio is intended to be seen in tandem with and notwithstanding different measures of performance.

Notwithstanding their utilization in dissecting individual stock returns, style categories, and fund managers, K-ratios can likewise be calculated for bonds. K-ratios will contrast across asset classes (domestic stocks versus bonds versus emerging market stocks), inside asset classes (e.g., enormous cap versus small-cap) and by time span.
