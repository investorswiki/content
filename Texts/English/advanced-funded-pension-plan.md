# Advance Funded Pension Plan
## What Is an Advance Funded Pension Plan?

An advance funded pension plan is funded concurrently with the benefits accrued by employees. These funds are set aside and accounted for a long time before employees retire. Advance funded pension plans are generally [defined-contribution plans](/definedcontributionplan) and are fully funded.

There are several different ways these plans can be funded. In one scenario, the employer alone bears the burden of funding the plan. In another, the plan can be funded by both the employer and the employee, like a [401(k)](/401kplan) or [403(b)](/403bplan) retirement option.

## How an Advance Funded Pension Plan Works

An advance funded pension plan has adequate [liquid assets](/liquidasset) to cover all of its [liabilities](/liability), including all future payments to beneficiaries. This type of pension plan not just benefits employees who hope to receive the full allotment of their retirement benefits yet in addition assists companies with killing a significant number of the costs and risks that accompany more traditional pension plans.

This type of [pension plan](/pensionplan) assigns unequivocally what the benefits will be upon [retirement](/retirement), and employers make defined contributions en route. This means that companies can actually add to the plan as they go, implying that employees who withdraw the company before meeting the foreordained amount of time for them to retire can in any case receive a portion of the rewards of the pension plan.

At the point when companies fully fund their pension plans in advance, it means that employees can count on adequate assets being accessible to cover their accrued benefits.

Alternately, certain employers choose for fund the pension plan out of current income. In contrast, the [unfunded pension plan](/unfunded-pension-plan) is an employer-oversaw retirement plan that utilizes the employer's [current income](/currentincome) to fund pension payments as they become essential. This type of plan utilizes actuarial assumptions to decide the periodic contributions it makes to the arrangement.

An unfunded pension plan conveys significantly more [financial risk](/financialrisk), as well as operational risk, for the pensioner and the employer than the advance funded pension plan. Both might be subject to investment risks should the company go through a troublesome period financially. In certain situations, either due to operational issues on the company's part or as a result of more extensive [market dynamics](/market-dynamics), the pensioner might not can support the suitable contribution rate to guarantee that the pension liabilities are met.
