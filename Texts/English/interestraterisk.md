# Interest Rate Risk
## What Is Interest Rate Risk? What Is an Example of Interest Rate Risk?
During[ bear markets](/bearmarket), investors rush to fixed-income investments like[ bonds](/bond) and[ Treasury securities](/treasury-securities) since they offer relative stability in times of market[ volatility](/volatility). Likewise, many give customary interest payments, known as the yield, or coupon.
A ton of investors definitely realize that bond prices and interest rates have an inverse relationship. You might have even heard the phrase, "When interest rates rise, bond prices drop." Bonds are sensitive to interest rate risk, and that means that when interest rates rise, the value of bonds falls, and when interest rates decline, bond prices go up.
## How Does Interest Rate Risk Affect Bonds?
However, why precisely do bonds lose value when interest rates increase? Everything reduces to a question of supply and demand.
At the point when interest rates rise, the value of bonds falls since investors lose interest in claiming bonds with lower yields. Accordingly, melting away demand drives prices lower. Likewise, when interest rates are cut, the value of bonds rises, since investors out of nowhere observe bonds with higher yields to be more appealing, and consequently, demand develops.
Let's assume you bought a 10-year, $1,000 bond today at a yield of 5%, and interest rates rise to 6%. On the off chance that you sold your bond before it arrived at maturity in 10 years, your bond would be worth not exactly the more current bonds, which have a higher yield.
This is where the concept of[ bond duration](/duration) comes in. Bond duration lets us know how much a bond's price could change in the event that interest rates vacillate. Generally talking, for each percentage change in interest rates, the value of the bond either increases or diminishes by similar amount as its duration.

## For what reason Does Interest Rate Risk Increase with Maturity?
We should take a gander at a couple of guides to assist with illustrating why interest rate risk increases on longer-term bonds.
Let's assume you had a 10-year Treasury with a yield of 3.5% and a duration of 8.4 years. Involving the formula in the chart above, assuming that interest rates increased by 2%, the bond's value would diminish by 15%.
However, suppose you had a longer-term bond, like a 30-Year Treasury. This bond has a higher yield, 4.5%, yet it likewise has a higher duration, at 14.5 years. So on the off chance that rates increased 2% in this situation, the bond would **actually lose 26% of its value**!
Even however the 30-Year bond has a higher yield, its higher duration makes it more helpless to interest rate vacillations.
## What Is the Interest Rate Risk Premium?
So how could an investor buy a long-term bond knowing that it is so powerless to changes in interest rates? Definitely, over a period of 30 years, which is a normal long-term maturity, there will be several interest rate changes occurring in the more extensive economy.
This is where the interest rate risk premium comes in. Some long-term bonds are priced with high yields to offset the risk an investor causes while purchasing a security that develops that out of sight: return for the increased risk, investors anticipate more compensation. The increased compensation is the premium.
## What Causes Interest Rate Risk?
Recollect that a bond is basically a loan from an investor to a corporation or government entity: In return for this capital investment, the bond issuer must pay back the principal of this investment with added interest, which is the yield.
Outside factors, like[ inflation](/inflation), add to interest rate risk on the grounds that the Federal Reserve must raise interest rates to return prices to normal.
For certain bonds, like[ corporate bonds](/corporatebond), internal factors likewise influence interest rate risk. Think high-yield bonds associated with companies that have a poor credit rating: These bonds could brandish an exceptionally high yield to offset the risk of default, should the bond issuer fail to pay back their obligations. High yielding, low quality bonds are otherwise called junk bonds.
Most bonds prices are impacted by changing interest rates since that is the actual idea of an interest-paying security â€” interest payments make up some or the entirety of the yield.
## Do Zero-Coupon Bonds Have Interest Rate Risk?
[Zero-coupon bonds](/zero-couponbond) don't offer a coupon payment, thus therefore they are less impacted by interest rate changes. In any case, in the event that an investor sells their zero-coupon bond prior to its maturity, they are subject to interest rate risk on the secondary market, by and by, on the grounds that bond prices fall when interest rates go up.
## How Does Interest Rate Risk Affect Banks?
Each time the[ Federal Reserve](/federal-reserve) increases or lowers its[ Fed funds rate](/federalfundsrate), each corner of the financial markets feel its effect, thus interest rate risk is the concealed force that financial experts and business individuals follow closely.
The Fed funds rate influences both short-term and long-term interest rates. It additionally influences foreign exchange rates. It additionally plays into more extensive economic contemplations, similar to growth and employment. For instance, when interest rates are cut, it becomes simpler for businesses to obtainloans to build new offices or in any case extend operations since they will have less money to pay back. Rising interest rates, then again, make it harder to carry on with work, secure mortgages to buy homes, or take different actions that include borrowed capital.
