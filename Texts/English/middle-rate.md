# Middle Rate
## What Is the Middle Rate?

In foreign exchange (forex) markets, the middle rate, likewise called the mid and mid-market rate, is the exchange rate precisely somewhere between a [currency's](/currency-exchange) [bid and ask](/bid-and-ask) rates.

## Figuring out the Middle Rate

A [bid-ask spread](/bid-askspread) (casually alluded to as the buy-sell spread) is the difference between the highest price that a buyer (the bid) will pay for an asset and the least price that a [seller](/seller) will acknowledge (the ask or offer). An individual hoping to sell will receive the bid price while one hoping to buy will pay the ask price.

When confronted with a standard bid and ask price for a currency, the higher price is what you would pay to buy the currency, while the lower price is what you would receive if you somehow managed to sell the currency. The [bid price](/bidprice) is the thing somebody will pay for a currency, while the ask price is the rate at which somebody will sell a similar currency. For instance, an American traveler is visiting Europe, and the cost of purchasing euros at the airport is shown as follows:

- [EUR](/euro) 1 = USD 1.30/USD 1.40

The higher price (USD 1.40) is the cost to buy every euro. To buy EUR 5,000, somebody would need to pay the dealer USD $7,000. Assume likewise that the next traveler in line has just returned from an European vacation and needs to sell the euros that are extra. They have EUR 5,000 to sell, and would the deal would trade at the bid price of USD 1.30 (the lower price), getting USD $6,500 in exchange for the euros. The middle rate here would be EUR/USD 1.35.

The middle rate is in this way the term used to depict the midpoint rate while leading a [foreign exchange](/foreign-exchange) transaction.

## Ascertaining the Middle Rate

The middle rate is calculated just by utilizing the [median](/median) (midpoint) of the bid and ask (offer) rates. The middle rate, instinctively, is the rate between the [spread](/spread) offered by the [market makers](/marketmaker).

A transaction executed at the middle rate requires two gatherings ready to execute in inverse bearings (i.e., a buyer and a seller) simultaneously. Trading at the middle rate is most important in markets that are illiquid or have a wide bid-ask spread.

## Illustration of the Middle Rate

For instance, say the market for the EUR/USD currency pair is trading with a bid price of $1.1920 and an offer price of $1.1930. A buyer and seller wish to execute with one another, and both are seeking [price improvement](/priceimprovement) so they don't need to lift the offer or hit the bid, separately.

They could consent to execute the trade at the middle rate, which would be $1.1925. The two players benefit by not crossing the whole spread to execute their transaction.

## Special Considerations

With the coming of online trading and increased liquidity, bid-ask spreads have fixed to a point where partners meeting at a middle rate is to a lesser extent a real concern since the bid and offer are so close to each other, in any case. Also, with less foreign exchange transactions happening through brokers, middle rate transactions are less predominant.

> The mid-market concept can be applied to other financial instruments with two-sided markets, for example, [stocks](/stock), [commodities](/ware), [futures](/futures, etc.
