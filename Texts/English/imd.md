## History of the International Institute for Management Development

The International Institute for Management Development was shaped in 1990 through the merger of independent management education centers International Management Institute, laid out in 1946 by Alcan, and Institut pour l'Etude des M\u00e9thodes de Direction de l'Entreprise Lausanne, laid out in 1956 by Nestl\u00e9. The new organization settled in Lausanne.

The International Institute for Management Development is set up to be basically an executive education center and offers no university courses or affiliations. The teachers don't have permanent academic tenure yet work under one-year contracts and a performance-based pay package. The workforce comprises of 75 experts, made up of 25 unique ethnicities. The current president is Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Manzoni, who follows Dominique Turpin, John R. Wells, and Peter Lorange. The last option ran the school from 1993 till 2008 and has been widely credited with having laid out it as one of the world's leading business schools.

## International Institute for Management Development's Programs

The International Institute for Management Development offers both a MBA and EMBA (for additional experienced experts) degree as well as an open executive education program which offers adaptable courses. The International Institute for Management Development deliberately keeps enrollment numbers exceptionally low and enlists candidates from around the world to guarantee assorted classroom settings. The institute likewise distributes the "World Competitiveness Yearbook" which measures the overall economic seriousness of the world's leading economic nations.

The school's MBA program is a one-year full-time program. The program runs from January through December with next to no break (summer is dedicated to a Company Engagement Project). The class of 2021 included 98 participants from different countries.

The MBA program centers emphatically around personal development, leadership, and general management rather than functional expertise, and accordingly, the majority (71%) of graduates get positions in the industrial as opposed to the [financial sector](/financial_sector), in contrast to other major schools.

The educational program of the EMBA is not quite the same as the MBA since it targets experienced managers with somewhere around 10 years of experience who look to reinforce their careers without find employment elsewhere. The average class size is around 55 participants. The program has three components: the establishments for business leadership, the advanced management concepts, and the mastery stage.
