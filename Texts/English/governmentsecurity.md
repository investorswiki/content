## What Is a Government Security?

In the investing world, "government security" applies to a scope of investment products offered by a governmental body. For most perusers, the most common types of government securities are those items issued by the U.S. Treasury as Treasury bonds, bills, and notes. Notwithstanding, the governments of numerous nations will issue these debt instruments to fund important continuous operations.

Government securities accompany a commitment of the full repayment of invested principal at maturity of the security. Some government securities may likewise pay periodic coupon or interest payments. These [securities](/security) are viewed as conservative investments with low risk since they have the backing of the government that issued them.

## Understanding Government Securities

Government securities are debt instruments of a sovereign government. They sell these products to finance everyday governmental operations and give funding to special infrastructure and military projects. These investments work similarly as a corporate debt issue. Corporations issue bonds as a method for gaining [capital](/bank-capital) for buying equipment, funding expansion, and paying off other debt. By giving debt, governments can abstain from climbing taxes or cutting other areas of spending in the budget each time they need additional funds for a project.

After giving government securities, individual and institutional investors will buy them to either hold until maturity or sell to other investors on the secondary bond market. Investors buy and sell recently issued bonds in the market for a variety of reasons. They might be hoping to earn interest income from the bond's periodic [coupon](/coupon-rate) payments or to allocate a portion of their portfolio into conservative risk-free assets. These investments are often viewed as risk-free on the grounds that when it comes the time for redemption at maturity, the government can continuously print more money to satisfy the demand.

> Government securities arrive in a variety of forms, but the best-realized types are the ones issued by the U.S. Treasury — Treasury bonds, bills, and notes.

## The U.S. versus Foreign Securities

As currently mentioned, the United States is only one of numerous countries that issues government securities to fund operations. U.S. Treasury bills, bonds, and notes are viewed as risk-free assets due to their backing by the American government. Italy, France, Germany, Japan, and numerous other nations likewise float government bonds.

Notwithstanding, government securities issued by foreign governments can carry the risk of default, which is the disappointment of paying back the principal amount invested. On the off chance that a country's government breakdowns or there's instability, a [default](/default2) can happen. While purchasing foreign government securities, it's important to gauge the risks, which can incorporate economic, country, and political risks.

To act as an illustration of such default risk, one requirements to look no further than 1998 when Russia defaulted on its debt. Investors were shocked by their losses as the country devalued the ruble. This downturn came on the impact point of — and was in some part brought about by — the [Asian financial crisis](/asian-financial-crisis) of that very decade. The Asian crisis was a series of currency devaluations by numerous nations throughout Asia that sent shock waves around the financial globe.

Although U.S. government securities or [Treasuries](/treasurybond) are risk-free investments, they tend to pay lower interest rates as compared to corporate bonds. As a result, fixed-rate government securities can pay a lower rate than other securities in a rising rate environment, which is called interest rate risk. Additionally, the low rate of return may not keep up with rising prices in the economy or the [inflation](/inflation) rate.

## Buying Government Securities

The U.S. Treasury Department issues government securities through auctions to institutional investors for buying and selling. [Retail investors](/retailinvestor) can purchase government securities directly from the Treasury Department's website, banks, or through brokers. Since most U.S. government securities have the [full faith and credit](/full-faith-credit) of the U.S. government, default on these products is improbable.

The purchase of foreign government bonds — otherwise called [Yankee bonds](/yankeebond) — is a bit more complicated than buying the American variant of the securities. Investors must work with brokers who have international experience and may have to meet specific qualifications. A few investors will expect the heightened aspects of [political risk](/politicalrisk) alongside [currency risk](/currencyrisk), credit risk, and default risk to procure the greater yields. A few bonds will require the creation of offshore accounts, and have high least investment levels. Likewise, a few foreign bonds fall into the category of junk bonds, due to the risk attached to their purchase.

## Controlling Money Supply Through Government Securities

The Federal Reserve (the Fed) controls the flow of money through numerous policies, one of which is the selling of government bonds. As they sell bonds, they reduce the amount of money in the economy and push interest rates up. The government can likewise repurchase these securities, affecting the [money supply](/moneysupply) and impacting interest rates. Called [open market operations](/openmarketoperations) (OMO) the Federal Reserve (the Fed) buys bonds on the open market, diminishing their availability and pushing the price of the leftover bonds up.

As bond prices rise, bond yields fall driving interest rates in the overall economy lower. New issues of government bonds are likewise issued at lower yields in the market further driving down interest rates. As a result, The Fed can significantly impact the trajectory of interest rates and bond yields for a long time.

The supply of money changes with this buying and selling, too. At the point when the Fed repurchases Treasuries from investors, the investors deposit the funds in their bank or spend the money somewhere else in the economy. This spending, thus, stimulates retail sales and spurs economic growth. Additionally, as money flows into banks through deposits, it allows those banks to utilize those funds to loan to organizations or individuals, further stimulating the economy.
