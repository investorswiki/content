# Cost of Labor
## What Is the Cost of Labor?

The cost of labor is the sum of all wages paid to employees, as well as the cost of employee benefits and payroll taxes paid by an employer. The cost of labor is broken into direct and indirect (overhead) costs. [Direct costs](/directcost) incorporate wages for the employees that produce a product, remembering workers for an assembly line, while indirect costs are associated with support labor, for example, employees who keep up with factory equipment.

## Figuring out Cost of Labor

At the point when a manufacturer sets the sales price of a product, the firm considers the costs of labor, material, and overhead. The sales price must incorporate the total costs brought about; in the event that any costs are avoided with regards to the sales price calculation, the amount of profit is lower than expected. In the event that demand for a product declines, or on the other hand assuming competition powers the business to cut prices, the company must reduce the cost of labor to stay profitable. To do as such, a business can reduce the number of employees, cut back on production, require higher levels of productivity, or reduce different factors in [production cost](/production-cost).

## The Differences Between Direct and Indirect Costs of Labor

Assume that XYZ Furniture is planning the sales price for lounge area chairs. The direct labor costs are those expenses that can be directly followed to production. XYZ, for instance, pays workers to run machinery that cuts wood into specific pieces for chair assembly, and those expenses are direct costs. Then again, XYZ has several employees who give security to the factory and warehouse; those labor costs are indirect, on the grounds that the cost can't be followed to a specific act of production.

## Instances of Fixed and Variable Costs of Labor

Labor costs are likewise classified as fixed costs or variable costs. For instance, the cost of labor to run the machinery is a variable cost, which changes with the firm's level of production. A firm can without much of a stretch increase or diminishing variable labor cost by expanding or decreasing production. Fixed labor costs can incorporate set fees for long term service contracts. A firm could have a contract with an outside [vendor](/vendor) to perform repair and maintenance on the equipment, and that is a fixed cost.

## Factoring in Undercosting and Overcosting

Since indirect labor costs can be challenging to assign to the right product or service, XYZ Furniture may underallocate labor costs to one product and overallocate labor costs to another. This situation is alluded to as undercosting and overcosting, and it can lead to inaccurate product pricing.

Assume, for instance, that XYZ manufactures both lounge area chairs and wooden bed casings, and that the two products cause labor costs to run machinery, which total $20,000 each month. Assuming XYZ allots too a significant part of the $20,000 labor costs to wooden bed outlines, too little is allocated to lounge area chairs. The labor costs for the two products are mistaken, and the sale prices of the two goods won't mirror their true cost.

## Cost of Labor versus Cost of Living

While the cost of labor alludes to the sum of all wages paid to employees, it ought not be mistaken for the cost of living. The cost of living is the cost expected to keep a certain [standard of living](/standard-of-living) by a consumer in a specific geographic location. This incorporates housing, food, transportation, amusement, and so on. These rates can some of the time be a lot higher than the cost of labor, particularly in profoundly metropolitan areas. For instance, the cost of living is higher in New York City than in a rural city. Demand for housing and food is higher, and that means higher prices for consumers.

## Features
- Costs of labor can be ordered into two fundamental categories, direct (production) and indirect (non-production) cost of labor.
- Assuming the cost of labor is inappropriately allocated or assessed, it can make the price of goods or services shift away from their true cost and damage profits.
- Direct costs incorporate wages for the employees that produce a product, remembering workers for an assembly line, while indirect costs are associated with support labor, for example, employees who keep up with factory equipment.
