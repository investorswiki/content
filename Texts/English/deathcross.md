The most closely watched stock-market moving averages are the 50-day and the 200-day.

The history of the death cross as a forerunner of market gains is even seriously engaging throughout shorter time periods. Starting around 1971, the 22 occurrences in which the 50-day moving average of the [Nasdaq Composite index](/nasdaqcompositeindex) fell below its 200-day moving average were followed by average returns of around 2.6% more than the next month, 7.2% in 90 days and 12.4% six months after the death cross, generally double the normal Nasdaq return throughout those time spans, as per Nautilus Research.

It prompted titles depicting "a stock market destroyed." The index continued to lose another 11% over the course of the next two weeks and a day, The S&P then energized 19% from that low in two months, and was 11% over its level at the hour of the death cross under six months after the fact.

Another S&P 500 death cross occurred in March 2020 during the initial COVID-19 panic, and the S&P 500 proceeded to gain just more than half in the next year.
