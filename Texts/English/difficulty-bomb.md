# Difficulty Bomb
The term "difficulty bomb" alludes to the continuous increase in Ethereum mining difficulty as part of its migration to a Proof of Stake system.
While mining, users surmise about the solution to a riddle that the protocol sets out. The riddle is planned with the goal that it requires a fixed amount of investment for miners to tackle it (10-20 seconds in Ethereum). It makes sense, notwithstanding, that the more users speculating, the quicker they'll track down the solution. To cure this, the protocol increases the difficulty of the riddle when [hashing power](/hash-rate) is increased.
Ethereum utilizes this style of consensus algorithm, yet it likewise incorporates a difficulty bomb, which increases the overall difficulty at determined block levels. Thus, such an increase diminishes the profitability of mining - this is the expected effect. Over the long haul, it turns out to be dramatically more earnestly to produce blocks, and rational miners will abandon the practice. At last, the difficulty bomb prompts the purported 'Ice Age,' where it turns out to be so hard to mine that the chain is effectively frozen.
This mechanism is intended to kill Proof of Work, in accordance with Ethereum's current roadmap. The network is expected to progress to staking from now on - the difficulty bomb tries to discourage anybody from continuing to create blocks on the old chain. In addition to other things, this could keep the chain from being split into two argumentative forks.
It has a secondary effect of forestalling the stagnation of development on the Ethereum chain, as designers must regularly upgrade it to keep it from becoming unusable.

## Highlights
- Ethereum's difficulty bomb has been delayed five times as designers calibrate Ethereum 2.0.
- Difficulty alludes to the time and computational power expected to confirm a cryptocurrency's transactions inside a blockchain.
- Ethereum's "difficulty bomb" alludes to a sudden increase in mining difficulty to discourage miners from selecting to remain with the proof-of-work mechanism after its change to proof-of-stake.
## FAQ
### What Is the Easiest Crypto to Mine?
Cryptocurrency mining, or utilizing computational power to approve a block's hash and receive a reward, has gotten considerably more troublesome due to its competitive nature. Mining [farms and pools](/mining-pool) have cornered the market on the higher valued cryptocurrencies, so the most straightforward to mine will be one that utilizes PoW and has the least value (estimated in its return to miners or its market price).
### Why Is ETH Difficulty So High?
The difficulty exists in the proof-of-work consensus mechanism, which approves transactions. Under PoW, the difficulty increases with the number of blocks that have been approved. Nonetheless, ETH is progressing to ETH 2.0, which will utilize proof-of-stake. Thus, arbitrarily chose validators will be utilized rather than competitive mining.
### What Is the ETH Difficulty Bomb?
The Ethereum difficulty bomb is a code adjustment that makes it a lot harder for a miner to confirm transactions on the blockchain and earn a reward under the proof-of-work [consensus mechanism](/consensus-mechanism-cryptocurrency). It is intended to support the change to ETH 2.0, which will utilize the proof-of-stake consensus mechanism.
