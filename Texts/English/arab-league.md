## What Is the Arab League?

The Arab League, formally the League of Arab States, is a union of Arabic-speaking African and Asian countries. It was formed in Cairo in 1945 to advance the independence, power, affairs, and interests of its member countries (initially, there were six) and observers.

The 22 members of the Arab League starting around 2021 are Algeria, Bahrain, Comoros, Djibouti, Egypt, Iraq, Jordan, Kuwait, Lebanon, Libya, Mauritania, Morocco, Oman, Palestine, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Somalia, Sudan, Syria, Tunisia, the United Arab Emirates, and Yemen. The five observers are Brazil, Eritrea, India, and Venezuela.

## Understanding the Arab League

The Arab League countries have widely differing levels of population, wealth, [gross domestic product](/gdp) (GDP), and literacy. They are dominatingly Muslim, Arabic-talking countries, however Egypt and Saudi Arabia are viewed as the predominant players in the League. Through agreements for joint defense, economic cooperation, and free trade, among others, the league helps its member countries to organize government and social programs to work with cooperation and limit conflict.

In 1945, when the League was formed, the noticeable issues were freeing the Arab countries that were still under provincial rule and forestalling the breakup of Palestine by means of the creation of the Jewish state of Israel. (The League perceives Palestine as a separate nation today.)

## The Arab League Council

The overall secretariat deals with the daily operations of the league and is going by the secretary-general. The overall secretariat is the administrative body of the league, the executive body of the council, and the specialized clerical councils.

## Arab League Member Conflicts

The Arab League's adequacy and influence have been hampered by divisions among member states. During the Cold War, a few members were strong of the Soviet Union while others lined up with Western nations. There has likewise been contention over League leadership — especially among Egypt and Iraq.

Threats between governments like Saudi Arabia, Jordan, and Morocco have been disruptive, as have the conduct of states that have gone through political change like Egypt under Gamal Abdel Nasser, and Libya under Muammar Gaddafi.

The United States' assault on Saddam Hussein's Iraq additionally made critical fractures between members of the Arab League.

Goals by the Council don't need to be consistently approved by members. In any case, because they are binding just on the nations that voted for them — no country needs to comply with them despite its desire to the contrary — their adequacy is fairly limited, frequently adding up to minimal more than declarations as opposed to carried out policies.

In February 2020, the League criticized the Middle East peace plan put forward by U.S. President Donald J. Trump's administration, saying it "doesn't meet the base rights and yearnings of Palestinian individuals."
