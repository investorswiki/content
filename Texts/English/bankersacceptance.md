# Banker's Acceptance (BA)
## What Is a Banker's Acceptance (BA)?

Banker's acceptance (BA) is a negotiable piece of paper that functions like a post-dated check. A bank, rather than an account holder, guarantees the payment. Banker's acceptances (otherwise called [bills of exchange](/billofexchange)) are involved by companies as a relatively safe form of payment for large transactions. BAs can likewise be short-term debt instruments, like U.S. Treasury bills, that trade at a discount to face value in the [money markets](/moneymarket).

BAs are most commonly issued 90 days before the date of maturity but can mature at any later date from one to 180 days. They are typically issued in multiples of $100,000.

BAs are issued at a discount to their face value. Thus, similar to a bond, they earn a return. They additionally can be traded like bonds in the secondary money market. There is no penalty for cashing them in ahead of schedule, except for the lost interest that would have been earned had they been held until their maturity dates.

The U.S. sent off the [Federal Reserve](/federalreservebank) in the mid 1900s to assist with creating banker's acceptances that compete with London's. The Fed's goal was to boost U.S. trade and it was given the authority to purchase certain BAs. While the Fed still purchases government bonds, it no longer purchases BAs.
