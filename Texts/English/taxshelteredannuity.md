# Tax-Sheltered Annuity
## What is a tax-sheltered annuity?
A tax-sheltered annuity (TSA) is a retirement savings plan that permits employees of tax-exempt organizations and self-employed individuals to invest pretax dollars to build retirement income. Tax-sheltered annuities are intended to give predictable payouts over the long haul and act as a solid source of income in retirement.
## More profound definition
[Annuities](/annuity) can be structured in different ways. They can turn out revenue for a specific time frame period (like 25 years), guarantee payments for the annuitant's whole life, and be structured to turn out revenue to an enduring spouse on the off chance that the annuity holder passes on.
Like [401(k) plans](/401kplan), TSAs are tax-conceded instruments. Notwithstanding, TSA plans are restricted to employees of tax-exempt organizations and the self-employed, while 401(k) plans are available to any private-area employee whose employer offers a plan.
Most [403(b) plans](/403bplan) offer tax-sheltered annuities. Eligible participants incorporate employees working for tax-exempt organizations and public schools. Nonprofit organizations that qualify under 501(c)3 of the IRS code might offer TSA plans to their employees.
The terms tax-sheltered annuity and 403(b) are often utilized conversely. When the 403(b) was made in 1958, it was known as a tax-sheltered annuity, as it just offered annuities. Over the long run, 403(b) plans have changed. While numerous 403(b) plans actually offer tax-sheltered annuities, they currently offer investments seen in 401(k) plans, including [mutual funds](/mutualfund).
With TSAs, employees' contributions are deducted from their income and the investment develops without the burden of being taxed. Taxes are paid on the annuity once the employee begins to draw income from the investment.
TSA contribution limits are equivalent to 401(k) limits, and offer a catch-up provision for participants north of 50 years of age. Participants who have worked for a qualifying organization for a long time or more and averaged a contribution limit of $5,000 or less are eligible for lifetime catch-up.
## Tax-sheltered annuity model
The chief advantage of a TSA is that it can assist with decreasing your taxes. Suzy is a professor of way of talking at a public university, with a $70,000 annual salary. She is concluding the amount she should save month to month with just 15 years to go until her projected retirement age.
At retirement, Suzy hopes to make an annual income of about $100,000 every year, and might want to earn 75 percent of that amount whenever she has retired. Between Social Security, her university pension, and savings, she will produce almost $60,000 per year, leaving her $15,000 short of her goal. Suzy's advisor proposes a TSA.
To earn the $15,000 in extra annual income, Suzy's advisor computes a month to month contribution of about $700, for a total annuity of $210,000. Suzy approves her employer to make arrangement contributions of $700 per month from her salary, which will reduce her taxes by $230 or so for each pay period. With a TSA, Suzy is earning income with a net out-of-pocket cost of just $470.
