# Takedown
## What Is the Takedown?

The takedown is jargon at the initial cost of a stock, bond, or other security when it is first offered in the open market. The takedown will be a factor in deciding the [spread](/spread) or commission underwriters will receive once the public has purchased securities from them.

A full takedown will be received by members of an investment banking [syndicate](/underwriter-syndicate) who have guaranteed [public offerings](/publicoffering) securities. Dealers outside of the syndicate receive a portion of the takedown while the excess balance stays with the syndicate.

## Grasping the Takedown

At the point when a company offers new issues, for example, publicly traded stocks or bonds, it will hire a [underwriter](/underwriter, for example, an investment banking syndicate, to regulate the method involved with putting up those new issues for sale to the public. The members of the syndicate take on the greater part of the risk inherent in putting up new securities offerings for sale to the public, and in return, they receive a majority of the profit produced from the sale of each share.

The spread or [commission](/commission) of a given offering alludes to the initial profit produced using its sale. Whenever it's sold, the spread must be split among the syndicate members or different salespeople responsible for selling it. The syndicate will regularly partition the spread into the takedown and the supervisor's fee.

In this case, "the takedown" alludes to the profit created by a syndicate member from the sale of an offering, and the chief's fee will normally address a lot more modest part of the spread. For instance, on the off chance that the takedown is $2, the director's fee might be $0.30, so the total takedown paid to the syndicate members is $1.70. This is on the grounds that the syndicate members have fronted money to purchase the actual securities, and thusly expect additional risk from the sale of the offering.

Different fees may likewise be removed from the takedown. For instance, a concession might be paid to members of a selling group who have not fronted money to purchase shares to sell to the public. A profit made by syndicate members on sales of this nature is known as an extra takedown.

## Shelf Offerings

In a [shelf offering](/shelfoffering), underwriters basically bring down securities off the shelf. A shelf offering permits a company to produce money from the sale of a stock over the long haul.

Company An is then supposed to be "bringing down" this stock offering "off the shelf".

The [Securities and Exchange Commission](/sec) (SEC) allows companies to register shelf offerings for as long as three years. This means that on the off chance that Company A registered a shelf offering for a considerable length of time in advance, it would have three years to sell the shares. In the event that it doesn't sell the shares inside the dispensed time, it can expand the offering period by filing replacement registration statements.
