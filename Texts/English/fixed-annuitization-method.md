# Fixed Annuitization Method
## What Is the Fixed Annuitization Method?

The fixed annuitization method is one of three methods by which early retired folks of any age can access their retirement funds without penalty before turning 59\u00bd. The fixed annuitization method separates the retired person's account balance by an annuity factor taken from IRS tables to decide an annual payment amount.

The annuity factor depends on IRS mortality tables and an interest rate that is under 120% of the federal mid-term rate. When the payment not set in stone, it can't be changed. This is otherwise called [72(t) distributions](/rule72t) or [Substantially Equal Periodic Payments](/sepp) (SEPP).

## How the Fixed Annuitization Method Works

The two different methods for right on time, sans penalty retirement withdrawals are the [fixed amortization method](/fixed-amortization-method) and the [required least distribution method](/required distribution). Every method can bring about very unique distribution amounts. The fixed annuitization method is the most confounded however now and again offers the highest payments.

Ordinarily, funds removed before age 59\u00bd are assessed a 10% [early withdrawal penalty](/earlywithdrawal). Funds must be removed as substantially equivalent periodic payments as framed by Internal Revenue Code Section 72(t). They must go on for a considerable length of time or until the retired person comes to 59\u00bd, whichever is longer. Retired folks can choose to receive their distributions annually, quarterly, or month to month. On the off chance that [withdrawals](/withdrawal) are stopped, all funds that have already been removed become subject to early withdrawal punishments.

## IRS Calculation Methods

As per the IRS, the required least distribution method comprises of an account balance and a [life expectancy](/lifeexpectancy) (single life, uniform life, and joint life and last survivor, each utilizing attained age(s) in the distribution calculation year). The annual payment is redetermined every year.

The fixed amortization method comprises of an account balance [amortized](/amortization) over a predefined number of years equivalent to life expectancy (single life, uniform life, or joint life and last survivor) and a [interest rate](/interestrate) of not over 120% of the federal mid-term rate.

The fixed annuitization method comprises of an account balance, an annuity factor, and an annual payment. The annuity factor is calculated in light of the [mortality table](/mortality-table) in Appendix B of Rev. Rul. 2002-62 and an interest rate of not over 120% of the federal mid-term rate. When an annual distribution amount is calculated under this method, a similar dollar amount must be distributed in subsequent years.

Choosing which method to utilize can be convoluted. It's wise to get professional counsel while seeking to take an early distribution.
