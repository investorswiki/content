## More profound definition
The Federal Reserve requires banks and other financial institutions to hold a certain amount of money in reserves toward the finish of every business day to guarantee customers can access their funds and to safeguard against bank disappointments. This is alluded to as the reserve requirement. The reserve requirement is roughly 10 percent of the deposits made at a financial institution. For instance, in the event that a bank has deposits of $100,000,000, the bank's overnight reserve requirement would be generally $10,000,000.
In the event that a bank is short on reserves toward the finish of the business day, they must borrow funds to meet the reserve requirement. Banks commonly borrow extra overnight funds from one another, yet on the off chance that for reasons unknown a bank can't borrow from different institutions, it must borrow from the Federal Reserve's discount window.

Banks in a troublesome financial condition are expected to borrow at the secondary rate.
