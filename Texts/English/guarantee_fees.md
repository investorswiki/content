## What Are Guarantee Fees?

The term guarantee fee alludes to the sum of money paid to the issuer of a [mortgage-backed security](/mbs) (MBS) by the holder.

Likewise called g-fees, guarantee fees additionally allude to charges paid by a mortgagor to a guarantor for services delivered.

Issuers of mortgage-backed security (MBS) providers like [Freddie Mac](/freddiemac), [Ginnie Mae](/ginniemae), and Fannie Mae charge lenders guarantee fees for the creation, servicing, and reporting of the asset, as well concerning the guarantee that the provider will supplement it to verify that payments of principal and interest are made even in the event that borrowers default. While the fee is normally a certain percentage of the value of the asset, the issuer may likewise charge a fixed amount. This payment guarantee is the fundamental part of the guarantee fees.

Providers like Fannie, Freddie, and Ginnie help banks by buying mortgages from mortgage companies, commercial banks, [credit unions](/creditunion), aggregators, etc. By and large, these [government-sponsored enterprises](/gse) (GSEs) pay for these mortgages by giving them back to the originators as a securitized MBS that the beneficiary can then decide to sell or keep. The guarantee fee incorporated into the MBS is the revenue generator for the MBS provider and these are ideally adequate across all products to cover individual mortgage defaults.

Guarantee fees are basically comprised of the credit guarantee they give to the end owner of the MBS, however they likewise cover the costs of overseeing and directing the [securitized](/securitize) mortgage pools, reporting on the MBS to investors and the [Securities and Exchange Commission](/sec) (SEC), and other administrative center tasks.

## Special Considerations

Guarantee fees are set on the [creditworthiness](/credit-value) and size of the underlying mortgage pool. Prior to the mortgage meltdown and financial crisis, guarantee fees were a small deduction of 15 to 25 basis points. In exchange for this small fee, the mortgage originator received a sellable asset while likewise clearing the loan under the table to free up more credit. This was a magnificent deal for lenders, as the MBS providers relied upon the information from loan originators to set the guarantee fees. Banks made a move to push the limits of who could sensibly be given a mortgage, bringing about [NINJA loans](/ninja-loan) and overall market distortion. Tragically, the guarantee fees were not being adjusted to mirror this reality, bringing about a monstrous mortgage meltdown where the U.S. government at last needed to bail out MBS providers due to their guarantee fees being deficient to cover the true liability.

Guarantee fees saw a sharp increase since the financial crisis and the [Great Recession](/great-recession). Compared to pre-meltdown averages of 15 to 25 basis points, the post-meltdown average is over two times. The [Federal Housing and Finance Agency](/fhfa) (FHFA) gives an annual analysis of guarantee fees charged by Freddie and Fannie. The FHFA reported an average guarantee fee of 58 basis points on a fixed-rate 30-year mortgage loan issued in 2019. Despite the fact that guarantee fees generally don't receive a lot of consideration outside of mortgage industry campaigning gatherings, there were political endeavors to make across-the-board increases of 10 extra basis points through the FHFA to reduce future risks to American taxpayers. These proposed increases were suspended prior to implementation.
