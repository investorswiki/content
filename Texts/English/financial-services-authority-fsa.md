# Financial Services Authority (FSA)
## What Is the Financial Services Authority (FSA)?

The Financial Services Authority (FSA) was the agency that regulated financial services in the United Kingdom somewhere in the range of 2001 and 2013. The regulatory authority was officially partitioned in 2013 into the [Financial Conduct Authority](/financial-conduct-authority-uk-fca) and the Prudential Regulation Authority of the [Bank of England](/boe).

## Figuring out the Financial Services Authority (FSA)

The Financial Services Authority (FSA) was officially settled in the United Kingdom by the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000. Initially settled in 1985 as the Securities and Investments Board, the agency adopted the Financial Services Authority name in 1997 until it was broken down in 2013.

FSA was responsible for managing banks, financial advisors, and insurance companies and mediators as well as elements took part in the mortgage business. The Financial Services and Markets Act spread out four primary objectives for the FSA, remembering empowering market confidence for the U.K. [financial system](/financial-system), public awareness and comprehension of the U.K. financial system, getting adequate consumer protections, and diminishing the incidence and impact of financial crime. Improving financial stability was subsequently added to the objectives. These objectives were upheld through a classified set of principles of good regulation.

Moreover, FSA enhanced its liabilities to the financial and consumer sectors in the U.K. by seeking after transparency in manners the agency decided policy and carried out broad capabilities, and by giving political, public, and legal accountability. To this end, FSA operations were regulated and investigated by the Treasury and Parliament, and the agency required that annual reports incorporate performance evaluations towards satisfying their principles.

## Disintegration of the FSA

In the repercussions of the [financial crisis](/financial-crisis) of 2008, government authorities chose to modify the regulatory structure of the financial markets in the U.K, passing the Financial Service Act 2012 and dissolving the FSA beginning in April 2013. To go on with the financial regulation requirements, two new agencies were made: the Financial Conduct Authority and the Prudential Regulation Authority of the Bank of England.

## Supplanting the Financial Services Authority

The Financial Conduct Authority was laid out to manage financial markets, giving protection to consumers and empowering market integrity in the U.K. financial system, and facilitating competition to better serve the interests of consumers. An independent public body, the Financial Conduct Authority, is funded by fees from the 58,000 firms the agency directs.

The Prudential Regulation Authority's liabilities incorporate the regulation of banks, credit unions, insurance firms, and investment firms. The Prudential Regulation Authority is part of the Bank of England, which thusly is owned by the government of the U.K. also, is represented by Parliament. The dynamic body for the Prudential Regulation Authority is the Prudential Regulation Committee, contained several members, including:

- Legislative head of the Bank of England
