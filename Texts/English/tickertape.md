## History of the Ticker Tape

Mechanical ticker tapes gave way to electronic ones during the 1960s. During the late nineteenth hundred years, most brokers who traded at the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) kept an office close to it to guarantee they were getting a consistent supply of the tape and the latest transaction figures of stocks. It was only after 1996 that a real-time electronic ticker was sent off. These authorized transaction figures — to be specific price and volume — are seen today on TV news shows, financial wires, and sites.

These latest quotes were delivered by couriers, or "cushion shovers," who ran a circuit between the [trading floor](/trading_floor) and brokers' offices. The more limited the distance between the trading floor and the [brokerage](/brokerage-organization), the more modern the quotes were.
