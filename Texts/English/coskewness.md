# Coskewness
## What Is Coskewness?

Coskewness, in statistics, measures how much two random factors change together, and is utilized in finance to break down security and portfolio risk. On the off chance that they show positive coskewness, they will more often than not go through positive deviations simultaneously. However, on the off chance that they display negative coskewness, they will more often than not go through negative deviations simultaneously.

## Grasping Coskewness

Coskewness is a measure of a security's risk corresponding to [market risk](/marketrisk). It was first used to examine risk in stock market investments by Krauss and Litzenberger in 1976, and afterward by Harvey and Siddique in 2000. [Skewness](/skewness) measures the frequency of excess returns in a specific course, which depicts an imbalance from the normal distribution.

Coskweness is similar as [covariance](/covariance), which is utilized in the [capital asset pricing model](/capm) as a measure of the volatility, or systematic risk, of a security comparable to the market overall — which is also called beta. In this manner, assets with higher covariance offer more to the variance of a very much expanded market portfolio — and ought to command a bigger risk premium.

Investors favor positive coskewness, since this addresses a higher likelihood that two assets in a portfolio will show extreme positive returns in excess of market returns simultaneously. On the off chance that the return distributions of these two assets would in general show negative coskewness, it would mean that the two assets have a higher likelihood of failing to meet expectations the market simultaneously.

All the other things being equivalent, an asset with higher coskewness ought to be more appealing as it expands the systematic skewness of a financial backer's portfolio. Assets with higher coskewness ought to give a hedge against periods when the benefits of portfolio diversification decay, for example, during periods of high market [volatility](/volatility) when connections between's different asset classes will generally rise strongly.

In theory, positive coskewness reduces the risk of a portfolio and brings down the expected return or risk premium. Emerging markets, for instance, is an asset class that could reduce [portfolio variance](/portfolio-variance), since it is more "correct slanted."

## Highlights
- Negative coskewess means there is a higher likelihood that two assets in a portfolio will at the same time have lower returns than market returns.
- Positive coskewness reduces portfolio risk yet brings down expected return.
- Positive coskewness measure means there is a higher likelihood that two assets in a portfolio will have positive returns in excess of market returns.
- Coskewness is utilized to measure protections' risk with respect to market risk.
