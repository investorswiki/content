# 457 Plan
## What Is a 457 Plan?

Generally talking, 457 plans are [non-qualified](/non-qualified-plan), [tax-advantaged, ](/tax-advantaged)[deferred compensation](/deferred-compensation) retirement plans offered by state governments, neighborhood governments, and a few nonprofit employers. Eligible participants are able to make salary deferral contributions, storing pre-tax money that is permitted to compound without being taxed until it is removed.

## How a 457 Plan Works

Prominently, 457 plans are comparable in nature to [401(k)](/401kplan) plans, just as opposed to being offered to employees at for-benefit companies, they take special care of state and neighborhood public workers, along with generously compensated executives at certain nonprofit organizations, like foundations.

Participants of these [defined contribution plans](/definedcontributionplan) set to the side a percentage of their salary for retirement. These funds are transferred to the retirement account, where they fill in value without being taxed. There are two types of 457 plans:

- **457(b)**: This is the most common 457 plan and is offered to state and nearby government employees.
- **457(f)**: A plan offered to exceptionally compensated government and select non-government employees.

Employees are permitted to contribute up to 100% of their salary, gave it doesn't surpass the applicable dollar limit for the year.

### 457(b) Plan Contributions

Starting around 2022, employees can contribute up to $20,500 each year (up from $19,500 in 2021) to 457 plans. At times, workers are able to contribute even more.

For instance, assuming an employer permits [catch-up contributions](/catchupcontribution), workers beyond 50 a years old contribute an extra $6,500, making their maximum contribution limit $27,000 ($20,500 + $6,500) in 2022.

Likewise, 457(b) plans feature a "twofold limit catch-up" provision. This is intended to permit participants who are approaching retirement to make up for quite a long time in which they didn't add to the plan however were eligible to do as such. In this case, employees who are in no less than three years of retirement age (as determined in their plan), may contribute $39,000, two times the annual contribution limit, in 2021; $41,000 in 2022.

## Advantages of a 457(b) Plan

Contributions are taken from checks on a pre-tax basis, bringing about lower [taxable income](/taxableincome). For instance, on the off chance that Alex was earning $4,000 each month and contributing $700 to a 457(b) plan, Alex's taxable income for the month is $3,300.

Employees likewise have the option to invest their contributions in a selection of [mutual funds](/mutualfund). Significantly, any interest and earnings created from these vehicles don't get taxed until the funds are removed. In addition, in the event that an employee leaves, or resigns early and necessities to pull out their funds, there is no 10% penalty fee, dissimilar to 401(k), and [403(b)](/403bplan) plans.

Nonetheless, any early distribution from a 457 plan by which the funds were a consequence of a direct transfer or rollover from a qualified retirement plan —, for example, a 401(k) — would be subject to the 10% penalty tax.

## Limitations of a 457(b) Plan

Employer-[matched contributions](/matchingcontribution) count toward the maximum contribution limit. For example, in the event that an employer contributes $10,000 to the plan, the employee can add $10,500 until the $20,500 contribution limit is reached (except if they are permitted to go through the catch option). In practice, most government employers don't offer contribution matching.

> 457 plans are taxed as income like a 401(k) or 403(b) when distributions are taken. The main difference is there are no pull out punishments and that they are the main plans without early withdrawal punishments. In any case, you likewise have the option of rolling the assets in an IRA rollover. Along these lines, you can better control distributions and possibly take them when required.
> So on the off chance that you accept the whole amount as a lump sum, the whole amount is added to your income and may push you into a higher tax bracket.
> With the rollover route, you could require out a little this year, etc depending on the situation, subsequently controlling your taxes better. And keeping in mind that it stays inside the IRA, it keeps on developing tax-deferred and is protected from creditors.
