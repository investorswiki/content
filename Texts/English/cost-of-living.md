## What Does "Cost of Living" Mean?
Cost of living alludes to the amount of income required to keep a certain lifestyle in a certain place at one point in time. Cost of living shifts geologically and transiently, meaning that a similar lifestyle often costs different amounts in different regions, and in a specific region, that cost can go up (or, in rare cases, down) over the long run.
For example, suppose an individual could keep a fundamental however agreeable lifestyle — including a humble loft, healthcare, food, public transportation, and enough extra money to add to savings and go out a couple of times a month — on an annual income of $39,000 around A, a medium-sized suburb. Around B, an all the more thickly populated metropolitan area, this equivalent lifestyle could require an annual income of $49,000 on the grounds that rent, food, and different expenses are higher there. In this case, the cost of living is substantially higher around B than in The neighborhood A.
One more method for thinking about cost of living is to compare what you could get for a certain salary in one place versus another. For example, an annual income of $85,000 in Fort Wayne, Indiana, could manage the cost of an average citizen a lot of extra money after things like housing food, and taxes are dealt with. In Manhattan, New York, then again, this equivalent income could barely cover necessities and leave minimal excess for discretionary purchases. This is on the grounds that goods and services — including necessities like rent and food — cost substantially more on average in Manhattan than in Fort Wayne.
Since the cost of living changes across the United States, wages and salaries are higher in places where things like rent, food, and gas cost more. Consequently, comparable positions might pay different amounts in different places.
## What Is a Cost of Living Index?
A cost of living index is a helpful device that can be utilized to compare the cost of living between states (or urban communities) by relegating every one a simple number that addresses the aggregate average cost of a speculative basket of the goods and services that most people would have to purchase to live in any city (e.g., rent, food, healthcare, childcare, taxes, and so on.). Most indexes utilize 100 as a base number. This base number is normally associated with a city or region that falls some place close to the average or median cost of living of each of the regions inspected by the index.
Consequently, a region with an index score of 84 would be 26% less expensive to live in than the base region, and one with a score of 112 would be 12% more costly. An individual considering moving starting with one city then onto the next could compare their city's index score to their target city's index score to find out around how much less expensive (or more costly) it is live there.
### How Might You Use a Cost-of-Living Index to Compare Regions?
To utilize cost-of-living index data to figure out the amount you would have to make to keep up with your current lifestyle in somewhere else, you can utilize the accompanying formula:
> Income Change = (City B - City A)/City A

**Note:** City An is where you currently live, and City B is where you are thinking about moving.
Suppose you currently live in Colorado Springs, Colorado, and are thinking about moving to San Francisco, California. Numbeo's cost-of-living index gives Colorado Springs a 75.77 and San Francisco a 95.78.
> Income Change = (City B - City A)/City A
>
> Income Change = (95.78 - 75.77)/75.77
>
> Income Change = (20.01)/75.77
>
> Income Change = 0.2641 = 26.41%

In this way, assuming you moved to San Francisco from Colorado springs, your income would have to increase 26.41% if you wanted to keep up with your current lifestyle.
## What Is a Cost-of-Living Calculator?

## What Is a Cost-of-Living Adjustment (COLA)?
[Inflation](/inflation) is more normal than deflation, and it causes the prices of necessities — like food, rent, and transportation — to rise. A cost-of-living adjustment, or COLA, is an increase in wages, salaries, benefits, or different forms of compensation to keep up with changes in the real costs of living due to inflation.
For instance, every year, the Social Security Administration looks at whether to increase benefits through a COLA. They go with their choice based on changes in the [Consumer Price Index](/consumerpriceindex), quite possibly of the most well known device used to measure inflation. In 2021, SSA increased benefits by 1.3 percent, and in 2022, when inflation rose at a higher-than-regular pace, it increased benefits by an incredible 5.9 percent.
While not required to, numerous employers additionally conduct wage surveys and give cost-of-living adjustments (separate from performance-based raises) annually or intermittently to assist their employees with keeping up with inflation.
