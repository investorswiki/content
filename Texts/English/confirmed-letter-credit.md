## What Is a Confirmed Letter of Credit?

The term confirmed [letter of credit](/letterofcredit) alludes to an extra guarantee to the original letter of credit got by a borrower from a subsequent bank.

The seller might require a second letter of [credit](/credit) or a confirmed letter of credit. This subsequent letter requires the backing of more than one [bank](/bank) by a buyer in a domestic or international transaction. A confirmed letter might be required on the off chance that the seller isn't happy with the creditworthiness of the main letter of credit. As a rule, the subsequent bank is the seller's bank. At the point when the buyer gets the subsequent letter, it affirms the first and qualifies it as a confirmed letter of credit. The subsequent bank vows to pay the seller the amount stated assuming the principal bank neglects to do so when it issues the confirmed letter of credit.

The method involved with getting the second letter of credit is equivalent to the first. The buyer must track down a second bank to move its purchase in case of [default](/default2). The organizing of the funds for the second letter of credit generally thinks about the terms of the primary letter of credit too. At times, the seller may just require the second letter of credit address a percentage of the total due on the grounds that the sale as of now comes connected with a credit letter by the principal bank.

Just like the principal letter of credit, banks may likewise charge the buyer a [fee](/fee) when they issue a confirmed letter of credit. The amount of the fee might rely upon the size of the transaction and payment amount, as well as the relationship between the buyer and the bank.

## Special Considerations

This requires a full [credit application](/credit-application) â€” the same way the buyer would in the event that they applied for a loan. Assuming the bank endorses the letter of credit, it records its ability to pay the seller the stated amount on the off chance that the buyer defaults at the hour of payment. The terms of the letter normally structure the payment as a [loan](/loan) for the buyer.

In the event that the buyer is unable to make the payment to the seller when the funds are due, the bank issues the payment as a loan to the buyer. The buyer additionally consents to the bank's terms and conditions when they receive the letter. Whenever required, the terms of the loan might incorporate a stated interest rate and payment schedule as well as other [disclosures](/exposure) with respect to repayment.

On the off chance that the seller is happy with the buyer's most memorable letter of credit they might acknowledge it as an unconfirmed letter of credit. Unconfirmed letters of credit need the help of just a single lending bank which means a second or confirmed letter of credit isn't required.

## Benefits of Confirmed Letters of Credit

The letter gives the seller [assurance](/assurance) that the will receive payment after the goods or potentially services are moved to the buyer. As referenced above, on the off chance that the buyer doesn't pay, the bank takes care of the payment. By getting a subsequent letter, the [risk of default](/defaultrisk) drops, since another bank consents to pay on the off chance that the first can't do as such. Buyers can have confidence that they will receive the mentioned goods and services from the seller when they get a confirmed letter of credit.

## Illustration of Confirmed Letter of Credit

To work with the transaction, Company B requires a letter of credit from the buyer's bank. Company A receives this and sends it over to the [seller](/seller). Since the responsible bank of the principal letter of credit is in an alternate country and its creditworthiness isn't known, Company A lets the buyer know that it needs a second letter of credit from one more bank to complete the transaction.
