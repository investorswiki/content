## What Is a Pairoff?

A pairoff is a purchase and sale of open short and long positions, ordinarily between brokerage firms, that offset with the difference settled in cash.

## Grasping a Pairoff

In a pairoff, there is no physical delivery of the securities; all things considered, the settlement difference between the trades is calculated and sent as a cash payment to the suitable brokerage firm. This type of activity between brokerage firms is unlawful as it is considered to fall under the umbrella of "market manipulation."

To act as an illustration of a pairoff in real life, look at Brokerage As a that consents to sell 100 shares of Company X to Brokerage B for $25,000. At the same time, Brokerage B consents to sell 100 [shares](/shares) of Company X to Brokerage A for $30,000. The difference between the two trades is $5,000. Rather than really trading the securities and transferring those shares to their individual accounts, the two brokerage firms pair off. In this case, Brokerage A gives Brokerage B $5,000 as opposed to doing the real transaction.

Another, more conversational, importance for the term is a transaction in securities markets where offsetting buy and sell trades are settled in cash, in view of the difference in the prices between the offsetting trades. The offsetting positions are generally executed around the same time of the original purchase. On account of matching trades, a pairoff can reduce settlement risks and security wire transfer fees. It is at last a form of speculation.

While directing this type of pairoff, settlement guidelines for the cash wire should be incorporated. The pairoff closes, or draws down, the amount of the open trade by the paired-off amount, and just the associated gain or loss is moved. There can be partial and numerous pairoffs.

In a partial pairoff, just part of the trade is paired-off, while the other part is either allocated into determined pools or paired-off later against the excess open trade amount. The pairing-off and allocation interaction can happen at various stretches and over various days.
