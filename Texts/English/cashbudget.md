# Cash Budget
## What Is a Cash Budget?

A cash budget is an assessment of the [cash flows](/cashflow) of a business over a specific period of time. This could be for a week after week, month to month, quarterly, or annual budget. This budget is utilized to survey whether the entity has adequate cash to keep operating throughout the given time period. The cash budget gives a company understanding into its cash needs (and any surplus) and assists with determining an efficient allocation of cash.

## How a Cash Budget Works

Organizations use sales and production [forecasts](/forecasting) to make a cash budget, along with presumptions about important spending and [accounts receivable](/accountsreceivable) collections. A cash budget is important to evaluate whether a company will have sufficient cash to proceed with operations. In the event that a company needs more [liquidity](/liquidity) to operate, it must raise more capital by giving stock or assuming more debt.

A cash roll forward registers the cash inflows and outflows for a month, and it involves the ending balance as the beginning balance for the next month. This cycle permits the company to forecast cash needs consistently, and changes to the roll forward to change the cash balances for every single future month.

## Short-Term Cash Budget versus Long-Term Cash Budget

Cash budgets are typically seen in either the short-term or the long-term. Short-term cash budgets center around the cash requirements required for the next week or months though long-term cash budget centers around cash needs for the next year to several years.

Short-term cash budgets will take a gander at things like utility bills, rent, [payroll](/payroll), payments to providers, other operating expenses, and investments. Long-term cash budgets center around quarterly and annual tax payments, [capital expenditure](/capitalexpenditure) projects, and long-term investments. Long-term cash budgets generally require more strategic planning and nitty gritty analysis as they expect cash to be tied up for a longer period of time.

It's likewise prudent to budget cash requirements for any crises or unforeseen requirements for cash that might emerge, especially assuming the business is new and all parts of operations are not completely realized.

## Special Considerations

Dealing with a cash budget likewise boils down to carefully dealing with the growth of the business. For instance, all businesses need to sell more and develop, however it is significant to do as such in a sustainable manner.

For instance, a company might execute a [marketing strategy](/marketing-strategy) to support brand awareness and sell more product. The promotion campaign is fruitful and [demand](/demand) for the product takes off. In the event that the company isn't prepared to satisfy this increase in need, for instance, it might not have sufficient machinery to deliver more goods, enough employees to conduct quality checks, or enough providers to order the required [raw materials](/rawmaterials), then it could have numerous troubled customers.

The company might need to build out this multitude of angles to fulfill need, yet in the event that it needs more cash or financing to have the option to do as such, then it can't. Subsequently, it is important to oversee sales and expenses to arrive at an optimal level of cash flows.

## Illustration of a Cash Budget

For instance, how about we expect ABC Clothing makes shoes, and it gauges $300,000 in sales for the months of June, July, and August. At a retail price of $60 per pair, the company gauges sales of 5,000 pairs of shoes every month. ABC forecasts that 80% of the cash from these sales will be collected soon after the sale and the other 20% will be collected two months after the sale. The beginning cash balance for July is forecast to be $20,000, and the cash budget expects 80% of the June sales will be collected in July, which equals $240,000 (80% of $300,000). ABC likewise projects $100,000 in cash inflows from sales made before in the year.

On the expense side, ABC must likewise compute the [production costs ](/production-cost)required to deliver the shoes and fulfill customer need. The company anticipates that 1,000 pairs of shoes should be in the beginning inventory, and that means at least 4,000 pairs must be created in July. Assuming the production cost is $50 per pair, ABC burns through $200,000 ($50 x 4,000) in the long stretch of July on the [cost of goods sold](/pinions), which is the manufacturing cost. The company additionally hopes to pay $60,000 in costs not straightforwardly connected with production, like insurance.

ABC figures the cash inflows by adding the receivables collected during July to the beginning balance, which is $360,000 ($20,000 July beginning balance + $240,000 in June sales collected in July + $100,000 in cash inflows from prior sales). The company then takes away the cash expected to pay for production and different expenses. That total is $260,000 ($200,000 in cost of goods sold + $60,000 in different costs). ABC's July ending cash balance is $100,000, or $360,000 in cash inflows short $260,000 in cash outflows.
