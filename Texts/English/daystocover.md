# Days to Cover
## What Are Days from Cover's point of view?

"Days to cover" measures the expected number of days to close out a company's [outstanding shares](/outstandingshares) that have been [sold short](/short). It registers a company's shares that are currently shorted partitioned by the average daily trading volume to give an estimate of the time required, communicated in days, to close out those short positions.

Days to cover are connected with the [short ratio](/shortinterestratio) as a measure of short interest in a stock.

## Understanding Days to Cover

Days to cover are calculated by taking the number of currently shorted shares and isolating that amount by the average daily [trading volume](/volumeoftrade) for the company being referred to. For instance, assuming that investors have shorted 2 million shares of ABC and its average daily volume is 1 million shares, then the days to cover is two days.

Days to cover can be helpful to traders in the accompanying ways:

- It very well may be a proxy for how [bearish](/bear) or bullish traders are about that company, which can aid future investment choices. A high days-to-cover ratio may be a harbinger that everything isn't well with company performance.
- It gives [investors](/investor) a thought of potential future buying pressure. In the event of a rally in the stock, short sellers must buy back shares on the open market to close out their positions. Naturally, they will try to purchase the shares back at the most minimal cost conceivable, and this desperation to escape their positions could convert into sharp moves higher. The more drawn out the buyback cycle takes, as referred to constantly to cover metric, the more extended the price rally might proceed, dependent exclusively upon the need of short sellers to close their positions.
- Moreover, a high days-to-cover ratio can frequently signal a potential [short squeeze](/shortsqueeze). This data can benefit a trader hoping to create a quick gain by buying that company's shares ahead of the anticipated event really working out as expected.

## The Short Selling Process and Days to Cover

Traders who short sell are persuaded by a conviction that the price of a security will fall, and shorting the stock permits them to profit from that decline in price. In practice, short selling includes borrowing shares from a [broker](/broker), selling the shares on the open market, and afterward buying the shares once again to return them to the broker.

The trader benefits in the event that the price of the shares fall after the shares are borrowed and sold, as this permits the investor to repurchase the shares at a price lower than the amount for which the shares are sold. The days to cover address the total estimated amount of time for all short sellers active in the market with a specific security to buy back the shares that were loaned to them by a brokerage.

If a formerly lagging stock turns very [bullish](/bull), the buying action of short sellers can bring about extra vertical momentum. The higher the days to cover, the more articulated the effect of up momentum might be, which could bring about bigger losses for short sellers who are not among the first to close their positions.
