## What Is a Lien Sale?

A lien sale is the sale of the claim — or a hold — put on an asset to fulfill an unpaid debt. Commonly, lien sales are directed as public [auctions](/auction), and the lien is on real estate, vehicles, and other personal property.

Depending on a specific state's laws, contractors, subcontractors, and providers might put a lien on a piece of property they have dealt with pending payment for services delivered.

## How a Lien Sale Works

Buying [delinquent](/delinquent) tax liens at a sale is turning into an undeniably well known form of investing and is like purchasing a long-term [Certificate of Deposit](/certificateofdeposit) (CD). In any case, not at all like a CD, tax-liens can't be sold back to the taxing authority and must be held until they are repaid. Redemption of the purchased lien is ordinarily at a given rate of return inside a predefined time span.

Lien sales for unpaid debts on a property can bring about the amount owed expanding further. At the point when the lien debt is sold, ordinarily by a nearby government agency, the buyer can utilize a lien servicing company that might add more fees and interest to the lien. This permits the buyer to see a return on their investment as the debtor must now pay the extra costs imposed.

In many cases, several notices of an impending lien sale will be shipped off the debtor before a notice is documented expressing the oncoming date for the auction.

Albeit a debtor might owe taxes and different fees, there can be special cases that will shelter their property and different assets from being subject to a lien sale. For instance, disabled homeowners, senior residents, and veterans could receive exemptions.

Active duty military staff could likewise be eligible for an exemption for lien sales on their property. Every jurisdiction will have its own criteria, application interaction, and window of time when the responsible agency must be reached.

The bidding system is auction style, with the victor being the highest bidder. Since there is a limit to the maximum interest rate a triumphant bidder can charge, the amount the buyer pays for the lien is paramount.
