# Unconditional Probability
## What Is Unconditional Probability?

An unconditional likelihood is the chance that a single outcome results among several potential outcomes. The term alludes to the probability that an event will occur independent of whether some other events have occurred or some other conditions are available.

The likelihood that snow will fall in Jackson, Wyoming, on Groundhog Day, without thinking about the historical weather conditions and climate data for northwestern Wyoming toward the beginning of February is an illustration of an unconditional likelihood.

Unconditional likelihood might be stood out from [conditional probability](/conditional_probability).

## Grasping Unconditional Probability

The unconditional likelihood of an event can be determined by adding up the outcomes of the event and isolating by the total number of potential outcomes.

Unconditional likelihood is otherwise called marginal likelihood and measures the chance of an occurrence overlooking any information acquired from previous or outside events. Since this likelihood disregards new data, it stays steady.

Conditional likelihood, then again, is the probability of an event or outcome happening, yet in view of the occurrence of another event or prior outcome. Conditional likelihood is calculated by increasing the likelihood of the first event by the refreshed likelihood of the succeeding, or conditional, event.

Conditional likelihood is frequently depicted as the "likelihood of A given B," documented as P(A|B). Unconditional likelihood likewise contrasts from [joint probability](/jointprobability), which computes the probability of at least two outcomes happening at the same time, and depicted as the "likelihood of A **and** B", written as P(A ∩ B). It basically consolidates the unconditional probabilities of An and B.

## Illustration of Unconditional Probability

As a theoretical model from finance, we should look at a group of [stocks](/stock) and their returns. A stock can either be a victor, which procures a positive return, or a loser, which has a negative returns. Express that out of five stocks, stocks An and B are victors, while stocks C, D, and E are losers. What, then, is the unconditional likelihood of picking a triumphant stock? Since two outcomes out of a potential five will create a champ, the unconditional likelihood is 2 victories partitioned by 5 total outcomes (2/5 = 0.4), or 40%.

## Features
- For example, the chance of a fair coin flip being heads has an unconditional likelihood of half paying little mind to the number of coin flips went before it, nor on the off chance that some other event had happened.
- Unconditional likelihood is otherwise called marginal likelihood.
- Unconditional likelihood mirrors the chance that some event will happen without accounting for some other potential impacts or prior outcomes.
