# Greenshoe Option
## What is a Greenshoe Option?

A greenshoe option is an over-designation option. With regards to a [initial public offering ](/ipo)(IPO), it is a provision in a [underwriting agreement](/underwriting-agreement) that concedes the underwriter the right to sell investors a larger number of shares than initially arranged by the issuer assuming that the demand for a security issue demonstrates surprisingly high.

## How a Greenshoe Option Works

[Over-portion options](/overallotment) are known as greenshoe options on the grounds that, in 1919, Green Shoe Manufacturing Company (presently part of Wolverine World Wide, Inc. (WWW) as Stride Rite) was quick to issue this type of option. A greenshoe option gives extra price stability to a security issue on the grounds that the underwriter can increase supply and smooth out price vacillations. It is the main type of price stabilization measure permitted by the [Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)](/sec).

Greenshoe options ordinarily permit underwriters to sell up to 15% a larger number of shares than the original amount set by the issuer for as long as 30 days after the IPO on the off chance that demand conditions warrant such action. For instance, in the event that a company educates the underwriters to sell 200 million shares, the underwriters can issue if an extra 30 million shares by practicing a greenshoe option (200 million shares x 15%). Since underwriters receive their [commission](/commission) as a percentage of the IPO, they have the incentive to make it as large as could really be expected. The prospectus, which the responsible company records with the SEC before the IPO, subtleties the genuine percentage and conditions connected with the option.

Underwriters use greenshoe options in one of two ways. To begin with, on the off chance that the IPO is a triumph and the share price floods, the underwriters [exercise](/exercise) the option, buy the extra stock from the company at the foreordained price, and issue those shares, at a profit, to their clients. On the other hand, assuming the price begins to fall, they buy back the shares from the market rather than the company to cover their [short position](/short), supporting the stock to settle its price.

A few issuers don't really want to remember greenshoe options for their underwriting agreements under particular conditions, for example, to fund a specific project with a fixed amount and has no requirement for extra capital.

## Instances of Greenshoe Option

A notable illustration of a greenshoe option at work happened in Facebook Inc., presently Meta (META), IPO of 2012. The underwriting syndicate, headed by Morgan Stanley (MS), agreed with Facebook, Inc. to purchase 421 million shares at $38 per share, less a 1.1% underwriting fee. Notwithstanding, the syndicate sold no less than 484 million shares to clients â€” 15% over the initial allocation, really making a short position of 63 million shares.

On the off chance that Facebook shares had traded over the $38 IPO price shortly subsequent to listing, the underwriting syndicate would've exercised the greenshoe option to buy the 63 million shares from Facebook at $38 to cover their short position and try not to need to repurchase the shares at a higher price in the market.

Be that as it may, in light of the fact that Facebook's shares [declined](/decline) below the IPO price not long after it started trading, the underwriting syndicate covered their short position without practicing the greenshoe option at or around $38 to settle the price and shield it from more extreme falls.
