# Profit-Volume (PV) Chart
## What Is a Profit-Volume (PV) Chart?

A profit-volume (PV) chart is a realistic that shows the [earnings](/earnings) (or losses) of a company comparable to its volume of sales. Companies can utilize profit-volume (PV) charts to lay out sales objectives, dissect whether new products are probably going to be profitable, or estimate [breakeven](/breakevenpoint) points.

## Grasping Profit-Volume (PV) Chart

The profit-volume chart gives a company a visual of how much product must be sold to accomplish profitability. The total costs of a company incorporate variable and [fixed costs](/fixedcost). Fixed costs address the money spent on assets expected to deliver the product, which can incorporate the cost of the building and equipment. [Variable costs](/variablecost) address the costs that vacillate with sales volumes, like raw materials and inventory. On the off chance that a company produces zero sales, they would in any case have the expense of their fixed costs yet would have no variable costs, expecting they purchased no inventory.

A company must produce an adequate number of sales to cover both their variable costs and fixed costs. While pricing the product available to be purchased, management would have to cover the variable costs to create every unit, yet additionally some portion of the fixed costs. Over the long run and with enough sales volume, the company would arrive at its breakeven point, which is the point at which they've produced an adequate number of sales volume so the cumulative total of the profit-per-unit covers the entirety of the fixed costs.

For instance, suppose a company has $1,000 in fixed costs, and they earn $50 per unit in profit, which covers the variable costs for every unit. The company would have to sell 20 units to accomplish breakeven (20 * $50 = $1,000).

## Plotting the Profit-Volume (PV) Chart

While plotting the profit-volume chart, where the total sales line crosses with the total cost line is the estimated breakeven point of a product in terms of volume.

Profits or (losses) are plotted on the Y-hub (the vertical pivot) while sales volume (quantity or units) is plotted on the X-hub (the horizontal hub). Initially, the line will start to one side and below zero at the amount of the fixed costs. All in all, on the off chance that a company has $20,000 in fixed costs, the line will start at - $20,000, and as every sale is made, the line would slant upwards until it arrives at zero or breakeven.

As the volume of sales increases, the line rises from left to right in a vertical slanting way so that profits rise as sales increase. Sales volumes to the right of the breakeven point on the chart demonstrate profits, while volumes to the left outcome in losses.

The incline of the total sales line is significant; the more extreme the slant, the less volume required to earn a profit. The steepness of the slant is a function of the price of the product. Beside pricing strategy, management can impact how a PV chart shows up by controlling a variable and fixed cost parts. Clearly, any effective efforts to bring down costs will shift the breakeven volume point to one side.

## Illustration of a Profit-Volume (PV) Chart

A company with critical fixed costs relies intensely upon sales volume to accomplish its profit objectives. Lodgings, for instance, have a fixed number of rooms and for the rooms, the inn purchased furniture, bedding, window medicines, air molding units, lighting, and TVs. The lodging likewise needs to keep up with its common areas no matter what the number of guests it has on a given night.

In this way, to cover the costs of running the inn restaurant, keeping the inn pool clean, heating or cooling the inn lobby and corridors, and utilizing front desk staff, the inn must sell a certain number of room nights before it begins to earn a profit on a given night. The PV chart can estimated that breakeven point and assist with directing inn management meet and surpass that number.

For instance, suppose the lodging burned through $20,000 on fixed costs for materials. Below is the per-room rental fee, the variable costs-per room, and the subsequent profit-per room.

- $350 every night rental rate
- $75 variable costs for each room
- $275 profit for each room

Be that as it may, the $275 profit per-room doesn't account for the fixed costs. Thus, it would take 73 room rentals before the inn paid for its fixed costs ($20,000/$275).
