## What is Perpetual Inventory?

Perpetual inventory is a method of accounting for inventory that records the sale or purchase of inventory immediately using modernized point-of-sale systems and enterprise asset management software. Perpetual inventory gives an exceptionally nitty gritty perspective on changes in inventory with immediate reporting of the amount of inventory in stock, and precisely mirrors the level of goods close by.

Businesses can improve on the inventory costing process by utilizing a [weighted average cost](/averagecostmethod), or the total inventory cost separated by the number of units in inventory.
