# Effective Net Worth
## What Is Effective Net Worth?

Effective net worth is [shareholders' equity](/shareholdersequity), the amount that would be returned to investors in the event that a company's all's assets were liquidated and every one of its debts reimbursed, plus [subordinated debt](/subordinateddebt), unsecured loans or bonds that rank least with respect to claims on assets or earnings. Adding subordinated debt, in effect, expands a company's net worth and is utilized by senior [creditors](/creditor) to decide a company's ability to pay them back, would it be advisable for them they loan it money.

## How Effective Net Worth Works

[Net worth](/networth), maybe the most common measurement to check a company's or alternately person's [financial health](/financial-wellbeing), is calculated by deducting all liabilities, or outstanding balances owed, from assets, or resources owned with monetary value. Effective net worth then, at that point, goes one step further by adding a portion of these debts back in.

Debt can generally be broken down into two types. There is [senior debt](/seniordebt), borrowed money that a company must repay first assuming it leaves business, and subordinated debt, loans that, on account of a [default](/default2), will just get reimbursed once every other debt has been cleared.
