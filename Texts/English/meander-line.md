## What Is Meander Line?

Meander line alludes to a survey line utilized for the purpose of planning, regularly adjoining a waterway, that changes assuming that the waterway changes.

## Understanding Meander Line

Meander lines are artificial lines drawn by surveyors for planning and surveying a waterway. The lines are drawn around the lake or lake to measure property that adjoins the water which means that they are typically unpredictable and dynamic in nature to account for the framework of a waterway. Ordinarily, a meander line for the end goal of surveying addresses the edge of a waterway.

Meander lines vary from official boundary lines in that they are not fixed and consistent. Official boundary lines can, in some cases, stretch out to the center of the waterway. Meander lines are normally drawn to match the overall boundary of that waterway.

To decide a meander line, a surveyor must evaluate the line by characterizing the right banks as the right hand side while facing the surge of waterway. The meander line not entirely set in stone at ordinary high water time from the right and left banks.

Thus, even assuming that the high water mark ought to change, the meander line will remain in a similar location. At times, for example, with erosion and natural land changes, for example, turning streams, a meander line can be set against the general course as opposed to being completely defined.

Meander lines are utilized by the government to characterize the shore, or bank, of a waterway as well as to measure the quantity of land in the connecting parcels of lands that are subject to [sale by the government](/governmentpurchases). In these cases, the water fills in as the boundary and, except if generally stated, the meander line isn't the legal boundary. All things being equal, it distinguishes the area of land that isn't limited to the title of the land.

There are specific rules and regulations that characterize what a meander line can be. For instance, a meander line is viewed as just applicable when lands were first surveyed. Any islands or lands that emerged after the land was first surveyed are not part of the meander line. Every single large stream, lakes, lakes, and bodies of water can be meandered, yet National Parks, Indian Reserves, mineral claims and boundary lines can't have a meander line. Shallow and irregular streams lacking clear cut banks and streams, as well as unnavigable tidewater deltas are not meandered.
