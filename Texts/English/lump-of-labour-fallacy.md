# Lump of Labor Fallacy
## What is the Lump of Labor Fallacy

The lump of labor fallacy is the mixed up conviction that there is a fixed amount of work accessible in the economy, and that rising the number of workers diminishes the amount of turn out accessible for every other person, or the other way around.

The fallacy starts with the broken assumption that an economy can unfortunately support a limited number jobs — for example a fixed lump of labor. It is then applied to policy issues like movement: **allowing more immigrants diminishes jobs accessible for native workers**. Economists view this thinking as misleading on the grounds that many factors impact required labor levels in an economy. For instance, expanding the employment of labor can extend the overall size of the economy, leading to promote [job creation](/jobsgrowth). Interestingly, lessening the amount of labor employed would diminish economic activity, hence further decreasing the demand for labor.

The lump of labor fallacy is otherwise called the "fallacy of labor scarcity," "lump of jobs fallacy," a "fixed pie fallacy," or a "[zero-sum](/zero-sumgame) fallacy."

## Breaking Down Lump of Labor Fallacy

The lump of labor fallacy originated to disprove claims that diminishing working hours would likewise reduce [unemployment](/unemploymentrate). As the thinking goes, companies that cut hours for full-time workers would have to hire extra workers to perform the excess quantity of work left unperformed.

In 1891, English economist David Frederick Schloss noticed that numerous workers and employers accepted there was a fixed amount of work to be finished in an economy, and he portrayed this reasoning as the "hypothesis of the Lump of Labor" fallacy. Yet policy choices are much of the time made based off the flawed thinking that the quantity of labor is fixed. Remarkably, France in 2000 restricted standard working hours to 35 every week, trying to ease unemployment.

## Lump of Labor Fallacy and Immigration

The lump of labor concept was initially applied to studies of movement and labor, explicitly the assumption that given a fixed amount of jobs, liberated migration would bring about less opportunities for native-conceived workers. Yet the movement of more skilled labor might lead to the presentation of new capacities that can add jobs to an economy, like through the opening of new businesses.

A few models are technology, research, and specialty products and services consumed by both native and immigrant populations. New business creation increments demand for nearby services and labor, just by their reality, yet in addition in light of any expansions in population that might result from new position opportunities.

## Lump of Labor Fallacy and Retirement

The lump of labor concept has been utilized — particularly in Europe — to propel more seasoned workers to acknowledge [forced retirement](/forced-retirement) before the legal retirement age. It was believed to be a solution to diminished labor needs at companies. All things being equal, it was found that making more youthful workers pay for the retirements of early retired people was counterproductive, as it eliminated useful people from an economy and set greater expectations for the workers that remained.
