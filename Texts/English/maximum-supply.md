# Maximum Supply
The maximum supply of a [cryptocurrency](/cryptocurrency) alludes to the maximum number of coins or tokens that will be at any point made. This means that once the maximum supply is reached, there won't be any new coins [mined](/mining), printed or delivered in differently.
Typically, the maximum supply is capped by the limits defined by the underlying protocol of each digital asset. Consequently, the maximum supply and issuance of new coins are typically defined at the [genesis block](/genesis-block) as per the venture's source code (which likewise characterizes numerous different highlights and functionalities).
Setting a consistent issuance rate along with a predefined maximum supply can be significant for controlling the inflation rate of a cryptocurrency, which may possibly lead to a long-term appreciation of the asset. Generally talking, when the maximum supply is reached, there will be less coins accessible on the market. This is expected to make market scarcity, which may ultimately lead to deflation conditions (or 0% inflation rates).
Be that as it may, some cryptographic forms of money don't have a predefined maximum supply, meaning they can be mined or printed constantly. Ethereum is an outstanding illustration of a cryptocurrency system that has no predetermined maximum supply. Ether's [supply](/supply) is continually expanding as new blocks are generated.

### Max supply versus total supply
As referenced, the calculation of max supply incorporates all coins that were at that point created (or mined) plus the coins that are yet to be issued (from here on out). Then again, the [total supply](/total-supply) incorporates just the coins that were at that point created minus the units that were annihilated, for example, in coin burn occasions.
