## History of the ICC

The ICC was laid out in 1887, following expanding public anger during the 1880s over misuses and malpractices by the railroad companies. Initially settled to manage the rail lines, the ICC had jurisdiction over every common carrier — barring planes — by 1940.

By 1910, the ICC had been conceded the authority by Congress and the Supreme Court to set rates and profit levels of railways, as well as to coordinate mergers. Its jurisdiction was additionally extended to cover regions, for example, dozing vehicle companies, oil pipelines, ships, terminals, and extensions. This occurred due to a staggering amount of grumblings in regards to the rates charged by railways on courses inside which there was no source of competition. Regulatory control over telephone, transmit, remote, and cable was likewise given to the ICC in 1910, and it practiced authority over these until the foundation of the [Federal Communications Commission ](/fcc)(FCC) in 1934.

The ICC's enforcement powers to set rates were extended during the 1940s, just like the analytical powers by which it could fairly figure out what fair rates were. The ICC was additionally assigned the task of combining railroad systems, as well as dealing with all labor questions that happened inside the scope of interstate vehicle. The ICC likewise assumed an essential part in upholding Supreme Court choices on the integration of the rail lines during the 1950s and 1960s.

In 1966, the ICC's safety functions were moved to the Department of Transportation (which was laid out in that year), however the ICC retained its rate-setting and regulatory functions. A general push toward deregulation hence saw the ICC's authority over rates and courses in both rail and shipping ended because of the implementation of the Staggers Rail Act and Motor Carriers Act in 1980. Both of these acts assumed a major part in the deregulation of these industries, which negatively affected the powers of the ICC.

Most ICC control over interstate shipping was abandoned in 1994, with its powers having been moved to the Federal Highway Administration and the recently made Surface Transportation Board (both under the sponsorship of the Department of Transportation). The Commission was in this manner shut down in 1995.

The primary organization that assumed control over the duties of the now-ancient ICC is the National Surface Transportation Board. Different services were moved to the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration or to the Bureau of Transportation Statistics inside DOT.
