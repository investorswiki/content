# Divestment
## What Is Divestment?

Divestment is the most common way of selling subsidiary assets, investments, or divisions of a company to boost the value of the parent company. Otherwise called [divestiture](/divestiture), divestment is really something contrary to an investment and is typically done when that subsidiary asset or division isn't performing up to expectations.

At times, be that as it may, a company might be [forced to sell assets](/sellout) as the consequence of legal or regulatory action. Companies can likewise focus on a divestment strategy to fulfill other strategic business, financial, social, or political objectives.

## Grasping Divestment

Divestment includes a company selling off a portion of its assets, frequently to further develop company value and get higher productivity. Many companies will utilize divestment to sell off fringe assets that empower their management groups to regain more keen spotlight on the core business.

Divestment can result from either a corporate optimization strategy or, more than likely be driven by superfluous conditions, for example, when [investments](/investment) are decreased and firms pull out from a specific geographic region or industry due to political or social pressure. One major current occasion is the impact of the pandemic, remote work, and the rise of technology use and their impact on offices, commercial real estate.

Things that are stripped may incorporate a [subsidiary](/subsidiary), business department, real estate holding, equipment, and other property, or financial assets. Proceeds from these sales are commonly used to pay down debt, make capital expenditures, fund working capital, or pay a special dividend to a company's shareholders. While most divestment transactions are planned, company-started efforts, on occasion this cycle could be forced upon them because of regulatory action.

Notwithstanding why a company decides to take on a divestment strategy, asset sales will create revenue that can be utilized somewhere else in the organization. In the short run, this increased revenue will benefit organizations in that they can redirect the funds to help another division that isn't exactly performing up to expectations. The standard is that divestment is finished inside the structure of restructuring and optimization activities. The exception would be on the off chance that the company was being forced to strip a productive asset or division for political or social reasons that could lead to a loss of revenue.

## Types of Divestments

Divestment will normally appear as a [spin-off](/side project), equity [carve-out](/carveout), or direct sale of assets.

- Side projects are non-cash and tax-free transactions, when a parent company conveys shares of its subsidiary to its shareholders. In this manner, the subsidiary turns into an independent company whose shares can be traded on a stock exchange. Side projects are generally common among companies that comprise of two separate and distinct businesses that have different growth or risk profiles.
- Under the equity carve-out scenario, a parent company sells a certain percentage of the equity in its subsidiary to the public through a stock market offering. Equity carve-outs are many times tax-free transactions that include an equivalent exchange of cash for shares. Since the parent company regularly holds a controlling stake in the subsidiary, equity carve-outs are generally common among companies that need to finance growth opportunities for one of their auxiliaries. Moreover, equity carve-outs permit companies to lay out trading roads for their auxiliaries' shares and later discards the leftover stake under appropriate conditions.
- A direct [sale of assets](/asset-disposal-plan), including whole auxiliaries, is one more common form of divestment. In this case, a parent company sells assets, like real estate or equipment to another party. The sale of assets normally includes cash and may trigger tax ramifications for a parent company on the off chance that assets are sold at a gain. This type of divestiture that happens under duress might result in a [fire sale](/firesale) with assets sold for below book value.

## Major Reasons for Divestment

The most common justification for divestment is to wipe out non-performing, non-core businesses. Companies, especially large corporations or [conglomerates](/combination), may claim different business units that operate in altogether different industries, and which can be very challenging to oversee or diverting from their [core competencies](/core_competencies).

Stripping a non-fundamental business unit can free up both time and capital for a parent company's management to zero in on its primary operations and skill. For example, in 2014, General Electric (GE) pursued a choice to strip its non-core financing arm by selling its shares of Synchrony Financial as a side project on the New York Stock Exchange.

Moreover, companies strip their assets to get funds, shed an underperforming subsidiary, answer regulatory action, and realize value through a separation. Companies that are going through the course of [bankruptcy](/bankruptcy) will frequently be required by legal ruling to sell off parts of the business.

At last, companies might take part in divestment for political and social reasons, for example, selling assets adding to global warming.
