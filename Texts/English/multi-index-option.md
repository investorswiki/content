# Multi-Index Option
## What Is a Multi-Index Option?

A multi-index option is a [outperformance option](/outperformanceoption) where the payoff depends on the relative performance of two indexes or other assets. The payoff from these exotic not entirely set in stone by the change in the percentage price performance of one index or asset over another. They mostly trade in the [over-the-counter](/otc) (OTC) market.

Multi-index options are regularly, however not required to be, [European-style options](/europeanoption), which must be practiced at maturity and are settled in cash.

## Grasping Multi-Index Options

Multi-index options are [spread options](/spreadoption) where the payoff relies upon a change in relative value rather than market heading. They are now and again utilized by investors to hedge risks or to hypothesize on the relative performance of stock indexes, various issuers in the bond markets, or exchange rates — particularly when there is no [cross rate](/crossrate) accessible to trade. They can likewise be relatively low cost, compared to vanilla index options.

Worth noticing each index might have unfathomably different [nominal prices](/nominalvalue). For instance, with the S&P 500 trading at $3,000 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average at $30,000 — or 10x higher — the nominal spread is certainly not a decent measure of relative performance. The S&P 500 might gain $10 and the Dow $20 over the life of the option; notwithstanding, the percentage gain for the former would be far greater than the last option. In this case, the S&P enormously beat the Dow over the life of the option albeit the gains in dollar terms were greater for the Dow. So multi-index frequently considers the percentage change of each toward the beginning of the contract. The spread then checks out at the increase or abatement in relative value between the two.

## Utilizes for Multi-Index Options

Multi-index options have a couple of primary purposes. The first is to allow examiners to wager on the performance of two indices relative to each other. Theorists can pick two indices inside a country, two province indexes, two sectors, and so on.

[Hedgers](/hedge) likewise find multi-index options valuable for lessening risks across markets or asset classes. For instance, equities in various countries might be impacted by their own country's political scene, interest rates, as well as currencies. Assuming the holder accepts the two markets have comparable possibilities however one has extra risks due to their home market, the option can assist with alleviating that risk.

## Illustration of a Multi-Index Option

For instance, consider a multi-index option on the relative performance of the S&P 500 versus Canada's TSX Composite over a year. In the event that the option has a [strike price](/strikeprice) of 5% — the threshold between the option paying off or lapsing worthless — then, if the [S&P 500](/sp) has declined 2% yet the TSX has declined 9% following a year, the option will have a positive payoff of 2% in light of the fact that the S&P 500 has beated the TSX by 7% points. Assuming that the S&P 500 outflanks by under 5%, the option will lapse being worthless.
