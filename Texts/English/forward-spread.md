# Forward Spread
## What Is the Forward Spread?

A forward spread is the price difference between the spot price of a security and the [forward](/forwardcontract) price of a similar security taken at a predefined interval. One more name for the forward spread is [forward points](/forwardpoints).

## Figuring out the Forward Spread

All spreads are simple conditions coming about because of the difference in price between two assets or financial products, like a security and a forward on that security. A spread can likewise be the price difference between two maturity months, two unique option [strike prices](/strikeprice), or even the difference in price between two distinct areas. For instance, the spread between U.S. Treasury bonds trading in the U.S. [futures market](/futures) and in the London futures market.

For forward spreads, the formula is the most ideal price for one asset at the spot price compared to the price of a forward which will be [deliverable](/expectations) sometime not too far off. In the event that the forward price is higher than the spot price, the formula is the forward price minus the spot price. In the event that the spot price is higher than the forward price, the spread is the spot price minus the forward price.

The forward spread can be founded on any time interval, like one month, six months, one year, etc. The forward spread among spot and a one-month forward will probably be not quite the same as the spread among spot and a six-month forward.

At the point when the spot price and the forward price are something similar, this means they are trading at par. Par in this setting ought not be mistaken for par in the debt markets, and that means the face value of a bond or debt instrument.

## Special Considerations

Forward spreads provide traders with an indication of [supply and demand](/law-of-supply-demand) over the long haul. Commonly, the more extensive the spread, the more significant the underlying asset is from now on and the narrower the spread, the more important it is presently.

Narrow spreads, or even negative spreads, could result from short-term shortages, either real or perceived, in the underlying asset. With [currency forwards](/currencyforward), negative spreads (called [discount spreads](/discount-spread)) happen much of the time since currencies have interest rates appended to them which will influence their future value.

There is likewise an element of [carrying cost](/carrying-costs). Claiming the asset currently recommends that there are costs associated with keeping it. For commodities, that can be storage, insurance, and financing. For financial instruments, it very well may be financing and the [opportunity costs](/opportunitycost) of locking into a future commitment.

Carrying costs might change after some time. While storage costs in a warehouse might increase, interest rates to finance the underlying might increase or diminish. As such, traders must monitor these costs over the long run to be certain their holdings are priced appropriately.

## Forward Spread Example

Expect that the cash rate for gold is $1,340.40 per ounce. A company needs a forward to lock in a rate on 5,000 ounces of gold to be delivered in 30 days. They could buy numerous 100-ounce futures contracts, or they could go into a one-month forward contract with a gold provider.

The gold provider consents to give the 5,000 ounces of gold in 30 days at a rate of $1,342.40. The buyer will give the provider $6,702,000 ($1,342.40 x 5,000) around then also. The forward spread is $1,342.40 - $1340.40 = $2.

## Features
- Forward spreads can be large, small, negative, or positive, and address the costs associated with locking in the price for a future date.
- The forward spread is the forward rate less the spot rate or, in the event of a discount rate, the spot rate minus the forward rate.
- The spread will be different in light of how far out the delivery date of the forward is, so a one-year forward will be priced uniquely in contrast to a 30-day forward.
