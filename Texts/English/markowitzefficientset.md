# Markowitz Efficient Set
## What Is the Markowitz Efficient Set?

The Markowitz efficient set is a portfolio with returns that are boosted for a given level of risk in view of mean-variance [portfolio](/portfolio) construction. The efficient solution to a given set of mean-variance boundaries (a given riskless asset and a given risky basket of assets) can be plotted on what is called the Markowitz [efficient frontier](/efficientfrontier).

## Grasping the Markowitz Efficient Set

Harry Markowitz (1927 - ), a Nobel Prize-winning economist who currently educates at the Rady School of Management of the University of California at San Diego, is viewed as a dad of [modern portfolio theory](/modernportfoliotheory). His article, "Portfolio Selection," which appeared in the **Journal of Finance** in 1952, interwove the concepts of portfolio returns, risk, variance, and covariance.

That's what markowitz set, since there were two criteria, risk and return, it was natural to expect that investors chose from the set of [Pareto optimal](/pareto-proficiency) risk-return combinations. Known as the Markowitz efficient set, the optimal risk-return combination of a portfolio lies on an efficient frontier of maximum returns for a given level of [risk](/risk) in view of mean-variance portfolio construction.

## Carrying out the Markowitz Efficient Set

The Markowitz efficient set is addressed on a graph with returns on the Y-hub and risk ([standard deviation](/standarddeviation)) on the X-hub. The efficient set lies along the line (frontier line) where increased risk is decidedly connected with expanding returns, or one more approach to saying this is "higher risk, higher returns," however the key is to build a set of portfolios to yield the highest returns at a given level of risk.

People have different [risk tolerance](/risktolerance) levels, and accordingly these portfolio sets are subject to different returns. Also, investors can't expect to be that assuming that they accept greater amounts of risk, they will be consequently compensated with extra returns. Truth be told, the set becomes inefficient when returns decline at greater levels of risk. At the core of a Markowitz efficient set is [diversification](/diversification) of assets, which brings down portfolio risk.

Since various combinations of assets have various levels of return, the Markowitz efficient set is meant to show the best combination of these assets that will boost returns at a picked risk level. Thusly, the Markowitz efficient set shows investors how returns change given the amount of risk assumed.

## Diversification in the Markowitz Efficient Set

Various assets answer distinctively to market factors. Certain assets move in similar course while different assets move in inverse headings. At the point when assets have a lower covariance, the more they move in inverse bearings, meaning that the risk of the portfolio is lower. Along these lines, the efficient frontier is a bended representation as opposed to a linear one. It suggests that a diversified portfolio has less risk than a portfolio comprising of one security or a group of securities that move in similar heading when market factors change.

## Features
- The efficient frontier is addressed with returns on the Y-hub and risk on the X-hub.
- The Markowitz efficient set features the diversification of assets in a portfolio, which brings down the portfolio's risk.
- The efficient solution to a portfolio can be plotted on the Markowitz efficient frontier.
- The Markowitz efficient set was developed by economist Harry Markowitz in 1952.
- The goal of the Markowitz efficient set is to boost the returns of a portfolio for a given level of risk.
