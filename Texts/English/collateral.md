# Collateral
Basically, the word collateral is something of value given as a guarantee to get something different. For example, a borrower might offer their vehicle as a collateral to a lender while applying for a line of credit. The vehicle acts as a defend or warranty in case the borrower neglects to pay their obligations.
Typically, collateralized loans present a lot of lower interest rates when compared to non-collateralized ones. Collateral can come in various forms. Probably the most common types incorporate mortgage collaterals, invoice financing, and margin trading collaterals.
Mortgage or real estate collaterals are likely the most utilized by borrowers. They allude to loans that are backed by real state properties, like a loft, house, or cultivating land. In this case, the property is the asset that secures the loan. So in the event that the borrower neglects to make the payments according to the contract, the lender has the privilege to claim ownership of their real state property.
Invoice financing, then again, is a short-term borrowing strategy employed by organizations. Such a strategy comprises of companies utilizing clients' invoices (that are yet to be paid) as collateral. So this permits them to involve funds in advance. For instance, envision that an online retailer sold $500,000 in products, however since most consumers paid with credit card, the company will not have the option to utilize the money at any point in the near future. The invoice financing strategy would be suitable in this case, permitting the company to further develop cash flow, utilizing the money ahead of time for high-need needs.
With regards to margin trading, the term collateral alludes to the assets that are kept in a margin trading account to cover potential losses traders might have while trading on leverage. As such, when you borrow money to trade on margin, your account balance will act as collateral. The brokerage (or exchange) reserves the right to liquidate your assets in case the market moves against you.
