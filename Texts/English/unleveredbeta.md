# Unlevered Beta
## What Is Unlevered Beta ?

[Beta](/beta) is a measure of market risk. Unlevered beta (or asset beta) measures the market risk of the company without the impact of debt.

'Unlevering' a beta removes the financial effects of [leverage](/leverage) subsequently confining the risk due solely to company assets. In other words, how much did the company's equity contribute to its risk profile.

## Understanding Unlevered Beta

Beta is the slope of the [coefficient](/coefficientofvariation) for a stock regressed against a benchmark [market index](/marketindex) like the [Standard and Poor's (S&P) 500 Index](/sp500). A key determinant of beta is leverage, which measures the level of a company's debt to its equity. Levered beta measures the risk of a firm with debt and equity in its [capital structure](/capitalstructure) to the volatility of the market. The other type of beta is known as **unlevered beta**.

'Unlevering' the beta removes any beneficial or detrimental effects gained by adding debt to the firm's capital structure. Contrasting companies' unlevered betas give an investor lucidity on the structure of risk being assumed when purchasing the stock.

Take a company that is increasing its debt hence raising its debt-to-equity ratio. This will lead to a larger percentage of earnings being used to service that debt which will intensify investor uncertainty about future earnings stream. Consequently, the company's stock is deemed to be getting riskier however that risk isn't due to market risk.

> Detaching and removing the debt component of overall risk results in unlevered beta.
>

The level of debt that a company has can affect its performance, making it more sensitive to changes in its stock price. Note that the company being analyzed has debt in its financial statements, however unlevered beta treats it like it has no debt by stripping any debt off the calculation. Since companies have different capital structures and levels of debt, an analyst can calculate the unlevered beta to effectively compare them against each other or against the market. Along these lines, just the sensitivity of a firm's assets (equity) to the market will be factored in.

To 'unlever' the beta, the levered beta for the company must be known in addition to the company's [debt-equity ratio](/debtequityratio) and [corporate tax rate](/corporatetax).

## Systematic Risk and Beta

[Systematic risk](/systematicrisk) is the type of risk that is caused by factors beyond a company's control. This type of risk can't be diversified away. Examples of systematic risk include natural disasters, political elections, inflation, and wars. Beta is used to measure the level of systematic risk, or [volatility](/volatility), of a stock or portfolio.

Beta is a statistical measure that compares the volatility of the price of a stock against the volatility of the broader market. In the event that the volatility of the stock, as measured by beta, is higher, the stock is considered risky. On the off chance that the volatility of the stock is lower, the stock is said to have less risk.

A beta of one is equivalent to the risk of the broader market. That is, a company with a beta of one has the same systematic risk as the broader market. A beta of two means the company is twice basically as volatile as the overall market, however a beta of less than one means the company is less volatile and presents less risk than the broader market.

## Example of Unlevered Beta
>
> B~U~ = B~L~ \u00f7 [1 + ((1 - Tax Rate) x D/E)]
>

For example, working out the unlevered beta for Tesla, Inc. (as of November 2017):

- beta (B~L~) is 0.73
- Debt to Equity (D/E) ratio is 2.2
- corporate tax rate is 35%.

>
> Tesla B~U~ = 0.73 \u00f7 [1 +((1 - 0.35) * 2.2)]= 0.30
>

Unlevered beta is quite often equal to or lower than levered beta given that debt will most frequently be zero or positive. (In the rare events where a company's debt component is negative, say a company is hoarding cash, then unlevered beta might potentially be higher than levered beta.)

On the off chance that the unlevered beta is positive, investors will invest in the company's stock when prices are expected to rise. A negative unlevered beta will provoke investors to invest in the stock when prices are expected to decline.

## Highlights
- Levered beta (usually referred to as just beta or equity beta) is a measure of market risk. Debt and equity are factored in when assessing a company's risk profile.
- High debt-to-equity ratio typically translates to an increase in the risk associated with a company's stock.
- Unlevered beta strips off the debt component to isolate the risk due solely to company assets.
- A beta of 1 means that the stock is basically as risky as the market while betas greater or less than 1 reflect risk thresholds higher or lower than the market, respectively.
## FAQ
### What Is Beta?
Basically, beta (\u00df) is a measure of market risk. More precisely, it is a measure of the volatility — or systematic risk — of a security or portfolio compared to the market as a whole. In statistical terms, it is the slope of the coefficient for a security (stock) regressed against a benchmark market index (S&P 500). Each of these data points represents an individual stock's returns against those of the market as a whole. In this way, beta effectively describes the activity of a security's returns as it responds to swings in the market.
### What Is Levered Beta?
Levered beta measures the risk of a firm with debt and equity in its capital structure to the volatility of the market. A key determinant of beta is leverage, which measures the level of a company's debt to its equity. In this way, a publicly traded security's levered beta measures the sensitivity of that security's tendency to perform in relation to the overall market. A levered beta greater than positive 1 or less than negative 1 means that it has greater volatility than the market. A levered beta between negative 1 and positive 1 has less volatility than the market.
### What might Unlevered Beta Do for an Investor?
Unlevered beta removes any beneficial or detrimental effects gained by adding debt to the firm's capital structure. Looking at companies' unlevered betas give an investor lucidity on the creation of risk being assumed when purchasing the stock. Since companies have different capital structures and levels of debt, an investor can calculate the unlevered beta to effectively compare them against each other or against the market. Along these lines, just the sensitivity of a firm's assets (equity) to the market will be factored in.
