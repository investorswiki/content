# Naked Writer
## What Is a Naked Writer?

A naked writer is the seller of an options contract who doesn't likewise keep an offsetting position in the underlying security. All in all, a naked [call](/calloption) writer doesn't have an existing long position, and a naked [put](/putoption) writer an existing short position in the underlying security, leaving the option writer unhedged regardless. Such options are otherwise called uncovered options.

The writer of a [naked call](/nakedcall) is at risk of acknowledging unlimited losses on the grounds that, theoretically, there is no restriction to how high a stock's price can go. A [naked put](/nakedput) writer, then again, risks potential losses that can be incurred in the event that the price of the underlying security drops to zero.

## Figuring out a Naked Writer

Naked writers try to profit by getting premiums for composing and selling [options contracts](/optionscontract) without the need to [hedge](/hedge) themselves against adverse developments of the underlying security's price. Options are contracts where the buyer has the right, yet not the obligation, to buy (call) or sell (put) shares at a specific price and future date.

Naked options are appealing to traders and investors since they have the expected volatility incorporated into the price. [Brokers](/specialist) typically have specific rules in regards to naked options trading, and unpracticed traders, or those with limited funds, may not be permitted to place this type of order.

### Naked Calls

A trader who composes a naked call can earn a maximum gain equivalent to the premium that the option writer receives upfront, which is normally credited to their account. Thus, the goal for the writer is to have the option [expire](/expirationdate) worthless. The breakeven point for the writer is calculated by adding the premium received and the strike price for the naked call.

The maximum loss is theoretically unlimited on the grounds that there is no cap on how high the price of the underlying security can rise. In any case, in additional down to earth terms, the seller of the options will probably buy them back well before the price of the underlying rises too far over the [strike price](/strikeprice), in light of their risk tolerance and [stop-loss](/stop-lossorder) settings.

> Naked call composing is frequently restricted to experienced traders with margin accounts who meet a base net account equity of $100,000 or more.

On the off chance that the options contract is worked out, the naked writer will be forced to buy a number of shares at a possibly unfortunate price to meet their contractual obligation. Conversely, in a [covered call](/coveredcall) strategy, the trader possesses the underlying security on which the call options are written.

### Naked Puts

A trader who composes a naked put doesn't hold the underlying position, which is a [short](/short) position in the underlying security to cover the contract in case the option is [exercised](/work out). Since the naked writer has accepted the obligation to buy the underlying asset at the strike price in the event that the option is practiced at or before its expiration date, they will lose money assuming the security's price falls.

The most a naked put writer can receive is the premium received from selling the option on the off chance that the option terminates [out-of-the-money](/outofthemoney). A naked put strategy is intrinsically risky as a result of the limited [upside](/upside) profit potential and, theoretically, a huge disadvantage loss potential.

The risk lays in that the maximum profit is just reachable assuming the underlying price closes only at or over the strike price at expiration. Further expansions in the cost of the [underlying security](/underlying-security) won't bring about any extra profit. The maximum loss is theoretically critical in light of the fact that the price of the underlying security can fall to zero. The higher the strike price, the higher the loss potential.

While the risk is contained on the grounds that the underlying asset can drop to zero dollars, it can in any case be large. Conversely, in a covered put the trader will keep a short position in the underlying security.
