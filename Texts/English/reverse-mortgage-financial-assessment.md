## What Is a Reverse Mortgage Financial Assessment?

A reverse mortgage financial assessment is a survey of the borrower's [credit history](/credit-history), employment history, debts, and income during the reverse mortgage application process. The current reverse mortgage financial assessment requirement became effective in 2015.

During the reverse mortgage financial assessment, [lenders](/lender) analyze the borrower's all's sources of income, for example, Social Security, pensions and other retirement accounts, and investments. It was presented following quite a while of problems with borrowers being not able to stand to remain current on their [property tax](/propertytax) and [homeowners insurance](/homeowners-insurance) bills.

Subsequently, borrowers were losing their homes to [foreclosure](/foreclosure), and lenders were filing insurance claims with the [Federal Housing Administration (FHA)](/federal-housing-administration) to cover their losses on these loans. The reverse mortgage financial assessment is planned to keep this problem from happening.

## How a Reverse Mortgage Financial Assessment Works

A reverse mortgage doesn't need the borrower to make month to month mortgage payments as with a traditional, or forward, mortgage; all things being equal, the borrower gets a regularly scheduled payment from the lender. Likewise, dissimilar to a traditional mortgage, a reverse mortgage doesn't need the borrower to qualify in view of their [credit score](/credit_score) and current income. All things being equal, reverse mortgage endorsement depends on the borrower's age, the loan's interest rate, having a small or zero mortgage balance, not being in debt to the federal government, and the property's physical condition and [appraised value](/appraised_value).

A reverse mortgage is accessible just to individuals age 62 or more seasoned. Such individuals may presently not be working and have limited income from Social Security, a [pension](/pensionplan), a [employer-sponsored retirement account](/employer_sponsored_plan), or a [individual retirement account (IRA)](/ira). The purpose of the financial assessment is to ensure that the borrower can bear the cost of progressing homeowners insurance and property tax payments on that limited income. Borrowers must give certain records, for example, tax returns and bank account statements, as part of the interaction.

A financial assessment that uncovers inadequate income or assets or a history of paying bills late doesn't be guaranteed to mean that the borrower will be denied a reverse mortgage. For instance, if the [credit check](/credit-checking) uncovers past problems in paying bills on time, the borrower will be given an opportunity to make sense of. In the event that a pattern of credit problems arises, the lender will at last decide whether the credit problems were due to special conditions.

> Mortgage lending discrimination is unlawful. Assuming you think that you've been oppressed in light of race, variety, religion, sex, age, national beginning, familial status, disability, marital status, sexual orientation, source of income, or orientation identity, there are steps that you can take. One such step is to file a report with the [Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB)](/consumer-financial-protection-bureau-cfpb) or the [Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD)](/us-department-housing-urban-development-hud).

## Life Expectancy Set-Aside

On the off chance that the financial assessment uncovers problems, the lender might require the borrower to lay out what is known as a life expectancy set-aside. This is a type of [escrow](/escrow) account that is funded from the borrower's reverse mortgage proceeds.

The assessment decides the amount of money that the borrower must set to the side to pay property taxes, insurance, and other required charges. The amount will reduce the loan proceeds accessible to the borrower. Be that as it may, not all borrowers will have these continuous costs — such as[ flood insurance](/flood-insurance), [homeowners association fees](/homeowners-association-charge hoa), and mortgage servicing fees — for the expected duration of their loan.
