# Socionomics
## What Is Socionomics?

Socionomics is the study of social mind-set and its influence over social mentalities and activities. All the more explicitly, it looks to comprehend how social temperament regulates the overall tenor and character of social behavior in areas like politics, pop culture, financial markets, and the economy.

Socionomic theory recommends that leaders and their policies are essentially powerless to change the social state of mind and that their activities in the aggregate express social temperament as opposed to regulate it.

## Grasping Socionomics' Origins

Socionomics — which was spearheaded in application to the financial markets by analyst Robert R. Prechter, and who popularized the Elliott Wave Principle beginning during the 1970s — turns conventional wisdom on its head.

Conventional analysts accept that events influence social state of mind. For example, conventional wisdom would agree that that a rising stock market, an extending economy, cheery topics in popular diversion, and positive news would make society hopeful and blissful, and a falling stock market, a contracting economy, hazier subjects in popular amusement, and negative news would make society cynical and troubled.

Socionomics, then again, suggests that waves of social temperament vacillate normally and start things out, turning around the assumed direction of causality. Subsequently, a hopeful and more joyful society delivers more positive activities, like a rising stock market, a growing economy, and more playful topics in popular diversion, and a cynical and unhappier society creates more negative social activities, like a falling stock market, a contracting economy, and hazier subjects in popular diversion.

Since stock market indexes can reflect changes in the social state of mind very quickly, socionomic studies regularly use them as benchmark social-temperament indicators, or sociometers, to comprehend and expect changes in different areas of social activity, for example, business and politics, which get some margin to play out.

## Interface Between Socionomics, Financial Markets, and the Economy

Prechter's 2016 book, **The Socionomic Theory of Finance** (STF), applies socionomic theory to financial markets. STF recommends that economics and finance are two fundamentally various fields. It goes against conventional economic causality in finance as well as the [Efficient Market Hypothesis](/efficientmarkethypothesis) (EMH) in each major respect.

In a nutshell, Prechter acknowledges that in free economic markets, where individuals know their own values, prices of goods and services are not entirely set in stone, objective, stable, persuaded by conscious utility maximization, and regulated by the [law of supply and demand](/law-of-supply-demand). However, STF suggests that in financial markets, where investors are unsure of others' future valuations, the pricing of investments is generally still up in the air, subjective, unendingly dynamic, persuaded by herding, and regulated by waves of social mind-set.

Socionomics suggests that waves of social temperament are endogenous and vary normally in a fractal pattern depicted by the Elliott wave model, amounting to nothing anybody jars change them. Stock market wins and fails, and chaperon economic expansions and contractions, thusly, happen no matter what any activities by business individuals, presidents, prime priests, lawmakers, central bankers, policymakers, or different citizenry. Running against the norm, socionomists claim, their activities ordinarily express social mind-set.

Moderates might fault Jimmy Carter's policies for the disquietude of the late 1970s and credit Ronald Reagan's policies for the bull market of the 1980s, and nonconformists might credit Franklin Roosevelt's policies for the market's recovery during the 1930s and fault Richard Nixon for the downturns of the mid 1970s. As indicated by socionomics, markets and the economy fell and recuperated normally. The leaders simply get the credit or fault.

In a 2012 paper, Prechter and a team of socionomists at the Socionomics Institute showed that presidential election results offer no solid basis for expecting stock market trends, while the stock market, as a sociometer, is helpful for anticipating presidential election results. In any case, the creators concede that their research was limited by the way that they couldn't really measure social temperament itself, exhibit any direct association between social state of mind and voting, nor rule out the effects of other unmeasured factors.

Consider the socionomic point of view on the [subprime crisis](/subprime-total implosion) of 2008. As indicated by this viewpoint, a large, positive temperament trend incited boundless confidence among lenders, borrowers, and examiners, which prompted record levels of housing debt and taking off real estate prices. At the point when social state of mind normally moved from positive to negative, lenders, borrowers, and examiners turned out to be more skeptical, and their comparing changes in behavior prompted a collapse in real estate prices and a contraction in credit. Credit expansion, then, was not a primary reason, but rather a consequence of hopeful state of mind and its contraction in the following financial crisis was an aftereffect of negative temperament.

Anyway strange socionomic thinking might appear to economists, modern [behavioral economics](/behavioraleconomics) and [behavioral finance](/behavioralfinance) concur that investors don't go with completely rational financial choices and are frequently influenced by feeling, cognitive predispositions, and the [herd instinct](/herdinstinct) — and that there is a big hole in the efficient market hypothesis. And, surprisingly, the regarded economist[ John Maynard Keynes](/john_maynard_keynes) permitted that financial markets are subject to waves of hopeful and cynical sentiment. Socionomics has given a broad hypothetical system to these perceptions and indicates to be steady inside as well as remotely with respect to data.

## Reactions of Socionomics

Socionomics experiences a number of expected flaws, and investors would do well to consider these alongside the support it gets from its advertisers.

### Elliott Waves

Socionomics is fundamentally tied to the possibility of the Elliott Wave Principle, which is additionally intensely advanced by Prechter and other socionomics aficionados. Empirical support for the legitimacy of Elliott waves is, without a doubt, far from being obviously true. Likened to [Kondratieff waves](/kondratieff-wave) or [Joseph Schumpeter's](/joseph-schumpeter) cycles-inside cycles, Elliot waves include claimed patterns of recurring waves in asset prices or other economic or financial data.

These types of speculations have been largely excused as informal, ailing in predictive power, and even practices in false pattern recognition, additionally called pareidolia or apophenia, as per the most keen pundits. These are notable mental peculiarities that are the basis for natural things like children seeing nonexistent winged serpents looking like mists and the popular "face" on the surface of Mars, or, less flatteringly, of different pseudosciences like numerology, soothsaying, or palm perusing.

As indicated by pundits, a major problem is that these speculations are not falsifiable, a key part of logical hypotheses. This might be a saving grace to these speculations, in their defenders' eyes, however it is likewise their defeat according to a logical point of view; at whatever point they fail to precisely foresee developments in the data, extra layers of waves and cycles can just be "found" to make sense of the data.

In such manner, they closely look like Ptolemaic geocentric speculations that the Earth sits at the center of the universe, circled by the Sun, Moon, planets, and stars, which over the long run came to rely upon a massively muddled series of cycles and epicycles to rationalize noticed deviations of reality from the model's predictions.

### Social Mood

Past its close association with Elliott waves, socionomics relies completely upon the concept of social temperament. Notwithstanding, conceptualizing, operationalizing, and measuring social temperament has consistently proven troublesome, best case scenario. Even in the degree writing, socionomists concede that directly measuring social mind-set is fundamentally unrealistic. This dubious and undefined character of the concept of social mind-set can place socionomics on a weak balance from a logical perspective.

All things being equal, they depend on an unconditional assortment of intermediaries and indicators of differing believability, for example, the stock prices, subjective understandings of plot topics in art or media, or the popularity of brilliant tones and short skirts in ladies' fashion, among numerous others. Pundits point out that this permits for all intents and purposes unlimited scope for socionomists to single out indirect indicators of social mind-set to rationalize a particular hypothesis, story, or prediction.
Most problematically, it permits any failed prediction to be rationalized by and large by evolving, adding, or shifting the focal point of indicators of social temperament. Once more, this is fairly practically equivalent to the geocentric model of the planetary group; rather than adding Ptolemaic epicycles to make sense of failed predictions, socionomists can concoct new understandings of social state of mind.
