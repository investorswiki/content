## History of the EAEU

Following the disintegration of the Soviet Union in 1991, the economies of the former Soviet republics were wrecked due to many years of fumble, and numerous Eurasian republics experienced sudden economic unrest as they adjusted to the post-Soviet time. The political breakup of the Soviet Union likewise separated a considerable lot of the useful economic relations between these countries.

Nonetheless, the finish of the Soviet Union as a political entity didn't mean that the historical ties among Russia and the countries known as the "Close Abroad" had dissipated nor that they couldn't in any case harvest the gains of comparative advantage and trade or the benefits of economic integration. New forms of economic cooperation were required.

To this end, talks started between states in the region in regards to economic cooperation. In March 1994, Kazakhstani President Nursultan Nazarbayev originally suggested laying out a trade alliance during a discourse at Moscow State University.

By June 1994, a point by point plan for an Eurasian Union was drafted and submitted to heads of state. Belarus, Kazakhstan, and Russia marked The Treaty on the Customs Union in 1995, laying the preparation for economic cooperation between the member states. Hence, over the course of the next many years, a series of extra deals fortified economic relations between Eurasian states, which had formerly been all members of the Soviet Union.

In Dec. 2010, The Declaration on Establishment of the Single Economic Space of the Republic of Belarus, the Republic of Kazakhstan, and the Russian Federation was marked, laying out the foundation for the EAEU. This treaty, which went into force in 2012, guaranteed the free movement of goods, services, labor, and capital between the states.

On May 29, 2014, the EAEU was officially settled while establishing member states Belarus, Kazakhstan, and Russia marked the Treaty on the Eurasian Economic Union and this treaty was placed into force on Jan. 1, 2015. Armenia and Kyrgyzstan consented to EAEU promotion arrangements in Oct. 2014 and Dec. 2014, individually. On Jan. 2, 2015, The Treaty on the Eurasian Economic Union went into force for Armenia, and on Aug. 6, 2015, it went into force for Kyrgyzstan.

## Fate of the Eurasian Economic Union

Russian President Vladimir Putin flagged his ultimate goal is to stretch out the Eurasian Economic Union to the post-Soviet states in general. This would essentially bar the three Baltic states (Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia) who have currently rather joined the European Union.

Tajikistan, Uzbekistan, Georgia, Moldova, Ukraine, and Turkey have each been offered membership. Nonetheless, Georgia, Moldova, Ukraine, and Turkey have likewise been offered EU membership. Supportive of Russian split away regions in Georgia, Moldova, and Ukraine have all taken actions toward coordinating with the EAEU. These two economic unions are, in effect, locked in competition over the economic integration of Eastern Europe.
