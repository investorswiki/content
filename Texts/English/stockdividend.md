## What Is a Stock Dividend?

A stock dividend is a dividend payment to shareholders that is made in shares as opposed to as cash. The stock dividend enjoys the benefit of rewarding shareholders without reducing the company's cash balance, despite the fact that it can [dilute](/dilution) earnings per share.

These stock distributions are generally made as portions paid per existing share. For instance, a company could issue a stock dividend of 5%, which will expect it to issue 0.05 shares for each share owned by existing shareholders, so the owner of 100 shares would receive five extra shares.

## How a Stock Dividend Works

Otherwise called a "scrip dividend," a stock dividend is a distribution of shares to existing shareholders in lieu of a [cash dividend](/cashdividend). This type of dividend might be made when a company needs to reward its investors yet doesn't have the spare cash or needs to protect its cash for different investments.

Stock dividends have a tax advantage for the investor. The share dividend, similar to any stock share, isn't taxed until the investor sells it except if the company offers the option of taking the dividend as cash or in stock.

A stock dividend might expect that the recently received shares are not to be sold for a certain period of time. This [holding period](/holdingperiod) on a stock dividend normally begins the day after it is purchased. Understanding the holding period is important for determining qualified dividend tax treatment.

## Dilution Effect

The board of a public company, for instance, may support a 5% stock dividend. That provides existing investors with an extra share of company stock for each 20 shares they currently own. Notwithstanding, this means that the pool of accessible stock shares in the company increases by 5%, diluting the value of existing shares.

Subsequently, in this model, an investor who owned 100 shares in a company will possess 105 shares once the dividend is executed. In any case, the total [market value](/marketvalue) of those shares remains something similar. Along these lines, a stock dividend is like a [stock split](/stocksplit). It is not necessarily the case that the market value of the shares will remain something very similar. The incentive behind the stock dividend is the expectation that the share price will rise.

## Accounting for Small versus Large Stock Dividends

At the point when a stock dividend is issued, the total value of equity remains something very similar from both the investor's viewpoint and the company's point of view. Be that as it may, all stock dividends require a journal entry for the company issuing the dividend. This entry transfers the value of the issued stock from the [retained earnings](/retainedearnings) account to the [paid-in capital](/paidincapital) account.

The amount moved between the two accounts relies upon whether the dividend is a small stock dividend or a large stock dividend. A stock dividend is viewed as small on the off chance that the shares issued are under 25% of the total value of shares outstanding before the dividend. A journal entry for a small stock dividend transfers the market value of the issued shares from retained earnings to paid-in capital.

Large stock dividends are those wherein the new shares issued are over 25% of the value of the total shares outstanding prior to the dividend. In this case, the journal entry transfers the [par value](/parvalue) of the issued shares from retained earnings to paid-in capital.

## An Example of Stock Dividends

For instance, in the event that a company were to issue a 5% stock dividend, it would increase the number of shares held by shareholders by 5% (one share for each 20 owned). In the event that there are 1,000,000 shares in a company, this would convert into 50,000 extra shares. In the event that you owned 100 shares in the company, you'd receive five extra shares.

This, nonetheless, similar to the cash dividend, doesn't increase the value of the company. On the off chance that the company was priced at $10 per share, the value of the company would be $10 million. After the stock dividend, the value will remain something very similar, yet the share price will diminish to $9.50 to adapt to the dividend [payout](/payout).
