# Bond Power
## What is Bond Power?

Bond power is a separate legal form that approves the transfer of ownership of a [registered bond](/registered-bond) starting with one party then onto the next, without endorsing the genuine bond certificate.

## Understanding Bond Power

Basically, a bond power document fills in as a substitute for the assignment form that is printed on the rear of a registered bond certificate. It formally appoints an attorney-in-fact to transfer the ownership of the bonds.

Bond power is likewise once in a while alluded to as an assignment separate from the certificate. The separation of the authority from the bond certificate gives a measure of safety to the [bondholder](/bondholder). The assignment permits lenders to sell any securities pledged as collateral against the bond should the borrower [default](/default2).

A bond power typically requires a [signature guarantee](/signatureguarantee) to safeguard against fraudulent transfers. A signature guarantee is a form of authentication, issued by a bank or other [financial institution](/financialinstitution) (FI), which verifies the authenticity of a signature and the signatory's overall request.

The bond power form commonly includes:

- Previous owner's name
- Total number of bonds
- The bond [issuer](/issuer) name
- Bond [principal](/principal) sum
- The bond certificate number.

In effect, a bond power document is more helpful than a registered bond certificate since it could be traded, sold, or sold separately from the bond document it addresses. A power of attorney is given to the named entity so they can give the bond to whomever they wish.

In the present digital marketplace, a retail investor will utilize a [brokerage firm](/brokerage-organization) to buy or sell bonds and will depend on that firm to keep records of any legal documentation required for the transfer of the bond to the new owner. More often than not the owner of a bond won't take physical possession of the bond certificate and doesn't need to complete legal desk work to buy and sell bonds.

Holding bonds as an electronic record with the representative's custodian eliminates the requirement for the physical possession of the bond certificate. Notwithstanding, before technology permitted the keeping of altogether electronically files, physical bond certificates were the standard. It was common to utilize bond powers while transferring ownership of bonds starting with one party then onto the next.

## Bond Power Example

For instance, when somebody dies, they frequently leave bonds as part of their assets. A bond power document would permit somebody to sell or transfer certificates for the departed's estate, if they are a personal representative, beneficiary, or [executor](/executor). In the event that those assets are still in the market a grant of authority might be expected to access them. A bond power document can improve on that interaction.
