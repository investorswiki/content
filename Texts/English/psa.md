# Public Securities Association Standard Prepayment Model (PSA)
## What Is the PSA Standard Prepayment Model?

The Public Securities Association Standard Prepayment Model (PSA) is the assumed month to month rate of prepayment that is annualized to the outstanding principal balance of a mortgage loan.

The Public Securities Association Standard Prepayment Model is one of several models used to ascertain and oversee [prepayment risk](/prepaymentrisk) specific to [mortgage-backed securities](/mbs) (MBS) and [collateralized mortgage obligations](/cmo) (CMO).

## Grasping PSA

The Public Securities Association Standard Prepayment Model (PSA) recognizes that prepayment assumptions will change during the life of the obligation and may influence the yield of the security. The model expects a progressive rise in prepayments, which tops following 30 months. The standard model, called 100% PSA, begins with an annualized prepayment rate of 0% in month zero, with 0.2% increases every month until cresting at 6% following 30 months.

Prepayment assumptions depend on homebuyer data that shows that, during the initial not many years, a borrower is less inclined to be willing or able to prepay the mortgage. This data seems OK, as another homeowner is probably not going to move to an alternate home or quickly refinance, and the costs of buying a house generally don't leave a great deal of free cash flow for another owner to make extra payments.

It is important to note that the PSA is just the most common [prepayment model](/prepayment-model). There are various models, including proprietary ones, that can be utilized to model and assess prepayment in mortgage-backed investments. The Public Securities Association Standard Prepayment Model is likewise alluded to as the PSA prepayment model.

## The Importance of the Standard Prepayment Model to Investors

In the event that the [single month to month mortality](/single-month to month mortality) (SMM) for a given MBS or CMO is above the thing was projected by the PSA, then the security might see its overall lifespan abbreviated. This can bring about capital being returned to the investors sooner than arranged.

The return of capital through prepayment is generally a negative for investors, as prepayment will in general increase in low-premium environments, meaning the investors receive capital back that they must reinvest in a less favorable yield environment. So there is a negative impact on the trading value of a security that is surpassing the PSA. In the contrary case, the life of a MBS might be extended on the off chance that the prepayment rates are below the PSA, expecting the PSA was utilized in the creation and marketing of the security.

## Foundation on the PSA

The Public Securities Association Standard Prepayment Model was developed by the Public Securities Association in 1985. The Public Securities Association in the long run turned into the Bond Market Association and, in 2007, it merged with the Securities Industry Association to turn into the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association (SIFMA).

The prepayment model is as yet alluded to by its original name, yet due to the subsequent name changes of the association, it is at times called the Bond Market Association PSA. It is likewise very common for the abbreviation for the model to be mistaken for the indistinguishable abbreviation for former Public Securities Association as well as an abbreviation for the function of the model, that is to say, giving a [prepayment speed assumption](/prepayment-model) (PSA).
