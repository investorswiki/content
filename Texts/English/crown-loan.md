# Crown Loan
## What Is a Crown Loan?

A crown loan is a sans interest loan without a [maturity date](/maturitydate). It is regularly made by a grown-up in a high-income tax bracket to a person in a low or negligible tax bracket — like a minor child or another family member — to stay away from or diminish the tax nibble on the funds. In 1984, Congress and the U.S. High Court closed the escape clauses that made such loans attractive.

## How a Crown Loan Works

Crown loans get their name from Henry Crown, a wealthy industrialist and prestigious donor from Chicago who first utilized [demand loans](/demandnote) as an approach to transferring wealth to his children and grandchildren.

Demand loans have no set maturity date, so their repayment becomes due just on the demand of the lender. Individuals utilizing these loans regularly did as such to exploit the different tax rates their children or grandchildren would pay on the investment earnings of the borrowed money.

The normal financial structure of such a deal included lending funds to a child or grandchild. These funds would then be invested in an asset or financial instrument offering a high-interest rate or rate of return.

Since the borrower generally occupied a lower tax bracket than the lender, the amount of tax due on the investment gains would be a lot more modest. Since the funds addressed a loan instead of a gift, the lender could try not to pay [gift taxes](/gifttax) on the amount of the loan, and the lender could stay away from exposure to taxes on interest by demanding repayment of principal as it were.

## Difficulties to Crown Loans

The U.S. [Internal Revenue Service](/irs) (IRS) began looking at Crown loans during the 1960s. In 1973, it looked to impose a gift tax on $18 million worth of such loans made to [trusts](/trust) laid out for children and other close family members by, as a matter of fact, Lester Crown, one of Henry Crown's children.

Lester Crown challenged the tax in Tax Court and won: Although the IRS pursued, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit, in Crown v. Commissioner, upheld the Tax Court's decision.

Nonetheless, a couple of years after the fact, the IRS won in another case. In 1984, in Dickman v. Commissioner, the Supreme Court upheld a ruling from the 11th Circuit evaluating a gift tax on sans interest loans made by Paul and Esther Dickman to their children and a closely held family corporation.

This ruling, alongside extra legislation to close tax escape clauses in regards to loans with [below-market interest rates](/below-market-interest-rate) in the Tax Reform Act of 1984, really eliminated the financial incentive to make Crown loans.

## Current Tax Treatment of Crown Loans

In spite of the fact that they actually exist, a high-wealth individual hoping to benefit from crown loans today probably wouldn't find the practice advantageous, tax-wise. Under the terms of Internal Revenue Code Section 7872, the IRS generally can think about such loans (and demand loans overall) to be either below-market loans or gift loans, contingent upon the rate of interest charged and the idea of interest payments foregone by the lender.

Technically, this means that some or the entirety of the loan — the principal, or potentially the amount of interest it could have charged — is thought of "pardoned," and debts excused by a creditor are taxable as [cancellation of debt](/cancellation-of-debt) income. The main concern, in practical terms: No-interest loans by and large, and crown loans specifically, become subject to tax.
