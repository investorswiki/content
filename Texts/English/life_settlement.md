## What Is a Life Settlement?

A life settlement alludes to the sale of an existing [insurance](/insurance) policy to an outsider for a one-time frame cash payment. Payment is more than the surrender value yet not exactly the genuine death benefit. After the sale, the purchaser turns into the policy's [beneficiary](/beneficiary) and assumes payment of its premiums. Thusly, they receive the death benefit when the insured kicks the bucket.

A life settlement agreement is closely connected with a viatical agreement.

## How Life Settlements Work

At the point when an insured party can never again bear the cost of their insurance policy, they can sell it for a certain amount of cash to an investor — generally a [institutional investor](/institutionalinvestor). The cash payment is principally tax-free for most policy owners. The insured person basically transfers ownership of the policy to the investor. As we noted over, the insured party receives a cash [payment](/payment) in exchange for the policy — more than the surrender value, however not exactly the policy's endorsed payout at death.

By selling it, the insured person transfers each part of the policy to the new owner. This means the investor who assumes control over the policy inherits and becomes responsible for all that connected with the policy including [premium](/premium) payments alongside the [death benefit](/deathbenefit). Thus, when the insured party bites the dust, the new owner — who turns into the beneficiary after the transfer — receives the payout.

> Life settlements are legal generally in the U.S. Since life settlements include a transfer by the policy owner, they don't amount to [stranger-owned life insurance](/stranger-owned-life-insurance-stoli) (STOLI), which is illegal.

## Why Choose a Life Settlement

There are many justifications for why individuals decide to sell their life insurance policies and are typically possibly done when the insured person doesn't have a known life-undermining illness. The majority of individuals who sell their policies for a life settlement will generally be more seasoned individuals — the people who need money for [retirement](/retirement) yet haven't had the option to set aside enough. That is the reason life settlements are in many cases called senior settlements. By getting a cash payout, the insured party can supplement their retirement income with a largely [tax-free](/tax-free) payout.

Different purposes behind picking a life settlement include:

- The powerlessness to manage premiums. Rather than allowing the policy to lapse and be canceled, an insured person can sell the policy utilizing a life settlement. Inability to pay the premiums may net the insured a more modest [cash surrender value](/cashsurrendervalue) — or none by any means, contingent upon the terms. A life settlement on a current policy, however, generally brings about a higher cash payment from the investor.
- The policy is not generally required. There might come a time when the purposes behind having the policy don't exist any longer. The insured party may never again require the policy for their [dependents](/subordinate).
- Cases of crises. In cases where a surprising event emerges, for example, the death or illness of a family member, the owner might have to sell the policy for cash to cover these expenses.
- Cases including key individual insurance policies held by companies on executives. This is average for individuals who never again work for the company. By ending a life settlement, the company can cash out on a policy that was beforehand [illiquid](/illiquid).

## Life Settlements versus Viatical Settlements

Policy sales became famous during the 1980s while individuals living with AIDS had life insurance they didn't require. This prompted one more part of the industry — the [viatical settlement](/viaticalsettlement) industry, where individuals who have terminal illnesses sell their policies for cash. This part of the [industry](/industry) lost its radiance after individuals with AIDS started living longer.

At the point when someone turns out to be terminally ill and has an exceptionally short life span, they might sell their life insurance to someone else. In exchange for a large [lump sum](/lump-sum-payment) of money, the buyer takes on the premium payments, turning into the policy's new owner. After the insured party passes on, the new owner receives the death benefit.

Viatical settlements are generally more dangerous on the grounds that the investor essentially [speculates](/hypothesis) on the death of the insured. Even however the original policy owner might be ill, there's no chance of knowing when they will really kick the bucket. Assuming the insured person lives longer, the policy becomes less expensive, however the genuine [return](/return) becomes lower subsequent to considering in premium payments over the long haul.

Yet, the case ended up in the Supreme Court.

In his ruling, Supreme Court Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes compared life insurance to customary [property](/property). He accepted the policy could be transferred by the owner at will and had similar legal standing as different types of property like stocks and [bonds](/bond). Moreover, he said there are rights that accompany life insurance as a piece of property:

- The owner can change the beneficiary except if the insurer has limitations in place.
- The policy might be utilized as [collateral](/collateral) for a loan.
- Owners can borrow against the insurance policy.
- Policies can be sold to someone else or entity.
