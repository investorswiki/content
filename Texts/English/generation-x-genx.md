# Generation X (Gen X)
## What Is Generation X (Gen X)?

Generation X, which is once in a while shortened to Gen X, is the name given to the generation of Americans brought into the world between the mid-1960s and the mid 1980s.

The specific years that comprise Gen X fluctuate. A few researchers — demographers William Strauss and Neil Howe, for instance — place the specific birth years from 1961 to 1981, though Gallup places the birth years somewhere in the range of 1965 and 1979. Yet, all concur that Gen X follows the baby boom generation and goes before Generation Y or the millennial generation.

## Figuring out Generation X

The name "Generation X" comes from a novel by Douglas Coupland, **Generation X: Tales for an Accelerated Culture**, distributed in 1991. However it's more helpful for marketing than social science, generational theory — the assumption that individuals brought into the world inside a similar time period can be viewed as a group with comparative perspectives, values, tastes, and habits — and the possibility of a [generation gap](/generation-gap) has acquired broad acceptance in the U.S.

The American generations covered in the theory are:

- [Greatest Generation](/the_greatest_generation) (conceived around 1901 to 1924)
- Silent Generation (around 1925 to 1945)
- [Baby Boomers](/baby_boomer) (around 1946 to 1964)
- Generation X (around 1965 to 1985)
- [Millennial](/millennial) Generation (around 1985 to 2000)
- Gen Z (post-Millennial) (2001-2020)

Gen X numbers around 65 million, while the baby boomers and the millennials each have around 72 million individuals. Gen X is likewise at times alluded to as the "latchkey generation" as they were in many cases left unaided at home after school until their parents returned home from work.

Like the silent generation, Generation X has been defined as "in the middle between" generation. The group's earning power and savings were compromised first by the [dotcom bust](/dotcom-bubble), and second by the financial crisis of 2008 and the [Great Recession](/great-recession). In terms of social and political power, Generation X is sandwiched between the baby boomers, who grew up during the Vietnam and Reagan times and the millennials of the Obama period.

> Gen X covers with another group called the [sandwich generation](/sandwichgeneration). Every modern generation has gotten its time in this space, which is utilized to portray middle-aged individuals who — because of longer life ranges and having children later in life — wind up supporting both aging parents and developing children all the while.

Gen X accounts for just 29% of the country's wealth, while baby boomers hold just more than half (51%), as indicated by the latest data from the Federal Reserve.

## Retirement Savings

Gen X has an average of $64,000 in retirement savings. Not surprisingly baby boomers have the most, $144,000, and millennials the least, $23,000. Nine percent of Gen Xers have no retirement savings by any means.

This falls far short of what the generations each expect they should retire. Gen X and baby boomers estimate that to have a good sense of safety they will require $500,000, and millennials $300,000.

## Effects of Market Timing on Gen X

On average, Gen X households started working, saving, and investing during a period of lower investment returns than the baby boomers. Numerous Gen X households started building their savings in periods of high market valuations, for example, the [technology bubble](/tech_bubble) and dotcom bubble of the late-1990s and in the approach the global financial crisis of 2008. The effects of the resulting [bear markets](/bearmarket) still weigh intensely on their portfolios.

Just 44% of Gen X workers said they have completely recovered or were not impacted by the Great Recession, compared to half of baby boomers, as indicated by the Transamerica survey.

Gen Xers presently have the highest average debt of any generation, as per research by Experian. They increased their average debt by around 3.5%, or $4,802, somewhere in the range of 2019 and 2020 coming to $140,643. Mortgage debt accounted for the highest extent, followed by HELOC loans, student loans, vehicle loans, personal loans, and credit card debt.

## Reevaluating Retirement for Gen X

Furthermore, Gen Xers aren't depending on [Social Security](/socialsecurity) to fund their retirement all things considered.

Baby boomers (37%) are substantially more prone to anticipate that Social Security should be their primary source of retirement income, compared with just 26% of Gen X, as indicated by the Transamerica survey. Truth be told, 41% of Gen X "firmly concur" that Social Security probably won't associate with when they retire, while 26% of baby boomers feel something similar."

That's what transamerica found, overall, workers across the three generations share financial and solid aging-related explanations behind working past age 65. In any case, baby boomers are almost certain than different generations to do so on the grounds that they need the income. Generation X will keep working as they can't bear to retire in light of the fact that they haven't sufficiently saved.
