# Simple Interest
## What is simple interest?
Simple interest is [interest](/interest) calculated on the [principal](/principal) portion of a loan or the original contribution to a savings account. Simple interest doesn't [compound](/compoundinterest), implying that an account holder will only gain interest on the principal, and a borrower won't ever need to pay interest on interest previously accrued.
## More profound definition
The formula for ascertaining simple interest is: Principal * Interest Rate * Term of the loan.
Loans rarely utilize the simple-interest calculation, however those that do are vehicle loans and short-term personal loans. A small bunch of mortgages likewise utilize this calculation, most eminently the biweekly mortgage. One of the reasons that the biweekly mortgage assists borrowers with paying their homes off quicker is that paying the interest all the more habitually accelerates the payoff date.
With simple-interest loans, the lender applies the payment to the month's interest first; the remainder of the payment decreases the principal. Every month, the borrower pays the interest in full so it won't ever accumulate. Assuming that she pays her loan late, she'll need to pay more money to cover the additional interest and keep the loan's predefined payoff date. This contrasts with compound interest, which adds a portion of the old interest to the loan. The lender then, at that point, calculates new interest on the old interest owed by the borrower.
Simple interest is likewise rare with savings accounts; most savings accounts utilize the compounding method to calculate interest.

## FAQ
### Which Will Pay Out More Over Time, Simple or Compound Interest?
Compound interest will continuously pay more after the main payment period. Assume you borrow $10,000 at a 10% annual interest rate with the principal and [interest due](/interest-due) as a [lump sum](/lump-sum-payment) in three years. Utilizing a simple interest calculation, 10% of the principal balance gets added to your repayment amount during every one of the three years. That emerges to $1,000 each year, which sums $3,000 in interest over the life of the loan. At repayment, then, at that point, the amount due is $13,000. Presently guess you take out a similar loan, with similar terms, however the interest is compounded annually. At the point when the loan is due, rather than owing $13,000, you wind up owing $13,310. While you may not consider $310 an immense difference, this model is only a three-year loan; compound interest stacks up and becomes harsh with longer loan terms.
