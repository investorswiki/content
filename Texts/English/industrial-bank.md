# Industrial Bank

An industrial bank is a state-chartered, financial institution, generally owned by a commercial firm, that isn't regulated by a federal banking agency. Industrial banks acknowledge customer deposits and give loans to consumers and small businesses.

Industrial banks are otherwise called industrial loan companies (ILCs). Industrial banks are just chartered by a couple of states; the state of Utah gives the majority of charters to industrial banks in the U.S.

## Figuring out Industrial Banks

Industrial banks were initially established in the mid 1900s to give low-to-direct pay industrial workers who couldn't meet all requirements for credit at traditional lending institutions with a means to access capital.

Industrial banks are regulated by state regulators and by the [Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. (FDIC)](/fdic). Due to their distinct corporate structure, industrial banks can be owned by companies. They are not subject to a portion of the regulations that oversee traditional institutions and don't need to conform to the Bank Holding Company Act. What's more, industrial banks don't face supervision by the Federal Reserve. Because of this lack of regulatory limitations, numerous [financial technology companies](/fintech) and investment companies have begun to apply for industrial bank charters.

While industrial banks have limited banking powers cross country, they generally keep up with similar powers and privileges as a traditional commercial bank. Industrial banks are disputable among the individuals who support a more stalwart division among banks and commercial firms. Reactions of industrial banks claim that they give companies the privileges, yet not the supervision, of a [bank charter](/charteredbank).

## Analysis of Industrial Banks

In 2005, Wal-Mart Inc. recorded an application to form another industrial bank to decrease credit and debit card transaction fees. This set off far reaching resistance and fights from commercial banks and financial regulators. The FDIC in the long run put an impermanent [moratorium](/moratorium) on industrial bank applications in 2006. Simultaneously, state-level legislation was passed that would block any prospective industrial banks from opening branches in various purviews.

Wal-Mart Inc. pulled out its application in 2007 before the FDIC could pursue any choice in regards to the situation with their application. Rivals of Wal-Mart's application claimed that the company's engagement in the business of banking represented a threat to the banking system and to the FDIC Deposit Insurance Fund.

In mid 2019, lobbyists from the [Independent Community Bankers of America (ICBA) ](/independent-community-bankers-of-america)distributed a policy paper that called for a moratorium on giving federal deposit insurance to industrial banks. Their actions were inspired by another wave of fintech companies, including payment processor Square Inc., that have submitted applications for state bank charters. A bank charter would permit Square Inc. to give loans and other financial services straightforwardly to its shippers. In any case, ICBA claims that industrial bank charters are a loophole that Congress needs to address. Not exclusively would fintech companies who receive bank charters be exempt from supervision by the Federal Reserve, however they likewise wouldn't be required to disclose any nonbanking-related commercial activities.

In November 2019, Senator John Kennedy of Louisiana presented a bill, called the "Disposing of Corporate Shadow Banking Act of 2019," that would successfully end the ability of nonfinancial companies to form industrial banks. The ICBA has communicated its support for Sen. Kennedy's bill, claiming that it would close the loophole of industrial banks, make a more secure financial system, and assist with keeping the distance of banking and commerce.
