# Foreign Deposits
## What Are Foreign Deposits?

The term foreign deposits alludes to [deposits](/deposit) made by individuals and corporations at or into domestic banks outside the United States. Dissimilar to customary deposits made at domestic branches, these deposits aren't subject to deposit [insurance premiums](/insurance-charge) or reserve requirements. The mercy granted to foreign deposits in regards to deposit insurance and reserve requirements is a work to contend with [offshore banking](/offshore) centers.

## How Foreign Deposits Work

Deposits are financial [transactions](/exchange). They include the transfer of money into a bank [account](/account) for safekeeping. For example, an individual might choose to put extra money they have close by into their bank account. The bank consents to keep the money until such time that the customer chooses to [withdraw](/withdrawal) the funds. On the off chance that it's a [savings account](/savingsaccount), the bank might pay the account holder interest on the balance.

Foreign deposits are any deposits made into accounts at banks that operate outside the United States. These are regularly domestic [banks](/bank) even however they carry on with work outside the country. For instance, a corporation that has an office in the Caribbean with a bank account at Bank of America might put aside installments to a nearby branch. In any case, there are certain conditions that account holders must consider.

In contrast to deposits at domestic branches, these aren't covered by the [Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation](/fdic) (FDIC). This means assuming the bank goes under, the customer loses their money. This was explained by the FDIC in September 2013. The announcement was made in response to new banking rules in Britain, which called for non-European banks to treat foreign depositors the same way they treat domestic depositors. Foreign branches of U.S. banks hold about $1 trillion in [assets](/resource), as per data made available from the FDIC in 2013. As per a Reuters report, 40% of these deposits are held in the United Kingdom.

The FDIC explained that foreign depositors who put aside installments in [bank branches](/branch-banking) on U.S. soil appreciate federal deposit insurance however depositors to overseas branches are not subject to a similar protection. All deposits made to U.S. [bank branches](/branch-banking) situated in the U.S. are dealt with similarly, whether or not or not the depositor is a foreign national. In other words, in the event of a bank disappointment, the FDIC covers these deposits similarly, and gives both foreign and domestic depositors preference over broad [unsecured creditors](/unsecuredcreditor).

## Special Considerations

Dually payable foreign deposits are payable in both the country in which the deposit is initially made and in the United States. For instance, on the off chance that a British citizen sets aside an installment in a foreign branch of an American bank situated in the U.K., and can make a trip to the U.S. what's more, pull out money from that account through a domestic branch of a similar bank, that account is considered dually payable.

Not all deposits to foreign banks are dually payable. Much of the time, foreign deposits are payable just in the country in which the deposit was made. Setting aside foreign installments dually payable is expensive for American banks since it opens them to higher [reserve balance requirements](/requiredreserves), increased documentation costs, the possibility of foreign regulatory requirements, foreign [sovereign risk](/sovereignrisk), and different traps.
