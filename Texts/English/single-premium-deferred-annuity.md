The assets in the annuity develop after some time.

There are two different ways for a buyer of a single-premium deferred annuity to open the value of such a product. The least demanding and cheapest way is to just annuitize to make an income stream. The other is to purchase a discretionary rider, for example, a [guaranteed withdrawal benefit](/gmwb), in which case the annuitant might access the cash value of the annuity contract while as yet having an income stream that will last til' the very end.

## Benefits of Single-Premium Deferred Annuities

All the more unequivocally, SPDAs might feature either a guaranteed interest rate or a rate based on a stock market index.

At the point when the market rises, the annuitant's return is based on a foreordained formula based on the index's gain. Basically, owners of a single-premium deferred annuity might decide to limit their [downside](/downside) by surrendering a portion of their upside.

Compared to low-interest savings accounts or cash, a single-premium deferred annuity might be a far superior place to park assets for some investors for a long period of time. As far as one might be concerned, tax on interest income is deferred. Likewise, indexed SPDAs give downside protection without forfeiting too much upside.
