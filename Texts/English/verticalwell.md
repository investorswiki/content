# Vertical Well
## What Is a Vertical Well?

A vertical well is a technique for accessing an underground reserve of oil or natural gas that includes drilling vertically into the ground. Drilling wells vertically is a traditional method of oil extraction, as compared to their more modern partner, [directional drilling](/directional-drilling).

## How Vertical Wells Work

Vertical wells function by pointing a borehole on a deeper level well and into a [reserve](/oil-reserves) situated underneath it. In the past, vertical wells were the main method accessible in light of the fact that directional drilling techniques were not accessible.

The primary benefit of a vertical well is its simplicity, which can bring about cost savings both in terms of equipment and labor, as well as reduce the time required to remove accessible reserves. At times, in any case, vertical wells can demonstrate relatively inefficient. For example, when the underground reserve broadens horizontally across a wide area, a company would have to penetrate different vertical wells to proficiently access the oil.

In those circumstances, directional drilling techniques could be undeniably more cost-compelling, which includes introducing a vertical well that drills down into the supply, and afterward drilling [horizontally](/horizontalwell) or at a point to expand the borehole into the nearby segments of the reserve. With this, the oil from the whole underground reserve could be extricated from a single vertical well.

## Vertical Well versus Horizontal Well

Like the name, horizontal wells are bored from the side. Vertical wells drill downward, yet horizontal well is penetrated off of a vertical borehole. In particular, a well is horizontal in the event that it's dug at a point of no less than eighty degrees to a vertical wellbore.

The number of horizontal wells outperformed vertical wells without precedent for 2017. Be that as it may, there were still north of 88,000 active vertical wells toward the finish of 2018, albeit the real production of those wells was well behind production by horizontal wells At the finish of 2018, horizontal drilling in U.S. [shale plays](/shaleoil) made up 96% of crude oil production and 97% of natural gas production.

## Illustration of Vertical Wells

As conventional wellsprings of oil and simple to-access reserves diminish, absolutely vertical wells are turning out to be more uncommon. Of course, vertical wells keep on playing an essential job in the oil extraction process, as all directional drilling projects must start with the drilling of a vertical well.

Engineers regularly utilize vertical wells to analyze rock parts at various degrees of depth. By investigating these examples, the engineers can figure out where the oil reserves are probably going to be found, in this manner advising the heading regarding the drilling.

At times, tests collected through vertical wells have permitted companies to remove oil from different distinct reserves utilizing directional drilling techniques. The ability to productively remove oil from numerous supplies utilizing a single vertical well can yield substantial cost savings over the life of the project, while likewise diminishing surface level disruption due to the relative lack of heavy equipment and work force included.

One more area in which vertical wells keep on playing an important job is in offshore oil extraction. In the sea, vertical wells are as yet the more normal method, where drilling from an offshore platform is now very complex. Offshore directional drilling, albeit technically conceivable, is still restrictively costly as a rule.

## Features
- They have become more uncommon in recent years due to the rise of directional drilling techniques.
- Vertical wells extricate oil and natural gas reserves found straightforwardly underneath the well site.
- Be that as it may, vertical wells keep on being utilized in the oil extraction industry and stay the primary method utilized by offshore drilling platforms.
