# War Exclusion Clause
## What Is a War Exclusion Clause?

A war exclusion clause in a [insurance](/insurance) policy explicitly prohibits coverage for acts of war, like attacks, uprisings, transformations, military overthrows, and terrorism. A war exclusion clause in an insurance contract alludes to the protection of a not be committed insurer to pay for losses brought about by war-related occasions.

Insurance companies ordinarily won't cover damages brought about by war for clear reasons. Assuming war breaks out in a country, it could cause a catastrophic amount of damage that would likely [bankrupt](/bankruptcy) the insurance company assuming that covering such damages were on the hook. Besides, in the event that an insured individual chooses to enlist in the military and do battle, they are deliberately putting themselves at a lot higher risk of getting disabled or killed.

Notwithstanding, after September 11, "war and terrorism" exclusions that expanded the war portion of the exclusion past contractually assumed liability were immediately added to liability policies. This improvement augmented the scope of the war exclusion clause, which is currently viewed as standard, whether or not terrorism is insured or excluded in the policy.
