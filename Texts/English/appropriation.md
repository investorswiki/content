### Appropriations in Business

Corporate appropriations allude to how a company dispenses its funds and can incorporate share buybacks, dividends, paying down debt, and purchases of fixed assets.

Investors watch to determine whether a company is utilizing its cash effectively to build shareholder value or whether the company is taken part in trivial utilization of its cash, which can lead to the destruction of shareholder value.

## Monitoring Corporate Appropriations

Investors monitor corporate appropriations of cash by investigating a company's cash flow statement. The cash flow statement (CFS) measures how well a company deals with its cash position, meaning how well the company produces cash to pay its debt obligations and fund its working expenses. The cash flow of a company is separated into three activities or behavior:

1. **Operating activities** on the cash flow statement incorporate any sources and uses of cash from business activities, for example, cash created from a company's products or services.
1. **Investing activities** incorporate any sources and uses of cash from a company's investments like a purchase or sale of an asset.
1. **Cash from financing activities** incorporates the wellsprings of cash from investors or banks, as well as the purposes of cash paid to shareholders. The payment of [dividends](/profit), the payments for stock repurchases, and the repayment of debt principal (loans) are remembered for this category.

Commonly, appropriated retained earnings are utilized exclusively to demonstrate to pariahs the goal of management to involve the funds for some purpose. Appropriation is the utilization of cash by a company showing how money is allocated and appropriated retained earnings frames the specific utilization of that cash by the board of directors.

## Limitations of an Appropriation

For investors, the cash flow statement mirrors a company's [financial health](/financial-wellbeing) since commonly the more cash that is accessible for business operations, the better. In any case, there are limitations to breaking down how money is spent. An investor won't be aware if the purchase of a fixed asset, for instance, is a decent decision until the company starts to produce revenue from the asset.

Subsequently, the investor can surmise whether the management is effectively conveying or appropriating its funds appropriately. In some cases a negative cash flow results from a company's growth strategy through extending its operations.
