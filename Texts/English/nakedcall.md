# Naked Call
## What Is a Naked Call?

A naked call is an options strategy wherein an investor [writes](/composing an-option) (sells) [call options](/calloption) on the open market without possessing the underlying security.

This strategy, some of the time alluded to as an uncovered call or an unhedged short call, remains rather than a [covered call](/coveredcall) strategy, where the investor claims the [underlying security](/underlying-security) on which the call options are written. A naked call can measure up to a naked put.

## Figuring out Naked Calls

A naked call empowers an investor to create [premium income](/premium-income) without straightforwardly selling the underlying security. Basically, the [premium](/premium) received is the sole motive for composing an uncovered call option.

It is innately risky as there is limited [upside](/upside) profit potential and, in theory, unlimited downside loss potential. As a matter of fact, the maximum gain is the premium that the option writer receives upfront, which is generally credited to their account. Thus, the goal for the writer is to have the option [expire](/expirationdate) worthless.

The maximum loss, be that as it may, is theoretically unlimited in light of the fact that there is no cap on how high the price of the underlying security can rise. Notwithstanding, in additional pragmatic terms, the seller of the options will probably buy them back well before the price of the underlying rises too far over the [strike price](/strikeprice), in light of their risk tolerance and [stop-loss](/stop-lossorder) settings.

> [Margin](/margin) requirements, naturally, will generally be very steep given the unlimited risk capability of this strategy.

A seller of call options, thusly, needs the underlying security to fall, with the goal that they can collect the full premium on the off chance that the option terminates worthless. Yet, assuming that the price of the underlying security rather rises, they might wind up selling the stock at a price far below the market price on the grounds that the option buyer might choose to [exercise](/exercise) their right to purchase the security â€” that is, they would be [assigned](/task) to sell the stock.

## Special Considerations

The [breakeven point](/breakevenpoint) for the writer is calculated by adding the option premium received to the strike price of the call that has been sold.

A rise in [implied volatility](/iv) isn't alluring to the writer as the probability of the option being [in the money](/inthemoney) (ITM), and consequently being exercised, likewise increments. Since the option writer believes the naked call should terminate [out of the money](/outofthemoney) (OTM), the progression of time, or time decay, will decidedly affect this strategy.

Because of the risk implied, just experienced investors who strongly accept that the price of the underlying security will fall or stay flat ought to embrace this advanced strategy. The margin requirements are much of the time exceptionally high for this strategy because of the propensity for unassuming losses, and the investor might be forced to purchase shares on the [open market](/open-market) prior to expiration on the off chance that margin limits are penetrated.

The upside to the strategy is that the investor could receive income as premiums without putting up a great deal of initial [capital](/capital).

## Utilizing Naked Calls

Again, there is a huge risk of loss with composing [uncovered](/uncovered-option) calls. Be that as it may, investors who strongly accept the price for the underlying security, normally a stock, will fall or remain the equivalent can compose call options to earn the premium. Assuming the stock stays below the strike price between the time the options are written and their expiration date, then the options writer keeps the whole premium minus [commissions](/commission).

Ought to, then again, the price of the stock rise over the strike price by the options expiration date, then the buyer of the options can demand the seller to deliver shares of the underlying stock. The options seller will then, at that point, need to go out from the dark market and buy those shares at the [market price](/market-price) to sell them to the options buyer at the options strike price.

If, for instance, the strike price is $60 and the open market price for the stock is $65 at the time the options contract is exercised, the options seller will cause a loss of $5 per share of stock less the premium received.

### Model

The premium collected will to some degree offset the loss on the stock yet the potential loss can in any case be exceptionally large. For instance, suppose an investor believed that the strong [bull](/bullmarket) run for Amazon.com was over when it at long last evened out in March 2017 close $852 per share.

The investor composed a call option with a strike price of $865 and an expiration in May 2017. Notwithstanding, after a short respite, the stock continued its [rally](/rally) and by the mid-May expiration, the stock came to $966.

The potential liability was the [exercise price](/exerciseprice) of $966 minus the strike price of $865, which came about in $101 per share. This is offset by anything premium was collected toward the beginning.

## Highlights
- At the point when call options are sold, the seller benefits as the underlying security goes down in price.
- A naked call is the point at which a call option is sold without anyone else (uncovered) with no offsetting positions.
- A naked call has limited upside profit potential and, in theory, unlimited loss potential.
- A naked call's breakeven point for the writer is its strike price plus the premium received.
