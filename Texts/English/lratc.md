# Long-Run Average Total Cost (LRATC)
## What Is Long-Run Average Total Cost (LRATC)?

Long-run average total cost (LRATC) is a business metric that addresses the average cost per unit of output over the [long run](/longrun), where all data sources are viewed as variable and the scale of production is changeable. The long-run average cost curve shows the most minimal total cost to create a given level of output over the long haul.

Long-term [unit costs](/unitcost) are quite often not exactly short-term unit costs on the grounds that, in a long-term time period, companies have the flexibility to change big parts of their operations, like factories, to accomplish optimal effectiveness. A goal of both company management and investors is to determine the lower limits of LRATC.

## Seeing Long-Run Average Total Cost

For example, in the event that a manufacturing company fabricates a new, bigger plant for production, it is assumed that the LRATC per unit would ultimately become lower than at the old plant as the company exploits certain [economies of scale](/economiesofscale) or the cost advantages that come from growing the scale of production. At the point when the scale of production is expanded, average costs are decreased, production turns out to be more efficient, and a company can turn out to be more competitive in the market. This can lead to both lower prices and bigger profits, which can be beneficial for the two consumers and makers â€” this is known as a positive-aggregate game.

## Step by step instructions to Visualize Long-Run Average Total Cost

The calculation of the LRATC might be addressed as a curve showing the most reduced costs that a company will actually want to go after any degree of output over the long haul. The state of that curve can closely look like the curve calculated for short-run average total costs. The LRATC should be visible as comprised of a series of short-run curves as a company works on its proficiency. The curve itself can be partitioned into three sections or phases. During the economies of scale toward the beginning of the curve, costs are decreased as the company develops more efficient and its production costs reduce.

The principal cycles of product development and assembly carry costs that will generally be greater at the beginning. As additional factories and production lines are presented, the idea of costs moves more towards the continuous manufacturing of the product. The burden of those expenditures lessens as it becomes simpler for the company to repeat and reproduce its operations.

In the end, the company will experience consistent returns to scale as it pushes nearer to [peak efficiency](/production_efficiency). Cost of acquisition for raw materials can be diminished by making such purchases in progressively developing amounts. Besides, the processes the company uses to create its product can turn out to be more stable and streamlined as it fosters a musicality and pace for its production flow.

On the off chance that the company keeps on increasing production, it will arrive at the part of the curve where diseconomies of scale become a factor and costs rise. However a company could streamline operations, it could see new layers of bureaucracy and management presented, which can slow overall production and decision making. The more the operation develops at this stage, the costs will rise as the operation loses productivity.

## Illustration of Long-Run Average Total Cost

For instance, in the video game industry, the costs to create a game are high. In any case, the cost of making duplicates of a game, once delivered, is marginal. Thus, when a company can set up a good foundation for itself, grow the customer base for a specific game, and raise demand for that game, the extra output required to fulfill that need brings down overall cost over the long haul.

## Highlights
- LRATC measures the average cost per unit of output long term.
- In long-term time spans, companies have greater flexibility to change their operations.
