# UTXO Model
## What Is the UTXO Model?

An unspent transaction output (UTXO) is the technical term for the amount of digital [currency](/currency) that remaining parts after a cryptocurrency transaction. You can think of it as the change you receive subsequent to buying a thing, yet it's anything but a lower denomination of the currency — it is a transaction output in the database created by the network to consider non-careful change transactions.

The portion of the whole cryptocurrency not spent in a transaction is utilized as an accounting measure. Like twofold section accounting, every transaction has an input and output.

For instance, envision that 1 BTC is a bucket full of coins. Each coin addresses an UTXO. Assuming you purchase something from Bob for .5 BTC, the network will provide Bob with the whole bucket of coins and send back the .5 BTC you're not kidding "change." You presently have an UTXO worth .5 BTC that can't be separated into smaller amounts.

## Understanding the UTXO Model

UTXO is a protocol for distributing the pieces of data that cryptocurrency is produced using and can be challenging to initially comprehend. A cryptocurrency network or designer sees UTXO in a vastly different manner than an everyday cryptocurrency client does.

### What the Network Sees

A cryptocurrency transaction is a transfer of data inside a database. Cryptocurrency is separated into small lumps, which are stored all through the whole database and called unspent transaction outputs. Virtually all transactions make UTXO on the grounds that most are not in additions of whole numbers.

This means spending doesn't happen utilizing a single data byte. All things being equal, various parts of cryptocurrency are recovered to satisfy a spending request.

> UTXOs are not cryptocurrency denominations, as satoshi for Bitcoin (BTC) or gwei for ether (ETH); be that as it may, UTXOs can be measured in these denominations.

At the point when you start a transaction through your wallet, UTXOs with your data are found, unlocked, and the new proprietor's data is associated with the UTXO you transferred to them. They are locked by and by, and that client can involve them in transactions by means of a similar cycle.

As transactions proceed, the database becomes populated with records of ownership changes. The outputs are parts of cryptocurrency you shipped off somebody that aren't spent. They are recorded into the database as inputs in parts of cryptocurrency.

### What a User Sees

At the point when you choose to spend your Bitcoin, you just see the amount you've spent deducted and the amount extra in your wallet. As far as you might be concerned, it's like utilizing a $1 bill on a $.50 thing — you're given change, you put it in your pocket and approach your day.

## Objectives of the UTXO Model

The UTXO model is utilized in numerous digital currencies since it permits users to follow ownership of all portions of that cryptocurrency. Since digital currencies were made in view of secrecy, UTXOs are associated with the public locations apparent to the whole network.

Users can't be recognized from their ownership — except if they publicize their location — yet the model takes into consideration transparency through the addresses.

### Destructions of the UTXO Model

The bounty of small coins inside a cryptocurrency's network makes certain transactions uneconomic. This is on the grounds that it might cost more to execute than the genuine cost of the product being purchased with cryptocurrency. For instance, it doesn't seem OK to buy a $2 cup of coffee if the transaction [fee](/fee) on bitcoin's network is greater than the price of the coffee.

## Features
- At the point when a transaction is completed, any unspent outputs are recorded into a database as inputs that can be utilized later for another transaction.
- UTXOs are handled persistently and are part of the beginning and end of every transaction.
- An UTXO is the amount of digital currency staying after a cryptocurrency transaction is executed.
## FAQ
### What Is UTXO in Blockchain?
UTXOs are small, unspent pieces of cryptocurrency extra from transactions in certain digital currencies. They are kept in the UTXO database and utilized in later transactions.
### Is Ethereum an UTXO?
Ethereum is a cryptocurrency, so it's anything but an UTXO. Moreover, Ethereum utilizes an account-based approach with account balances, so there are no UTXOs in the Ethereum Virtual Machine.
### Is Bitcoin an UTXO?
