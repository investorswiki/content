# Open Market Operations (OMO)
  Open market operations are how the Fed keeps the fed funds rate close to the target set by the Federal Open Market Committee. The fed funds rate is the rate at which banks loan to one another overnight, and the Fed keeps it on target by supplying as much liquidity as there is demand for at the target rate. In the event that the Fed failed to supply sufficient liquidity, the fed funds rate - - the cost of money - - would rise as the supply fell. Alternately, on the off chance that the Fed supplied too much liquidity, the fed funds rate would fall as supply surpassed demand.
The open market operations by which the Fed supplies liquidity to the banking system are purchases from and sales to dealers of Treasury and other debt securities. It works along these lines: When the Fed buys securities from a dealer, the dealer's bank see its reserves increase by the amount the Fed paid for the securities.
Open market operations are either permanent or transitory. The Fed buys or sells securities on a permanent, or outright, basis, when its figures demonstrate that the amount of liquidity in the banking system will keep on requiring adjustment. It buys or sells them on a brief basis when a shortage or excess of liquidity in the system is considered short-lived.
An outright purchase of Treasury notes or bonds by the Fed is called a coupon pass. An impermanent purchase is called a repurchase agreement, since the dealers consent to buy the securities back from the Fed on a certain date. Permanent and impermanent sales of securities by the Fed to dealers are considerably less common than purchases.
Open market operations are conducted by the Fed's Domestic Trading Desk (a.k.a. the Open Market Desk) at the New York Fed.

It has been one of the tools utilized by the Federal Reserve to carry out monetary policy and influence the American economy.

The Fed can increase the money supply and lower the market interest rate by purchasing securities utilizing recently made money. Likewise, the central bank can sell securities from its balance sheet and remove money from circulation, accordingly forcing market interest rates to rise.
### How Does the Federal Funds Rate Affect Banks?
By law, commercial banks must keep a reserve equivalent to a certain percentage of their deposits in an account at a Federal Reserve bank. Any money in their reserve that surpasses the required level is accessible for lending to different banks that could have a shortfall. The interest rate the lending bank can charge for these loans is called the federal funds rate, or fed funds rate. Banks frequently base their interest rates for consumer or business loans on the federal funds rate.
