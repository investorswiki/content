Enrollment statements that the Securities and Exchange Commission ([SEC](/sec)) expects for new securities have implicit or explicit language that prospective investors will accept capital risk by buying the securities.

For instance, Axovant Sciences Ltd's. 10-K for the fiscal year 2017 contains 36 pages of risk revelations. (Pfizer Inc., paradoxically, carried just 11 pages of risk factors in its 10-K for the fiscal year 2016.) When Axovant documented its 10-K on June 13, 2017, the stock closed at $22.51 per share. On the last trading day of 2017, the stock closed at $5.27.
