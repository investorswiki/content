# Tax Bracket
## What is a tax bracket?
The tax rate applied to major league salary earners is greater than that applied to the individuals who earn less. The method used to deal with the increase in taxes is using tax brackets. For instance, a single person earning more than $418,400 each year is set in the highest tax bracket and pays 39.6 percent tax on all income above $418,400, while somebody earning somewhat less will be in the 35 percent tax bracket.
## More profound definition
In a progressive tax scheme, a taxpayer's tax liability increases the more the person earns. The increase in the tax rate isn't linear, and the IRS sets certain income bands to which a fixed marginal rate of tax applies. These are known as tax brackets. There are four major tax categories:
- Single records.
- Married and filing jointly.
- Married and filing separately.
- Head of household.

Every taxpayer falls into one of these categories, contingent upon their conditions.
Inside each schedule, there are a number of tax brackets. At the point when somebody falls in a specific tax bracket, say at 25 percent, it's enticing to think that all income is taxed at 25 percent. This isn't the case:
- All income up to $9,325 is taxed at 10 percent.
- Income above $9,325 and below $37,950 is taxed at 15 percent.
- Income above $37,951 and under $91,900 is taxed at 25 percent.

Thusly, the average tax rate is lower than the marginal rate of the tax bracket that the taxpayer falls into.
