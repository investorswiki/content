# Net Unrealized Appreciation (NUA)
## What Is Net Unrealized Appreciation?

A few companies offer the benefit of employees possessing stock in the employer company. The thought is that this makes an ownership mentality in the employees, even assuming that they own a tiny percentage of total shares. The net unrealized appreciation (NUA) is the difference in value between the average cost basis of shares of employer stock and the current market value of the shares. The NUA is important in the event that you are distributing exceptionally valued employer stock from your [tax-deferred](/taxdeferred) employer-sponsored retirement plan, for example, a [401(k)](/401kplan).

## Figuring out Net Unrealized Appreciation (NUA)

Commonly, distributions from tax-deferred retirement accounts are treated as [ordinary income](/ordinaryincome) at the hour of distribution. Ordinary income is taxed at a higher rate than long-term [capital gains](/capitalgain). To cure this issue, the [Internal Revenue Service (IRS)](/irs) offers an election for the NUA of employer stock to be taxed at the more great capital gains rate.

The NUA election is just accessible when the stock is put into a tax-deferred account, for example, a 401(k) or traditional [IRA](/ira), and is simply applicable to the stock of the company for which you are or alternately were employed. [Roth IRAs](/rothira) don't fit the bill for NUA on the grounds that they are not tax-deferred, and brokerage accounts don't meet all requirements for NUA in light of the fact that they are generally currently subject to the [capital gains tax](/capital_gains_tax).

## Advantages and Disadvantages of Net Unrealized Appreciation (NUA)

Distributing stock out of a 401(k) will contrastingly affect NUA funds, per IRS rules and regulations. While the IRS will tax most of a 401(k) portfolio at its market value as ordinary income, shares of the employer stock might be taxed as ordinary income on the [cost basis](/costbasis). The cost basis is the original value of the employer stock. This means that any extra value acquired since the stock was initially purchased isn't taxed as ordinary income, and it will rather be taxed as capital gains. After selling the company stock, the NUA will be subject to the capital gains tax, which might be decisively lower than your current income tax rate.

In any case, the downside is that ordinary income tax must be paid on the cost basis of the employer stock right away. The compromise is that ordinary income taxes could never have been due until you sold the shares from now on, years or a long time from now. In light of this compromise, it is best to just appropriate the most reduced cost basis shares under the NUA rules to improve the tax results.

## Requirements for Net Unrealized Appreciation

There are extra requirements that must be met as part of the NUA rules. In somewhere around one year, you must disseminate the entirety of the vested balance held in the plan, including all assets from each of the accounts sponsored by a similar employer. Certain qualifying events must likewise be met. You must have either separated from the company, arrived at the base retirement age for distribution, experienced an injury bringing about total disability, or you must have kicked the bucket.

## Features
- The IRS offers a provision that considers an additional good capital gains tax rate on the NUA of employer stock upon distribution, after certain qualifying events.
- The downside is that ordinary income tax must be paid promptly on the cost basis of the shares of employer stock.
- Net unrealized appreciation (NUA) is the difference between the original cost basis and current market value of shares of employer stock.
