# Bill of Materials (BOM)
## What Is a Bill of Materials (BOM)?

A bill of materials (BOM) is a broad rundown of [raw materials](/rawmaterials), parts, and directions required to develop, production, or repair a product or service. A bill of materials normally shows up in a hierarchical configuration, with the highest level displaying the completed product and the base level appearance individual parts and materials.

There are various types of bills of materials specific to engineering utilized in the design cycle; they're likewise specific to the manufacturing utilized in the assembly cycle.

## Figuring out a Bill of Materials (BOM)

A bill of materials (BOM) is a centralized source of data used to make a product. It is a rundown of the things expected to make a product as well as the directions on the best way to collect that product. Manufacturers that build products start the assembly interaction by making a BOM.

Making an accurate bill of materials (BOM) is fundamental since it guarantees that parts are accessible when required as well as guaranteeing that the assembly interaction is pretty much as efficient as could really be expected. On the off chance that the BOM isn't accurate, it can make production halt, which increments [operating costs](/operating-cost), as time is expected to find missing parts, begin another production order, or until the right course of not entirely settled.

The various types of bills of materials (BOMs) rely upon the type of project and the business needs. Common areas that use BOMs are engineering, design, operations, manufacturing, and the sky is the limit from there. A manufacturing BOM is essential in designing [enterprise resource planning](/erp) (ERP) systems and [materials requirement planning](/mrp) (MRP).

Things remembered for a BOM are the part number, part name, quantity, unit of measurement, assembly references, method of parts construction, and extra notes.

## Bills of Materials (BOMs) Displays

A BOM displays its data in one of two ways: a blast display or a collapse display. A bill of materials (BOM) blast displays an assembly at the highest level broken down into its individual parts and parts at the most minimal level, while a BOM collapse displays the linkage of individual parts at the lower level to an assembly at the higher level.

For instance, a computer is detonated into hard drives, computer chips, random access memory boards, and processors. Every processor is detonated into an arithmetic unit, a control unit, and a register. The requirements for the arithmetic unit, control unit, and register are collapsed into the requirements for the processor, which are collapsed into the requirements for the whole computer.

## Types of Bills of Materials (BOMs)

A BOM list is vital while building a product and ordering replacement parts, and diminishes potential issues on the off chance that product repairs are required. It assists with planning for acquisition orders and lessens the possibility of errors. The two fundamental types of BOMs are engineering BOMs and manufacturing BOMs.

An engineering bill of materials characterizes the design of the completed product. It incorporates all alternative and [substitute](/substitute) part numbers and parts contained in the drawing notes. Each line of the bill of materials (BOM) incorporates the product code, part name, part number, part update, description, quantity, unit of measure, size, length, weight, and specifications or elements of the product.

The engineering BOM is frequently organized by engineers in view of a computer-supported design (CAD) drawing. For a completed product, there might be more than one engineering BOM made. This is a part of [product lifecycle management](/product-life-cycle-management).

A manufacturing bill of materials (BOM) involves every one of the gatherings and parts required to develop a completed thing ready to be transported. It likewise consolidates the bundling materials required to send the product to the customer. It contains processes that require execution on the product prior to completion and stores all the data required for [manufacturing activities](/manufacturing-production).

## Features
- Bills of materials (BOMs) can be introduced as a blast display or a collapse display.
- The two principal types of bills of materials (BOMs) are manufacturing bills of materials (BOMs) and engineering bills of materials (BOMs).
- A bill of materials (BOM) is a centralized source of data containing a rundown of things used to make a product and the directions on the most proficient method to do as such.
- Frequently displayed in a hierarchical manner, a bill of materials (BOM) records the completed product at the top, down to individual parts and materials.
