## What Is a Quota Share Treaty?

A quota share treaty is a pro-rata [reinsurance](/reinsurance) contract in which the insurer and reinsurer share premiums and losses as per a fixed percentage. Quota share reinsurance permits an insurer to hold a few risk and premium while sharing the rest with an insurer up to a foreordained maximum coverage. Overall, it's a way for an insurer to lift and protect a portion of its capital.

## Understanding Quota Share Treaties

At the point when an insurance company endorses another policy, the policyholder pays it a premium. In exchange, it consents to repay the policyholder up to the coverage limit. The more policies that an insurer guarantees, the more its [liabilities](/risk) will develop, and sooner or later, it will run out of capacity to endorse any new policies.

To free up capacity, the insurer can surrender a portion of its liabilities to a reinsurer through a reinsurance treaty. In exchange for taking on an insurer's liabilities, the reinsurer gets a portion of the policy premiums.

A quota share treaty is a reinsurance agreement where the insurer surrenders a portion of its risks and premiums up to a maximum dollar limit. Losses over this limit are the insurer's responsibility, however the insurer can utilize an excess of loss reinsurance agreement to cover losses that surpass the maximum per policy coverage.

Some quota share deals likewise incorporate per-occurrence limits that confine the amount of losses a reinsurer will share on a for each occurrence basis. Insurers are less ready to acknowledge this type of agreement since it can lead to a situation in which the insurer is responsible for the majority of the losses from a particular occurrence of a peril, like a catastrophic flood.
