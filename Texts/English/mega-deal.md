## What Is a Mega-Deal?

A mega-deal is a large and costly transaction between two corporations, frequently including a merger of the two or the acquisition of one by the other. The term was imagined by the business media to depict such a transaction. It comes from the Greek **megas,** signifying "fantastic."

In spite of the fact that mergers and acquisitions are genuinely common events in modern business, the most frightening mega-deals include at least one large and notable brand names. A mega-deal is big news as a result of its immediate interest to investors and, as a rule, its impact on consumers down the road.

The acquisition of Sprint USA by T-Mobile for $26 billion, which was finished in 2020, is an illustration of a mega-deal. The historic (and eventually sad) merger of AOL and Time Warner in 2000 is another model.

## Why Make a Mega-Deal?

From the start, mega-deals can in some cases appear to be odd. For instance, the retail drug store chain CVS bought the health care coverage goliath Aetna for about $70 billion in a mega-deal that closed in late 2018. The two drug stores and insurance companies are in the wellbeing business yet different collaborations are not immediately self-evident.

SilverScript, a major Medicare Part D plan sponsor, was at that point a unit of CVS. All the company made sense of in a press release that it planned to coordinate extra wellbeing services in its store areas. It would have liked to make medical services nearby and accessible, improve on how consumers access medical care, and lower costs.

A mega-deal might permit a company to extend its customer base, dispense with a contender, or get significant assets. It is many times a method for adding a complementary product or business line. It is much of the time refered to by the companies required as a method for smoothing out operations by consolidating administrative departments and other overhead costs.
