# Rollover Risk
## What Is Rollover Risk?

Rollover risk is a risk associated with the refinancing of [debt](/debt). Rollover risk is generally looked by countries and companies when a loan or other debt obligation (like a bond) is going to mature and should be changed over, or rolled over, into new debt. In the event that interest rates have increased meanwhile, they would need to [refinance](/refinance) their debt at a higher rate and cause more interest charges from now on — or, in case of a bond issue, pay out more in interest.

## How Rollover Risk Works

Rollover risk likewise exists in derivatives, where futures or options contracts must be "rolled" over to later maturities as close term contracts lapse to preserve one's market position. On the off chance that this interaction will cause a cost or lose money it represents a risk.

Specifically, it alludes to the possibility that a hedge position will terminate at a loss, requiring a cash payment while the lapsing hedge is supplanted with another one. At the end of the day, if a trader needs to hold a futures contract until its maturity and afterward supplant it with a new, comparative contract, they run the risk of the new contract costing more than the old — paying a premium to expand the position.

## Rollover Risk versus Refinancing Risk

Otherwise called "roll risk," rollover risk is now and again utilized conversely with [refinancing risk](/refinancing_risk). Notwithstanding, it's to a greater extent a sub-classification of that. Refinancing risk is a more broad term, alluding to the possibility of a borrower being not able to supplant an existing loan with another one. Rollover risk manages the adverse effect of rolling over or refinancing debt.

This effect has more to do with winning economic conditions — explicitly, interest rate trends and the [liquidity](/liquidity) of credit — than the financial condition of the borrower. For instance, if the U.S. had $1 trillion dollars of debt it expected to roll over in the next year, and interest rates unexpectedly increased 2% higher before the new debt was issued, it would cost the government significantly more in new interest payments.

The state of the economy is additionally critical. Lenders are frequently reluctant to recharge lapsing loans during a financial crisis, when collateral values drop, particularly in the event that they are short-term loans — that is, their excess maturity is short of what one year.

So alongside the economy, the idea of the debt can matter, as per a 2012 article "Rollover Risk and Credit Risk," distributed in **The Journal of Finance:**

>
> Debt maturity assumes an important part in determining the firm's rollover risk. While shorter maturity for an individual bond decreases its risk, shorter maturity for all bonds issued by a firm compounds its rollover risk by compelling its equity holders to rapidly retain losses incurred by its debt financing.
