# Harvard MBA Indicator
## What Is the Harvard MBA Indicator?

The Harvard MBA Indicator is a [contrarian](/contrarian) long-term stock market indicator that assesses the percentage of Harvard Business School [MBA](/mba) graduates that acknowledge "market sensitive" positions. Market sensitive positions exist in fields, for example, investment banking, securities sales and exchanging, private equity, venture capital, and leveraged buyouts.

In the event that over 30% of a year's graduating class take occupations in these areas, the Harvard MBA Indicator is said to produce a sell signal for stocks. On the other hand, if under 10% of graduates take occupations in this sector, it addresses a long-term buy signal for stocks. In the middle between can be viewed as "impartial".

## Grasping the Harvard MBA Indicator

Begun and kept up with in 2001 by investment consultant and Harvard Business School graduate Roy Soifer, who received his MBA there in 1965. The Harvard MBA Indicator gave sell signals in 1987 and in 2000, which were both awful years for the stock market. The esoteric indicator is intended to address long-term signals in view of the relative engaging quality of Wall Street occupations. The more graduates that are tempted to go there, the more swollen Wall Street becomes and the more probable the market is approaching a top. At the point when stock markets are doing inadequately, less graduates need to enter the sector.

This indicator is contrarian in that it depends on a comparable subject to the old market saying that "when every other person is hoping to get in, now is the ideal time to get out". All in all, grouping behavior can be indicative of a reversal.

## Performance of the Harvard MBA Indicator

As per Soifer, the Harvard MBA Indicator produces undeniably more sell signals than buy signals. The last time it arrived at the 10% long-term "Buy" level was back in 1982, proclaiming what ended up being a historic bull market. Soifer weites, "supposedly, the record low was reached in 1937, when just three MBAs, around 1%, went into Wall Street. It was a great chance to buy." The record high of 41% happened in 2008, right before the stock market slumped during the 2008-09 financial crisis leading to the Great Recession.

Soifer calls his index a "fairly esoteric yet in any case generally exact" long-term indicator of the heading of the stock market.

## Highlights
- It is a contrarian indicator, where in the event that over 30% take such positions it is a sell signal, and if less than 10% do it is a buy signal.
- The Harvard MBA Indicator generally delivers more sell than buy signals, and accurately anticipated the 1987, 2000, and 2008 bear markets in stocks.
- The Harvard MBA Indicator creates long-term market signals in light of the extent of new Harvard MBA's who take occupations in the securities markets.
