# Trilemma
## What Is a Trilemma?

Trilemma is a term in economic dynamic theory. Not at all like a dilemma, which has two arrangements, a trilemma offers three equivalent answers for a complex problem. A trilemma recommends that countries have three options from which to pick while settling on fundamental conclusions about dealing with their international monetary policy agreements. Notwithstanding, the options of the trilemma are conflictual in light of mutual restrictiveness, which makes just a single option of the trilemma reachable at a given time.

Trilemma frequently is inseparable from the "inconceivable trinity," likewise called the Mundell-Fleming trilemma. This theory uncovered the flimsiness inherent in utilizing the three primary options accessible to a country while laying out and monitoring its international monetary policy agreements.

## Trilemma Explained

While settling on fundamental conclusions about overseeing international monetary policy, a trilemma proposes that countries have three potential options from which to pick. As per the Mundell-Fleming trilemma model, these options include:

1. Setting a fixed currency [exchange rate](/exchangerate)
1. Permitting capital to flow freely with no fixed currency exchange rate agreement
1. Autonomous monetary policy
<!--FFDEB66CFEDB6C6591CEE598B07E3AB5-->
The details of every option conflict due to mutual selectiveness. Thusly, mutual selectiveness makes just a single side of the trilemma triangle reachable at a given time.

- **Side A**: A country can decide to fix exchange rates with at least one countries and have a free flow of capital with others. Assuming it picks this scenario, free monetary policy isn't reachable in light of the fact that interest rate changes would make currency arbitrage focusing on the currency pegs and making them break.
- **Side B**: The country can decide to have a free flow of capital among every foreign country and furthermore have an autonomous monetary policy. Fixed exchange rates among all nations and the free flow of capital are mutually exclusive. Subsequently, only each can be picked in turn. Thus, in the event that there is a free flow of capital among all nations, there can't be fixed exchange rates.
- **Side C**: If a country picks fixed exchange rates and free monetary policy it can't have a free flow of capital. Once more, in this occurrence, fixed exchange rates and the free flow of capital are mutually exclusive.

## Government Considerations

The test for a government's international monetary policy comes in picking which of these options to seek after and how to oversee them. Generally, most countries favor side B of the triangle since they can partake in the freedom of autonomous monetary policy and permit the policy to assist with directing the flow of capital.

## Scholastic Influences

The theory of the policy trilemma is habitually credited to the economists [Robert Mundell](/ideal currency-area) and Marcus Fleming, who freely depicted the relationships among exchange rates, capital flows, and monetary policy during the 1960s. Maurice Obstfeld, who became chief economist at the [International Monetary Fund (IMF)](/imf) in 2015, introduced the model they developed as a "trilemma" in a 1997 paper.

The French economist H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Rey contended that the trilemma isn't quite as simple as it shows up. In the modern day, Rey accepts that the majority of countries are confronted with just two options, or a dilemma, since fixed currency pegs are not normally effective, leading to an emphasis on the relationship between autonomous monetary policy and free capital flow.

## Real World Example

A real-world instance of tackling these compromises happens in the [eurozone](/eurozone), where countries are closely interconnected. By framing the eurozone and utilizing one currency, the countries have at last settled on side An of the triangle, keeping a single currency (in effect a balanced peg combined with the free capital flow).

Following World War II, the well off decided on side C under the [Bretton Woods Agreement](/brettonwoodsagreement), which pegged currencies to the U.S. dollar however permitted countries to set their own interest rates. Cross-border capital flows were little to the point that this system held for years and years â€” the exception being Mundell's native Canada, where he acquired special understanding into the strains inherent in the Bretton Woods system.

## Features
- Be that as it may, just a single option of the trilemma is reachable at a given time, as the three options of the trilemma are mutually exclusive.
- The trilemma is an economic theory, which posits that countries might browse three options while arriving at fundamental conclusions about their international monetary policy agreements.
- Today, most countries favor free flow of capital and autonomous monetary policy.
