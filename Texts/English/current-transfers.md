# Current Transfers
## What Are Current Transfers?

Current transfers are [current account](/currentaccount) transactions in which a resident entity in one nation provides a non-resident entity with a [economic value](/economic-value), like a real resource or financial thing, without getting something of economic value in exchange.

## Grasping Current Transfers

Current transfers are transactions where the originator doesn't receive a "[quid pro quo](/quidproquo)" consequently; this shortfall of economic value on one side is addressed in the [balance of payments](/bop) by one-sided transactions called transfers.

Current transfers influence the current account and are separate and distinct from capital transfers, which are remembered for the capital and [financial account](/financial-account). Current transfers incorporate workers' [remittances](/remittance), donations, tax payments, foreign aid, and awards.

Current transfers incorporate all transfers that don't have the accompanying qualities of capital transfers:

1. Transfers of ownership of [fixed assets](/fixedasset)
1. Transfers of funds linked to acquisition or disposal of fixed assets
1. Forgiveness by [creditors](/bank) of liabilities with next to no partners being received in kind

## Types of Current Transfers

The two fundamental types of current transfers are general government and different sectors.

General government transfers incorporate the accompanying:

- Transfers in cash or kind backed by international cooperation between governments of various economies, or between a government and an international association
- Cash transfers between governments for financing current expenditures by the beneficiary government
- Gifts of food, clothing, medical aid, and so forth as relief efforts after a natural disaster
- Gifts of certain military hardware
- Current taxes on income and wealth, and different transfers, for example, [social security](/socialsecurity) contributions

Other sector transfers include:

- Workers' remittances by transients (someone who stays in one more nation for) a thought about over a year residents of different countries
- Transfers in cash and kind for disaster relief
- Standard contributions to charitable, strict, logical, and social associations
- Premiums and claims for non-extra security

The [International Monetary Fund's](/imf) (IMF) **Balance of Payments Manual** generally sets the terms of accounting for current transfers. While current transfers are gathered separately from goods, services, and income yet to be determined of payments due to their one-sided nature, the distinction between a transfer and an ordinary transaction isn't clear 100% of the time.

For instance, remittances from overseas workers are classified by the beneficiary nation either as current transfers or as "remuneration of employees," contingent upon the length of stay of these workers in the foreign countries where they are working. As another model, a remittance from a resident of one nation to finance another resident who is remaining abroad briefly isn't recorded as a transfer, since it is viewed as a transaction between residents of a similar country.

## Features
- There is no quid pro quo between the two gatherings associated with the transfer.
- Current transfers are one-sided transaction transfers described by a resident entity in one nation providing a non-resident entity with an economic value.
- Accounting for current transfers isn't generally clear in balance of payments in view of their one-sided nature.
- The two principal types of current transfers are general government transfers, which are led between governments of two countries, and other sector transfers, like those including worker remittances or premiums associated with non-life protections.
