## What Is a Catalyst?

A catalyst in equity markets is an event or other news that pushes the price of a stock decisively up or down. For instance, a catalyst could be an earnings report, analyst update, new product announcement, legislative changes, lawsuits, [mergers and acquisitions](/mergersandacquisitions) (M&A), or inclusion from a [activist investor](/activist-investor).

## Grasping Catalysts

In the financial media, a catalyst is anything that hastens a radical change in a stock's current price trend. It tends to be negative news that clatters investors and breaks up momentum or uplifting news that pushes the stock up.

Investors will assign various levels of significance to catalysts, contingent upon their market philosophy. Value investors will generally put less accentuation on catalysts and search rather for operational productivity, objective situated management, reasonable valuation, and a strong market position.

For these investors, catalysts are unexpected, yet wonderful treats — expecting they were right in their assessment of a company — either giving an opportunity to build up a position efficiently (on account of falling prices) or understanding the value they'd seen from the start (on account of rising prices).

Pure [momentum investors](/momentum_investing), in the interim, will observe carefully for catalysts, or their effects on prices, attempting to be quick to perceive the truth about them. In reality, barely any investors are totally one type or the other yet fall some place along the value-momentum range.

## Special Considerations

An investor could focus essentially on a company's [fundamentals](/fundamentals), yet recognize that a catalyst will be important to understand that value. They could give huge idea to what that catalyst may be, keeping their ear to the ground with regards to new products and the state of markets where the company works.

Simultaneously, the bulk of momentum investors will have some feeling of what companies may be undervalued or that exist off the mainstream market's radar. They will gather a watch list and foster a feeling of what news could spark price developments, instead of being failed catalysts.

## Catalyst Example

Kohl's (KSS), which has been the target of activist investors over the last several years, received a buyout offer from activist hedge fund Starboard Value for $64 per share on Jan. 21, 2022. Shares bounced 37% the next trading day. This comes after Engine Capital and Macellum Advisors had taken stakes in previous months and pushed the company to think about a sale. The stock's price has seen sharp single-day increments over the past year on new activist investor announcements and letter releases.
