# Stop Payment
## What Is a Stop Payment?

A stop payment is a conventional request made to a [financial institution](/financialinstitution) to cancel a [check](/check) or payment that has not yet been handled. A stop payment order is issued by the account holder and must be sanctioned in the event that the check or payment has not as of now been handled by the beneficiary.

Giving a stop payment order frequently costs the bank account holder a fee (generally $30 in spite of the fact that bank policies vary), which is demanded by the institution. There are several reasons that a stop payment order might be requested. For instance, the account holder might have sent a check for some unacceptable amount or may have canceled a purchase subsequent to having put the check in the mail. Sporadically, in the event that the stop payment isn't requested in time as well as erroneously, the financial institution can not halt the cycle.

## How a Stop Payment Works

To request a stop payment, an account holder generally gives specific data about a check that is in progress to the bank — e.g., check # 607 for $250 written to John's Cleaning Agency. In an ideal scenario, the bank would then flag the check and keep it from clearing the account.

In the event that a bank is unable to find the check, it will frequently keep on searching for the check for a considerable length of time, in spite of the fact that policies vary among banks. A banks offer the opportunity to expand or revive the stop payment, by means of a verbal or written request.

## Special Considerations

As well as giving individual stop payments, extra measures for getting checks and [personal finance](/personalfinance) data all the more generally are becoming mainstream. This protection is important assuming an account holder is worried about mistake or [fraud](/fraud).

One method that has been refreshed after some time is the expansion of a lock feature on personal checks. The Washington-D.C.- based Check Payment Systems Association (formerly Financial Stationers Association) made the lock feature as check fraud became pre-2000. The latch feature completed a magistrate of features, incorporated into a check, to add complexity and make it more provoking for fraudsters to imitate it.

Online banking, which is presently utilized by all major banks like Bank of America, TD Bank, Citibank, Chase Bank, is intended to work on the proficiency of storing, transferring, and pulling out funds, alongside balance-checking and other, somewhat simple personal finance tasks. With individual financial data presently stored online — the potential for secure encryption is high — alongside the ability of [cyber-criminals](/network safety) to take data. Regardless of such dangers, many have decided to bank completely online. Along these lines, giving stop payments, among different tasks, become more efficient.
