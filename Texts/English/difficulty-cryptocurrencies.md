# Cryptocurrency Difficulty
## What Is Cryptocurrency Difficulty?

Cryptocurrency difficulty is a measure of the fact that it is so hard to mine a block in a [blockchain](/blockchain) for a specific [cryptocurrency](/cryptocurrency). A high cryptocurrency difficulty means it takes extra computing power to check transactions entered on a blockchain — an interaction called [mining](/bitcoin-mining).

Cryptocurrency difficulty is a boundary that [bitcoin](/bitcoin) and other digital forms of money use to keep the average time between blocks consistent as the network's hash power changes. Cryptocurrency difficulty is important since a high difficulty can help secure the blockchain network against malicious attacks.

## Figuring out Cryptocurrency Difficulty

Bitcoin and other cryptographic forms of money that utilization [proof-of-work](/evidence work) blockchains are kept up with through the most common way of mining. Miners check transactions that are done on a blockchain and perform the duties of auditors to forestall fraud and guarantee the authenticity of the transactions. Mining was brought about by bitcoin's organizer, [Satoshi Nakamoto](/satoshi-nakamoto).

In this system, miners — who run the cryptocurrency's software on their PCs — contend to track down another block, adding the latest batch of transaction data to the chain. At the point when enough transactions have been checked, another block is added to the blockchain. Miners might get compensated a fee for their efforts however there are different requirements before a miner can receive compensation if any whatsoever. The degree of the computing power expected to mine a block is addressed by cryptocurrency difficulty. The time it takes to find another block is subject to the level of cryptocurrency difficulty and random chance.

To measure the cryptocurrency difficulty of another block, it's important to comprehend hash power, which addresses the combined computational power being utilized to mine and interaction the transactions on the blockchain.

### Random Hashes

A hash is an alphanumeric code that is utilized to address words or data. Miners take a batch of transaction data and run it through a [hash algorithm](/hash), that's what a one-way function — given a specific set of data — will always create a similar output, yet whose output can't be switched to show the original data. Hashing algorithms are utilized to make these random hash codes. Before new data can be added to a blockchain, miners must contend to create a hash that is lower or equivalent to a numeric value called a [target hash](/target-hash).

Miners achieve the hashing system by changing a single value, called a [nonce](/nonce) — or a number utilized once — and each time the nonce is changed, another hash is made with its own set of numbers. There is absolutely not a chance of foreseeing what a hash will be and since each set of data has just a single output for a given hash function, miners must repeat the most common way of adding another nonce to the data until they meet the hash requirement.

### Cryptocurrency Difficulty

The requirement a hash must meet relates to the difficulty. A substantial hash must be below a certain target value set naturally (and occasionally adjusted) by the cryptocurrency's convention. The lower the target value, the more redundancies of the hash function a miner must go through to obtain an acceptable outcome — as such, the higher the difficulty. A miner can, in theory, luck out and get a substantial hash for a given block on the primary try. In any case, over the long haul, higher difficulty means that miners must attachment through additional nonces per block on average.

People and organizations contribute their computational power through their mining apparatuses to deal with the data and produce the hashes. The hash power of a cryptocurrency network addresses the total hash rates of all the mining rigs. The hash rate is the number of hashes that can be calculated each second.

Since each hash is made randomly, it can speculate a huge number of surmises or hashes before the target hash requirement is met and new cryptocurrency coins are printed to the fruitful miner. Really at that time are the transactions added to another block inside the blockchain. As it were, the hashing system is like a lottery system. Thus, new coins are issued through this mining system.

> The higher the hash rate, the more troublesome it is for a fraudster to gain control of the blockchain since seriously hashing power is required. As such, the higher the difficulty, the safer the network.

## Benefits of Cryptocurrency Difficulty

One could ask why a network's participants would lay out a higher cryptocurrency difficulty on the off chance that the outcome implied miners repeating a similar function again and again. There are two key benefits to cryptocurrency difficulty.

### A Steady Rate of New Blocks

The bitcoin whitepaper by Satoshi Nakamoto makes sense of how the evidence of-work difficulty assists with creating a consistent production of new blocks added to the blockchain.

> "To make up for speeding up and fluctuating interest in running hubs over the long haul, the confirmation of-work not entirely settled by a moving average targeting an average number of blocks each hour. Assuming they're generated too fast, the difficulty increments."

Bitcoin is intended to add another block to the blockchain like clockwork on average. Other digital currencies aim for additional successive blocks; [litecoin](/litecoin), for instance, aims for 2.5 minutes. The issue is that the amount of computing power the network's miners altogether control can fluctuate immensely.

At the point when Satoshi Nakamoto mined the principal block, there was just a single machine on the network — probable a simple PC or work area. Today there are a number of rambling, warehouse-sized ASIC ranches. ASICs are machines planned explicitly to drive through hash functions as fast as could be expected.

To guarantee that the network delivers another block at a consistent average rate, the software is set to consequently change the target hash up or down, which brings about lower or higher difficulty, individually. At the point when Nakamoto mined the genesis block, bitcoin's difficulty was one.

### Network Security

The overall hash rate gives knowledge into a cryptocurrency network's security since fraudsters or troublemakers would have to beat the total hash power of the network to take control in a malicious attack. Extraordinarily planned PCs are utilized to perform hashing functions, which are able to make trillions of surmises each second to take care of the hashing problem.

The higher the cryptocurrency difficulty, the more estimates or hashes are expected to arrive at the target hash requirement. Thus, this interaction makes it undeniably challenging and costly for attackers to gain the majority control — called a [51% majority](/51-attack) — of a blockchain network.

## Illustration of Cryptocurrency Difficulty

As of April 2, 2021, the cryptocurrency difficulty for bitcoin was 23.14 trillion. Assuming we compare the change in difficulty, we can see that on April 1, 2018, bitcoin's difficulty was 3.51 trillion.

The chart below plots bitcoin's change in difficulty throughout the long term:

## Highlights
- Cryptocurrency difficulty is a measure of the fact that it is so hard to mine a block in a blockchain for a specific cryptocurrency.
- A high cryptocurrency difficulty means it takes extra computing power to confirm transactions entered on a blockchain.
- The higher the difficulty expected to make a block further develops a cryptocurrency network's security since attackers would require huge resources to assume command.
