# Equitable Subrogation
## What is Equitable Subrogation

Equitable subrogation is a legal doctrine that permits a party that has made payments for the benefit of one more party to make a case for the recovery of damages or funds from a third-party. Equitable [subrogation](/subrogation) is a legal concept that permits one party to supplant one more party with regards to a legal right. It is generally ordinarily associated with the insurance industry, specifically comparable to the settlement of claims.

Equitable subrogation is considered equitable in light of the fact that one party pays the obligation of another party. The party that pays the obligation is alluded to as the subrogee, and the party that has its obligation paid is called the subrogor.

## Breaking Down Equitable Subrogation

Equitable subrogation is one of the key components of modern insurance contracts and the most common way of claiming and paying out insurance. People and organizations purchase insurance to safeguard themselves from [specific risks](/specificrisk). They pay a premium to the insurer for this protection, with the insurer repaying the insured for the risks covered in the policy. The insurer is responsible for settling claims that are made against the policy. At times, for example, floods, there is probably not going to be a [third party](/third-party) to be held responsible for the damages. In different cases, be that as it may, the damages might be brought about by a third party. In such cases, the insurer will pay the policyholder for the claim, and in return will hold the right to sue the third party â€” except if there is a [waiver of subrogation](/waiver-of-subrogation) provision.

For instance, a homeowner purchases homeowners insurance from an insurance company. The neighbor of the policyholder fails to keep a grip on a fire outside their home, and the fire at last makes damage the policyholder's home. The homeowner documents a claim with their insurance company, and the insurer pays out the claim so the homeowner can fix the property. At the point when the claim is settled, the homeowner surrenders their rights to sue the neighbor over to the insurer, who can then sue the homeowner to recuperate funds lost from paying out the claim.

## Non-Insurance Uses of Equitable Subrogation

In theory, the concept of equitable subrogation can apply to a number of situations including liability, however in practice, it just applies in cases in which one party has set up a [agency relationship](/head agent-relationship) with another party. That means that assuming one party is legally going about as the agent of the subsequent party, that first party could be a subrogee by paying the obligation of a third party to the subsequent party. In practice, in any case, this situation would be bound to go to court, and the third party would be required to straightforwardly pay the subsequent party.
