# Moving Average Chart
## What Is a Moving Average Chart?

A [moving average](/movingaverage) (MA) chart is a tool utilized by technical analysts to follow the price developments of a security. It plots average prices over a defined period of time, with the moving average normally overlaid onto a candlestick or bar chart. The bars or candlesticks show the price data for each time span.

While a ton of information is lost, when the moving average is applied to the chart the price data could be hidden. This way the watcher just sees the smooth moving average and its direction, not the period-by-period price data, which can seem inconsistent.

## What Does a Moving Average Chart Tell You?

MAs enjoy the benefit of smoothing out price data by making a continually refreshed (moving) average price. Generally speaking, moving averages are overlaid on a price chart. This way the trader can see the period-to-period price developments as well as the smoother line of the MA. This average can be adjusted to a trader's preferred time horizon:

- The longer the MA chose (more periods calculated) the more slow that MA will react to price changes. A long-term MA is helpful for demonstrating the longer-term trend.
- A shorter MA (hardly any periods calculated) will react speedier to price changes and is valuable for demonstrating the short-term trend.

The least difficult benefit of smoothed data is its ability to filter out "noise." Noise is the period-to-period price variances that can distract the trader from the master plan or trend.

One more well known utilization of the moving average is the concept of support and resistance. At times, yet not each of the, a security may rise in the wake of dropping to the MA. In this case, the MA is acting as support. This will in general happen when the MA is rising overall. On the off chance that the price rallies up to the MA, and declines subsequent to arriving at it, the MA has acted as resistance. This will in general happen when the MA is moving lower and the price is in a [downtrend](/downtrend).

A few traders like to exclusively zero in on the smoothed data, and disregard short-term price vacillations totally. Subsequent to applying the MA, the price data is hidden, so all they see is the MA and its direction. The downside of this is that MAs are delayed to react to price changes, and that means the price may have an extraordinary move yet the trader may not notice and have the option to react to it till too late.

## Illustration of How to Use a Moving Average Chart

The accompanying chart portraying the historical stock price Facebook Inc. (FB) has two MAs applied to it, a 200-day (orange) and a 21-day (blue).

The 200-day MA shows the overall trend. At the point when the price is over this MA, the overall trend will in general be up. At the point when the price is below it, the price will in general be in a downtrend, since the current price is below the 200-day average price. The 21-period MA shows the short-term trends, catching the smaller price waves.

A trader may possibly wish to buy when the price is above or close to the 200-day MA. Along these lines, the longer-term moving average acts as a [filter](/filterrule), assisting the trader with just trading in the overall trend bearing. The 21-day may assist with determining short-term trading opportunities, for example, getting in or out of trades when the price crosses above or below the 21-day.

## The Difference Between a Moving Average and Volume-Weighted Average Price (VWAP)

A moving average (in view of price) just ganders at price. [VWAP](/vwap) considers price and volume, showing where the vast majority of the trading has occurred. VWAP is frequently involved by informal investors or institutional traders for evaluating whether they overpaid or came up short on for a security.

## Limitations of Using a Moving Average Chart

The moving average calculation takes a gander at averaging historical prices. This average may not give predictive knowledge in terms of where the price is going next. The moving average is a [lagging](/laggingindicator) indicator, meaning it follows price, moving just once the price itself has previously moved.

While the MA may now and again act as support or resistance, the outcomes could be viewed as random, since the price frequently overshoots or neglects to arrive at the MA before bobbing (up or down). Likewise, the price may not respect a MA by any means.

## Features
- Longer-term MAs feature longer-term trend bearing, while shorter-term MAs feature shorter-term trends.
- Moving averages are a lagging indicator, in light of historical data, and are not really predictive.
- Moving averages smooth out the period-to-period price variances, assisting with featuring the overall trend course.
- A moving average chart portrays the average price of a security over a predetermined number periods, displayed as a single line overlaid onto a standard price chart.
