# Rule 144
## What Is Rule 144?

Rule 144 is a regulation upheld by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) that sets the conditions under which [restricted](/restricted-asset), [unregistered](/unregistered-shares), and [control](/controlstock) securities can be sold or resold. Rule 144 gives an exemption from registration requirements to sell the securities through public markets in the event that a number of specific conditions are met. The regulation applies to a wide range of sellers, notwithstanding issuers of securities, underwriters, and dealers.

## Figuring out Rule 144

Rule 144 directs transactions dealing with restricted, unregistered, and control securities. These type of securities are regularly acquired over-the-counter (OTC), through private sales, or comprise a controlling stake in a responsible company. Investors might get restricted securities through private positions or other stock benefit plans offered to a company's employees. The SEC precludes the resale of restricted, unregistered and control securities, except if they are registered with the SEC prior to their sale, or they are exempt from the registration requirements when five specific conditions are met.

## Five Conditions for Resale of Rule 144 Securities

Five conditions must be met for restricted, unregistered and control securities to be sold or resold.

1. To start with, the endorsed [holding period](/holdingperiod) must be met. For a public company, the holding period is six months, and it starts from the date a holder purchased and completely paid for securities. For a company that doesn't need to make filings with the SEC, the holding period is one year. The holding period requirements apply fundamentally to restricted securities, while resale of control securities is subject to the other requirements under Rule 144.
1. Second, there must be adequate current public data accessible to investors about a company, including historical financial statements, data about officers and directors, and a business description.
1. Third, in the event that a selling party is an affiliate of a company, he can't resell over 1% of the total outstanding shares during any three-month period. In the event that a company's stock is listed on a stock exchange, just the greater of 1% of total outstanding shares, or the average of the previous four-week trading volume can be sold. For [over-the-counter](/otc) stocks, just the 1% rule applies.
1. Fourth, all of the normal trading conditions that apply to any trade must be met. Specifically, brokers can't request buy orders, and they are not permitted to receive commissions in excess of their normal rates.
1. At last, the SEC requires an affiliated [seller](/seller) to file a proposed sale notice, in the event that the sale value surpasses $50,000 during any three-month period, or on the other hand in the event that there are in excess of 5,000 shares proposed available to be purchased.

## Other Considerations

On the off chance that the seller isn't associated with the company that issued the shares and has owned the securities for over one year, the seller doesn't need to meet any of the five conditions and can sell the securities without limitations. Likewise, non-affiliated gatherings might sell their securities, in the event that they held them for under a year, however greater than six months, gave the current public data requirement is met.
