# Nonfeasance
## What Is Nonfeasance?

Nonfeasance is a legal concept that alludes to the resolved failure to execute or perform an act or duty required by one's position, office, or law by which that neglect brings about mischief or damage to a person or property. The culprit can be found obligated and subject to indictment.

Nonfeasance contrasts from [malfeasance](/malfeasance), which is a tenaciously unsafe act, or [misfeasance](/misfeasance), which is performing one's duty inaccurately.

## Figuring out Nonfeasance

While nonfeasance — the shortfall of action to assist with forestalling mischief or damage — was not initially subject to the penalty of law, legal changes developed to make it feasible for courts to utilize the term to portray inaction which relegates liability. In certain purviews, nonfeasance conveys firm criminal punishments. At any rate, it can lead to a [notice of termination](/notice-of-termination).

For deliberate inaction to be viewed as nonfeasance, it must meet three criteria. They are:

1. The individual who didn't act was the person who might have been sensibly expected to act;
1. That individual didn't perform the expected action; and
1. Through inaction, that individual hurt.

For instance, in the event that a daycare provider is employed to regulate children and fails to keep a child from moving through on a window edge from which the child falls, the daycare provider could be found at risk for nonfeasance since it was their contracted duty to watch and shield the child from mischief, and they failed to make a move when important.

## Financial Nonfeasance

At the point when a corporate director, real estate agent, financial advisor, or one more individual with a [fiduciary](/fiduciary) duty penetrates that duty through resolved and purposeful inaction, nonfeasance can be said to have occurred. For instance, when a real estate agent acknowledges an earnest money check from a client however fails to deposit that check, making the deal fall through, the realtor may be held at risk for nonfeasance, and not a more serious offense, as long as the funds weren't abused and the agent had no improper motive.

Likewise, a corporate director may be held at risk for nonfeasance on the off chance that they fail to keep an active job in the business and monitor corporate affairs, with the end goal that their inaction really hurts the business.
