# Schedule I Bank
## What Is a Schedule I Bank?

The term Schedule I bank alludes to one of the structures used to classify [financial institutions](/financialinstitution) in Canada. This category is associated with wholly domestic banks. Accordingly, they are neither affiliated with nor are they [subsidiaries](/auxiliary) of foreign institutions. To be classified as a Schedule I [bank](/bank), an institution must take customer deposits.

The Schedule I assignment is part of Canada's Bank Act, which directs all financial institutions in the country. There are 36 domestic or Schedule I banks in Canada, including the country's largest six institutions.

## Understanding Schedule I Banks

The Bank Act was laid out in Canada in 1871 as a method for managing the country's banks and the banking industry. This law is surveyed consistently to address the issues of and changes in Canada's [economy](/economy) and the marketplace. The act covers the type of powers banks have, conventions associated with [incorporation](/incorporate), how they're organized, capital structure, [corporate governance](/corporategovernance), and different issues.

Banks and other financial institutions are classified under three distinct categories — Schedule I, Schedule II, and Schedule III banks. Every category connotes a bank's ownership structure. While the last two are connected with foreign banks, Schedule I banks are domestic institutions that must acknowledge [deposits](/store) from their customers. This means they are not auxiliaries of foreign banks even assuming that there are foreign [shareholders](/shareholder) who own stock.

Canada's major chartered banks are remembered for the rundown of Schedule I banks. Additionally remembered for the rundown are regional banks and online institutions. The majority of credit unions and certain government-owned institutions are not on the rundown on the grounds that these organizations are [regulated by provincial and regional governments](/schedule-2-bank) as opposed to the federal government.

## Special Considerations

As indicated above, banking regulations are surveyed and amended on a periodic basis. This is to guarantee that the [industry](/industry) stays up with the latest with changes that happen in the economy and the Canadian marketplace.

Prior to 2001, individual shareholders of Schedule I bank stock couldn't hold over 10% of any [class of shares](/share_class) and were required to be widely held. Yet, that changed with Bill C-8, which was executed on October 24, 2001. The bill expected to give greater protections to consumers while advancing growth in the [financial sector](/financial_sector) and help competition in Canada. Under the bill, ownership systems of banks depend on equity size where:

- The small banks are those with under $1 billion in [equity](/equity)
- Moderate sized banks have equity running between $1 billion and $5 billion
- Large banks' equity surpasses $5 billion

Institutions with more than $5 billion in equity are required to have no person possessing over 20% of the [voting shares](/votingshares) or 30% of the non-voting shares. Thusly, they must in any case be widely held. Institutions with equity of $1 billion to $5 billion have less limitations on ownership as they are simply subject to having a public float of 35% of voting shares. Institutions with under $1 billion in equity have no ownership limitations.

> Banks are generally viewed as a safe investment, yet they are inclined to operational, liquidity, and market risk.

## Schedule I Banks versus Schedule II Banks versus Schedule III Banks

As referenced above, there are two different categories of financial institutions according to the Bank Act. [Schedule II](/schedule-2-bank) banks are auxiliaries of foreign banks that are permitted to carry on with work in Canada.

Like Schedule I banks, these institutions additionally acknowledge deposits yet can be owned by non-occupants. They are just essentially as common as their Schedule I counterparts and are additionally regulated by Canadian banking laws. Changes to banking structures under Bill C-8 likewise impacted Schedule II banks. Shareholders of large Schedule II banks — those with more than $5 billion in equity — are not permitted to claim over 20% of voting shares or 30% of non-voting shares.

Schedule III banks, then again, are foreign institutions that are authorized to carry on with work in Canada with certain limitations. These banks, however, are not regulated under the Bank Act.

Instances of Schedule II banks incorporate Citibank Canada and Amex Bank of Canada. Schedule III banks incorporate Bank of America and Capital One.
