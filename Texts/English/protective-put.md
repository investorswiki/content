# Protective Put
## What Is a Protective Put?

A protective put is a risk-the board strategy utilizing options contracts that investors utilize to prepare for the loss of claiming a stock or asset. The hedging strategy includes an investor buying a [put option](/putoption) for a fee, called a premium.

Puts without anyone else are a bearish strategy where the trader accepts the price of the asset will decline from now on. Be that as it may, a protective put is normally utilized when an investor is still [bullish](/bull) on a stock yet wishes to hedge against likely losses and uncertainty.

Protective puts might be placed on stocks, currencies, commodities, and indexes and give a protection to the downside. A protective put acts as an insurance policy by giving downside protection in the event the price of the asset declines.

## How a Protective Put Works

Protective puts are usually used when an investor is [long](/long) or purchases shares of stock or different assets that they plan to hold in their portfolio. Normally, an investor who claims stock has the risk of writing off the investment assuming the stock price declines below the purchase price. By purchasing a put option, any losses on the stock are limited or capped.

The protective put sets a realized floor price below which the investor won't keep on losing any additional money even as the underlying asset's price keeps on falling.

A put option is a contract that gives the owner the ability to sell a specific amount of the [underlying security](/underlying-security) at a set price before or by a predefined date. Dissimilar to futures contracts, the options contract doesn't commit the holder to sell the asset and possibly permits them to sell assuming that they ought to decide to do as such. The set price of the contract is known as the strike price, and the predefined date is the expiration date or expiry. One option contract likens to 100 shares of the underlying asset.

Additionally, just like everything in life, put options are not free. The fee on an option contract is known as the premium. This price has a basis on several factors including the current price of the underlying asset, the time until expiration, and the [implied volatility](/iv) (IV) — how likely the price will change — of the asset.

## Strike Prices and Premiums

A protective put option contract can be bought whenever. A few investors will buy these simultaneously and when they purchase the stock. Others might pause and buy the contract sometime in the future. At the point when they buy the option, the relationship between the price of the underlying asset and the strike price can place the contract into one of three categories — known as the [moneyness](/moneyness). These categories include:

1. At-the-money (ATM) where strike and market are equivalent
1. Out-of-the-money (OTM) where the strike is below the market
1. In-the-money (ITM) where the strike is over the market

Investors hoping to hedge losses on a holding basically center around the ATM and OTM option offerings.

Should the price of the asset and the strike price be something similar, the contract is considered [at-the-money](/atthemoney) (ATM). An at-the-money put option gives an investor 100% protection until the option terminates. Commonly, a protective put will be at-the-money in the event that it was bought simultaneously the underlying asset is purchased.

An investor can likewise buy a [out-of-the-money](/outofthemoney) (OTM) put option. Out-of-the-money happens when the strike price is below the price of the stock or asset. An OTM put option doesn't give 100% protection on the downside however rather covers the losses to the difference between the purchased stock price and the strike price. Investors use out-of-the-money options to bring down the cost of the premium since they will take a certain amount of a loss. Additionally, the further below the market value the strike is, the less the premium will turn into.

For instance, an investor could decide they're reluctant to take losses past a 5% decline in the stock. An investor could buy a put option with a strike price that is 5% lower than the stock price hence making a worst situation imaginable of a 5% loss if the stock declines. Different strike prices and expiration dates are available for options giving investors the ability to tailor the protection — and the premium fee.

## Possible Scenarios with Protective Puts

A protective put keeps downside losses limited while safeguarding unlimited expected gains to the upside. Notwithstanding, the strategy includes being long the underlying stock. In the event that the stock continues to rise, the long stock position benefits and the bought put option isn't required and will lapse uselessly. All that will be lost is the premium paid to buy the put option. In this scenario where the original put expired, the investor will buy another protective put, again protecting their holdings.

Protective puts can cover a portion of an investor's long position or their whole holdings. At the point when the ratio of protective put coverage is equivalent to the amount of long stock, the strategy is known as a [married put](/marriedput).

Married puts are ordinarily utilized when investors need to buy a stock and quickly purchase the put to safeguard the position. Be that as it may, an investor can buy the protective put option whenever as long as they own the stock.

The maximum loss of a protective put strategy is limited to the cost of buying the underlying stock — along with any commissions — less the strike price of the put option plus the premium and any commissions paid to buy the option.

The strike price of the put option acts as a barrier where losses in the underlying stock stop. The very smart arrangement in a protective put is at the stock cost to increase essentially, as the investor would benefit from the long stock position. In this case, the put option will terminate uselessly, the investor will have paid the premium, yet the stock will have increased in value.

## True Example of a Protective Put

Suppose an investor purchased 100 shares of General Electric Company (GE) stock for $10 per share. The price of the stock then increased to $20, giving the investor $10 per share in unrealized gains — unrealized on the grounds that it has not been sold yet.

The investor would rather not sell their GE holdings, on the grounds that the stock could appreciate further. They additionally don't have any desire to lose the $10 in unrealized gains. The investor can purchase a put option for the stock to safeguard a portion of the gains however long the option contract is in force.

The investor buys a put option with a strike price of $15 for 75 pennies, which makes a most dire outcome imaginable of selling the stock for $15 per share. The put option lapses in 90 days. In the event that the stock falls back to $10 or below, the investor gains on the put option from $15 and below on a dollar-for-dollar basis. In short, anyplace below $15, the investor is hedged until the option lapses.

The option premium cost is $75 ($0.75 x 100 shares). Thus, the investor has locked in a base profit equivalent to $425 ($15 strike price - $10 purchase price =$5 - $0.75 premium = $4.25 x 100 shares = $425).

To put it another way, if the stock declined back to the $10 price point, loosening up the position would yield a profit of $4.25 per share, on the grounds that the investor earned $5 in profit — the $15 strike less $10 initial purchase price — less the 0.75 pennies premium.

On the off chance that the investor didn't buy the put option, and the stock fell back to $10, there would be no profit. Then again, in the event that the investor bought the put and the stock rose to $30 per share, there would be a $20 gain on the trade. The $20 per share gain would pay the investor $2,000 ($30 - $10 initial purchase x 100 shares = $2000). The investor must then deduct the $75 premium paid for the option and would walk away with a net profit of $1925.

Of course, the investor would likewise have to consider the commission they paid for the initial order and any charges incurred when they sell their shares. For the cost of the premium, the investor has protected a portion of the profit from the trade until the option's expiry while as yet having the option to partake in additional price increases.

At last, the investor ought to understand that the $75 premium for the put is basically the cost of insurance on the position. One could contend that they would have been better off not buying the put by any means assuming it stays above $10. Nonetheless, similarly as with all insurance, it gives peace of psyche and protection on account of an adverse event.
