# Zero-Investment Portfolio
## What Is a Zero-Investment Portfolio?

A zero-investment portfolio is an assortment of [investments](/investing) that has a net value of zero when the portfolio is collected, and in this manner requires an investor to take no equity stake in the portfolio. For example, an investor might short sell $1,000 worth of stocks in a single set of companies, and utilize the proceeds to purchase $1,000 in stock in one more set of companies.

## Grasping a Zero-Investment Portfolio

A zero-investment portfolio that requires no equity at all is simply hypothetical; it doesn't exist in reality, yet theoretically this type of portfolio is of interest to scholastics studying finance. A genuinely zero-cost investment strategy isn't feasible because of multiple factors. To start with, when an investor gets stock from a broker to sell the stock and profit from its decline, they must involve a large part of the proceeds as collateral for the loan. Second, in the U.S., [short selling](/shortselling) is regulated by the [Securities and Exchange Commission](/sec) (SEC) to such an extent that it may not be workable for investors to keep up with the right balance of short investments with long investments. At last, buying and selling securities expects investors to pay commissions to brokers, which inflates costs to an investor; a real-life endeavor at a zero-investment portfolio would include risking one's own capital

The unique idea of a zero-investment portfolio drives it to not have a portfolio weight by any means. A [portfolio weight](/portfolio-weight) is generally calculated by separating the dollar amount that a portfolio is long by the total value of the multitude of investments in the portfolio. Since the net value of a zero-investment portfolio is zero, the denominator in the equation is zero. Thusly, the equation can't be addressed.

Portfolio theory is one of the main areas of study for understudies and specialists of [finance](/finance) and investing. The main contribution of portfolio theory to how we might interpret investments is that a group of stocks can earn investors a better risk-adjusted return than individual investments can. In most real-world markets, in any case, diversification of assets can't dispose of risk totally. An investment portfolio that can guarantee a return with no risk is known as an arbitrage opportunity, and scholastic financial theory typically expects that such situations are unrealistic in reality. A true zero-investment portfolio would be viewed as an arbitrage opportunity â€” in the event that the rate of return this portfolio earns equals or surpasses the riskless rate of return (normally assumed to be the rate one can earn from [U.S. government bonds](/government-bond)).

Arbitrage is the most common way of buying certain amounts of securities in a single market while all the while selling similar amount of something similar or comparable securities in another market. The principle of arbitrage can likewise be applied to buying and selling securities of like value in a similar market. The goal of an arbitrage strategy is to limit the overall risk of losing money, while simultaneously making the most of opportunities to bring in money.
