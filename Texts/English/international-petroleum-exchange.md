The petroleum industry experienced extraordinary [volatility](/volatility) during the 1970s, due to political and military contentions in the Middle East. The disruption in the global petroleum markets sent U.S. gasoline prices taking off, and its effects spread to different corners of the global economy.

## Future Contracts were IPE's Bread and Butter

Futures contracts on underlying petroleum supplies permit producers and consumers to [hedge](/hedge) their positions and safeguard themselves against future volatility.
