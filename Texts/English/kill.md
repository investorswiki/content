# Kill
## What is a Kill

A kill is a request to cancel a trade between its [placement](/placement) and its satisfaction.

## BREAKING DOWN Kill

Kill requests happen after a trader places an order however before it gets filled by a [counterparty](/counterparty). Investors might wish to kill trades as a result of market developments that change the possible profitability of a trade, since they placed the order inadvertently, or just in light of the fact that they changed their psyche in the wake of setting the trade.

The outcome of the kill relies upon the type of trade and the disposition of the markets. Many trades move from placement to [execution](/execution) promptly because of computer trading, limiting the amount of time accessible for a fruitful kill. At the point when exchanges experience heavy trade volumes, investors may likewise run into difficulty killing trades on the grounds that convenient notice about the trade's satisfaction or cancellation can be delayed. Setting a trade makes the investor or trader obligated for the order on satisfaction, whether or not the trader gets convenient notice. Kill orders issued or received after satisfaction of a trade won't be respected, and won't change the trader's responsibility to follow through on the placement order.

## Killing Market and Limit Orders

Since an effective kill order requires a trader to submit it before the order gets fulfilled, traders have significantly more slack on timing for placements that defer satisfaction or which place limitations on satisfaction. For instance, a few traders who wish to satisfy a large order at a specific price will issue a [fill or kill](/fok) order. Contingent upon the exchange and the order type determined, fill or kill orders occur in a single large transaction that either takes care of the whole request or however much of the order as could reasonably be expected. Regardless, the order must fill at the predefined price and the unfilled balance, in whole or in part, winds up dead assuming no counterparties approach.

[Limit orders](/limitorder) , then again, determine an amount of time during which an order satisfies on the off chance that the security in the trade hits a specific price point. For instance, an investor might utilize a stop loss order to guarantee a security that falls in price gets sold before it loses too much value. An investor may likewise utilize a take profit order to set a higher price point at which the investor maintains that a sale should happen. Regardless, the order doesn't get fulfilled until the contingent event occurs, and hence, a trader or investor could all the more effectively kill the trade.
