# Spot Reinsurance
## What Is Spot Reinsurance?

The term spot reinsurance alludes to a [insurance](/insurance) contract that spreads the risk from an insurance company to a [reinsurer](/reinsurer) for a single event. A spot reinsurance contract includes transferring the coverage from the original insurer to the reinsurer. All things considered, it is a form of insurance for insurance companies. An insurance company might get spot reinsurance when a subsection of its total portfolio implies extensively more risk than its portfolio as a whole.

## Grasping Spot Reinsurance

Reinsurance is a form of insurance that safeguards insurance companies. Numerous insurance companies might band together to share the risk by buying policies from different insurers. This permits them to relieve the risk of loss in the event of a major disaster or event that would bring about a high [payout](/payout).

In exchange for sharing the risk (and diminishing their own exposure), insurance companies surrender part of the [premiums](/premium) paid by their policyholders when they go into reinsurance agreements. By doing this, they really pay one more insurer to take a portion of the underwriting risks off their books.

A reinsurance agreement might cover a whole line of business or specific policy types. Under spot reinsurance contracts, the reinsurer consents to take on some or every one of the risks associated with a single event or occurrence from a catastrophic loss like floods, fires, and natural disasters, especially when policies carry a considerable degree of risk.

Reinsurance might permit the reinsurer to be particular with regards to the perils it acknowledges. This is known as [facultative reinsurance](/facultative-reinsurance). Or on the other hand, it might require the insurer to acknowledge a peril naturally. That is known as [treaty reinsurance](/treaty-reinsurance). We meticulously describe these two types of reinsurance below.

## Special Considerations

Reinsurance exists since there are certain risks that are just too high for one company to expect. In that capacity, insurance companies frequently search out reinsurers to assist with spreading the risk. Reinsurers are large insurance companies that are in the business of giving financial protection to insurance companies, and that means they don't offer financial types of assistance or protection to individuals. As verified above, spot reinsurance permits insurance companies to share the risk stemming from a single event with a reinsurer.

## Facultative Reinsurance versus Treaty Reinsurance

Facultative reinsurance is one of the least difficult ways for insurance companies to get reinsurance coverage. This type of agreement permits a reinsurer to be particular by picking a single [risk profile](/risk-profile) or they might pick a specific set of risks. Reinsurance companies ordinarily guarantee the policies they decide to reinsure all alone.

For instance, an insurance company might endorse flood insurance policies across a wide geographic area yet may decide to take on just a small number of policyholders. This small number might push the company's [aggregate risk](/aggregate-risk) over its limit, leading it to reinsure those policies.

Treaty reinsurance, then again, permits the insurance company to surrender every one of the risks associated with a set of policies to the reinsurer. The reinsurer doesn't guarantee any of the policies all alone and consents to [indemnify](/indemnity) the ceding company of the risks as a whole.

Facultative reinsurance contracts can be more costly than treaty reinsurance. This is on the grounds that treaty reinsurance covers a whole book or category of risks. It is an indication that the relationship between the insurer and the reinsurer is more long-term than if the reinsurer managed one-off [transactions](/transaction) covering single risks.

> While the increased cost is a burden, a facultative reinsurance arrangement might permit the insurer to take on clients that it might somehow not have the option to acknowledge.

## Purchasing Spot Reinsurance

Insurance companies can purchase spot reinsurance to cover policies utilizing a limit other than whatever is conceded for their portfolio as a whole. This type of insurance might be purchased to cover a specific peril or set of policies in a certain location, or it very well may be tailored to be pretty much as specific as covering a single policy.

For instance, a company that guarantees [auto insurance](/collision protection) policies might purchase spot reinsurance to cover a single driver who is distinguished as a lot riskier than different drivers that it safeguards. By isolating the risk associated with the more clumsy driver, the insurer lessens the chances that its overall portfolio of policies will bump facing its coverage limit.
