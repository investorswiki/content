## Seeing Bad Credit

Most Americans who have at any point borrowed money or pursued a credit card will have a credit file at least one of the three major [credit bureaus](/creditbureau), Equifax, Experian, and TransUnion. The data in those files, including how much money they owe and whether they pay their bills on time, is utilized to figure their credit score, a number that is planned as a manual for their creditworthiness. The most common credit score in the United States is the [FICO score](/ficoscore), named for the Fair Isaac Corporation, which contrived it.

A FICO score is comprised of five major components:

1. **35% — payment history.** This is given the best weight. It basically shows whether the person whose FICO score it is paid their bills on time. Missing by just a couple of days can count, albeit the more delinquent the payment, the more terrible it is thought of.
1. **30% — total amount an individual owes.** This incorporates mortgages, credit card balances, vehicle loans, any bills in collections, court decisions, and different debts. What's particularly important here is the person's [credit utilization ratio](/credit-utilization-rate), which compares how much money they have accessible to borrow, (for example, the total limits on their credit cards) to the amount they owe at some random time. Having a high credit utilization ratio (say, above 20% or 30%) can be seen as a risk signal and result in a lower credit score.

Scores somewhere in the range of 580 and 669 are named as fair. These borrowers are substantially more averse to turn out to be truly delinquent on loans, making them considerably less unsafe to loan to than those with awful credit scores.
