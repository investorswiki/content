## What Is ICON (ICX)?

ICON is a platform that is expected to work with the collaborations of independent blockchains, likewise alluded to as networks. Inside the ICON platform, a community is defined as a network of nodes that follow a single governance system. (A node is a computer that interfaces with a cryptocurrency network.)

Cryptocurrency networks (like Bitcoin and Ethereum) are viewed as networks, yet banks, businesses, medical clinics, schools, and governments could likewise participate as networks inside this ecosystem. ICON is upheld through a [cryptocurrency token](/cryptocurrency), ICX. The ICON Project was established in 2017 by the Icon Foundation, an organization situated in South Korea.

The goal of the ICON project is to work with a platform where elements from a different scope of enterprises — financial, security, insurance, healthcare, instructive, and business — can interface and execute on a single network.

## Figuring out ICON (ICX)

An initial coin offering (ICO) in September 2017 for Icon's cryptocurrency, ICX, raised generally $43 million. This sale included half of ICON's token supply. The project formally sent off its blockchain in January 2018 and participants in the ICO received their ICX cryptocurrency in June 2018.

In 2019, ICON delivered its own token standard, IRC16, which permits clients to involve the ICON software as infrastructure to make their own tokenized assets and securities. These tokenized assets and securities are digital tokens (or "coins") that address equity ownership units. With tokenized equity, a business can raise capital by giving its shares as digital assets.

This is the means by which ICON depicts its goal: to lay out a "digital nation," wherein different economic entertainers can issue and control their own forms of value, under rule systems they select. As per its website, the aim of Project ICON is to "hyperconnect the world" by "building quite possibly of the biggest decentralized network in the world."

The ICON project took motivation for their project from how real-world economies are structured; businesses, nonprofit organizations, and government institutions all leverage a common medium of exchange — a national currency — while as yet staying distinct yet interoperable economic entertainers. The blockchain technology and going with cryptocurrency token, called ICX, permit participants in a decentralized system to unite at a central point, making an interconnected blockchain network.

A [blockchain](/blockchain) is a type of database. It varies from a common database in the manner that it stores data. Data is stored in blocks in sequential order: As new data comes in, it is placed into another block. When the block is filled with data, that block is affixed onto the previous block.

While blockchains are generally commonly associated with cryptocurrencies, there are extra areas where this technology can be applied on the grounds that various types of information can be stored on a blockchain. While the most common use up to this point has been as a ledger for transactions, any exchange of information can be added to a blockchain. Transactions including securities, currencies, business contracts, deeds, loans, intellectual property, and personal identification could be tokenized.

Each blockchain is managed by a specific network. Consequently, in the past, associating different blockchains was not viewed as a possibility. The ICON project is an endeavor at such an association. Dissimilar to other centralized payment systems, which expect businesses to comply to their own policies and rules, ICON permits individual networks to hold control of their own policies. Along these lines, ICON tries to reduce expected barriers to adoption.

## Goals of ICON

ICON aims to make a greater network — made out of individuals networks — that is fueled by cryptocurrencies. Blockchains that participate in the ICON project can exchange currencies utilizing the platform's decentralized exchange (DEX).

The DEX sets currency reserves for each blockchain community so the networks can exchange value in real-time. Exchange rates are set for these transactions utilizing an A.I. analysis model and the native ICX coin is utilized as an intermediary currency for the exchange.

The ICON project comprises of five major parts: the ICON Republic, ICON people group, community representatives (C-Rep), community nodes (C-Nodes), and citizen nodes. ICON people group are a network of nodes inside a single governance system; they can operate with their own governance structures, numbers of nodes, and qualities. Networks can likewise fluctuate in their approaches to decision-production. For instance, while bitcoin adopts an agreement driven strategy, different networks — like financial institutions — may follow a hierarchical approach.

Community nodes are the infrastructure for every community; they keep a community's blockchain. Community representatives are nodes that are chosen from inside every community and are trusted to associate with the ICON Republic. Through the community representative, every community's blockchain is linked to the ICON Republic. Community representatives receive ICX for their work.

The ICON Republic is the administering structure of the network. It is additionally the decision committee for the blockchain's operations. ICON Republic still up in the air by the votes of community representatives. A supportive relationship is to envision the ICON Republic as the United States and to envision every ICON community as a separate state.

The activities of the ICON Republic don't decide the governance of the separate networks themselves. Be that as it may, the ICON Republic administers the interaction by which new ICX cryptocurrency is printed.

Citizen nodes are participants in the blockchain that don't have voting rights yet can make transactions inside a community, with different networks, and with the Icon Republic.

The ICON Republic's blockchain is alluded to as the "nexus." The technology that powers the nexus is an algorithm called a loopchain. The loopchain interfaces networks that are part of the ICON Republic. These people group — when gathered they are alluded to as a consortium — decide a common set of rules that permit the different blockchains to successfully cooperate.

The set of rules overseeing how the independent blockchains connect with the ICON Republic's blockchain — the nexus — is called the Blockchain Transmission Protocol (BTP).

At long last, likewise with [Ethereum](/ethereum), anybody can utilize ICON to build decentralized applications, called DAPPs, through the blockchain's public channel. Furthermore, after these applications are listed on ICON's DAPP store, anybody with a citizen node can download and utilize them.

## Reactions of ICON

While ICON has aggressive plans for associating various networks, it faces many difficulties in achieving this goal. To start with, numerous investors are utilized to traditional centralized cryptocurrency exchanges. While the facts really confirm that these traditional, centralized exchanges don't fit with the decentralized philosophy of cryptocurrencies, in 2021, these exchanges are as yet a necessary part of the cryptocurrency market. Numerous investors just purchase cryptocurrencies that they can buy through their #1 exchanges. This could make issues for ICX. Given the goals of ICON, many exchanges might not have any desire to offer ICX to their customers.

High levels of competition increase the risk that a particular cryptocurrency will fail to get on. Like other cryptocurrencies, ICON faces fierce opposition from other cryptocurrencies.

## Highlights
- Networks are associated with the ICON Network through a decentralized exchange.
- Possible resistance from traditional centralized cryptocurrency exchanges is a major test facing ICON.
- ICON is a blockchain technology and network system intended to permit independent blockchains to collaborate with one another.
