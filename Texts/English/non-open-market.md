While these transactions happen outside of the traditional market, they actually should be documented with the [Securities and Exchange Commission](/sec) (SEC). Such transactions can be alluded to as a non-open market acquisition or disposition.

These options are priced in light of the market price at the time they are conceded. This is known as the [strike price](/strikeprice). Employees must sit tight for these options to [vest](/vesting) — and that means they stay long enough at the company to earn the right to utilize the options — before they can be exercised.

The assumption is that the value of the shares will increase during that time. The strike price ought to be a discount compared with the market price when the employee exercises their options. This allows the option holder the opportunity to possibly resell the shares for a profit on the open market where outside buyers must pay the current market price.

Utilizing real figures, an employee might get 10 stock options, qualifying them for 1,000 shares (10 contracts x 100 shares each) at a price of $50. The options can't be exercised for quite some time. The stock is currently worth $50, however in five years time it is ideally worth more. This gives the employee incentive to assist the company with becoming as profitable as could be expected. The higher the stock price goes, the more they stand to make.

In five years time the employee might exercise their options. On the off chance that the stock price is currently $70, every option is worth $20 x (10 contracts x 100 shares) = $20,000. Thought about another way, they receive 1,000 shares at $50 and can sell them on the open market at $70 for a $20,000 profit.
