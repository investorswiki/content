# Exchange Rate Mechanism (ERM)
## What Is an Exchange Rate Mechanism (ERM)?

An exchange rate mechanism (ERM) is a set of procedures used to deal with a country's currency exchange rate relative to different currencies. It is part of an economy's [monetary policy](/monetarypolicy) and is put to use by central banks.

Such a mechanism can be employed in the event that a country uses either a [fixed exchange rate](/fixedexchangerate) or one with an obliged floating exchange rate that is limited around its peg (known as a [adjustable peg](/adjustable-peg) or crawling peg).

## Understanding the Exchange Rate Mechanism

Monetary policy is the most common way of drafting, reporting, and executing the plan of moves made by the central bank, [currency board](/currency_board), or other equipped monetary authority of a country that controls the quantity of money in an economy and the channels by which new money is supplied. Under a currency board, the management of the exchange rate and money supply is given to a monetary authority that settles on conclusions about the valuation of a country's currency. Frequently, this monetary authority has direct guidelines to move all units of domestic currency in circulation with foreign currency.

An exchange rate mechanism is certainly not another concept. By and large, most new currencies began as a [fixed exchange](/fixedexchangerate) mechanism that followed gold or a widely traded commodity. It is approximately founded on fixed [exchange rate](/exchangerate) edges, by which exchange rates vary inside certain edges.

An upper and lower bound interval permits a currency to experience some variability without forfeiting [liquidity](/liquidity) or drawing extra economic risks. The concept of currency exchange rate mechanisms is likewise alluded to as a semi-pegged currency system.

## Real World Example: The European Exchange Rate Mechanism

The most striking exchange rate mechanism happened in Europe during the late 1970s. The European Economic Community presented the ERM in 1979, as part of the [European Monetary System (EMS)](/ems), to reduce exchange rate variability and accomplish stability before member countries moved to a single currency. It was intended to standardize exchange rates between countries before they were integrated to stay away from any problems with price discovery.

The exchange rate mechanisms reached a crucial stage in 1992 when Britain, a member of the European ERM, pulled out from the treaty. The British government initially entered the agreement to prevent the British pound and other member currencies from veering off by over 6%.

## Real World Example: Soros and Black Wednesday

In the months leading up to the 1992 event, unbelievable investor [George Soros](/soros) had developed a fantastic [short position](/short) in the pound sterling that became productive assuming the currency fell below the lower band of the ERM. Soros recognized that Britain entered the agreement under unfavorable conditions, the rate was too high, and economic conditions were delicate. In September 1992, presently known as [Black Wednesday](/black-wednesday), Soros sold off a large portion of his short position to the disappointment of the Bank of England, who battled tooth and nail to support the pound sterling.

The European exchange rate mechanism broke down before the decade's over, however not before a replacement was introduced. The exchange rate mechanism II (ERM II) was shaped in January 1999 to guarantee that exchange rate changes between the Euro and other EU currencies didn't disturb economic stability in the single market. It additionally helped non-euro-area countries get ready to enter the euro area.

Most non-euro-area countries consent to keep exchange rates bound to a 15% territory, up or down, against the central rate. At the point when fundamental, the European Central Bank (ECB) and other nonmember countries can mediate to keep rates in the window. A few current and former members of the ERM II incorporate Greece, Denmark, and Lithuania.
