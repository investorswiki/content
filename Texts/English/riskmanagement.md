# Risk Management in Finance
## What Is Risk Management?

In the financial world, risk management is the course of identification, [analysis](/risk-analysis), and acceptance or alleviation of vulnerability in investment choices. Basically, risk management happens when an investor or fund manager dissects and endeavors to measure the potential for losses in an investment, like a moral hazard, and afterward makes the proper move (or inaction) given the fund's investment objectives and risk tolerance.

Risk is inseparable from return. Each investment implies some degree of risk, which is viewed as close to zero on account of a U.S. T-bill or exceptionally high for something like developing market equities or real estate in highly inflationary markets. Risk is quantifiable both in absolute and in relative terms. A strong comprehension of risk in its various forms can assist investors with bettering comprehend the opportunities, compromises, and costs associated with various investment draws near.

## Grasping Risk Management

Risk management happens wherever in the realm of finance. It happens when an investor purchases [U.S. Treasury](/ustreasury) bonds over corporate bonds, when a fund manager hedges his currency exposure with currency [derivatives](/subsidiary), and when a bank performs a credit check on an individual before giving a personal credit extension. Stockbrokers utilize financial instruments like [options](/choice) and [futures](/futures), and money managers use strategies like portfolio diversification, asset allocation and position sizing to relieve or actually oversee risk.

Lacking risk management can bring about extreme ramifications for companies, individuals, and the economy. For instance, the [subprime mortgage meltdown](/subprime-meltdown) in 2007 that aided trigger the Great Recession originated from terrible risk-management choices, for example, lenders who extended mortgages to individuals with poor credit; investment firms who bought, packaged, and exchanged these mortgages; and funds that invested excessively in the repackaged, yet at the same time risky, [mortgage-backed securities (MBS)](/mbs).

## How Risk Management Works

We will generally think of "risk" in prevalently negative terms. Nonetheless, in the investment world, risk is vital and inseparable from desirable performance.

A common definition of investment risk is a **deviation from an expected outcome**. We can express this deviation in absolute terms or relative to something different, similar to a market [benchmark](/benchmark).

While that deviation might be positive or negative, investment professionals generally acknowledge the possibility that such deviation infers some degree of the planned outcome for your investments. Hence to accomplish higher returns one hopes to acknowledge the greater risk. Likewise a generally accepted thought increased risk comes as increased volatility. While investment professionals continually look for — and sometimes find — ways of lessening such volatility, there is no unmistakable agreement among them on how it's best finished.

How much volatility an investor ought to acknowledge relies altogether upon the individual investor's tolerance for risk, or on account of an investment professional, how much tolerance their investment objectives permit. One of the most commonly utilized absolute risk metrics is [standard deviation](/standarddeviation), a statistical measure of [dispersion](/dispersion) around a central inclination. You take a gander at the average return of an investment and afterward track down its average standard deviation throughout a similar time span. Normal distributions (the natural bell-formed curve) direct that the expected return of the investment is probably going to be one standard deviation from the average 67% of the time and two standard deviations from the average deviation 95% of the time. This assists investors with assessing risk mathematically. Assuming they accept that they can endure the risk, financially and inwardly, they invest.

## Model

For instance, during a 15-year period from August 1, 1992, to July 31, 2007, the average [annualized total return](/annualized-total-return) of the [S&P 500 ](/sp500) was 10.7%. This number uncovers what occurred for the whole period, however it doesn't get out whatever occurred along the way. The average standard deviation of the S&P 500 for that equivalent period was 13.5%. This is the difference between the average return and the real return all things considered given points all through the 15-year period.

While applying the bell curve model, some random outcome ought to fall inside one standard deviation of the mean around 67% of the time and inside two standard deviations around 95% of the time. Consequently, a S&P 500 investor could anticipate the return, at some random point during this period, to be 10.7% plus or minus the standard deviation of 13.5% around 67% of the time; he may likewise expect to be a 27% (two standard deviations) increase or diminishing 95% of the time. In the event that he can bear the cost of the loss, he invests.

## Risk Management and Psychology

While that information might be useful, it doesn't completely address an investor's risk concerns. The field of [behavioral finance](/behavioralfinance) has contributed an important element to the risk equation, showing asymmetry between how individuals view gains and losses. In the language of prospect theory, an area of behavioral finance presented by Amos Tversky and Daniel Kahneman in 1979, investors display **loss aversion.** Tversky and Kahneman reported that investors put generally two times the weight on the pain associated with a loss than the positive sentiment associated with a profit.

Frequently, what investors really need to know isn't just how much an asset veers off from its expected outcome, yet the way in which terrible things look way down on the left-hand tail of the distribution curve. [Value at risk](/var) (VAR) endeavors to give a solution to this inquiry. The thought behind VAR is to evaluate how large a loss on investment could accompany a given level of confidence over a defined period. For instance, the following statement would be an illustration of VAR: "With about a 95% level of confidence, the most you stand to lose on this $1,000 investment more than a two-year [time horizon](/timehorizon) is $200." The confidence level is a probability statement in view of the statistical qualities of the investment and the state of its distribution curve.

Of course, even a measure like VAR doesn't guarantee that 5% of the time will be a lot of more regrettable. Breathtaking fiascos like the one that hit the hedge fund [Long-Term Capital Management](/longtermcapital) in 1998 advise us that supposed "exception events" may happen. On account of LTCM, the exception event was the Russian government's default on its outstanding sovereign debt obligations, an event that took steps to bankrupt the hedge fund, which had highly[ leveraged](/leveragedloan) positions worth more than $1 trillion; assuming it had gone under, it might have imploded the global financial system. The U.S. government made a $3.65-billion loan fund to cover LTCM's losses, which enabled the firm to endure the market volatility and sell in an orderly way in mid 2000.

## Beta and Passive Risk Management

One more risk measure situated to behavioral inclinations is a [drawdown](/drawdown), which alludes to any period during which an asset's return is negative relative to a previous high mark. In measuring drawdown, we endeavor to address three things:

- the extent of each negative period (how awful)
- the duration of every (how long)
- the frequency (how frequently)

For instance, as well as yet curious as to whether a mutual fund beat the S&P 500, we likewise need to know how similarly risky it was. One measure for this is [beta](/beta) (known as "market risk"), in view of the statistical property of [covariance](/covariance). A beta greater than 1 demonstrates more risk than the market and vice versa.

Beta assists us with figuring out the concepts of passive and [active risk](/activerisk). The graph below shows a [time series](/timeseries) of returns (every data point named "+") for a specific portfolio R(p) versus the market return R(m). The returns are cash-adjusted, so the place where the x and y-tomahawks converge is the money identical return. Drawing a [line of best fit](/line-of-best-fit) through the data points permits us to measure the passive risk (beta) and the active risk (alpha).
<!--3F8669F1F8FA62AAEF6A1C448F79070F-->
The slope of the line is its beta. For instance, an inclination of 1.0 demonstrates that for each unit increase of market return, the portfolio return likewise increases by one unit. A money manager utilizing a passive management strategy can endeavor to increase the portfolio return by taking on more market risk (i.e., a beta greater than 1) or on the other hand decline portfolio risk (and return) by decreasing the portfolio beta below one.

## Alpha and Active Risk Management

In the event that the level of market or systematic risk were the just impacting factor, then a portfolio's return would continuously be equivalent to the beta-adjusted market return. Of course, this isn't the case: Returns vary in view of a number of factors unrelated to market risk. Investment managers who follow an active strategy face different risks challenges accomplish excess returns over the market's performance. Active strategies incorporate strategies that leverage stock, sector or country selection, fundamental analysis, position sizing, and technical analysis.

Active managers are on the chase after an alpha, the measure of excess return. In our diagram model above, alpha is the amount of portfolio return not made sense of by beta, addressed as the distance between the convergence of the x and y-tomahawks and the y-pivot capture, which can be positive or negative. As they continued looking for excess returns, active managers open investors to [alpha risk](/alpha-risk), the risk that the aftereffect of their wagers will demonstrate negative instead of positive. For instance, a fund manager might think that the energy sector will outperform the S&P 500 and increase her portfolio's weighting in this sector. On the off chance that unexpected economic advancements cause energy stocks to pointedly decline, the manager will probably underperform the benchmark, an illustration of alpha risk.

## The Cost of Risk

By and large, the more an active fund and its managers shows themselves able to create alpha, the higher the fees they will more often than not charge investors for exposure to those higher-alpha strategies. For a simply passive vehicle like a [index fund](/indexfund) or a [exchange-traded fund](/etf) (ETF), you're probably going to pay 1 to 10 [basis points](/basispoint) (bps) in annual management fees, while for a high-octane hedge fund utilizing complex trading strategies including high capital commitments and transaction costs, an investor would have to pay 200 basis points in annual fees, plus offer back 20% of the profits to the manager.

The difference in pricing among passive and active strategies (or [beta risk](/beta-risk) and alpha risk separately) encourages numerous investors to try and separate these risks (for example to pay lower fees for the beta risk assumed and concentrate their more costly exposures to explicitly defined alpha opportunities). This is famously known as [portable alpha](/portablealpha), the possibility that the alpha part of a total return is separate from the beta part.

For instance, a fund manager might claim to have an active sector rotation strategy for beating the S&P 500 and show, as evidence, a history of beating the index by 1.5% on an average annualized basis. To the investor, that 1.5% of excess return is the manager's value, the alpha, and the investor will pay higher fees to get it. The remainder of the total return, what the S&P 500 itself earned, doesn't apparently have anything to do with the manager's unique ability. Portable alpha strategies use derivatives and different devices to refine how they acquire and pay for the alpha and beta parts of their [exposure](/financial-exposure).
