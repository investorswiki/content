## How the Comparative Interest Rate Method Works

To comprehend the comparative interest rate method, it is useful to initially survey the structure of the two types of [life insurance products](/lifeinsurance) that it is utilized to compare: whole life policies and decreasing term policies. In a whole life policy, the policyholder pays month to month [insurance premiums](/insurance-premium) for as long as they can remember and is guaranteed coverage the length of they keep making their payments. Frequently, the whole life premiums will be fixed at a level that is a lot higher than whatever a youthful and sound person could get inside a decreasing term policy, with the advantage being that the coverage will in any case be in effect once the policyholder is old and sick.
