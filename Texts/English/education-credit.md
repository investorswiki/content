# Education Tax Credit
## What Is an Education Tax Credit?

Education tax credits are available for taxpayers who pay qualified higher education expenses for an eligible student to an eligible educational institution, like a college or university. The two types of education tax credits are the [American Opportunity Tax Credit (AOTC)](/american-opportunity-tax-credit) and the [Lifetime Learning Credit](/lifelearningcredit).

## How Education Tax Credits Work

Education tax credits might be claimed by the individuals who bring about qualifying educational expenses, like tuition and fees. Parents who pay these expenses for their children might have the option to claim this type of credit on their [tax returns](/individual-tax-return), subject to certain income limitations.

There are two types of education tax credits: the American Opportunity Tax Credit (AOTC) and the lifetime learning credit. The AOTC applies to the first four years of postsecondary education, with certain limitations. The Lifetime Learning Credit applies to all students at the undergraduate or graduate level. You can't claim both the AOTC and the Lifetime Learning Credit for a similar student in a similar tax year.

## Requirements for the Education Tax Credit

The two credits likewise have their own qualification rules, yet a taxpayer must meet each of the three of these requirements for both:

1. You, your dependent, or an outsider must pay [qualified higher education expenses](/qhee).
1. You, your spouse, or a dependent listed on your tax return qualify as an eligible student.
1. The eligible student (above) must be enrolled at an eligible educational institution.

## American Opportunity Tax Credit (AOTC)

The American Opportunity Tax Credit (AOTC) is for eligible students who have not yet completed their first four years of higher education. They must not have claimed the AOTC or former Hope credit for in excess of four tax years. The student must be enrolled to some degree half time for one scholarly, still up in the air by the school, during the tax year. Furthermore, they must not have a crime drug conviction as of the finish of the tax year.

There are income limits for claiming the AOTC. The credit starts to phase out at a [modified adjusted gross income (MAGI)](/magi) of $80,000 for [single filers](/single) and $160,000 for [married taxpayers filing jointly (MFJ)](/mfj) for a full credit. Single taxpayers with a MAGI of more than $90,000, or MFJs with a MAGI more than $180,000, can't claim the credit. In the middle of between these brackets considers claiming a reduced credit.

Eligible students can claim 100% of the first $2,000 spent on school expenses and another 25% of the next $2,000. The maximum amount that an eligible student can claim is, accordingly, $2,500: (100% \u00d7 $2,000) + (25% \u00d7 $2,000). At the end of the day, the maximum $2,500 AOTC can offset $4,000 spent on qualified higher educational expenses.

The AOTC is a to some extent refundable tax credit. This means that in the event that the credit reduces your tax burden to under zero, the [Internal Revenue Service (IRS)](/irs) will send you a check for up to 40% of the excess credit. The maximum refundable portion of the credit is, subsequently, $1,000 (40% \u00d7 $2,500).

## Lifetime Learning Credit

The Lifetime Learning Credit has more extensive qualification requirements than the AOTC, as it is expected for taxpayers at all education levels. The Lifetime Learning Credit can be utilized for many schools, including [vocational](/vocational-degree) training or professional degree courses, as well concerning tuition at additional traditional four-year undergraduate and graduate schools.

To be eligible for the Lifetime Learning Credit, a student must be enrolled in a course to earn education credits or further develop job skills at an eligible educational institution for no less than one scholastic, not set in stone by the school. The student will receive a Form 1098-T, Tuition Statement, from the educational institution assuming it is an eligible school as defined by the IRS.

After Dec. 31, 2020, the MAGI involved by joint filers for the Lifetime Learning Credit isn't adjusted for inflation. The credit is phased out for taxpayers with a MAGI in excess of $80,000 for single filers and $160,000 for joint returns.

Eligible students can claim 20% of the first $10,000 of qualified education expenses. The maximum amount that an eligible student can claim is, in this way, $2,000 (20% \u00d7 $10,000). The Lifetime Learning Credit isn't refundable. This means that the credit can reduce your tax liability to zero, yet it can't be refunded to you past that point.

## Reactions of Education Tax Credits

Pundits of appropriations for higher education have long contended that education tax credits are one explanation that the cost of higher education has been rising ordinarily quicker than [inflation](/inflation). As per these pundits, education tax credits just raise the overall cost of college without a real increase in access to it. Tax credits get more cash-flow available for spending on education, yet they never really increase the supply or quality of schooling.
