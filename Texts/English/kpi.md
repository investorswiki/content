# Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
## What Are Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)?

Key performance indicators (KPIs) allude to a set of quantifiable measurements used to check a company's overall long-term performance.

KPIs explicitly assist with determining a company's strategic, financial, and operational accomplishments, especially compared to those of different businesses inside the same sector.

## Grasping Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

Additionally alluded to as key achievement indicators (KSIs), KPIs change among companies and between industries, contingent upon performance criteria.

For instance, a software company endeavoring to achieve the quickest growth in its industry might consider [year-over-year (YOY)](/year-over-year) revenue growth as its chief performance indicator. Conflictingly, a retail chain could place more value on same-store sales, as the best KPI metric where to check its growth.

## Types of Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
### Financial Metrics

Key performance indicators tied to the financials normally center around revenue and profit margins. Net profit, the most dependable of profit-based measurements, addresses the amount of revenue that remaining parts, as profit for a given period, in the wake of accounting for the company's all's expenses, taxes, and interest payments for the same period.

Calculated as a dollar amount, net profit must be changed over into a percentage of revenue (known as "net profit margin"), to be utilized in comparative analysis.

For instance, assuming the standard net profit margin for a given industry is half, another business in that space realizes it must pursue meeting or beating that figure assuming it wishes to remain seriously viable. The gross profit margin, which measures revenues subsequent to accounting for expenses straightforwardly associated with the production of goods available to be purchased, is another common profit-based KPI.

A financial KPI that is known as the "current ratio" centers to a great extent around liquidity and can be calculated by partitioning a company's current assets by its current debts.

A financially solid company commonly has adequate cash close by to meet its financial obligations for the current year period. Notwithstanding, various industries depend on various amounts of debt financing, consequently a company should just compare its current ratio to those of different businesses inside the same industry, to ascertain how its cash flow stacks up among its friends.

### Customer Metrics

Customer-zeroed in KPIs generally center on per-customer productivity, customer satisfaction, and customer retention.

Customer lifetime value (CLV) addresses the total amount of money that a customer is expected to spend on your products over the whole business relationship.

Customer acquisition cost (CAC), by comparison, addresses the total sales and marketing cost required to land another customer. By contrasting CAC with CLV, businesses can measure the effectiveness of their customer acquisition efforts.

### Process Performance Metrics

Process metrics aim to measure and monitor operational performance across the organization.

By isolating the number of defective products by total products created, for instance, businesses can measure the percentage of defective products. Normally, the goal is get this number down as low as could be expected.

Throughput time addresses the total amount of time it takes to run a specific cycle. For instance, a drive-through restaurant throughput can measure what amount of time it requires to service an average customer; from the time they make their order to the time they drive away with their food.

## Instances of Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

We should investigate electric vehicle-creator Tesla (TSLA) for a couple of instances of KPIs in real life. These numbers are all from their Q4 2021 earnings release.

### Vehicle Production

During the quarter, Tesla created a record 305,840 vehicles and delivered 308,650 vehicles. Production is a big deal for the company since it has reliably been reprimanded for being terrible at inclining up.

Increased manufacturing scale means more market share and profits for Tesla.

### Automotive Gross Margin

For the quarter, Tesla's automotive gross margin expanded to 30.6%. Gross margin is one of the most outstanding measures of profitability for Tesla since it separates its vehicle production costs.

Tesla managed to grow its gross margin in Q4 even as sales of lower-valued models dominated its higher-margin models.

### Free Cash Flow

Tesla's free cash flow got started at $2.8 billion during the quarter. That addresses a tremendous improvement from the $1.9 billion free cash flow in the year-prior period.

Tesla's current level of free cash flow production recommends that the company is arriving at a scale of profitability without the assistance of regulatory credits.

## Limitations of Using Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

A portion of the impediments to utilizing KPIs include:

- The long time span required for KPIs to give significant data
- They require consistent monitoring and close follow-up to be valuable
- They open up the possibility for managers to "game" KPIs
- Quality tends to drop when managers are hyperfocused on productivity KPIs
- Employees can be pushed too hard aiming explicitly for KPIs

## Special Considerations

KPIs don't be guaranteed to must be exclusively tied to financial data.

While profits and debt levels are without a doubt important key financial indicators

a company's relationships with the two its customers and its employees are no less important to laying out its overall wellbeing.

> Common non-financial KPIs incorporate measures of foot traffic, employee turnover rates, the number of repeat customers versus new customers, and different quality metrics.
