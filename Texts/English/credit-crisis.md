## What Is a Credit Crisis?

A credit crisis is a breakdown of a [financial system](/financial-system) brought about by a sudden and serious disruption of the normal course of cash movement that supports any economy. A bank shortage of cash accessible for lending is just one in a series of flowing events that happen in a credit crisis.

## Figuring out a Credit Crisis

A credit crisis has a triggering event. Consider the likely impact of an extreme dry spell where farmers lose their crops. Without the income from the crop sales, they can't repay their bank [loans](/loan). Without those loan payments, the bank is short of cash and needs to pull back strongly on making new loans. The bank actually needs [cash flow](/cashflow) for its ordinary operations, so it moves forward borrowing in the short-term lending market. Nonetheless, the bank itself has now turned into a [credit risk](/creditrisk) and different lenders cut it off.

As the crisis develops, it starts to intrude on the flow of short-term loans that keeps a large part of the business community running. Businesses rely upon this cycle to keep operating not surprisingly. At the point when the flow evaporates, it can lamentably affect the financial system as a whole.

In the worst situation imaginable, customers find out about the problem and there's a [run on the bank](/bankrun) until there's no cash left to pull out. In a somewhat more positive scenario, the bank staggers through however its standards for loan endorsements have become so contracted that the whole economy, in some measure in this dry season stricken region, endures.

The modern banking system has shields that make it more challenging for this scenario to happen, including a requirement for banks to keep up with substantial [cash reserves](/cash-reserves). Moreover, the banking system has become consolidated into a couple of goliath global institutions, making it impossible that a regional dry season could trigger a vast crisis. Be that as it may, those large institutions have their own risks. This is where the government steps in and rescues institutions that are "[too big to fail](/too-big-to-fail)."

## The 2007-2008 Credit Crisis

The 2007-2008 credit crisis is no doubt the main extreme illustration of a credit crisis that has happened inside the memory of most Americans.

The 2007-2008 credit crisis was a [meltdown](/subprime-meltdown) for the history books. The triggering event was a cross country bubble in the housing market. Home prices had been rising quickly for a really long time. [Speculators](/examiner) hopped in to buy and flip houses. Leaseholders were restless to buy before they got priced out. A few accepted prices could rise constantly. Then, at that point, in 2006, prices hit their pinnacle and began to decline.

A long time before then, at that point, mortgage brokers and lenders had loosened up their standards to exploit the boom. They offered [subprime](/subprime_mortgage) mortgages, and homebuyers borrowed well too far in the red. "Mystery" rates essentially guaranteed that they would [default](/default2) in a little while.

This was not foolish behavior with respect to the lenders. They didn't hold onto those subprime loans, however rather sold them for repackaging as [mortgage-backed securities](/mbs) (MBS) and [collateralized debt obligations](/cdo) (CDO) that were traded in the markets by investors and institutions.

At the point when the bubble burst, the last buyers, who were among the biggest financial institutions in the country, were stuck. As the losses climbed, investors started to worry that those organizations had made light of the degree of their losses. The stock prices of the actual organizations started to fall. Between lending between the organizations stopped.

The credit crunch combined with the mortgage meltdown to make a crisis that froze the financial system when its requirement for liquid capital was at its highest. The situation was exacerbated by a simply human element — dread went to panic. Riskier stocks experienced big losses, even assuming they didn't have anything to do with the mortgage market.

The situation was critical to such an extent that the Federal Reserve (Fed) was forced to pump billions into the system to save it — and, surprisingly, then, we actually ended up in [The Great Recession](/great-recession).
