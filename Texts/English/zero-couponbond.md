# Zero-Coupon Bond
Bonds are financial instruments that permit investors to earn money by lending money to a government or corporation for a set period of time. Commonly, bond issuers (governments and corporations) reward bondholders (investors) with interest payments called "coupons" throughout the span of a bond's term before returning the principal amount, or "face value," of the bond to the holder once the bond matures.
With regards to interest-paying bonds, an investor's profit — assuming they hold the bond for the entirety of its term and don't resell it — is the total value of the coupon payments they receive throughout a bond's term. So what, then, is a zero-coupon bond, and how do investors bring in money with them?
## What Are Zero-Coupon Bonds and How Do They Work?
Like standard [bonds](/bond), zero-coupon bonds are financial [securities](/security) that mature after some time, and their face (par) value is paid to their holder toward the finish of their term. Dissimilar to coupon-paying bonds, in any case, zero-coupon bonds don't give periodic coupon payments — thus the name.
Since they don't offer [interest](/interestrate) payments, these bonds are sold at a discount to boost investors to purchase them. Hence, they are at times alluded to as "deep discount" bonds. The difference between a zero-coupon bond's discounted purchase price and its face value is its investor's profit.
## What Is Imputed Interest?
This difference between a zero-coupon bond's purchase price and its face value (the investor's profit in the event that they hold to term) is frequently alluded to as imputed interest. **Impute** means "to assign or credit to," so **imputed interest** basically means "suggested interest credited to a bond in spite of a lack of real interest payments."
In this way, where a normal bond's yield is the total value of its interest payments, a zero-coupon bond's all's yield is its imputed interest, or the amount by which its face value was discounted when it was sold.
## How Do Zero-Coupon Bonds Differ From Regular Bonds?
Not at all like traditional bonds, zero-coupon bonds are not [fixed-income](/fixed-income-ventures) debt instruments. While normal bondholders receive interest payments consistently (generally two times per year or yearly), zero-coupon bondholders never receive interest payments. All things being equal, they receive a single lump sum of cash upon the bond's maturity (or sale, in the event that they sell it before it matures).
Furthermore, zero-coupon bonds are more unpredictable than traditional bonds. This means that their value tends to goes up more than the value of common bonds when interest rates drop (and vice versa)
## How Are Zero-Coupon Bonds Priced?
The more drawn out the time until a bond matures, the less secure it is, so generally, bonds with longer terms sell at more extreme discounts (i.e., have higher yields). Ordinarily, the accompanying formula is utilized to compute the sale price of a zero-coupon bond in light of its face value and maturity date.
### Zero-Coupon Bond Price Formula
> Sale Price = FV/(1 + IR) ^N^

Where:
- **FV** is the face value of the bond.
- **IR** is the imputed interest rate (communicated as a decimal).
- **N** is the number of years until the bond matures.

### Zero-Coupon Bond Pricing Example
To make 5% imputed interest on a zero-coupon bond with a face value of $15,000 that matures in four years, what amount might they want to pay?
> Sale Price = FV/(1 + IR) ^N^Sale Price = $15,000/(1 + 0.05) ^4^Sale Price = $15,000/(1.05) ^4^Sale Price = $15,000/(1.05) ^4^Sale Price = $15,000/(1.05) ^4^Sale Price = $12,295.08

Thus, in this scenario, an investor would pay $12,295.08 today in exchange for $15,000 in four years.
## How Is the Income From a Zero-Coupon Bond Taxed?
In spite of the way that zero-coupon bonds don't really pay interest, bondholders are as yet subject to any applicable taxes on their **imputed interest** every year. This means that they must pay taxes on income they won't receive until their bond matures.
For example, in the event that a zero-coupon bond was sold at a $100 discount and matures in four years, its holder would need to pay the applicable bond interest tax rate on $25 worth of the bond's total $100 yield every year.
Contingent upon the issuer of a bond and where it is purchased, its imputed interest payments could possibly be taxable at federal, state, and neighborhood levels. In some cases, these taxes can be deferred on the off chance that a bond is purchased through a tax-deferred retirement account like an IRA or 401K. Since numerous people have lower income once retired, they might fall into a lower income tax bracket, so conceding taxes with a retirement account can assist with limiting the effect of taxes on bond yield.
