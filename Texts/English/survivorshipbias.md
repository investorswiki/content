# Survivorship Bias
## What Is Survivorship Bias?

Survivorship bias or survivor bias is the propensity to see the performance of existing stocks or funds in the market as a representative far reaching sample without in regards to those that have become bankrupt. Survivorship bias can bring about the misjudgment of historical performance and general credits of a fund or market index.

[Survivorship bias risk](/survivorship-bias-risk) is the chance of an investor going with an off track investment choice in light of distributed investment fund return data.

## Understanding Survivorship Bias

Survivorship bias is a natural peculiarity that makes the existing funds in the investment market more noticeable and subsequently more highly seen as a representative sample. Survivorship bias happens in light of the fact that many funds in the investment market are closed by the [investment manager](/investment-manager) because of multiple factors leaving existing funds at the very front of the investing universe.

Funds might close in light of multiple factors. Various market researchers follow and have reported on the effects of fund closings, highlighting the occurrence of survivorship bias. Market researchers routinely follow fund survivorship bias and fund closings to measure historical trends and add new dynamics to fund performance monitoring.

Various studies have been finished examining survivorship bias and its effects. For example, Morningstar delivered a research report named "The Fall of Funds: Why Some Funds Fail" examining fund terminations and their negative ramifications for investors.

## Fund Closings

There are two fundamental reasons that funds close. One, the fund may not receive high demand and hence asset inflows don't warrant keeping the fund open. Two, a fund might be closed by an investment manager due to performance. Performance closings are regularly the most common.

Investors in the fund are quickly influenced by a fund closing. Companies generally offer two solutions for a fund closing. One, the fund goes through full liquidation and the investors' shares are sold. This causes potential tax reporting ramifications for the investor. Two, the fund might decide to blend. Merged funds are in many cases the best solution for shareholders since they consider the special progress of shares commonly with no tax reporting requirements. In any case, the performance of the merged funds is in this way likewise progressed and can be a factor in the discussion of survivorship bias.

Morningstar is one investment service provider that consistently talks about and reports on survivorship bias. It tends to be important for investors to know about survivorship bias since it could be a factor impacting performance that they are not aware of. While merged funds might consider closed fund performance, much of the time funds are closed and their performance isn't integrated into future reporting. This prompts survivorship bias, since investors might accept that at present, active funds are a true representative, everything being equal, to oversee toward a specific [objective](/investmentobjective) historically. Hence, investors might need to incorporate qualitative fund research on a strategy they are keen on investing in to decide whether previous managers have fallen flat in the past.

### Closing to New Investors

Funds might close to new investors which is totally different than a full fund closing. Closing to new investors may really be an indication of the fame of the fund and consideration from investors for better than expected [returns](/return).

## Reverse Survivorship Bias

Reverse survivorship bias depicts an undeniably more uncommon situation where low-performers stay in the game, while high performers are coincidentally dropped from the running. An illustration of reverse survivorship can be seen in the Russell 2000 index that is a subset of the 2000 smallest securities from the Russell 3000. The loser stocks stay small and remain in the small-cap index while the victors leave the index once they become too big and fruitful.

## Highlights
- Survivorship bias happens when just the victors are considered while the losers that have disappeared are not thought of.
- This can happen while assessing mutual fund performance (where merged or defunct funds are excluded) or market index performance (where stocks that have been dropped from the index out of the blue are disposed of).
- Survivorship bias slants the average outcomes vertical for the index or getting through funds, making them seem to perform better since underperformers have been ignored.
