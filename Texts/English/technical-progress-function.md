# Technical Progress Function (TPF)
## What Is the Technical Progress Function?

The technical progress function (TPF) is a part of a macroeconomic growth model that accounts for the impact of technology and technological progress on the total amount of economic output a society can and delivers as well as the productivity of the factors of production that a society utilizes. Previous models of macroeconomic growth zeroed in on factors, for example, natural resource blessings, a developing labor force, or the accumulation of capital goods and equipment to make sense of economic growth and development. In the twentieth century the job of technical improvements in how these different production factors could be combined all the more effectively to further develop their productivity turned out to be widely recognized among financial specialists as a key to economic growth. The incorporation of a TPF into models of macroeconomic growth by several unique financial specialists brought this recognition into formal economic modeling.

The TPF in a given macroeconomic model determines in mathematical terms the relationship between technological progress and increase in output. The specific forms and structure of the TPF might differ starting with one macroeconomic model then onto the next, however they generally show that an increase in the rate of technical progress is the most — or one of the most — important factor(s) in advancing overall productivity and economic growth. Technological progress can be an important factor in a country's economic growth since it assists a nation with creating more using better technology on the information side of the production equation.

In light of these macroeconomic models, econometric techniques can be utilized to estimate the influence of technological progress on total economic output observationally using a regression model. In this way, as opposed to taking a gander at [economic production growth](/economicgrowth) simply in terms of information allocation proficiency, the technical progress function gives a method for estimating technological progress as a supporter of conclusive production overall.

## Figuring out the TPF

The TPF is a part of a multifactor regression model used to comprehend total production and what various variables mean for total production. In an essential production regression, the output is made sense of by the level of effectiveness in which fundamental variables are allocated to production. For instance, labor and machinery are two essential variables that influence production.

With more in depth analysis, economic analysts might look to break out technological progress into two components. The two principal components are as a rule:

- **Encapsulated technical progress**: Improved technology which is ascribed to investments in new equipment. New technical changes that are made are encapsulated in the equipment.
- **Bodiless technical progress**: Improved technology which brings about output increases without investing in new equipment.

The technical progress function is an additional variable to a production regression analysis. Essentially, an extra function of the equation gives knowledge on technological contributions to production that are not made sense of by any of the other fundamental sources of info. Generally, as technological progress increases, more production is credited to technical progress inside the production equation and less to different variables.

## The Solow Residual

[Robert Solow](/blackscholes) received a Nobel Prize for his work on concepts of technical progress function, otherwise called the Solow Residual and total factor productivity (TFP). Solow spread out the growth model used to figure out productivity with his model specifying the various functions that influence productivity. Solow's model incorporates the functions of capital, labor, and technological progress. Later specialists have modified Solow's model for the inclusion of extra variables, like human capital.

In Solow's model, the TPF is the perusing on how much technological progress is affecting the total output.

While involving the model for the years 1909-49 in the United States, Solow found that only one-eighth of the increase in labor productivity in the United States could be credited to increased capital. The rest was a consequence of technical progress in how labor and capital were utilized. America, all in all, became great due to American expertise and innovation.

Total factor productivity can be impacted by different influences. While all under the umbrella of technological progress, influences can incorporate tech, social factors, and new economic efficiencies. In that capacity, the technical progress function and TFP can likewise be utilized to dissect differences in nations' technological influences and technological progress.

## Features
- The TPF measures how much economic growth can be credited to technological progress innovation in a country.
- The TPF is a part of a macroeconomic model concentrating on how various factors influence total production.
- Technical progress can appear as either exemplified in new equipment or immaterial in productivity gains from new innovations unrelated to equipment.
