# Credit Card Authorized User
## What Is a Credit Card Authorized User?

A credit card authorized client is a person who has permission to utilize someone else's [credit card](/creditcard) yet isn't legally responsible for paying the bill. For personal cards, authorized users are normally family members, like a child or a spouse. Contingent upon the credit card issuer, some credit card companies give a unique card to authorized users linked to the holder of the primary account. Others essentially approve a credit card authorized client to make purchases with the primary account holder's card.

Authorized users commonly report lost or taken cards, receive account data, for example, credit limit, accessible balance, and fees, make payments and start billing debates. Cards generally don't allow authorized users to close an account, add one more authorized client, change the address or [PIN](/personal-ID number) or request a change to the credit limit or interest rate.

## Understanding Credit Card Authorized User

A credit card authorized client isn't obligated for the payments that they charge to the credit card. However the genuine cardholder for the most part anticipates that the authorized client should pay the costs of anything they purchase on the card, that is at last an agreement between the cardholder and the authorized client. For instance, in the event that one member of a couple is an authorized client on the other's credit card and two or three separates, the cardholder is legally responsible for covering any charges on the card assuming that the authorized client won't make the payments.

Authorized users in some cases opt to just pay the cardholder any money owed on the card, so the cardholder can pay the balance, or the cardholder gives them access to the card's account with the goal that the authorized client can make the actual payments. At times, for example, when a child is an authorized client, the cardholder basically pays the whole balance all alone.

## Effects on Credit

Many individuals become authorized users of others' credit cards as a method for building or rebuild credit. Assuming that a person has no credit, or on the other hand if their [credit score](/credit_score) is especially low, they might possibly raise their credit score by turning into an authorized client of a credit card that the cardholder utilizes dependably. Be that as it may, in the event that the cardholder doesn't utilize the card dependably and their credit score sinks, this might possibly drag down the credit score of the authorized client.

Likewise, an authorized client can drag down a cardholder's credit score, contingent upon how they utilize the card. Say a cardholder and an authorized client have a personal agreement that the authorized client needs to pay the issuer straightforwardly for any charges made on the card. In any case, in the event that the authorized client neglects to make payments on time and the cardholder is either unaware of this or unfit to step in and make the actual payments to stay away from a late payment, the cardholder's credit endures, due to a late payment on the primary cardholder's credit history.
