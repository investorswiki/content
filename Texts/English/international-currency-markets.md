The currency market, or [foreign exchange market ("forex")](/foreign-exchange-markets), was made to work with the exchange of currency that is essential as the aftereffect of foreign trade. For instance, in the event that a Canadian company sells a product to a U.S. firm, it'll need to be paid in Canadian dollars. The U.S. firm would have to work with a foreign exchange conversion through its bank to pay the Canadian company. The U.S. firm's bank account would be charged in U.S dollars. The U.S. bank would transfer the funds to the Canadian company's bank. The funds would be changed over completely to Canadian dollars at a preset exchange rate and credited to the Canadian company's account.

The global currency market assists with working with foreign trade since it permits companies to sell their goods globally and get compensated in their nearby currency. Companies should be paid in their nearby currency since their expenses, like payroll, are in their neighborhood currency.

The forex market varies from the stock market in that it doesn't include a [clearinghouse](/clearinghouse). Transactions happen straightforwardly between parties without an intermediary to guarantee that each party consents to its obligations. Currencies don't accompany a single price however are priced in terms of different currencies.

## The Major Currency Pairs

Below are the major currency pairs that are generally widely exchanged for one another.

- EUR/USD: the [euro](/euro) of the [Eurozone](/eurozone) versus the U.S. dollar
- USD/JPY: the U.S. dollar versus the [Japanese yen](/jpy-japanese-yen)

- USD/CAD: the U.S. dollar versus the [Canadian dollar](/cad-canadian-dollar)
- AUD/USD: the [Australian dollar](/aud-australian-dollar) versus the U.S. dollar

The U.S. dollar is viewed as the world's reserve currency since the U.S. has a stable economy and financial system. Numerous products, commodities, and investments are executed in U.S. dollars, which is the reason it's included the greater part of the major transactions and currency exchanges. Countries that don't have a stable market or currency exchange rate could opt to trade in dollars to draw in investment and work with trade.

In any case, there are numerous other currency pairs that are traded globally. Despite the fact that China has the yuan and the renminbi as their currencies, the greater part of the transactions including U.S. trade with China are worked with in U.S. dollars.

## Safe-Haven Currencies

Certain currencies have taken on a specific identity or job in the global markets. For instance, Switzerland has long been viewed as a safe place to store money in times of political and economic disturbance. During upsetting times, forex conversions from the other global currencies into Swiss francs will in general increase altogether.

Japan is likewise thought to be a [safe-haven](/safe-shelter) for investment flows since Japan is viewed as a stable economy. In times of economic downturns, numerous investors exchange their investments designated in dollars, euros, and pounds for [Japanese government bonds (JGBs)](/jgb), which are guaranteed by the government of Japan. Thus, the yen will in general appreciate against other major currencies during downturns. For instance, U.S. investors could sell their dollar-named [mutual funds](/mutualfund) or investments for yen-designated Japanese government bonds, and in doing as such, make the yen appreciate against the dollar due to the forex conversion.

## International Currency Market Players

In spite of the fact that there are numerous participants engaged with the global currency markets, below are a portion of the major players that are engaged with the forex markets.

### Corporations

Sometimes corporations enter the forex market to [hedge](/hedge) their international money transfers and foreign profits. A U.S. company with broad operations in Mexico, for instance, may go into a [forward contract](/forwardcontract), which only secures in the exchange rate between the dollar and the Mexican peso. Thus, when it comes time to bring those Mexican profits home, the profits earned in pesos wouldn't be subject to startling exchange rate vacillations. All things being equal, the pesos would be switched over completely to dollars at the preset forward exchange rate. Companies use forwards as part of an overall gamble management strategy to assist with forestalling currency exchange rates from affecting earnings or profits.

### Governments and Central Banks

Governments might look to influence the value of their currencies-called [devaluation](/devaluation)- to assist with expanding their exports or foreign sales. A country's [central bank](/centralbank), which deals with a country's money supply, may enter the market to sell the country's currency, assisting with pushing the value down. At the point when the exchange rate declines versus the other major currencies, the country benefits from having less expensive exports exclusively due to the exchange rate.

For instance, if the U.S. furthermore, British pound exchange rate was $2, and an investor wanted to buy a home in Britain that costs 200,000 pounds, it would cost the investor $400,000 (2 * 200,000 pounds). In the event that Britain brought their exchange rate down to $1.50, the U.S. investor could now buy a similar property for $300,000 (1.50 * 200,000 pounds).

Accordingly, the cheapening of the British currency would probably draw in gigantic buying interest from foreign investors supporting demand for British goods, real estate, and reinforcing the British economy. Sometimes countries that take part in currency exchange rate devaluations can be marked a "currency [manipulator](/control)."
