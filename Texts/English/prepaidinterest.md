## What Is Prepaid Interest?

Prepaid interest is the interest that a [debtor](/debtor) pays before the first scheduled debt repayment. For taxation purposes, most sorts of prepaid interest are discounted over the life of the loan. For [mortgage loans](/mortgage), prepaid interest can likewise be the interim interest that builds from the settlement day to the beginning of the first mortgage period.

## Figuring out Prepaid Interest

During the last phase of a mortgage loan processing (normally alluded to as the [closing](/closing)), the homebuyer will receive an itemized [disclosure statement](/disclosurestatement) listing every one of the costs connected with the property purchase. This rundown can incorporate real estate taxes, loan fees, recording fees, title company costs, and different expenses. Among the expenses due at closing are prepaid interest charges, which alludes to the daily interest that builds on the mortgage from the closing date until the first month to month mortgage payment is due.

Contingent upon when escrow shuts, the borrower's first mortgage payment could be a long time or more later on. The prepaid interest due at closing is the [mortgage interest](/mortgageinterest) the borrower owes the lender during this time period before the first mortgage payment. While prepaid interest can happen in different types of loan circumstances where the borrower pays interest in advance before it [accrues](/gather), it's normally associated with mortgages.

## Mortgage Points

[Mortgage points](/points), a sort of fee that mortgage lenders charge borrowers, are viewed as a type of prepaid interest. Additionally alluded to as [discount points](/discountpoints), the one-time fee empowers borrowers to reduce the amount of interest they pay the lender over the life of the loan. As a rule, the borrower will pay 1% of the total loan amount for each discount point. Each point reduces the interest rate on the mortgage by one-eighth to one-fourth of a percent.

Like different types of prepaid interest, points are commonly deducted over the life of the loan (in this case, a mortgage). Given that certain conditions are met, the [Internal Revenue Service (IRS)](/irs) permits this type of prepaid interest to be deducted in the year in which it is paid.

Be that as it may, a borrower might find it trying to haggle such changes with the lender.

Feasible for the prepaid interest is due to change between the time of the loan estimate and the time of the closing disclosure. The charges might be prorated daily from the closing till the first mortgage payment comes due. That calculation will be founded on the [annual interest rate](/apr) that will be applied to the mortgage. The specific calculation might differ by lender. There might be options to skip payments on the mortgage, yet the prepaid interest will in any case should be covered.

## Special Considerations

On the off chance that a borrower tries to refinance a mortgage, this could influence the prepaid interest on the new financing. The principal amount that remaining parts due might be structured so that permits the borrower to skip a payment. The borrower will in any case be responsible for the outstanding amount and should make prepaid interest on what is negotiated under the new terms of the financing they have obtained.
