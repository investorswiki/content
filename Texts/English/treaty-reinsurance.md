# Treaty Reinsurance
## What Is Treaty Reinsurance?

Treaty reinsurance is insurance purchased by an insurance company from another insurer. The company that issues the insurance is called the [cedent](/cedent), who passes on every one of the risks of a specific class of policies to the purchasing company, which is the reinsurer.

Treaty reinsurance is one of the three fundamental types of [reinsurance](/reinsurance) contracts. The two others are facultative reinsurance and excess of loss reinsurance.

## Grasping Treaty Reinsurance

Treaty reinsurance addresses a contract between the ceding insurance company and the reinsurer who consents to acknowledge the risks of a predetermined class of policies throughout some stretch of time.

At the point when insurance companies [underwrite](/underwriting) another policy, they consent to face extra risk challenges exchange for a [premium](/insurance-premium). The more policies an insurer guarantees, the more risk it accepts. One way an insurer can reduce its exposure is to surrender a portion of the risk to a reinsurance company in exchange for a fee. Reinsurance permits the insurer to free up risk limit and to shield itself from high seriousness claims.

Even however the reinsurer may not quickly guarantee every individual policy, it actually consents to cover every one of the risks in a treaty reinsurance contract.

By signing a treaty reinsurance contract, the reinsurer and the ceding insurance company show the business relationship will probably be long-term. The long-term nature of the agreement permits the reinsurer to plan out how to accomplish a profit since it knows the type of risk it is taking on, and it knows all about the [ceding company](/ceding-company).

Treaty reinsurance contracts can be both proportional and non-proportional. With proportional contracts, the reinsurer consents to take on a specific percentage share of policies, for which it will receive that extent of premiums. On the off chance that a claim is recorded, it will pay the stated percentage too. With a non-proportional contract, be that as it may, the reinsurance company consents to pay out claims on the off chance that they surpass a predefined amount during a certain period of time.

## Benefits of Treaty Reinsurance

By covering itself against a class of predetermined risks, treaty reinsurance gives the ceding insurer greater security for its equity and greater stability when uncommon or significant events happen.

Reinsurance likewise permits an insurer to endorse policies that cover a bigger volume of risks without excessively raising the expenses of covering its solvency edges. Truth be told, reinsurance makes substantial liquid assets accessible for insurers in case of outstanding losses.

## Treaty versus Facultative versus Excess of Loss Reinsurance

Treaty reinsurance varies from [facultative reinsurance](/facultative-reinsurance). Treaty reinsurance includes a single contract covering a type of risk and doesn't need the reinsurance company to give a facultative certificate each time a risk is moved from the insurer to the reinsurer.

Facultative risk, then again, permits the reinsurer to acknowledge or dismiss individual risks. Besides, it is a type of reinsurance for a single or a specific package of risks. That means both the reinsurer and the cedent settle on what risks will be covered in the agreement. These agreements are generally negotiated separately for every policy.

The expenses engaged with underwriting facultative contracts are in this manner significantly more costly than a treaty reinsurance agreement. Treaty reinsurance is less value-based and more averse to imply risks that would have in any case been dismissed from reinsurance arrangements.

[Excess of loss reinsurance](/excess-loss-reinsurance) is a non-proportional form of reinsurance. In an excess of loss contract, the reinsurer consents to pay the total amount of losses or a certain percentage of losses over a certain limit to the cedent. Excess of loss reinsurance is less like standard insurance, similar to treaty and facultative reinsurance are, frequently requiring both the cedent and reinsurer to share in the losses.
