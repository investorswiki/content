## What Is a Small Trader?

A small trader alludes to a market participant whose buying and selling activity is small enough for them to be exempt from certain regulatory requirements. It is frequently used to allude to retail traders or small financial firms, whose trading volumes are somewhat low.

Large traders, conversely, are required to register with regulators and consistently file reports unveiling their activities. For instance, large traders must register with the [Securities and Exchange Commission](/sec) (SEC) by filing Form 13H.

## Seeing Small Traders

Various exchanges will have separate standards connecting with how large a specific market participant can be before they are required to make special divulgences about their trades. On account of the SEC, a trader is small if their daily [trading volume](/volume) is not exactly either 2,000,000 shares or $20 million during any calendar day, or 20 million shares or $200 million during any calendar month. In practice, in this way, essentially all market participants are small traders, beside [ultra high net-worth individuals](/ultra-high-net-worth-individuals-uhnwi) and exceptionally large firms.

Generally talking, regulators decide the amount of small traders active in the market by taking the total volume for the whole marketplace and deducting the volume reported by large traders. The remainder is of course owing to small traders, however this methodology doesn't need the individual small traders to be recognized.

The explanation that small traders don't face the level of regulatory examination required of large traders is that they are ventured to have a lesser ability to influence or [manipulate the market](/control). For example, small traders' trading choices are probably not going to impact the overall price of a given security, and small traders are probably not going to prevail in purposely cornering a market. At a useful level, regulators would likewise battle to investigate small traders' activities on the grounds that the administrative burden of doing so would be restrictively costly.

## Genuine Example of a Small Trader

One illustration of where small traders are recognized by regulators can be found in the Commitments of Traders (COT) report issued by the [Commodity Futures Trading Commission](/cftc) (CFTC). The COT report is distributed each Friday, and it frames the size and course of all positions taken in a specific commodity, partitioning this data into trades made by [commercial traders](/commercialtraders), [non-commercial traders](/noncommercialtrader), and non-reportable traders.

This last category, non-reportable traders, incorporates small traders whose position sizes are too low to require active reporting or monitoring under the CFTC's rules. Different regulators and financial go-betweens, for example, [clearinghouses](/clearinghouse) and [brokerage firms](/brokerage-organization), normally follow comparable procedures while monitoring and uncovering their clients' trades.
