# Next-Day Funds
## DEFINITION of Next-Day Funds

In banking, next-day funds are money that opens up for use on the next [business day](/business-day) following the day it is deposited. In investing, next-day funds are available the business day following a trade; be that as it may, most trades have used same-day funds settlement starting around 1996, in light of the Group of 30's recommendations for further developing settlement and clearance risk, productivity and cost. Same-day funds are available the day the trade is completed or the day the funds are deposited. Some [mutual funds](/venture store), be that as it may, are available the next business day after the trade is made, or may not be available for up to three business days.

## BREAKING DOWN Next-Day Funds

Bank deposits must be cleared and settled before they become available. This includes transferring deposits and withdrawals among banks and guaranteeing that adequate funds are available to complete the transactions.

On account of the coming of electronic [check conversion](/check-conversion) and substitute checks or picture replacement archives (IRDs), deposited funds can frequently be made available the day after they are deposited, because the use of electronic check conversion and substitute checks substantially facilitates the check-going through process. A statutory hold under the [Expedited Funds Availability Act](/expedited-funds-availability-act) (EFAA) expects banks to make the first $200 of a deposit available the next business day, with $400 available on the second business day and the lay available on the third business day. Banks must make their funds availability policies available to customers, yet while most banks will consider holds of two, three, five, or seven business days in their policies, they can usually make funds available the next day because of the expedited check-going through process.

## Exceptions to the Next-Day Funds Rule

A few types of bank deposits must be made available as same-day funds. These incorporate checks for under $200, clerk's checks, USPS money orders, U.S. Treasury checks and on-us checks, or checks drawn from the same bank as that at which they're being deposited. Wire transfers, [direct deposits](/directdeposit) and different forms of electronic deposits are likewise generally made available as same-day funds.

## Cut-Off Times for Next-Day Funds

To receive funds the next day, they must be deposited before the bank's cut-off times for processing deposits. This can occur as soon as noon at an ATM or other off-premises banking location, and as soon as 2 p.m. at a branch, albeit cut-off times for mobile deposits can be pretty much as late as 5 p.m.
