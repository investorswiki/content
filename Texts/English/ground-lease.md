Ground leases are likewise frequently called land leases, as landlords lease out the land as it were.

Despite the fact that they are utilized principally in the commercial space, ground leases contrast significantly from different types of commercial leases like those found in shopping edifices and office buildings.

## Subordinated versus Unsubordinated Ground Leases

For this type of ground lease, the landlord might arrange higher rent payments in return for the risk taken on in case of tenant default. This may likewise benefit the landlord in light of the fact that developing a building on his land increases the value of his property.

Since the lender may not take ownership of the land on the off chance that the loan goes unpaid, loan experts might be reluctant to expand a mortgage for improvements. Albeit the landlord holds ownership of the property, they regularly need to charge the tenant a lower amount of rent.
