# Alternative Fuels Tax Credit
## What Is the Alternative Fuels Tax Credit?

The alternative fuels credit is a[ non-refundable tax credit](/nonrefundabletaxcredit) granted to [taxpayers](/taxpayer) who use non-liquor alternative fuels that are either sold monetarily by the taxpayer or utilized in the taxpayer's vehicles for business.

## Understanding the Alternative Fuels Tax Credit

The alternative fuels credit, which is nitty gritty in the[ Internal Revenue Code (IRC)](/internal-revenue-code), originated from the possibility that the U.S. ought to reduce its reliance on imported oil and embrace advanced fuels and vehicle innovations.

Especially persuasive in the development of the IRC's perspectives on alternative fuels were the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 (Jobs Bill), the Safe, Accountable, Flexible, Efficient Transportation Equity Act: A Legacy for Users (Highway Bill), and the Energy Policy Act of 2005 (EPAct 2005). The fuel credits for [biodiesel](/biodiesel) or renewable diesel credits, as well as fuel combinations, including ethanol/gasoline mixes, were laid out in the Volumetric Excise Tax Credit (VEETC) portion of the Jobs Bill. They are intended to give incentives to create, sell, and utilize these fuels.

The Internal Revenue Service believes alternative fuels to be liquefied petroleum gas (LPG), compacted natural gas (CNG), liquefied natural gas (LNG), liquefied hydrogen, liquid fuel derived from coal (counting peat) through the Fischer-Tropsch process, liquid hydrocarbons derived from biomass, and P-Series fuels. Note that [hydrocarbons](/hydrocarbon) incorporate liquids that contain oxygen, hydrogen, and carbon, and that liquid hydrocarbons derived from biomass incorporate ethanol, biodiesel, and renewable diesel.

Nonetheless, the IRS does exclude these fuels in the alternative fuels category. [Tax incentives](/tax-benefit) for these fuels are covered under the fuel categories of gasoline and diesel, separately.
