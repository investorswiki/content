GAAS assists with guaranteeing the precision, consistency, and unquestionable status of auditors' activities and reports.

## Grasping the Generally Accepted Auditing Standards

GAAS are the auditing standards that assist with estimating the quality of audits. Auditors survey and report on the financial records of companies as indicated by the generally accepted auditing standards.

Auditors are entrusted with deciding if the financial statements of public companies follow generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). GAAP is a set of accounting standards that companies must follow while reporting their financial statements. Auditors survey an organization's financial numbers and accounting practices to guarantee they're reliable and conform to GAAP. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) expects that the financial statements of public companies are inspected by outside, independent auditors.
