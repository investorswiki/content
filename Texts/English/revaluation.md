## What Is a Revaluation?

A revaluation is a calculated vertical adjustment to a country's official [exchange rate](/exchangerate) relative to a picked baseline. The baseline can incorporate wage rates, the cost of gold, or a foreign currency. Revaluation is something contrary to [devaluation](/devaluation), which is a descending adjustment of a country's official exchange rate.

## Grasping a Revaluation

In a [fixed exchange rate](/fixedexchangerate) system, just a decision by a country's government, for example, its [central bank](/centralbank), can modify the official value of the currency. Creating economies are bound to involve a fixed-rate system to limit speculation and give a stable system.

A floating rate is something contrary to a fixed rate. In a floating rate environment, revaluation can happen consistently, as seen by the recognizable changes in the foreign currency market and the associated exchange rates.

The U.S. had a fixed exchange rate until 1973 when President Richard Nixon eliminated the United States from the [gold standard](/goldstandard) and presented a floating rate system. In spite of the fact that China has an advanced economy, its currency has been fixed beginning around 1994. Before the Chinese government revalued its currency in 2005, it was [pegged to the U.S. dollar](/currency-stake). After revaluation, it was pegged to a basket of world currencies.

## Effects of Revaluations

Revaluations influence both the currency being analyzed and the valuation of assets held by foreign companies in that particular currency. Since a revaluation can possibly change the exchange rate between two countries and their particular currencies, the [book values](/bookvalue) of foreign-held assets might need to be adjusted to mirror the impact of the change in the exchange rate.

This outcomes in its currency being two times as costly when compared to U.S. dollars than it was beforehand.

In the event that the previously mentioned currency revaluation happened, any assets held by a U.S. company in the foreign economy should be revalued. If the asset, held in foreign currency, was recently valued at $100,000 in light of the old exchange rate, the revaluation would require its value to be changed to $200,000. This change mirrors the new value of the foreign asset, in the home currency, by adjusting for the revaluation of the currency in question.
