# Fully Paid Shares
## What Are Fully Paid Shares?

Fully paid shares are shares issued for which no more money is required to be paid to the company by shareholders on the value of the shares. At the point when a company issues [shares](/shares) upon incorporation or through an initial or secondary issuance, shareholders are required to pay a set amount for those shares. When the company has received the full amount from shareholders, the shares become fully paid shares.

> Shareholders of partially paid shares have a similar shareholder rights as fully paid shareholders.

## How Fully Paid Shares Work

Fully paid shares are unique in relation to partially paid shares in which just a portion of the market value has been received by the company. On account of partially paid shares, the [shareholder](/shareholder) is as yet required to pay the excess amount to the company. For instance, suppose Company XYZ sells shares for $50 per share. On the off chance that the company gets $50, the share is a fully paid share, however on the off chance that under $50 has been collected, it is a partially funded share.

For the end goal of accounting, companies issue shares with a par value, which is a nominal amount, for example, $1. Typically, in any case, the market value is a lot higher, and the amount over the [par value](/parvalue) is called the share premium.

## Fully Paid Shares versus Partly Paid Shares

Regularly, shares issued are fully paid. That is, investors pay the full amount per share. Once in a while companies will issue unpaid or partially paid shares, notwithstanding, on the off chance that the shareholder needs time to access the vital funds yet focuses on a payment schedule. At times, giving unpaid shares may likewise be more helpful for a new business.

Typically, partially paid shares are possibly issued to a shareholder in the event that there are convincing business motivations to do as such. For example, a company might expect to issue shares to a strategically adjusted partner, who has deficient funds to pay for every one of the shares at the hour of issue.

Generally, the shareholder and the company concur at the hour of issue when the company can call on payment. The company may then issue partly paid shares alongside a payment schedule that lays out when the shareholder must pay the balance. After the company gets the balance, the partially paid shares convert to fully paid shares.

Partially paid shares have similar rights as fully paid shareholders, including:

- Right to dividend payments
- Right to vote at shareholders' meetings
- Right to participate after ending up of the company

Generally, a shareholder's right to dividend payments is proportionate to the amount they have previously paid. At a shareholders' meeting where voting is by a raising of hands, a shareholder with partly paid shares will have similar vote as a shareholder with fully paid shares (one vote for every share).
