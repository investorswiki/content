# Tactical Asset Allocation (TAA)
## What Is Tactical Asset Allocation (TAA)?

Tactical asset allocation is a [active management](/activemanagement) portfolio strategy that shifts the percentage of assets held in different categories to exploit market pricing [anomalies](/abnormality) or strong market sectors. This strategy permits portfolio managers to make extra value by exploiting certain circumstances in the marketplace. It is a moderately active strategy since managers return to the portfolio's original asset mix once arriving at the ideal short-term profits.

## Tactical Asset Allocation (TAA) Basics

To comprehend tactical asset allocation, one must initially comprehend [strategic asset allocation](/strategicassetallocation). A portfolio manager might make a [investor policy statement](/ips) (IPS) to set the strategic mix of assets for inclusion in the client's holdings. The manager will take a gander at many factors, for example, the required rate of return, acceptable risk levels, legal and liquidity requirements, taxes, time horizon, and unique investor conditions.

The percentage of weighting that each [asset class](/assetclasses) has over the long term is known as the strategic asset allocation. This allocation is the mix of assets and weights that assist an investor with arriving at their specific objectives. Coming up next is a simple illustration of commonplace portfolio allocation and the weight of every asset class.

- Cash = 10%
- Bonds = 35%
- Stocks = 45%
- Commodities = 10%

## The Usefulness of Tactical Asset Allocation

Tactical asset allocation is the method involved with taking an active position on the strategic asset allocation itself and adjusting long-term [target weights](/portfolio-weight) for a short period to capitalize on the market or economic opportunities. For instance, expect that data proposes that there will be a substantial increase in demand for commodities over the course of the next 18 months. It very well might be prudent for an investor to shift more capital into that asset class to make the most of the opportunity. While the portfolio's strategic allocation will continue as before, the tactical allocation may then turn into:

- Cash = 5%
- Bonds = 35%
- Stocks = 45%
- Commodities = 15%

Tactical shifts may likewise go in close vicinity to an asset class. Accept the 45% strategic allocation of stocks comprises of 30% large-cap and 15% [small-cap](/small-cap) holdings. In the event that the outlook for small-cap stocks doesn't look good, it could be a shrewd tactical decision to shift the allocation inside stocks to 40% large-cap and 5% small-cap for a brief time frame until conditions change.

Generally, tactical shifts range from 5% to 10%, however they might be lower. In practice, it is unusual to change any asset class by over 10% tactically. This large adjustment would show a fundamental problem with the construction of the strategic asset allocation.

Tactical asset allocation is not the same as [rebalancing](/rebalancing) a portfolio. During rebalancing, trades are made to take the portfolio back to its ideal strategic asset allocation. Tactical asset allocation changes the strategic asset allocation for a brief time frame, fully intent on returning to the strategic allocation once the short-term opportunities vanish.
