# Inverse Transaction
## What Is an Inverse Transaction?

Inverse transaction happens when someone makes a trade to close with a counterparty, who has the contrary position thus closes their position too with a similar trade.

The term inverse transaction is most frequently utilized with regards to closing a [forward](/forwardcontract) or options contract with a similar [value date](/valuedate). This permits the investor to evaluate the profit or loss of the whole transaction.

## Grasping Inverse Transactions

An inverse transaction is one that is utilized to fix or offset another transaction made beforehand by an investor with a similar transaction subtleties. Inverse transactions are normally utilized with [options](/choice) and forwards. This leaves the investor with a fixed gain or loss when the transaction is closed.

Investors who purchase forwards can decide to claim the [underlying asset](/underlying-asset), like a currency, at the hour of expiration or they can close the contract before the [expiration date](/expiration-date) is reached. To close the position, the investor must buy or sell a [offsetting transaction](/offsetting-transaction).

In the event that the inverse transaction is completed with an alternate party other than the investor purchased the first forward contract through, then, at that point, this outcomes in a separate trade that completely covers or locks in the profit or loss on the primary transaction. The principal transaction won't be closed out, even however the net aftereffect of these two transactions offsets since they were finished through two distinct gatherings.

An inverse transaction can bring about either a profit or loss to the investor. Assuming that the trades use leverage (where the investor gets funds to start the transactions), then the losses could trigger [margin calls](/margincall).

> An inverse transaction can be made through a clearinghouse that coordinates the transaction subtleties from the investor with the transaction subtleties of an outside buyer or seller.

## Illustration of an Inverse Transaction

Here is a theoretical illustration of how inverse transactions work. Expect an American company purchases a \u20ac150,000 forward contract at the predetermined price of $1.20 per one [euro](/euro) in April to be executed in June. It can do an inverse transaction by selling \u20ac150,000 with a similar expiration date as the forward it purchased in April.

By doing this, the company has [locked in](/locked_in) a profit or loss. This will be the amount of money received for selling the euro less the amount paid for the purchase of the euros with the forward contract. On the off chance that the euro ascends in value since the purchase, the buyer ends up as a winner.

Suppose the two gatherings consent to an exchange rate of $1.20 [EUR/USD](/eur-usd-euro-us-dollar-currency-pair), so assuming the price ascends to $1.25, they were better off buying at $1.20. Then again, on the off chance that the euro tumbles to $1.15, they are more terrible off since they are contractually committed to execute at $1.20.

Companies use forwards to lock in rates on funds they will require from now on and are more worried about understanding what their future cash inflows and outpourings will be, as opposed to the potential price [volatility](/volatility).
