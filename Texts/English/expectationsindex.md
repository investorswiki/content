# Expectations Index
## What Is the Expectations Index?

The Expectations Index is a part of the [Consumer Confidence Index\u00ae](/cci) (CCI), which is distributed every month by the [Conference Board](/conferenceboard). The CCI mirrors consumers' present moment — that is, half year — outlook for, and sentiment about, the performance of the overall economy as it effects them. The Expectations Index is comprised of the average of the CCI parts that deal with half year outlooks for business, employment, and income.

## Understanding the Expectations Index

The Expectations Index involves precisely 60 percent of the overall Consumer Confidence Index; the CCI is an average of reactions to five survey questions, three of which deal with expectations over the course of the next six months. The average of those three things makes up the Expectations Index.

Participants in the Consumer Confidence Survey answer inquiries regarding whether, in the next six months, they anticipate that business conditions should be better, more terrible, or the equivalent; and assuming they accept that employment and income is expected to increase, decline, or remain something very similar. Respondents can address each inquiry with one of three reactions: "positive, negative, or neutral." The survey likewise poses valuable inquiries about participants' spending plans throughout the next six months and their outlook for inflation, interest rates, and stock prices over the course of the next 12 months.

The other 40 percent of the CCI is utilized to determine the [Present Situation Index](/presentsituationindex). Dissimilar to the Expectations Index, the Present Situation Index, as its name suggests, is worried about how consumers feel about a set of economic factors **now**, not what they think those factors would resemble sooner rather than later. The two indexes are produced from reactions accumulated by the Conference Board's month to month Consumer Confidence Survey\u00ae.

This survey surveys 5,000 families about their mentalities toward winning business and economic conditions, and their contemplations about what might foster in the months ahead. When the survey data for the present and expected conditions are collected, the two sub-indexes are combined to make the complete Consumer Confidence Index, where the data are organized by age, income, and region, among other demographic factors. The CCI is widely viewed as an accurate [leading economic indicator](/leadingindicator) for the United States economy.

## Expectations Index Is a Critical Component of CCI

Since the Expectations Index might be utilized to check future trends, and may influence current dynamic behavior, it is the main part of the Consumer Confidence Index; and businesses frequently use it to assist with pursuing better-informed choices or changes in strategy.

For instance, assuming the Expectations Index shows that consumers probably wouldn't spend more on discretionary travel during the next six months, then the relaxation industry probably won't build new luxury lodgings in that time span.

Or on the other hand, on the off chance that the Expectations Index demonstrates that business conditions, employment, and income probably would continue as before as opposed to rising over the course of the next six months, then, at that point, executives could choose to delay investments in new ventures until a later date.
