# Quantity Discount
## What Is a Quantity Discount?

A quantity discount is an incentive offered to a buyer that outcomes in a diminished [cost per unit](/unitcost) of goods or materials when purchased in greater numbers. A quantity [discount](/discount) is frequently offered by sellers to captivate customers to purchase in bigger amounts.

The [seller](/seller) can move more goods or materials, and the buyer gets a better price for them. At the consumer level, a quantity discount can show up as a BOGO (buy one, get one discount) or different incentives, like buy two, get one free.

## How a Quantity Discount Works

Retailers frequently get better arrangements assuming they order business as usual thing. For instance, the cost per unit for shirts may be $7.50 per unit if under 48 pieces are ordered; $7.25 per unit if 49-72 pieces are ordered; or $7 per unit in the event that at least 73 pieces are ordered.

Contingent upon the quantity discount, all pieces ordered must be delivered and paid for by a certain date. Alternatively, the purchases and payments can be spread out over a predefined period of time.

By selling in bigger amounts, the seller can increase their [revenues](/income) per [transaction](/transaction) (RPT). The vendor can likewise scale quantity discounts in "ventures," with lower per-unit prices at higher amounts to empower bulk buyers. For example, a coat creator that utilizes "ventures" in its pricing strategy could offer coats at $20 every, five for $90, and 10 for $160.

## Advantages and Disadvantages of Quantity Discounts

Quantity discounting can be productive. The principal benefit is to increase total sales volume to acknowledge [economies of scale](/economiesofscale). Quantity discounts help [units per transaction](/units-per-transaction) (UPT). The subsequent increased sales volume can lead to economies of scale through purchasing goods and materials in bulk at a quantity discount from providers, and the ability to consolidate incidental per-order costs, like delivery and bundling, into one sale. These economies of scale can possibly reduce per-unit costs to the seller.

Quantity discounting can likewise prove to be useful when a seller is quick to bring down its [inventory](/inventory). Making a such move can be especially valuable when the product being referred to risks leaving fashion or becoming [obsolete](/obsoleteinventory), due to an innovative forward leap.

However, there are several provisos to this strategy. The principal disadvantage of quantity discounts is that the discount presses [profit](/profit) per unit, otherwise called the [marginal profit](/marginal-profit), except if adequate economies of scale are realized to basically offset the discount offer.

In this way, if the per-unit cost for the coat company is $10, the company makes a $10 profit on each and every $20 sale. Be that as it may, on the off chance that the company offers quantity discounts of $2 per coat for orders of five coats and $4 per coat for orders of 10 coats, then, at that point, it makes just $8 in marginal profit on an order of five and $6 in marginal profit on an order of 10. That would of course change assuming the coat company can set aside cash by, for instance, buying in bulk from its providers.

## Quantity Discount versus Linear Pricing

At the point when companies price their goods and services, they generally have two options: quantity discounting or linear pricing. A linear pricing strategy is more straightforward to oversee for business owners than quantity discount pricing and makes it simpler for them to keep up with the marginal profit on every thing.

For example, a T-shirt company that utilizes linear pricing would sell a single shirt for $20, five shirts for $100, and 10 for $200. In the event that each shirt costs $10 to make, each shirt will get $10 in marginal profit, paying little heed to the number of are sold in an order.

The primary downside of linear pricing is that it doesn't give an incentive to buy in bigger amounts. At the point when customers order just single things, the price per transaction remains something very similar. Linear pricing likewise denies the business owner the opportunity to make the most of economies of scale.

## Features
- An alternative to quantity discount is linear pricing: charging a similar price paying little mind to the number of things the customer that buys.
- Discounts can unfavorably affect profit per unit, otherwise called the marginal profit.
- A quantity discount is an incentive offered to buyers that outcomes in a diminished cost for each unit of goods or materials when purchased in greater numbers.
- Captivating buyers to purchase in bulk enables sellers to increase their units per transaction (UPT), bring down their inventories, and possibly reduce per-unit costs.
