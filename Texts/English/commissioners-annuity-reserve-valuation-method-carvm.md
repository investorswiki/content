# Commissioners' Annuity Reserve Valuation Method (CARVM)
## What Is the Commissioners' Annuity Reserve Valuation Method (CARVM)?

The commissioners' annuity reserve valuation method (CARVM) is a method used to work out the statutory cash reserves for a [annuities](/annuity) carrier.

It tends to be calculated by several unique methods. The cash reserve of the annuity must be greater or equivalent to the value calculated by the CARVM. The CARVM is equivalent to the best [net present value](/npv) of all future guaranteed benefits.

## Grasping the CARVM

CARVM calculations do exclude expenses or slips by in annuity policies. In any case, they in all actuality do incorporate any [nonforfeiture](/nonforfeiture-statement) benefits that surpass [premiums](/premium) that are required from now on. By state law, these reserves must be kept up with by each annuity carrier.

CARVM is essentially a standardized way for issuers of annuities to determine the value of reserves by explaining the suspicions and methodologies that will follow the Standard Valuation Law (SVL).

The National Association of Insurance Commissioners is an industry body entrusted with implementing reserve standards for annuities contracts to guarantee there are guaranteed benefits for holders of annuities.

### Ascertaining the CARVM

Utilizing the CARVM, the actuarial reserves of an annuity are calculated as:

>
> "the best of the individual abundances of the present values..., representing things to come guaranteed benefits, including guaranteed nonforfeiture benefits, accommodated by the contracts toward the finish of each particular contract year, over the current value, at the date of valuation, of any future valuation contemplations derived from future gross considerations..."
>

As such, the CARVM value of an annuity is the best difference between a policy's guaranteed benefits, and its expected premiums, for each leftover year of the policy. This incorporates any expected payouts assuming that the holder of the policy were to surrender their benefits.

This is the best amount a policy-holder would be qualified for at whatever year, and hence the base reserve vital. The calculation is altogether more complex for different types of policies, and may factor in probabilities or mortality tables.

## Enforcement of CARVM

Buyers or holders of annuities, except if they are [accountants](/bookkeeper) or [actuaries](/statistician), can not determine whether CARVM has been utilized accurately in their contract. To be sure, they wouldn't be expected to approach the internal numbers on which the calculations are based.

Be that as it may, the [NAIC](/nainsurancec), which addresses all of the state insurance commissioners, requires companies giving these contracts to keep its standard valuation methods. Each state insurance commission is entrusted with oversight of insurers carrying on with work in their state to see that the rules for annuity valuations are being adhered to and applied accurately.
