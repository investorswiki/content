# Blue-Chip Index
## What Is a Blue-Chip Index?

A blue-chip index is a [index](/index) that tracks the shares of notable and monetarily stable publicly traded companies known as [blue chips](/bluechip). Blue-chip stocks give investors reliable returns, making them positive investments, and are viewed as a check of the relative strength of an industry or economy.

A blue-chip index is a [bellwether](/bellwether), meaning news reports and analysts will generally stress the performance of the major ones, like the S&P 500 and [Dow Jones Industrial Average](/djia) (DJIA), every day.

## Grasping a Blue-Chip Index

Investors can invest in a blue-chip index and gain exposure to various stable stocks by purchasing shares of a blue-chip-centered [exchange-traded fund](/etf) (ETF) or [index fund](/indexfund). These passive vehicles give you stakes in a blue-chip index's all's constituents at a much lower cost than if you somehow managed to buy each of the individual stocks yourself.

Other than the DJIA and [S&P 500](/sp500), different instances of blue-chip indexes incorporate the New Europe Blue Chip Index (NTX), which tracks 30 of the top stocks traded in central, eastern, and southeastern Europe, and the [DAX](/dax) Index, which tracks the main 30 companies on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange.

The term blue chip starts from the game of poker, where the highest designated chip is hued blue. While there is no universal definition of what compels up a blue-chip company, there are several characteristics each company shares.

For a certain something, all blue chips have a history of stable earnings growth and reward shareholders by giving [dividend](/dividend) payments with excess profits. Moreover, a large number of the companies have a critical competitive advantage that permits them to keep a leadership position in a specific industry.

## Special Considerations

A blue-chip index, for example, the DJIA tracks the performance of just 30 stocks when the total investment universe comprises of thousands of assets. All things being equal, investors have begun to utilize the S&P 500 — a [market-capitalization-weighted](/wamc) index of the main 500 companies — as a benchmark for the stock market. It offers exposure to a more extensive exhibit of industries and sectors that are frequently missing from a traditional blue-chip index.

The Dow 30 puts a greater accentuation on price as opposed to standard market factors like momentum, size, value, and market capitalization. In doing as such, the Dow 30 avoids the absolute best-performing and most dynamic companies in the U.S. stock market, including Amazon, Alphabet, and Meta (formerly Facebook).
