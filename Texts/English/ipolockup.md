# IPO Lock-Up
## What Is an IPO Lock-Up?

An initial public offering (IPO) [lock-up period](/lockup-period) is a caveat framing a period of time after a company has opened up to the world when major shareholders are precluded from selling their shares. During the IPO lock-up company insiders and early investors can't sell their shares, assisting with ensuring an orderly IPO and not flood the market with extra shares available to be purchased.

Lock-up periods usually last between 90 to 180 days. When the lock-up period ends, most trading restrictions are taken out.

## Understanding IPO Lock-Ups

The purpose of an IPO lock-up is to forestall the flooding of the market with too a very remarkable company's stock supply too rapidly. Regularly, just 20% of a company's outstanding shares are initially offered to the investing public. A single large shareholder trying to dump each of their holdings in the first seven day stretch of trading could send the stock down to the disservice, everything being equal. Empirical evidence suggests that after the finish of the lock-up period, stock prices experience a permanent drop of around 1% to 3%.

The public can find out about a company's lock-up period(s) in its [S-1 filing](/sec-structure s-1) with the SEC; subsequent S-1As will declare any changes to the lock-up period(s).

It should be noticed that lock-up periods are not commanded by the United States [Securities and Exchange Commission](/sec) or some other regulatory body. Rather, lock-up periods are either self-imposed by the company opening up to the world, or they are required by the [investment bank](/investmentbank) underwriting the IPO request. Regardless, the goal is the same: to keep stock prices soaring after a company goes public

Shares of Shake Shack Inc. set off a short squeeze from the day preceding its first lock-up expiration on July 28, 2015, which shot the stock price more than 30% in under two weeks. The margin interest had risen to more than 100% to borrow shares to short.
