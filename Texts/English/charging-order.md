# Charging Order
## What Is a Charging Order?

A charging order is a court-approved [lien](/lien) forced by a creditor on distributions produced using a business entity, for example, a [limited partnership](/limitedpartnership) (LP) or [limited liability company](/llc) (LLC). The debtor, in such a case, will be a member, partner, or the owner of the business entity.

The charging order is generally limited to the dollar amount of the judgment and is like [garnishment](/garnishment) of wages or income. It is important to note that a charging order doesn't give the creditor management rights in the business entity. Nor might the creditor at any point meddle in the management of the business to which the [debtor](/debtor) is a partner, member, or owner.

## How Charging Orders Work

A charging order permits an entity to place a lien and [seize money owed](/judgment-lien) to them by somebody who is named as a member of a limited partnership (LP) or limited liability company (LLC). Under the charging order, they might put a lien on money distributed to the debtor through the business. A charging order doesn't give the creditor rights of ownership of the company, however until the debt is fulfilled, the creditor can legally connect [distributions](/distribution) to the debtor from the business entity.

## Special Considerations

In many states in the U.S., personal creditors of a LLC owner are limited to utilizing a charging order as their exclusive solution for recover money owed to them. States shift in the type of business entity they will permit a claim against and much will rely upon whether the entity is a solitary or multi-member business. A few states don't limit creditors to a charging order to fulfill their claim. These states, in view of changing criteria and conditions, permit the creditor to [foreclose](/foreclosure) on the interest of the debtor in the speculation based entity. Fundamentally, the creditor can force the liquidation of the business to fulfill the claim against the debtor.

Would it be a good idea for one member or owner of a LLC be subject to a charging order from a personal creditor, the interests of the other LLC members are protected. Personal creditors who have been granted a charging order can't make a case for the distributions owed to the next LLC members nor are they permitted to participate in the LLC's management, disintegrate the LLC, or sell its assets without the other LLC members' consent. Charging order limitations are an effective method for protecting partnership assets in the states which have them, like California.

## Single-Member LLCs

In a solitary member LLC, foreclosure on the debtor's interest might happen notwithstanding the grant of a charging order. The rules for single-member LLCs differ contingent upon the state. For those states that really do permit foreclosure, the thinking is that there could be no other non-debtor members that have interests to secure. Subsequently, the [liquidation](/liquidation) of the business might occur. The proceeds are utilized to fulfill the creditor's judgment claim.

A few states, in any case, have amended their LLC laws to grant single-member LLCs similar protection from creditors managed multi-member LLCs. These laws don't permit the creditor to foreclosure and on second thought indicate that charging orders are the creditor's exclusive cure while seeking claims against single-or multi-member LLCs.

> States that have established laws protecting single-member LLCs incorporate Delaware, Wyoming, and Nevada.

## Tax Ramifications of Charging Orders

Some contend that a [creditor](/creditor) who connects the distributions of a debtor from a LLC is responsible for paying the taxes on these distributions. Be that as it may, as indicated by the Revenue Ruling 77-137 (1997-1 C.B. 178), the creditor doesn't pay taxes on this distribution. Rather, the debtor is responsible for tax payment on the grounds that the creditor isn't a member of the LLC. In the case in which the creditor forces the liquidation of the LLC to pay the debt, the creditor around then would be responsible for taxes on the liquidation.
