## What Is Mark-to-Model?

Mark-to-model is a pricing method for a specific investment position or portfolio in light of financial models. This differentiations with traditional mark-to-market valuations, in which [market prices](/market-cost) are utilized to work out values as well as the losses or gains on positions.

Assets that must be marked-to-model either don't have a normal market that gives accurate pricing, or have valuations that depend on a complex set of reference factors and time spans. This causes a situation wherein mystery and suspicions must be utilized to assign value to an asset, which makes the asset riskier.

## Understanding Mark-to-Model

Mark-to-model valuations are utilized principally in illiquid markets on products that don't trade frequently. Mark-to-model assets basically leave themselves not entirely clear, and this can make risk for investors. Amazing investor, Warren Buffett, named this method of valuation as "marking to legend," due to the underpricing of risk.

The risks of mark-to-model assets happened during the [subprime mortgage](/subprime_mortgage) meltdown beginning in 2007 due to this mispricing of risk and therefore of the assets. Billions of dollars in securitized mortgage assets must be written off on company balance sheets on the grounds that the valuation suppositions ended up being inaccurate. Large numbers of the mark-to-model valuations assumed liquid and orderly [secondary markets](/secondarymarket) and historical default levels. These suspicions proved wrong when secondary liquidity evaporated and mortgage default rates spiked well above normal levels.

Largely because of the balance sheet issues confronted with [securitized mortgage](/mbs) products, the [Financial Accounting Standards Board](/fasb) (FASB) issued a statement in November 2007 requiring all publicly traded companies to unveil any assets on their balance sheets that depend on mark-to-model valuations beginning in the 2008 fiscal year.

## Level One, Level Two, and Level Three

[FASB Statement 157](/fasb_157) presented a classification system that means to carry lucidity to the financial asset holdings of corporations. Assets (as well as liabilities) are partitioned into three categories:

- Level 1
- Level 2
- Level 3

Level 1 assets are valued by perceptible market prices. These marked-to-market assets incorporate Treasury securities, marketable securities, foreign currencies, commodities, and other liquid assets at which current market costs can be promptly acquired.

Level 2 assets are valued in view of quoted prices in idle markets and additionally in a roundabout way depend on noticeable data sources, for example, interest rates, default rates, and yield bends. Corporate bonds, bank loans, and [over-the-counter](/otc) (OTC) derivatives fall into this category.

At last, Level 3 assets are valued with internal models. Prices are not straightforwardly discernible and presumptions, which can be subject to wide variances, must be left in imprint to-model asset valuation. Instances of mark-to-model assets are [distressed](/distressedsecurities) debt, complex [derivatives](/subordinate), and private equity shares.

## Features

- The assets will more often than not be riskier as their values depend on mystery.
- After the financial crisis, all companies holding assets valued through mark-to-model are required to reveal them.
- The requirement for this valuation emerges due to [illiquid](/illiquid) assets that don't have a sufficiently large market for mark-to-market pricing.
- Mark-to-model includes assigning values to assets involving financial models instead of normal market prices.
