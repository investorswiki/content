## Real World Example of Confusion of Goods

A case of confusion of goods started during the 1970s, when Humble Oil Refining Group, which merged with Exxon in 1973, was sued for utilizing a repository to store its unessential gas. The company was blamed for blending its [gas](/commoditiesexchange) in the repository with that of certain royalty owners known as the Wests.

The Wests authenticated it was basically impossible to tell who reserved the options to the native and infused gas, and it depended on Humble to pay them for its intentional confusion of goods. In a 1974 ruling, the Supreme Court in Texas decided that "the act of commingling native and unessential gas didn't impose upon Humble the obligation of paying eminences on all gas from there on delivered from the repository, assuming the evidence lays out with reasonable certainty the volume of gas reserves whereupon the Wests would have been qualified for sovereignties, missing injection of superfluous gas." The commingler, in this case, was Humble Oil.
