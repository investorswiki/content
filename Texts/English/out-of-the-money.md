# Out of the Money
Options contracts grant their owners the right (however not the obligation) to buy or sell a specific asset (typically 100 shares of a stock) at a specific price (the option's strike price) until or upon the contract's expiration. Call options grant their owners the right to buy an asset, while put options grant their owners the right to sell an asset.
## What's the significance here? Out of the Money Defined
An options contract is thought of "out of the money" on the off chance that it lacks intrinsic value, meaning that assuming its owner exercised it, they would pay more than the current market value for a stock (on account of a [call option](/calloption)) or sell a stock for not exactly its current market value (on account of a [put option](/putoption)).
At the end of the day, a call option is out of the money in the event that its [strike price](/strikeprice) is higher than its spot price (market value), and a put option is out of the money assuming its strike price is lower than its spot price.
## Out of the Money (OTM) versus In the Money (ITM) Options
Something contrary to out of the money is "in the money." Options contracts that in all actuality do have intrinsic value are considered [in the money](/inthemoney).
In the event that a call option's strike price is lower than the current market price of the underlying stock, it is in the money on the grounds that its owner could exercise it to buy the stock for short of what it's worth. On the off chance that a put option's strike price is over the current market price of the underlying stock, it is in the money on the grounds that its owner could exercise it to sell the stock for more than it's worth.
## What Happens When an Option Expires Out of the Money?
Assuming an options contract arrives at expiration while out of the money, it lapses worthless in light of the fact that it is a waste of time to exercise an option that lacks intrinsic value. At the point when a contract lapses OTM and worthless, its owner loses the [premium](/option-premium) they paid for it.
Option premiums are typically extremely low compared to the price of the underlying shares, so trading options is a genuinely low-risk method for wagering on the price movement of 100 shares of stock without requiring a large amount of capital. In the event that circumstances don't work out and an option lapses worthless, the most its owner stands to lose is the premium they paid for the option.
## Do Out-of-the-Money Options Have Value? Are They Worthless?
Options that are out of the money might appear to be worthless, as it would be useless to exercise them. How could somebody need to exercise their right to sell shares for short of what they're worth or buy shares for beyond what they're worth when they could buy or sell standard shares on the open market at market value all things considered?
In reality, options that are out of the money truly do in any case have value â€” they just don't have intrinsic value. The value of an options contract is derived (predominantly) from three things: its intrinsic value, its time value (how long remaining parts until its expiration), and the [volatility](/volatility) of the underlying stock or asset. In this manner, OTM options truly do have value. The longer until the contract's expiration and the more unpredictable the underlying asset, the more value an OTM option has.
An option's time value and the volatility of the underlying asset together make up a contract's **extrinsic value**.
While practicing an OTM option would quite often be pointless, holding it wouldn't really be a poorly conceived notion. Take, for instance, a call option on a profoundly unpredictable stock that is out of the money by just $5 and terminates in a month. Since the underlying stock is unstable, quite possibly it will go up by more than $5 inside the excess 30 days, making the contract move into the money before its expiration. On the off chance that this occurs, the contract's owner can either exercise the option to buy shares (generally 100 for each contract) of the underlying stock for not exactly their market value, or resell the contract for a higher premium (price) than they paid for it.
Even on the off chance that an OTM option doesn't move into the money, it can in any case be exchanged for a higher premium in the event that it draws nearer to the money. The nearer an OTM option is to being in the money, the higher its premium, any remaining things being equivalent.
**Note:** The intrinsic value of an options contract is constantly remembered for its premium (sale price), so any remaining things being equivalent, OTM options are less expensive than ITM options. Subsequently, in the event that an OTM option moves ITM, its owner can ordinarily resell it for a higher premium than they paid and pocket the difference.
## How Does the Moneyness of an Option Affect Its Premium?
An option's premium, or sale price, is derived from its moneyness (degree of intrinsic value or lack thereof), how long remaining parts until its expiration, and how unpredictable the underlying stock or asset will in general be. Of these three factors, moneyness is typically the most huge.
In each case, an option's intrinsic value (how far in the money it is) is remembered for its premium. For example, an option that is in the money by $10 could have a premium of $12. $10 of this would address the option's intrinsic value, and the leftover $2 would account for the time until expiration and the volatility of the underlying stock.

## FAQ
### How could Someone Buy an Option That Is Out of the Money?
OTM options have moderately low premiums on the grounds that no intrinsic value is remembered for their price. In the event that an investor is bullish on a stock (i.e., they think it will go up in value), they could buy an OTM call or put with the expectations of reselling it for a higher premium once the underlying stock goes up in value and moves into the money (or possibly closer to being in the money). On the other hand, assuming the option moves into the money, they could exercise it as opposed to reselling it to purchase shares for under market value or sell shares for over market value.
### When Is a Call Option Out of the Money?
A call option is OTM when its strike price is higher than its spot price (the current market value of the underlying equity). This means that assuming it were exercised, the option's owner would buy shares for more than they're worth.
### Could You at any point Exercise an Option That Is Out of the Money?
By and large, practicing an OTM option doesn't seem OK. Thusly, most options that don't move into the money before expiration are allowed to lapse worthless. That being said, options owners in all actuality do constantly reserve the privilege to exercise before or upon expiration, even assuming their options are out of the money.
### When Is a Put Option Out of the Money?
A put option is OTM when its strike price is lower than its spot price. This means that assuming it were exercised, the option's owner would sell shares for short of what they're worth.
