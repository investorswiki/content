# January Effect
Toward the end of the year, investors begin agonizing over taxes. Keeping that in mind, they might sell a few stocks that they've seen a loss on - - not on the grounds that they could do without them any longer, but since they can remove those losses from their annual bill from Uncle Sam. This selling will thump stocks down a bit close to the end of the year - - especially small-covers, since they're not as liquid. In January, investors will be in there buying back their lost sweethearts, giving stocks a lift.

  In any case, that is the theory. Yet, it hasn't occurred in years in light of the fact that, many say, when our efficient markets recognized the phenomenon it got priced in.

## FAQ
### What Is the January Barometer?
The [January Barometer](/januarybarometer) is a society theory of the stock market that claims the returns experienced in January will anticipate the overall performance of the stock market for that year. In this manner, a strong January would foresee a strong bull market, and a down January a bear market. Real evidence for this effect is insufficient.
### Might You at any point Make Money Exploiting the January Effect?
Far-fetched. Even assuming the January Effect were real (it's presumably not) and markets were to rise uniquely every January, the way that individuals might try to take advantage of can sabotage its fulfillment.
### What Is the January Effect in the Stock Market?
The January Effect is an implied market anomaly by which stock prices tend to rise in the principal month of the year routinely. Genuine evidence of the January Effect is small, with numerous researchers contending that it doesn't really exist.
