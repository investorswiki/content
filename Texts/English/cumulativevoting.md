# Cumulative Voting
## What Is Cumulative Voting?

Cumulative voting is the technique followed while choosing an organization's directors. Regularly, each [shareholder](/shareholder) is qualified for one vote for every share increased by the number of directors to be chosen. This is an interaction some of the time known as proportional voting. Cumulative voting is invaluable for [individual investors](/financial backer) since they can apply every one of their votes to one candidate.

## Grasping Cumulative Voting

Cumulative voting is a voting system utilized by organizations that permit shareholders to vote proportionately to the number of shares they hold. This permits a shareholder with 100 shares to project the equivalent of 100 votes toward any single issue.

Assume various candidates are being considered for different positions, for example, board seats. In that case, every shareholder has the option of putting each of their votes toward one seat during races or toward one decision while voting on different issues. Notwithstanding, the shareholder can likewise decide to split his votes across different options.

### Benefits for Minority Shareholders

This interaction is said to benefit [minority shareholders](/minorityinterest) in light of the fact that they can zero in all of their consideration on a single candidate or decision point. In the event that numerous minority shareholders center in a single direction together, they frequently have the power to impact a change or appointment in their ideal direction.

### Alternative to Cumulative Voting

Assuming an organization picks an alternative to cumulative voting, it might institute [statutory voting](/statutoryvoting). In these cases, shareholders actually receive a few votes proportionate to the number of shares they hold, yet they must direct their votes towards all positions or the issues viable.

For instance, in the event that there are three board seats open, and a shareholder has 100 shares, the shareholder has 100 votes for every one of the open seats. This is as opposed to cumulative voting where the shareholder could take every one of the 300 votes and direct them toward a single seat.

## Real World Example of Cumulative Voting

For instance, in the event that a shareholder partakes in a vote for two open [board seats](/boardofdirectors) for which candidates An and B are running for the main seat and candidates C and D are running for the subsequent seat, the shareholder would have 200 votes. The shareholder could decide to take part just in the primary seat vote, sending every one of the 200 votes toward his preferred candidate, candidate A.

The shareholder could likewise vote exclusively on the subsequent seat putting every one of the 200 votes on candidate C. In the event that the shareholder wishes to vote in the two seats, the shareholder can split his votes similarly giving 100 to candidate An and 100 to candidate C. Alternatively, the shareholder can direct the votes in an alternate extent, like 150 votes for candidate An and 50 votes to candidate C.
