## What Is a Two-Sided Market?

This can happen when two client gatherings or agents interact through an intermediary or platform to the benefit of the two players.

A two-sided market is many times defined by the relationship the intermediary has with the outer gatherings or agents on its platform. This relationship is found in pricing, specifically.

It ought to be noticed that any change to one side of the market will change the pricing on the opposite side, known as the "waterbed effect."
