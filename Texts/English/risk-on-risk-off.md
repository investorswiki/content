# Risk-On Risk-Off
## What Is Risk-On Risk-Off?

Risk-on risk-off is an investment setting in which price behavior responds to and is driven by changes in investor risk tolerance. Risk-on risk-off alludes to changes in investment activity in response to global economic examples.

During periods when risk is perceived as low, the risk-on risk-off theory states that investors will quite often participate in higher-risk investments. At the point when risk is perceived to be high, investors tend to incline toward lower-risk investments.

## Understanding Risk-On Risk-Off

Investors' hungers for risk rise and fall over the long haul. On occasion, investors are bound to invest in higher-risk instruments than during different periods, for example, during the 2009 economic recovery period. The [2008 financial crisis](/credit-crisis) was considered a risk-off year, when investors endeavored to reduce risk by selling existing risky positions and moving money to either [cash positions](/cash_position) or low/no-risk positions, like U.S. Treasury bonds.

Not all [asset classes](/assetclasses) carry a similar risk. Investors will quite often change asset classes relying upon the perceived risk in the markets. For example, stocks are generally considered to be riskier assets than bonds. In this way, a market where stocks are outflanking [bonds](/bond) is supposed to be a risk-on environment. At the point when stocks are selling off and investors run for shelter to bonds or gold, the environment is supposed to be risk-off.

## Risk Sentiment

While asset prices eventually detail the [risk sentiment](/marketsentiment) of the market, investors can frequently track down indications of changing sentiment through corporate earnings, [macroeconomic](/macroeconomics) data, global central bank action and statements, and different factors.

Risk-on environments are in many cases carried by a combination of extending corporate earnings, hopeful economic outlook, accommodative central bank policies, and [speculation](/speculation). We can likewise expect that an increase in the stock market is an indication that risk is on. As investors feel the market is being upheld by strong powerful fundamentals, they see less risk about the market and its outlook.

Conversely, risk-off environments can be brought about by boundless corporate earnings downsizes, contracting or slowing economic data, unsure central bank policy, a race to safe investments, and different factors. Just like the stock market rises connecting with a risk on environment, a drop in the stock market equals a risk off environment. That is on the grounds that investors need to stay away from risk and are averse to it.

## Returns and Risk-On Risk-Off

As the perceived risk rises in the markets, investors bounce from risky assets and pack into [high-grade bonds](/investmentgrade), U.S. Treasury bonds, gold, cash, and other [safe havens](/safe-sanctuary). While returns on these assets are not expected to be extreme, they give downside protection to portfolios during times of distress.

At the point when risks die down in the market, low-return assets and safe shelters are unloaded for [high-yielding bonds](/high_yield_bond), stocks, [commodities](/product), and different assets that carry raised risk. As overall market risks stay low, investors are more able to take on portfolio risk for the chance of higher returns.

## Highlights
- In risk-off situations, investors become more risk-averse and sell assets, sending their prices lower.
- Risk-on risk-off is an investment paradigm under which asset prices are directed by changes in investors' risk tolerance.
- In risk-on situations, investors have a high risk hunger and bid up the prices of assets in the market.
