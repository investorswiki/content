# Stabilization Policy
## What Is Stabilization Policy?

Stabilization policy is a strategy sanctioned by a government or its central bank that is pointed toward keeping a sound level of economic growth and insignificant price changes. Supporting a stabilization policy requires monitoring the business cycle and adjusting fiscal policy and monetary policy depending on the situation to control sudden changes in demand or supply.

In the language of business news, a stabilization policy is intended to prevent the economy from exorbitant "over-warming" or "dialing back."

## Figuring out Stabilization Policy

A study by the Brookings Institution notes that the U.S. economy has been in a recession for around one in like clockwork since the finish of World War II. This cycle is viewed as unavoidable, yet stabilization policy looks to relax the blow and prevent far reaching unemployment.

A stabilization policy looks to limit sporadic swings in the economy's total output, as estimated by the country's gross domestic product (GDP), as well as controlling floods in inflation or deflation. Stabilization of these factors generally leads to sound levels of employment.

The term stabilization policy is likewise used to portray government action in response to an economic crisis or shock, for example, a sovereign debt default or a stock market crash. The responses might incorporate emergency actions and reform legislation.

### The Roots of Stabilization Policy

Spearheading economist John Maynard Keynes contended that an economy can experience a sharp and supported period of stagnation without an any sort of natural or automatic rebound or correction. [Previous economists](/classicaleconomics) had seen that economies develop and contract in a cyclical pattern, with periodic downturns followed by a recovery and return to growth. Keynes questioned their speculations that a course of economy recovery ought to ordinarily be expected after a [recession](/recession). He contended that the fear and vulnerability that consumers, investors, and businesses face could prompt a prolonged period of decreased consumer spending, sluggish business investment, and raised unemployment which would all build up each other in an endless loop.

To stop the cycle, Keynes contended, requires changes in policy to control [aggregate demand](/aggregatedemand). He, and the Keynesian economists who followed him, additionally contended the reverse policy could be utilized to fight off unreasonable inflation during periods of hopefulness and economic growth. In Keynesian stabilization policy, demand is animated to counter high levels of unemployment and countering rising inflation is smothered. The two principal apparatuses being used today to increase or diminish demand are to lower or raise interest rates for borrowing or to increase of abatement government spending. These are known as [monetary policy](/monetarypolicy) and [fiscal policy](/fiscalpolicy), individually.

### The Future of Stabilization Policy

Most modern economies utilize stabilization policies, with a large part of the work being finished by central banking specialists like the U.S. Federal Reserve Board. Stabilization policy is widely credited with the moderate yet positive rates of GDP growth found in the U.S. since the mid 1980s. It includes utilizing [expansionary](/expansionary_policy) monetary and fiscal policy during recessions and [contractionary policy](/contractionary-policy) during periods of extreme good faith or rising inflation. This means bringing down interest rates, cutting taxes, and expanding deficit spending during economic downturns and raising interest rates, rising taxes, and diminishing government deficit spending during better times.

Numerous economists currently accept that keeping a consistent pace of economic growth and keeping prices consistent are essential for long-term success, especially as economies become more complex and advanced. Extreme volatility in any of those factors can lead to unanticipated results to the broad economy.
