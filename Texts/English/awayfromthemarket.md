# Away-from-the-Market
## What Is Away-from-the-Market?

An away-from-the-market order is a type of [limit order](/limitorder) in which the amount stipulated for execution contrasts from the current price of the security. With a buy limit order the price is lower than the current market price while with a sell limit order, the price is higher.

## Seeing Away-from-the-Market

Away-from-the-market alludes to orders that are placed at a price that is not quickly accessible — that is, when either buy or sell price strays from a current market quote for that particular security. The articulation applies in two fundamental types of situations:

1. if the [bid](/bid) on a limit order is lower than the current market price, then an away-from-the-market order issues directions to buy at a price lower than the current market price
1. in the event that the [ask](/ask) on a limit order is higher than the current market price, then an away-from-the-market order issues guidelines to sell at a price higher than the current market price.

For instance, a limit order to buy 100 shares of Acme United Corp. (ACU) at $28 is away-from-the-market since the stock is as of now trading at $40 per share. Essentially, a limit order to sell 100 shares at $46 is away-from-the-market when shares are currently trading at $40.

An away-from-the-market order, in the event that it is executed, would require a move in that security's price toward the path that the order was placed. In other words, a sell limit order higher than the market would possibly be filled in the event that the market price moved higher, and vice versa. An away-from-the-market order that isn't filled could lead to a more extensive [bid-ask spread](/bid-askspread) for that security.

Away-from-the-market limit orders are commonly held for later execution except if determined as [fill or kill](/fok) (FOK) orders, which are orders that must be completed right away ("filled"), or they will be canceled ("killed").

Alongside FOK, there are other conditions for execution you can put on your order. They include:

- **Great until Canceled (GTC)**. A GTC order maintains the control open endlessly until it is executed or canceled. (This is generally a default position for away-from-the-market orders.)
- **Quick or Cancel (IOC)**. With an IOC order, all or just a portion of the order can be executed. Any portion of the order not promptly completed is canceled.
- **All or None (AON)**. An AON order is a condition that commands either the whole order is filled or no part of it.

## Limit Orders

Like all limit orders, an away-from-the-market order is placed with a [brokerage](/brokerage-organization), which executes the buy or sell transaction. The limit order includes a pre-decided number of shares with a set limit price that must be met or surpassed. Limit orders set boundaries that provide the investor with an extra level of control since it permits them to characterize a price, alongside the period of time where an order can be in progress and pending before it will be canceled.

Even assuming the stock arrives at the predefined limit price, your order may not be filled, or it very well might be just filled in part — in light of the fact that orders ahead of yours have spent the availability of shares at the limit price.

A limit order is a decent option in the event that there is a specific price that you need or have to get. It's likewise fitting when you think you can buy at a price lower than — or sell at a price higher than — the current quote.

At the point when you place an order of this type, there is no guarantee the order will be executed, and there is a possibility it won't ever be executed. Generally, limit orders will stay open until the security arrives at the designated limit or the investor cancels the order.

In any case, assuming that the order goes through, you are guaranteed to get essentially the price you determined when you put the order in place. Or then again perhaps better.
