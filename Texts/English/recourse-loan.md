# Recourse Loan
For lenders, limiting risk is the situation. That is the reason greater loans have more severe qualification requirements and why just the most reliable borrowers get the best interest rates. Be that as it may, a few lenders might go even further in lessening risk, offering what's known as recourse loans.
Recourse loans are loans that allow the lender to hold onto a large number of the borrower's assets on the off chance that the borrower neglects to repay their loan — even assets that were excluded from the loan agreement as collateral. With a nonrecourse loan, the lender may just hold onto those assets determined in the original loan agreement as collateral.
## Types of recourse loans
A recourse loan is the point at which the lender can hold onto assets past the original collateral used to secure the loan. At the point when you apply for a new line of credit, you consent to a contract that determines what actions the lender can take in the event that you default. A few common types of recourse loans include:
- Personal loans
- Credit cards
- Auto loans
- Short-term real estate loans.

Most mortgages are additionally recourse loans, however there are 12 states that allow nonrecourse mortgages. On the off chance that a borrower defaults on a mortgage in one of those states, the lender may have the option to repossess the home and no different assets or kinds of revenue.
These states are:
- Alaska
- Arizona
- California
- Connecticut
- Hawaii
- Idaho
- Minnesota
- North Carolina
- North Dakota
- Texas
- Utah
- Washington

All administration upheld mortgages are nonrecourse loans, even on the off chance that you don't live in one of the 12 states listed previously. In the event that you default on a VA, USDA or FHA loan, the lender can't come after any assets with the exception of your home.
## An illustration of a recourse loan
Suppose you take out an auto loan to buy a vehicle. On the off chance that you stop making payments, the lender can legally repossess the vehicle.
The recourse angle kicks in the event that the value of the vehicle is not exactly the excess balance on the loan. For instance, suppose you took out a vehicle loan and stopped making payments following one year, at which point the lender holds onto the vehicle. Right now, the vehicle is just worth $12,000 — however you actually have $14,000 left on the loan.
The lender needs to recover $2,000 to break even on the loan. On the off chance that you have a recourse loan, the lender can ask a court to embellish your wages until you've paid off the $2,000. It might likewise have the option to recover funds by taking your tax refunds, pension checks, Social Security checks and that's just the beginning.
## Recourse loan versus nonrecourse loan
In short, a recourse loan is the point at which a lender can hold onto any asset, including and past the thing used to secure the loan. Conversely, in the event that you default on a nonrecourse loan, the lender can take the asset associated with the loan. All in all, the lender may not pursue any extra assets — even assuming the value of the asset associated with the loan doesn't cover the whole outstanding debt you owe. Since lenders face an expected loss with this type of loan, many don't offer them or reserve them for borrowers with the highest credit scores.
Recourse loans are possibly more harming to borrowers than nonrecourse loans, but on the other hand they're more well known with lenders. Assuming you're right now carrying any form of debt, there's a decent chance that it's a recourse loan.
## Would it be a good idea for me to get a recourse loan?
Determining whether a recourse or nonrecourse loan will be best for you relies upon your unique financial picture including your credit score and ability to keep up with payments until the loan is completely repaid. Here are a few instances of when a recourse and nonrecourse loan may be a decent decision.
Recourse loan:
- **You have a high debt-to-income ratio:** If you're as of now making huge debt payments every month or have a high debt-to-income ratio, a recourse loan will probably be a better decision. With a recourse loan, you won't risk collateral past that which is agreed to in the loan.
- **You're seeking a more competitive interest rate:** Recourse loans quite often accompany more favorable interest rates than nonrecourse loans since there is less risk for lenders in the event you are unable to repay the debt.

Nonrecourse loan:
- **You have an incredible credit score:** Lenders typically have higher lending standards for nonrcourse loans and for the most part offer them to borrowers who have the best credit scores. Likewise, these loans might even require a bigger down payment.
- **You wouldn't fret paying higher interest:** Because a nonrecourse loan limits a lender's ability to recover its money on the off chance that you default, nonrecourse loans have a lot higher interest rates.

## The bottom line
On the off chance that you as of now have a recourse loan, your best course of action is to pay your bills on time. In the event that you're stressed over defaulting and have a recourse loan, you ought to call the lender and ask about your options.
On the off chance that you are choosing a recourse loan and a nonrecourse loan, gauge the upsides and downsides. You might pay more interest on a nonrecourse loan, so in the event that you have a stable job and low debt-to-income ratio, you might choose to face a small challenge and pick a recourse loan.
