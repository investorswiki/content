# Convertible Debenture
## What Is a Convertible Debenture?

A convertible debenture is a type of long-term debt issued by a company that can be changed over into shares of equity stock after a predefined period. Convertible debentures are typically unsecured bonds or loans, frequently with no underlying [collateral](/collateral) backing up the debt.

These long-term debt securities pay interest returns to the bondholder like some other bond. The unique feature of convertible debentures is that they are exchangeable for stock at indicated times. This feature gives the bondholder some security that might offset a portion of the risks implied with investing in unsecured debt.

A convertible debenture varies from convertible notes or [convertible bonds](/convertiblebond), generally in that debentures have longer maturities.

## Convertible Debentures Explained

Commonly, companies raise [capital](/capital) by giving debt, as bonds, or equity, as shares of stock. A few companies might utilize more debt than [equity](/equity) to raise capital to fund operations or vice versa.

A convertible debenture is a type of [hybrid security](/hybridsecurity) with qualities of both debt and equity instruments. Companies issue convertible debentures as fixed-rate loans, paying the bondholder fixed interest payments on an ordinary schedule. Bondholders have the option of holding the bond until maturity — at which point they receive the return of their principal — at the same time, holders may likewise change over the debentures into stock. The [debenture](/debenture) can ordinarily just be changed over into stock after a predetermined time, as determined in the bond's offering.

A convertible debenture will typically return a lower interest rate since the debt holder has the option to switch the loan over completely to stock, which is to the investors' benefit. Investors are hence able to acknowledge a lower rate of interest in exchange for the [embedded option](/embeddedoption) to change over into [common shares](/commonstock). Convertible debentures hence permit investors to partake in share price appreciation.

## Special Considerations

The number of shares a bondholder receives for every debenture is determined at the hour of issue in light of a [conversion ratio.](/conversionratio) For instance, the company could disperse 10 shares of stock for every debenture with a face value of $1,000, which is a 10:1 conversion ratio.

The convertible debt feature is considered into the calculation of the [diluted](/weakening) per-share metrics of the stock. The conversion will increase the share count — number of shares accessible — and lessens metrics, for example, [earnings per share](/eps) (EPS).

One more consideration for investing in unsecured debentures is that on account of bankruptcy and liquidation they receive payment solely after other fixed-income holders.

## Types of Debentures

Similarly as there are convertible debentures, there are additionally non-convertible debentures by which the debt can't be changed over into equity. Thus, non-convertible debentures will offer higher interest rates than their convertible partners since investors don't have the option to switch over completely to stock.

Incompletely convertible debentures are likewise a rendition of this type of debt. These loans have a predetermined portion that can be switched over completely to stock. The conversion ratio is determined at the beginning of the debt issuance.

Completely convertible debentures have the option to change over all of the debt into equity shares in view of the terms illustrated at the debt issuance. Investors genuinely must research the type of debenture they're thinking about for investment including if or when there is a conversion option, the conversion ratio, and the time span for when a conversion to equity can happen.

## Benefits of Convertible Debentures

Similarly as with any fixed-income instrument, whether it is a bond or loan the debt it addresses eventually should be repaid. Too much debt on a company's balance sheet can lead to high debt-overhauling costs that incorporate interest payments. Thus, companies with debt can have unstable earnings.

Equity, in contrast to debentures, doesn't need repayment, nor does it require the payment of interest to holders. Be that as it may, a company could pay dividends to shareholders, which albeit voluntary, should have been visible as a cost of giving equity since the association's [retained earnings](/retainedearnings) or accumulated profits would be diminished.

Convertible debentures are hybrid products that try to strike a balance among debt and equity. Investors gain the benefit of fixed interest payments while additionally having the option to change the loan over completely to equity in the event that the company performs well, rising stock prices after some time.

The risk to investors is that there is little insurance in case of default assuming they're holding shares of common stock. Nonetheless, during bankruptcy liquidation, in the event that an investor is holding a convertible debenture, the debenture holder gets compensated before [common shareholders](/common_shareholder).

## Genuine Example of a Convertible Debenture

Expect Pear Inc. needs to grow internationally interestingly to sell its mobile products and services. Investors are uncertain assuming the products will sell abroad and whether the company's international business plan will work.

The company issues convertible debentures to draw in an adequate number of investors to fund their international expansion. The conversion will be at a ratio of 20:1 following three years.

The fixed interest rate paid to investors on the convertible debenture is 2%, which is lower than the normal bond rate. Notwithstanding, the lower rate is the compromise for the right to change over the debentures into stock.

### Scenario 1:

Following three years, the international expansion is a hit, and the company's stock price takes off rising from $20 to $100 per share. Holders of the convertible debentures can change over their debt into stock at the 20:1 conversion ratio. Investors with one debenture can change over their debt into $2,000 worth of stock (20 x $100 per share).

### Scenario 2:

The international expansion comes up short. Investors can hold on to their convertible debentures and keep on getting fixed interest payments at the rate of 2% per year until the debt develops and the company returns their principal.

In this model, Pear got the benefit of a low-interest-rate loan by giving the convertible debenture. In any case, on the off chance that the expansion gets along admirably, the company's equity shares would get diluted as investors convert their debentures to stock. This increase in the number of shares would result in a [diluted earnings-per-share](/dilutedeps).

## Highlights
