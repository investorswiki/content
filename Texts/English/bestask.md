## What Is a Best Ask?

A best ask (otherwise called a best offer) is the most reduced offer price from contending market makers or different sellers for a quoted security. The ask (offer) price is successfully the least price a seller will take for an asset, and is the most great price a buyer could hope to pay utilizing a market order around then.

The best ask is supplemented with the [best bid](/bestbid), which is the highest price a market participant will pay for a security at a given time.

## Seeing Best Ask

In financial markets, potential buyers are said to offer their purchase price by expressing a "[bid](/bid)" offer or price. The [ask](/ask) is the opposite side of a transaction. The ask price is the price a potential seller will offer a security for purchase at. Since different brokers, agents, and investors each have a unique price they're willing to buy and sell at, a scope of conceivable price levels is kept in a control book or electronically. The best ask is just the most reduced (or best) price somebody will sell a basket of securities at.

A best ask may likewise allude to the least price that a given individual market participant will sell, in which case it would be their best ask, and not really the market's best ask.

## National Best Bid and Offer (NBBO)

The [National Best Bid and Offer](/nbbo) (NBBO) are the bid and ask prices that traders and investors ordinarily see. Active traders, short-term traders, and informal investors will frequently study [Level 2 quotes](/level2) that incorporate every one of the current bids and asks for a specific trading instrument. The NBBO is constantly refreshed all through the trading session so customers approach these prices.

The NBBO guarantees that all investors receive the best conceivable price while executing trades through their broker without stressing over conglomerating statements from different exchanges or market makers before setting a trade. This assists with leveling the playing field for [retail traders](/retailinvestor) who might not have the resources to constantly search out the best prices across different exchanges.

The least ask price and the highest bid price are displayed in the NBBO and are not required to come from a similar exchange. The best bid and ask price from a single exchange or [market maker](/marketmaker) is called the "best bid and offer" as opposed to the NBBO. Dark pools and other [alternative trading systems](/alternative-trading-framework) may not necessarily show up in these outcomes given the less transparent nature of their organizations.

> Traders that need to execute orders bigger than those accessible through the NBBO ought to utilize an exchange or market maker's [depth of book](/depth-of-market) data or Level II market maker screens to know the other expected bid and ask prices that they could use to execute their order.

## Illustration of Best Ask

For instance, [wirehouse brokers](/wire-house-broker) like Morgan Stanley, Merrill Lynch, UBS, and Wells Fargo will all freely come to a selling price they're willing to sell stocks held in inventory at. Normally, an investor needs to purchase (buy) at the most reduced conceivable price. By adding the directions to purchase at simply the "best ask," they're guaranteeing the best conceivable price.

Inconvenience emerges when just a certain amount of a given security is accessible at the least price. For example, Morgan Stanley might have an ask price of $25.00/share for company ABC's stock, and they're willing to sell 25,000 shares at that rate. In the event that a customer executes an order to purchase 30,000 shares at the best ask price, Morgan Stanley's part wouldn't completely take care of the request. Here's where other trading directions become an integral factor, for example, [all-or-none](/aon) and allowance for a [trade to be split](/ordersplitting).
