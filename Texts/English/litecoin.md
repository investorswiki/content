# Litecoin (LTC)
## What Is Litecoin (LTC)?

Litecoin (LTC) is an alternative [cryptocurrency](/cryptocurrency) made in October 2011 by Charles "Charlie" Lee, a former Google engineer. Litecoin was adjusted from Bitcoin's open-source code however with several alterations. Like Bitcoin, Litecoin is based on an open-source global payment network that isn't controlled by any central authority. Litecoin varies from Bitcoin in perspectives like quicker block generation rate and utilization of Scrypt as a proof of work scheme.

It is viewed as among the first [altcoins](/altcoin), derived from Bitcoin's original open-source code.

Initially, it was a strong competitor to Bitcoin. Be that as it may, as the cryptocurrency market has become significantly more saturated and competitive in recent years with new offerings, Litecoin's notoriety has wound down fairly.

Litecoin has forever been seen as a reaction to Bitcoin. In fact, when Lee announced the presentation of Litecoin on a famous Bitcoin forum, he called it the "light rendition of Bitcoin." For this explanation, Litecoin has a significant number of similar elements as Bitcoin, while likewise adjusting and changing a few different perspectives that the development team felt could be gotten to the next level.

As of November 2021, 1 LTC is worth around $215, making it the 14th-biggest crypto with a market cap of just under $15 billion.

## Grasping Litecoin (LTC)

Like other decentralized cryptocurrencies, Litecoin isn't issued by a government, which historically has been the main entity that society trusts to issue money. Rather than being regulated by a central bank and falling off the press at the Bureau of Engraving and Printing, Litecoins are made by an elaborate cryptocurrency method called mining, which comprises of processing a rundown of Litecoin transactions.

Litecoin was developed by Charlie Lee, a graduate of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) and a former Google engineer who became keen on Bitcoin in 2011. As per Lee, "In October of 2011, I was playing around with the Bitcoin codebase, and I surmise its short was that I was just attempting to make ... a fork of Bitcoin. It was essentially a tomfoolery side project."

Like Bitcoin, the maximum number of LTC is fixed. There won't ever be in excess of 84 million Litecoins in circulation. Each 2.5 minutes, the Litecoin network generates a new [block](/block-bitcoin-block)- a ledger entry of recent Litecoin transactions all through the world. The block is checked by mining software and made noticeable to any system participant (called a miner) who needs to see it. When a miner confirms it, the next block enters the chain, which is a record of each and every Litecoin transaction made.

There are incentives for mining Litecoin: the primary miner to effectively check a block is rewarded with 12.5 Litecoins. Likewise with Bitcoin, the number of Litecoins granted for such a task diminishes with time. In August 2019, it was split, and the halving will go on at customary stretches until the 84,000,000th Litecoin is mined. The Litecoin Foundation assesses that it will be around 2142 when the maximum of 84 million Litecoins will be reached.

## Scrypt Proof-of-Work Algorithm

Bitcoin, Litecoin, and numerous other cryptocurrencies utilize the [proof-of-work](/proof-work) (PoW) algorithm to secure their networks. Basically, PoW expects that one party demonstrates to all the other participating gatherings in the network that a required amount of computational exertion has been consumed. Not at all like Bitcoin, which utilizes the SHA-256 PoW hashing algorithm, Litecoin utilizes the less asset intensive Scrypt PoW algorithm.

Scrypt is a secret key based key induction function. As per Tarsnip, "the scrypt key determination function was originally developed for use in the Tarsnap online backup system and is intended to be undeniably safer against hardware savage power attacks than alternative functions like PBKDF2 or bcrypt."

Scrypt was developed by Lee specifically to make enormous scale, custom-constructed hardware attacks on the currency more troublesome. Bitcoin's SHA-256 algorithm doesn't need a ton of random access memory (RAM) as a hindrance to parallel processing, though Scrypt does.

Toward the beginning of the 2010s, as mining operations developed particular hardware, similar to the [application-specific circuit](/asic) (ASIC) to settle SHA-256 hashing, it appeared that Bitcoin was helpless against such an attack. By making Litecoin's consensus algorithm memory intensive, Lee tried to impede the hardware arms race, however in practice that didn't occur as the rise of GPUs addressed the requirement for greater RAM.

## How Is Bitcoin (BTC) Different From Litecoin (LTC)?

Litecoin was sent off determined to be the "silver" to Bitcoin's "gold." Like Bitcoin, Litecoin is a [peer-to-peer internet currency](/ptop). It is a completely decentralized, open-source, global payment network. Lee developed Litecoin with the aim to enhance Bitcoin's shortcomings. The more extensive differences between the two cryptocurrencies are listed in the table below.

BTC versus LTC

Litecoin is intended to deliver four times however many blocks as Bitcoin (1 new block each 2.5 minutes to Bitcoin's 10), and it additionally allows for 4x the coin limit, making its primary appeal over Bitcoin to do effortlessly of acquisition. Nonetheless, in light of the fact that Litecoin utilizes Scrypt (rather than Bitcoin's SHA-256) as a proof-of-work algorithm, the utilization of mining hardware, for example, ASIC miners or a GPU mining rig requires fundamentally really processing power.

Litecoin positions in the Top 15 biggest cryptocurrencies in terms of market capitalization (however as yet staying far below that of Bitcoin), and as of November 2021, it had in excess of 69 million coins in circulation.

## Tentative arrangements for Litecoin (LTC)

Litecoin has carried out several elements since its send off planned to further develop its transaction speed without compromising the security and integrity of the network.

### SegWit

SegWit or Segregated Witness was first proposed for Bitcoin in 2015. It works by "isolating" the digital signal data (the "witness") outside the base block in the blockchain. [SegWit](/segwit-segregated-witness) was developed to address Bitcoin's scalability issue, however the proposal made deep discussion inside the Bitcoin community.

In 2017, Litecoin adopted SegWit, and due to Litecoin's closeness to Bitcoin, it filled in as a testing ground or testnet for SegWit's practicality on the bigger Bitcoin network. The test was a triumph, and Bitcoin adopted SegWit from that point. A few rivals of the SegWit adoption who upheld for bigger Bitcoin block sizes made a Bitcoin hard fork that brought about [Bitcoin Cash](/bitcoin-cash).

### Lightning Network

The [Lightning Network](/lightning-network) is a second-layer technology for bitcoin that utilizes micropayment channels to scale its blockchain's capability to conduct transactions.

Like the SegWit model, the implementation of the Lightning Network on Litecoin has been a testnet to demonstrate innovations are conceivable on Bitcoin. Charlie Lee has likewise contended that when "the Bitcoin blockchain is clogged and the fees are high, it's not difficult to utilize Litecoin to locally available onto the Lightning Network."

### MimbleWimble

MimbleWimble is a privacy protocol that expands on confidential transactions that scramble or dark data like transaction amounts. It is contended that MimbleWimble can diminish blocksize and increase scalability. Charlie Lee announced in mid 2019 that Litecoin would seek after MimbleWimble development, and starting around 2021, development is in progress.

## Highlights
- Since its structure is like Bitcoin's, it has been utilized as a testnet or testing ground for improvements that later were applied to Bitcoin.
- It had whenever been called the silver to Bitcoin's gold, and at its level was the third biggest cryptocurrency by market cap.
- Litecoin is an early altcoin developed by former Google engineer Charlie Lee in 2011.
