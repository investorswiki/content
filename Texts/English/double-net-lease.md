## What Is a Double Net Lease?

A double net lease (otherwise called a 'net' or 'NN' lease) is a lease agreement where the tenant is responsible for both property taxes and premiums for guaranteeing the building. Dissimilar to a single net lease, which just requires the tenant to pay property taxes, a double [net lease](/net-lease) passes more expenses along as insurance payments.

The landlord is as yet held responsible for structural maintenance expenses. Every month, the landlord gets the base rent plus the extra payments.

## How Double Net Leases Work

Net leases are just similar to claiming property without really having legal [title](/title) over it. They are lease agreements between [landlords](/landlord) and tenants where the tenant pays for rent and some other cost associated with the property being referred to. The agreement might incorporate at least one expenses including insurance, property taxes, utilities, maintenance and repairs, and other [operational costs](/working cost). Most landlords generally acknowledge lower rent payments due to the extra costs associated with net leases.

Double net leases are most commonly found in [commercial real estate](/commercialrealestate). For commercial properties with numerous tenants, for example, a shopping center, taxes and insurance fees might be assigned to the individual tenants on a proportional basis. Even assuming property taxes and building insurance premiums are viewed as the responsibility of the tenant, owners of commercial property ought to have property taxes went through themselves to guarantee that they are aware of payment issues.

Frequently, gatherings will consent to a "base year" estimated expense, with the landlord billing the tenant for any overage.
