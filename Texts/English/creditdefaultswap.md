# Credit Default Swap (CDS)
A credit default swap is a type of contract that offers a guarantee against the non-payment of a loan. In this agreement, the seller of the swap will pay the buyer on account of a credit event (default) by a third-party. On the off chance that no default happens, the seller of the swap will have collected a premium from the buyer.

- CDSs are traded over-the-counter and are in many cases used to transfer credit exposure on fixed income products to hedge risk.
- Lenders purchase CDSs from investors who consent to pay the lender assuming the borrower at any point defaults on its obligation(s).
## FAQ
### How Does a Credit Default Swap Work?
A credit default swap is a financial derivative contract that moves the credit risk of a fixed income product to a counterparty in exchange for a premium. Basically, credit default swaps act as insurance on the default of a borrower. As the most well known form of credit derivatives, buyers and sellers orchestrate custom agreements on over-the-counter markets which are frequently illiquid, speculative, and challenging for regulators to trace.
### What Are Credit Default Swaps Used for?
Credit default swaps are essentially utilized for two fundamental reasons: hedging risk and speculation. To hedge risk, investors buy credit default swaps to add a layer of insurance to safeguard a bond, for example, a mortgage-backed security, from defaulting on its payments. Thusly, a third party expects the risk in exchange for a premium. On the other hand, when investors hypothesize on credit default swaps, they are betting on the credit quality of the reference entity.
### What Is an Example of a Credit Default Swap?

In view of its extensive maturity, this adds a layer of vulnerability to the investor in light of the fact that the company will most likely be unable to pay back the principal $10,000 or future interest payments before expiration. To guarantee themself against the likelihood of this outcome, the investor buys a credit default swap.A credit default swap basically guarantees that the principal or any owing interest payments will be paid over a foreordained time span. Normally, the investor will buy a credit default swap from a large financial institution, who for a fee, will guarantee the underlying debt.
