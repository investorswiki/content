# Short Call
## What Is a Short Call?

A short call is an options position taken as a trading strategy when a trader accepts that the price of the asset underlying the option will drop. In this manner, it's considered a [bearish trading strategy](/bear-position).

Short calls have limited profit potential and the hypothetical risk of unlimited loss. They're generally utilized exclusively by experienced traders and investors.

## How a Short Call Works

A short call strategy is one of two simple ways options traders can take bearish positions. It includes selling [call options](/calloption), or calls. Calls give the holder of the option the right to buy the underlying security at a predetermined price (the [strike price](/strikeprice)) before the option contract terminates.

The seller, or writer, of the call option receives the [premium](/option-premium) the buyer pays for the call. The seller must deliver the underlying shares to the call buyer assuming the buyer exercises the option.

The progress of the short call strategy lays on the option contract terminating worthless. Like that, the trader banks the profit from the premium. The expired position will be eliminated from their account.

For this to occur, the price of the underlying security must fall below the strike price. Assuming it does, the buyer won't exercise the option.

On the off chance that the price rises, the option will be exercised on the grounds that the buyer can get the shares at the strike price and quickly sell them at the higher market price for a profit.

For the seller, there's unlimited exposure during the time allotment the option is feasible. That is on the grounds that the underlying security's price could rise over the strike price during this time, and keep rising. The option would be exercised eventually before expiration. When that occurs, the seller needs to go into the market and buy the shares at the current price. That price might actually be a lot higher than the strike price that the buyer will pay.

A seller of a generally own the underlying call shares of an option is selling a [naked short](/nakedshorting) call. To limit losses, a few traders will exercise a short call while claiming the underlying security. This is known as a [covered call](/coveredcall). Or on the other hand, then again, they may just close out their naked short position, accepting a loss that is not as much as what they'd lose assuming that the option were [assigned](/task) (exercised).

## Illustration of a Short Call

Say that shares of Humbucker Holdings are trading close $100 and are in a strong uptrend. Nonetheless, in view of a combination of fundamental and technical examinations, a trader accepts that Humbucker is overvalued. That's what they feel, eventually, it will fall to $50 a share.

In light of that, the trader chooses to sell a call with a strike price of $110 and a premium of $1.00. They receive a net premium credit of $100 ($1.00 x 100 shares).

The price of Humbucker stock really does without a doubt drop. The calls lapse worthless and unexercised. The trader will partake in the full amount of the premium as profit. The strategy worked.

Nonetheless, things could rather turn out badly. Humbucker share prices could keep moving up as opposed to go down. This makes a theoretically limitless risk for the call writer.

For instance, say the shares climb to $200 inside a couple of months. The call holder exercises the option and buys the shares at the $90 dollar strike price. The shares must be delivered to the call holder. The call writer enters the market, buys 100 shares at the current market price of, it ends up, $200 per share. This is the trader's outcome:

Buy 100 shares at $200 per share = $20,000

Receive $90 per share from buyer = $9,000

Loss to trader is $20,000 - $9,000 = ($11,000)

Trader applies $100 premium received for a total loss of ($10,900)

> Short calls can be very risky due to the potential for loss assuming they're exercised and the short call writer needs to buy the shares that must be delivered.

## Short Calls versus Long Puts

As recently referenced, a short call strategy is one of two fundamental bearish strategies including options. The other is buying [puts](/putoption). Put options give the holder the right to sell a security at a certain price inside a specific time span. Going long on puts, as traders say, is likewise a wagered that prices will fall, however the strategy works in an unexpected way.

Say that our trader actually accepts Humbucker stock is set out toward a fall. They opt to buy a put with a $90 strike price for a $1.00 premium. The trader burns through $100 for the right to sell shares at $90 even on the off chance that the genuine market price falls to $50. Of course, in the event that the stock doesn't drop below $90, the trader will have lost the premium paid for the protection.

## FAQ

### What's the Risk of a Naked Short Call?

In this way, the risk is that the market price for the security goes up over the option strike price, the buyer exercises the option, and traders must enter the market to buy the securities at a cost way above what they'll receive for them (the strike price).
### How could Someone Sell Call Options?
Investors who accept that the price of a security will fall could sell calls on that security basically for income. All in all, they'll profit just from the premium they received for selling the option. In any case, for the strategy to succeed, the option needs to terminate unexercised by the buyer.
