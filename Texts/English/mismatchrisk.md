# Mismatch Risk
## What Is Mismatch Risk?

Mismatch risk has a number of specific definitions in finance, yet with each fundamentally alluding to the chance that a loss can arise from a contrariness between at least two gatherings and their objectives. Mismatch risk can frequently appear as a [principal-agent problem](/principal-agent-problem).

The principal-agent problem is a conflict in priorities between a person or group and the representative authorized to act for their benefit. A [agent](/agent) may act in a way that is in opposition to the best interests of the [principal](/principal).

Substantial instances of mismatch risk include:

1. [Swap contract](/swap) mismatch risk alludes to the possibility that a swap dealer will not be able to find a suitable [counterparty](/counterparty) for a swap transaction for which it is acting as an intermediary.
1. For investors, mismatch risk happens when an investor picks investments that are not suitable for their situation, risk tolerance, or means.
1. For companies, mismatch risk arises while assets generating cash to cover liabilities don't have a similar interest rates, maturity dates, or potentially currencies.

## Understanding Mismatch Risk

Investors or companies experience mismatch risk when transactions in which they draw in or assets they hold are not lined up with their necessities.

As talked about above, there are three common types of mismatch risk connected with swap transactions, investor investments, and cash flows.

### Mismatch Risk with Swaps

For [swaps](/swap), a number of factors can make it hard for a [swap bank](/swapbank) or one more intermediary to find a counterparty for a swap transaction. For instance, one company might have to participate in a swap with an exceptionally large notional principal however finds it challenging to track down a willing counterparty to take the opposite side of the transaction. The number of potential swappers might be limited, in this case.

Another model might be a swap with unmistakable terms. Again, counterparties might not have needs for those exact terms. To gain a portion of the benefits of the swap, the primary company might need to acknowledge somewhat altered terms. That could leave it with an imperfect [hedge](/hedge) or a strategy that may not match its specific figures.

### Mismatch Risk for Investors

For investors, a mismatch between investment type and investment horizon can be a source of mismatch risk. For instance, mismatch risk would exist in a situation where an investor with a short investment horizon, (for example, one who is close to retirement) puts vigorously in speculative biotech stocks. Commonly, investors with short investment horizons ought to zero in on less speculative investments like fixed income securities and blue-chip equities.

Another model would be an investor in a low tax bracket investing in tax-free [municipal bonds](/municipalbond). Or on the other hand a risk-disinclined investor that purchases a [aggressive](/aggressivegrowthfund) mutual fund or investments with critical volatility.

### Mismatch Risk for Cash Flows

For companies, a mismatch among assets and liabilities might deliver cash flow that doesn't match with liabilities. One model may be the point at which an asset generates semi-annual payments, yet the company must pay rent, utilities, and providers consistently. The company might be presented to missing its payment obligations in the event that it doesn't deal with its money firmly between getting funds.

Another model may be a company getting income in one currency yet paying its obligations in another currency. [Currency swaps](/currencyswap) may be employed to moderate that risk.

## A Classic Mismatch Example

The classic illustration of risks among assets and liabilities is a bank that gets in the short-term market to loan in the long-term market. At the point when short-term interest rates rise and long-term rates stay flat, the bank's ability to profit declines. The spread among short-and long-term rates, or the [yield curve](/yieldcurve), psychologists and that presses the bank's [profit margins](/profitmargin).

Compound that risk for a global bank with currency mismatches and the requirement for an exotic, difficult to achieve, swap transaction to relieve those risks, and the bank has a triple mismatch. For instance, expect a bank has $1 billion in short-term borrowings in USD, and $1 billion long-term loans overseas in different currencies. While they might have different borrowings and loans that assist with supporting the currency exposure, they might in any case be presented to currency variances which influence their profitability.

They could go into a swap contract to assist with offsetting a portion of the currency variances. This by and by may leave them with a potential mismatch risk connected with the swap transactions.
