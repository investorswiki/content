# Official Settlement Account
## What Is an Official Settlement Account?

An official settlement account is a special type of account utilized in international [balance of payments](/bop) (BoP) accounting to keep track of central banks' reserve asset transactions with another. The official settlement account keeps track of transactions including gold, foreign exchange reserves, bank deposits and [special drawing rights (SDRs).](/sdr)

Basically, this type of account keeps track of transactions connected with international reserves and central bank assets that are moved among nations to settle either a balance of payment deficit or surplus.

## Understanding Official Settlement Accounts

Official settlement accounts are utilized in international balance of payments accounting, and address the [current account](/currentaccount) and the [capital account](/capitalaccount) of central banks. The current account keeps a record of a country's imports and exports of goods, services, income and transfers, and whether the country is a net creditor or net debtor. The capital account records the change in foreign and domestic investments, government borrowing and private sector borrowing. At the point when there is either a balance of payments deficit or surplus, inflows of [reserve assets](/reserve-assets) or surges of reserve assets bring the ledger back into balance. This is recorded in the official settlement account.

The Bank for International Settlements ([BIS](/bis)) is an international financial institution that plans to advance global monetary and financial stability and keeps up with oversight of official settlement accounts. The BIS is at times called the "central bank for central banks" since it gives banking services to institutions like the European Central Bank and Federal Reserve.

## Monitoring an Official Settlement Account

Nations keep an eye on the official settlement account to measure their economic wellbeing in the global economy. Assuming there are consistent outpourings of reserve assets for a country, it means that its competitiveness in delivering exported goods is moderately weak, or it's business environment isn't quite so appealing as that offered by different countries for direct foreign investment.

A nation running constant current account [deficits](/deficit) may then figure out policy remedies to work on the quality of its goods for export or look for exchange rate acclimations to make their exports more price competitive. It additionally may try to make better conditions for international companies hoping to build new industrial facilities abroad. Tax incentives, infrastructure tasks, and labor force training programs could be elevated by a country to address undesirable surges recorded in its official settlement account.
