# Dispersion
## What Is Dispersion?

Dispersion is a statistical term that depicts the size of the distribution of values expected for a specific variable and can be measured by several unique statistics, like reach, variance, and [standard deviation](/standarddeviation). In finance and investing, dispersion generally alludes to the scope of conceivable [returns](/return) on an investment. It can likewise be utilized to measure the risk inherent in a specific security or investment portfolio.

## Figuring out Dispersion

Dispersion is in many cases deciphered as a measure of the degree of vulnerability, and in this manner [risk](/risk), associated with a specific security or investment [portfolio](/portfolio).

Investors have huge number of potential [securities](/security) to invest in and many factors to consider in picking where to invest. One factor high on their rundown of contemplations is the risk profile of the investment. Dispersion is one of numerous statistical measures to give point of view.

> Most funds will address their risk profile in their reality sheets or [prospectuses](/plan), which can be promptly found on the internet. Data on individual stocks, in the mean time, can be found on Morningstar and comparative stock rating companies.

The dispersion of return on an asset shows the [volatility](/volatility) and risk associated with holding that [asset](/asset). The more variable the return on an asset, the more risky or unstable it is.

For instance, an asset whose historical return at whatever year goes from +10% to - 10% can be viewed as more unpredictable than an asset whose historical return goes from +3% to - 3% on the grounds that its returns are all the more widely scattered.

## Measuring Dispersion
### Beta

The primary risk measurement statistic, [beta](/beta), measures the dispersion of a security's return relative to a specific benchmark or [market index](/marketindex), most often the U.S. S&P 500 index. A beta measure of 1.0 shows the investment moves as one with the benchmark.

A beta greater than 1.0 shows the security is probably going to experience moves greater than the [market](/monetary market) in general — a stock with a beta of 1.3 could be expected to experience moves that are 1.3x the market, meaning assuming the market is up 10%, the beta stock of 1.3 trips 13%. That's what the flip side is assuming the market goes down, that security will probably go down more than the market, however there are no guarantees of the size of the moves.

A beta of under 1.0 means a less distributed return relative to the overall market. For instance, a security with a beta of 0.87 will probably trail the overall market — on the off chance that the market is up 10%, the investment with the lower beta would be expected to rise just 8.7%.

### Alpha

[Alpha](/alpha) is a statistic that measures a portfolio's [risk-adjusted returns](/riskadjustedreturn) — that is, how much, pretty much, did the investment return relative to the index or beta.

A return higher than the beta shows a positive alpha, generally credited to the outcome of the [portfolio manager](/portfoliomanager) or model. A negative alpha, then again, shows the lack of outcome of the portfolio manager in beating the beta or, all the more comprehensively, the market.

## Highlights
- Dispersion alludes to the scope of possible results of investments in view of historical volatility or returns.
- Dispersion can be measured utilizing alpha and beta, which measure risk-adjusted endlessly returns relative to a benchmark index, separately.
- Generally talking, the higher the dispersion, the riskier an investment is, and vice versa.
