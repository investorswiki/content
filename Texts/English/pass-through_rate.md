# Pass-Through Rate
## What Is a Pass-Through Rate?

The pass-through rate is the interest rate on a [securitized](/securitize) asset, for example, a mortgage-backed security (MBS), that is paid to investors once management fees, servicing fees, and [guarantee fees](/guarantee_fees) have been deducted by the issuer of the securitized asset. It is frequently alluded to as the net interest rate.

## Figuring out a Pass-Through Rate

The pass-through rate (otherwise called the coupon rate for a MBS) is lower than the interest rate on the individual securities inside the offering. The biggest issuers of securitized assets are the Sallie Mae, Fannie Mae, and Freddie Mac corporations, whose guarantees on mortgages are backed by the U.S. government, giving the mortgages high credit ratings.

The pass-through rate is the net interest the issuer pays investors after any remaining costs and fees are settled. In a [mortgage-backed security](/mbs) (MBS), for instance, the amount sent to investors passes from the payments on the underlying [mortgages](/mortgage) that make up the securitized mortgage security, through the pay specialist and at last to the investor.

The pass-through rate is continuously going to be not exactly the average interest rate paid by the borrower on the mortgages backing the security. This is so in light of the fact that different fees are deducted from the paid interest, including general [management fees](/managementfee), for the overall management of the security, the going through with of transactions connected with the security pool, and for guarantees associated with the securities in question. As defined in the terms and conditions administering the issuance of the securitized asset, fees are set up as percentages of the interest generated from the underlying mortgages or as flat rates.

## Securitizing Mortgage-Backed Securities (MBS)

Numerous institutions, like banks, endorse various mortgages. They frequently then take these mortgages, repackage them into a bundle of mortgages, and sell them to investors as a mortgage-backed security (MBS). The investor that purchases the MBS gets the interest payments on the individual mortgages that make up the securitized asset as interest payments/returns on the asset.

During times of economic stability, the risk associated with investing in mortgage-backed securities is low when compared to numerous other investment options, as there is diversity through the many mortgages that make up the securitized pool. The return realized as the pass-through rate is commonly thought to be equitable for the degree of risk implied.

## Projecting a Pass-Through Rate

While investing in a securitized asset, investors will project the pass-through rate as the return on their investment. Of course, unexpected factors might emerge and influence the amount of net interest generated.

For instance, on the off chance that the mortgages backing the security carry a variable or [floating rate](/floatinginterestrate) as opposed to a [fixed rate](/fixedinterestrate), changes in the average interest rate will impact the amount of the return. Consequently, investors might endeavor to expect interest rate changes over the life of the security and factor them into the projected pass-through rate. This cycle assists the investor with concluding whether the return is worth the degree of risk associated with the underlying mortgages.

## Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac

Congress made Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to give [liquidity](/liquidity), stability, and affordability in the mortgage market. The organizations give liquidity to great many banks, [savings and loans](/government savings-and-credit), and mortgage companies, making loans for financing homes.

Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac purchase mortgages from lenders and hold the mortgages in their portfolios or package the loans into mortgage-backed securities that may later be sold. Lenders utilize the cash raised by selling mortgages for participating in extra lending. The organizations' purchases assist with guaranteeing that individuals buying homes and investors purchasing high rises or other multifamily residences have a continuous supply of mortgage money.
