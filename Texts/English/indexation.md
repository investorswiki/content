# Indexation
## What Is Indexation?

Indexation is a system or technique utilized by organizations or governments to interface prices and asset values. This is finished by connecting changes made to the value of a decent, price of a service, or one more indicated value to a predetermined price or composite index. Indexation requires recognizing a price index and determining whether connecting the value to the price index will achieve the association's objectives. Indexation is generally ordinarily utilized with wages in a high-[inflation](/inflation) environment. Indexation is otherwise called [escalating](/escalatorclause).

## Grasping Indexation

Indexing a given price or payment to different prices can fill two primary needs. It tends to be utilized either to keep a stable relative price between at least two goods or services or to keep a stable real price of a decent or service relative to the purchasing power of a currency unit. Indexation is a pre-indicated process, implying that all gatherings included are regularly aware of how the connection functions.

In the first, and easier, case, this is finished by determining the ideal target ratio of two prices and adjusting one price when different changes to keep up with the ratio. For instance, an ice cream stand could index the sale price of ice cream cones to the wholesale price that they pay for ice cream to keep a consistent profit margin by keeping the price of cones served steady, relative to the cost of bulk ice cream. Like that if the wholesale price of the information duplicates, so does the output price and the business stays profitable.

In the subsequent case, a price or asset value is linked to a price level of a basket of goods, which is generally set equivalent to 100 at a given point in time. Price indexes are regularly distributed by official government agencies, frequently for the specific purpose of helpful use in the indexation of prices, wages, and transfer payments.

Businesses might utilize this type of indexation to match a worker's salary increases to the inflation rate, implying that an increase in the consumer price level throughout some undefined time frame will lead to an increase in salary. This specific type of indexation is called a [cost of living](/cost-of-living) increase (COLA).

In the above model, the utilization of indexation, in theory, can moderate the impact of inflation against a specialist's [standard of living](/standard-of-living). Without this sort of indexation, most workers would successfully be getting a real wage cut every year as inflation cuts into the [purchasing power](/purchasingpower) of their nominal wages. There are still opportunities for economic changes to force a few disparity among salaries and the pace of inflation.

Governments could comparably involve indexation as an approach to possibly lighten the negative effects inflation can have on the beneficiaries of [transfer payments](/transferpayment) and qualifications. Social Security payments, for instance, are indexed to the annual increase in the [Consumer Price Index](/consumerpriceindex).

Notwithstanding indexation after some time, prices and wages can be indexed over various geographic areas. For instance, since rents and costs of residing change from one place to another, a company with employees in numerous states or urban communities could have to connect compensation in various areas to neighborhood prices. This should be possible either by indexing pay to the common wages paid by different businesses in those areas or by utilizing an index, for example, the Regional Price Parities distributed by the Bureau of Economic Analysis.

Different assets and values may be subject to indexation. A few countries could apply indexation on certain types of tax payments at different periods. For example, it very well may be applied to debt mutual funds that have been held for a certain base amount of time before being sold. In such a case, the original purchase price is adjusted for inflation while computing long-term capital gains that will be taxed when those debt funds are sold. This can lead to a discount on taxes after the transaction for the seller of such assets.

Indexation could likewise be applied to pension funds to console participants that their assets will keep pace with inflation. Like that, the value of those assets don't dissolve over the long haul.

Life insurance companies could offer their clients policies that incorporate terms for indexation, which might guarantee a payout that is adjusted for inflation. Be that as it may, the premiums for such plans can be higher with annual increases. Such a product might raise worries about consumers overspending on premiums, particularly for periods when inflation is negligible and below the rate of increase that is charged for indexation.
