# Wick
By definition, a wick is a line found on a candlestick chart which is utilized to demonstrate where the price of an asset is fluctuating concerning its opening and closing prices. Wicks may likewise be alluded to as [whiskers](/whiskers), shadows or tails.
In terms of financial markets, a wick is essentially a vertical line that assists you with visualizing the high and low scopes of price action. This means that while perusing an ordinary candlestick chart, traders will center, in addition to other things, on three key points â€” the opening price, the closing price, and the candlestick wicks.
The actual wicks show limits in prices, allowing traders to better grasp market sentiment and momentum. This means that as the price moves corresponding to the opening and closing price, wicks are shaped as a visual record of such movement.
The candlestick pattern is made in light of the open, high, low, and close of a market. The "case" portion of the candlestick is known as the body, while the lines on either end are the wicks (addressing associated highs and lows).
The length of the wick is likewise applicable. For instance, when there is a long wick at the lower part of the candle, it shows that the price went right down and back up again before the close of the candle. This recommends an increase in buying right after a period of selling pressure. For this reason a few technical analysts accept that a long wick will frequently demonstrate price reversal, moving the market the other way of that wick.
On the other hand, there is likewise the possibility of a wickless candle. These candles seem to be a square or rectangle on the grounds that the closing and opening prices concur with the high and low signs of that specific candlestick.
With regards to trading, knowing how to peruse a candlestick chart is extremely valuable, and candlestick patterns are most certainly an interesting point while attempting to comprehend and foresee market sentiment and price movements. Nonetheless, it is important to keep as a main priority that a broker's strategy shouldn't utilize candlestick analysis alone, yet rather related to different instruments and technical analysis indicators.
