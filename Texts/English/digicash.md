## What Is DigiCash?

Established by electronic currency pioneer [David Chaum](/ecash) in 1989, DigiCash was one of the earliest electronic money companies. Digicash is both the name of the currency David Chaum developed and the company that administered it.

Chaum developed a number of cryptographic conventions that represented DigiCash transactions and set his currency apart from its rivals. These conventions made DigiCash an important ancestor of modern digital currencies.

DigiCash was in business for under a decade, and during that time it was unable to persuade banks to embrace its technology. The company sought financial protection in 1998, a decade before the financial crisis that would be the catalyst for the development of blockchain-based cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin.

## Grasping DigiCash

David Chaum earned his doctorate in computer science from the University of California, Berkeley in 1982. His thesis "Computer Systems Established, Maintained and Mutually Trusted by Suspicious Groups" is viewed as a prototype of blockchain technology.

That very year, Chaum established the International Association for Cryptologic Research (IACR), which was a leading institution for research into and development of digital cryptography.

Chaum distributed Blind Signatures for Untraceable Payments in 1982, which presents the proper system for numerically scrambling payments. The system was a critical development for digital cash since it anonymizes payments. This means that banks and the government can't trace the payer in a two-party transaction. Be that as it may, it is not the same as blockchain technology since it expects banks to act as trusted outsiders for every electronic transaction.

## History of DigiCash

Chaum established DigiCash in Amsterdam in 1989 to capitalize on his hypothetical work in digital currency. By 1995, the company had entered agreements with the Mark Twain Bank in St. Louis (presently Mercantile Bancorporation). In 1996, DigiCash hammered out an agreement with Deutsche Bank, Credit Suisse, the Australian bank Advance Bank, Norske Bank, and the Bank Austria.

After a promising beginning during the 1990s, DigiCash failed to build on early triumphs. A few sources put the fault on Chaum, who reportedly have zero faith in his employees and evidently put flawlessness before practicality while fostering his product. He additionally wouldn't go into partnerships with large banks, like ING, and was distrustful of big technology players, as Microsoft and Netscape.

Had DigiCash had the option to secure a partnership with at least one major financial institutions along these lines, it would probably have had a greatly improved chance of getting by in the quickly digitizing financial world. One of the most encouraging (but at last frustrating) potential partnerships was with Citibank. The bank participated in long-term discussions with DigiCash about the possibility of coordinating, just to shift toward different ventures eventually.

Chaum said in a meeting in 1999 that the company's problem scaling was due to a classic chicken and egg problem in the technology industry: "It was difficult to get an adequate number of vendors to acknowledge it, so you could get an adequate number of consumers to utilize it, or vice versa."

For users to conduct transactions utilizing DigiCash, they expected to use a particular type of programming. This considered the withdrawal of notes from a bank by means of the utilization of designated scrambled keys. It additionally permitted users to send DigiCash payments to different beneficiaries.

DigiCash used a digital currency called "cyberbucks." In a 2003 report, the Guardian suggested that DigiCash saw its highest levels of support from freedom supporters and others for a digital, international currency that would exist outside of the control of any government.

DigiCash gave a broad and unique set of payment sizes for users, including [micropayments](/micropayment). An email mailing system was set up for currency trading, and numerous traders additionally participated in off-market exchanges too.

### After Digicash

DigiCash was a urgent early defender of public and private key cryptography, the very fundamental principle that is utilized by digital currencies today. Known as "Blind Signature" technology, Chaum's innovation both enhanced security for DigiCash users and made electronic payments untraceable by outside sources.

Chaum keeps on being associated with the cryptography and digital payments world. Despite the fact that DigiCash never completely made headway, it in any case served to establish the groundwork for the clamoring cryptocurrency world that exists today.
