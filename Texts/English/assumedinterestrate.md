# Assumed Interest Rate (AIR)
## What Is the Assumed Interest Rate (AIR)?

The assumed interest rate (AIR) is the rate of interest (or growth rate) chose by an insurance company. The assumed interest rate is given to decide the value of a [annuity contract](/annuitycontract) and, consequently, the periodic income payment gave to the annuitant.

Combined with different factors, for example, the annuitant's age upon [annuitization](/annuitization), spousal coverage options and the type of annuity coverage picked, the AIR decides the regularly scheduled payment the annuitant will receive. Insurance companies utilize the AIR to compute the value of an annuity.

Numerous investors use annuities to generate retirement income, and realizing the AIR can assist such annuitants with planning monetarily for their retirement years since it tells them the amount they can hope to receive from an annuity. Computing the value of an annuity likewise gives investors plan extra investments access different vehicles.

## Understanding the Assumed Interest Rate (AIR)

The assumed interest rate (AIR) is the base interest rate that must be earned on investments in the policyholder's money value account to cover the insurance company's costs and expected [profit margin](/profitmargin). A bigger AIR will bring about a more robust prediction for market returns, as well as more prominent month to month income payment for the annuitant.

The AIR isn't a [guaranteed rate of return](/guaranteedinvestmentcontract). Rather, it is an earnings target that the insurance company sets for the annuity account. The account must meet this earnings target to keep up with payment levels. As annuity value changes, the payment received by the investor changes. On the off chance that the account outperforms the AIR, an investor can anticipate that their payments should increase in size. Assuming performance falls below the AIR, payments will diminish in size. Performance is constantly estimated against the AIR, not past performance.

### What It's Based On

An annuity payment depends on the number of annuity units owned by the investor, increased by the annuity unit value. At the point when performance rises to AIR, the annuity unit value stays unchanged, thus will the investor's payment. In this way, it is vital to choose a sensible AIR.

In the event that the AIR is too high, the value of the annuity unit will keep on falling, alongside the investor's payment. In the event that the account outperforms the AIR, the value of the annuity unit will proceed to rise, thus will the investor's payment. The AIR is just pertinent during the payout phase of the contract when the investor is getting payments and possesses annuity units. The aggregation of units during the amassing stage — or on the other hand in the event that benefits are conceded — is irrelevant to the assumed interest rate.

## Illustration of an Assumed Interest Rate

As a speculative model, expect a [variable annuity](/variableannuity), where the annuitant receives a base guaranteed periodic payment that is tied to the performance of the annuity's underlying investments. An assumed interest rate of 5% on $1 million of chief would accordingly generate bigger [minimum payments](/least regularly scheduled payment) to the annuitant than an annuity performing at 2%.

Albeit the annuitant can receive extra payments in the event that the annuity's underlying assets outperform expectations, the base guaranteed payment is tied to the assumed interest rate.

## Highlights
- Realizing the AIR can assist beneficiaries with planning for what's in store.
- The assumed interest rate is the growth rate the insurance company chooses.
- AIR decides the regularly scheduled payment of the annuity.
