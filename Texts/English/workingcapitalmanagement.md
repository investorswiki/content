## Working Capital Management Ratios

Three ratios that are important in working capital management are the working capital ratio (or current ratio), the collection ratio, and the inventory turnover ratio.

### Current Ratio (Working Capital Ratio)

The working capital ratio or [current ratio](/currentratio) is calculated as current assets partitioned by current liabilities. It is a key indicator of a company's financial wellbeing as it exhibits its ability to meet its short-term financial obligations.

In spite of the fact that numbers change by industry, a working capital ratio below 1.0 generally demonstrates that a company is experiencing difficulty meeting its short-term obligations. That is, the company's debts due in the forthcoming year wouldn't be covered by its liquid assets. In this case, the company might need to resort to selling off assets, getting long-term debt, or utilizing other financing options to cover its short-term debt obligations.

Working capital ratios of 1.2 to 2.0 are viewed as desirable, yet a ratio higher than 2.0 may propose that the company isn't effectively utilizing its assets to increase incomes. A high ratio might show that the company isn't dealing with its working capital efficiently.

### Collection Ratio (Days Sales Outstanding)

The collection ratio, otherwise called [days sales outstanding](/dso) (DSO), is a measure of how efficiently a company deals with its accounts receivable. The collection ratio is calculated as the product of the number of days in an accounting period duplicated by the average amount of outstanding accounts receivable separated by the total amount of net credit sales during the accounting period.

The collection ratio calculation gives the average number of days it takes a company to receive payment after a sales transaction on credit. On the off chance that a company's billing department is effective at collections endeavors and customers pay their bills on time, the collection ratio will be lower. The lower a company's collection ratio, the more rapidly it transforms receivables into cash.

### Inventory Turnover Ratio

One more important element of working capital management is inventory management. To operate with maximum productivity and keep an easily high level of working capital, a company must [keep adequate inventory on hand](/inventory-management) to address customers' issues while staying away from pointless inventory that ties up working capital.

Companies normally measure how efficiently that balance is kept up with by monitoring the inventory turnover ratio. The inventory turnover ratio, calculated as cost of goods sold separated by average balance sheet inventory, uncovers how quickly a company's inventory is being utilized in sales and supplanted. A generally low ratio compared to industry peers demonstrates a risk that inventory levels are exorbitantly high, while a moderately high ratio might show deficient inventory levels.
