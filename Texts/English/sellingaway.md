# Selling Away
## What Is Selling Away?

Selling away is the point at which a [broker](/broker) requests a client to purchase securities not held or offered by the executing brokerage firm. Brokerage firms generally have arrangements of approved products that can be offered by their brokers to clients of the firm. These approved products have typically gone through due diligence screenings and have been distinguished by the firm's screening personnel as strong products.

At the point when a broker sells from the firm's rundown of approved products, they run the risk of selling something for which due diligence has not been completed. When in doubt, such activities are a violation of securities regulations.

## How Selling Away Works

Selling away happens when a broker sells investments that are not a part of the official rundown of products offered by their firm. On occasion, a broker may improperly do this on the grounds that the client needs to purchase a product that has not yet been approved by the broker's firm, a particularly specific mutual fund or a [over-the-counter](/otc) (OTC) security.

The broker might be anxious to earn a commission and to keep their client blissful, so they could curve or break the rules and figure out how to get the security wanted by their client. This can frequently happen when the investments being referred to are private [placements](/arrangement) or other non-public investments that have limited oversight or transparency. Generally, selling away is a violation of securities regulations and can bring about disciplinary action or fines.

FINRA rule 3040 forbids a registered representative or [associated person](/associatedperson) from selling any security "away" from the [member firm](/memberfirm) except if the firm has authorized the associated person to make the sale. Rule 3040 further requires registered persons to give notice of the proposed transaction, recorded as a hard copy, to their firm, before the sale is made.

## Instance of Selling Away

For instance, Bert is a broker at Bert's Brokerage. Ernie is Bert's client. Ernie needs to purchase stock of XYZ company, which is a private company not traded on public exchanges. They are offering stock straightforwardly through an agency that endorses and circulates private positions. Sadly, Bert's brokerage has not played out the fundamental due diligence on XYZ company, so their private stock isn't on the rundown of approved products available to be purchased. Bert, in any case, needs to earn the commission associated with this sale of XYZ company stock, so Bert "sells away" from Bert's Brokerage and finishes the transaction for his client by utilizing a third-party broker, Sam's Securities, who has endorsement for that product.

## Features
- Selling away is much of the time seen as a violation of both internal work environment rules as well as more extensive securities regulation.
- Selling away alludes to offering or getting financial products for a client that are not approved by a brokerage.
- Doing so can create extra commissions for a broker, yet accompanies a greater degree of risk since those products are not verified or authorized available to be purchased by the broker's employer.
