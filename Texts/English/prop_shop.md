## What Is a Prop Shop?

A prop shop is a trading firm that conveys its own capital in quest for trading profits. 'Prop' is short for proprietary. An assortment of trading strategies are employed by prop shops for assets going from fundamental liquid assets like stocks and bonds to complex securities, for example, [collateralized debt obligations](/cdo) (CDO), [derivatives](/subordinate), and commodity futures. They likewise are active in arbitrage strategies and large macro wagers. Prop shops can go long, go short, or do both. Trades are ordinarily executed by traders, yet algorithmic trading is important for a developing number of prop shops.

## Understanding Prop Shop

Prop shops are shaped by people who contribute their own capital. If these owners have any desire to run a tight ship, they will conduct the actual trading. On the off chance that they wish to scale up, the prop shop founders will utilize traders to carry out designated strategies or set them loose to openly trade all alone. Anybody taken on board must contribute their own capital as an entry fee, and will be subject to trading risk limits. A prop shop splits trading profits, if any, between the firm and the trader. Prop shop trading is high risk, high reward. A trader can strike gold one day, give everything back the next, become well off past their fantasies in no time if great or fortunate, or collapse completely and turn out to be accompanied out of the building carrying a cardboard box and dismal articulation.

## Prop Shop versus Prop Desk

Until the order of the [Volcker Rule](/volcker-rule), proprietary trading desks could be found at investment banks playing with big pieces of bank capital. Here and there these prop desks earned disproportionate measures of profits for their hosts and some of the time they fared ineffectively. For instance, Morgan Stanley's prop desk lost $9 billion of every 2007 from trading mortgages. The Volcker Rule either disposed of or seriously diminished prop desks on Wall Street. (Note: The Volcker Rule could be revoked.) Many of these gun fighter traders who were given huge number of dollars in bonuses regardless of losing billions for bank shareholders joined or framed prop shops. Nobody cares whether a trader loses his own money at a prop shop.
