# Needs Approach
## What Is the Needs Approach?

The necessities approach is an approach to determining the fitting amount of [life insurance](/wholelife) coverage an individual ought to purchase. This approach depends on the creation of a budget of expenses that will be incurred, including memorial service expenses, estate settlement costs, and replacement of a portion of future income to support the spouse or dependants.

## Understanding the Needs Approach

The necessities approach is a function of two variables:

1. The necessary amount at death to meet immediate obligations.
1. The future necessary income to support the household.

While working out your expenses, misjudging your necessities a little is best. For example, the necessities approach will consider any remaining obligations and obligations that ought to be covered, like a mortgage or vehicle payments. The necessities approach likewise perceives that the requirement for income replacement may slowly decline as children residing at home move away, or on the other hand assuming a spouse remarries.

The necessities approach appears differently in relation to the [human-life approach](/humanlifeapproach). The human-life approach computes the amount of life insurance a family will require, in view of the financial loss the family would cause in the event that the insured person were to die today.

The human life approach ordinarily considers factors, for example, the insured individual's age, orientation, arranged retirement age, occupation, annual wage, and employment benefits, as well as the personal and financial data of the spouse and any dependent children.

## Types of Life Insurance

Life insurance gives financial protection to enduring dependents in case of the death of an insured. Similarly as with different forms of [insurance](/insurance), life insurance is a contract between an insurer and a policyholder. In life insurance, the insurer guarantees payment of a death benefit to named beneficiaries.

Different types of life insurance approaches exist, including the requirements approach and the human life approach. Whole life, term life, universal life, and variable universal life (VUL) policies are separate types of plans accessible to individuals and their families. Whole life (otherwise called traditional or permanent life) covers the duration of the life of the insured.

As well as giving a death benefit, whole life likewise contains a savings part where cash value might gather. [Term life](/termlife) guarantees payment of a death benefit during a predetermined term. Dissimilar to whole life, after the term lapses, the policyholder can reestablish for another term, convert to permanent (whole life) coverage, or let the policy terminate.

[Universal life](/universallife) is like whole life insurance, yet it gives an extra investment savings element and low payments like term life insurance. Most universal life insurance policies contain a flexible premium option, albeit some require a single premium (single lump-sum premium) or fixed premiums (scheduled fixed premiums).

At last, [variable universal life](/variableuniversallife) or VUL is a permanent life policy with an underlying savings part, which allows for the investment of the cash value. Like standard universal life, the VUL premium is flexible.
