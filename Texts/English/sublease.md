## What Is a Sublease?

A sublease is the re-renting of property by an existing tenant to another outsider for a portion of the tenant's existing [lease](/lease) contract. The sublease agreement may likewise be called a rent.

Subleasing might be permitted in the terms of the original lease, and might be subject to extra limitations by jurisdiction. Even on the off chance that a sublease is permitted, the original tenant is as yet liable for the obligations stated in the lease agreement, like the payment of rent every month.

## How a Sublease Works

A lease is a contract between a property owner and a tenant that transfers the owner's rights to the exclusive possession and utilization of the [real estate](/realestate) property to the tenant for a settled upon period. The lease states the timeframe the contract is to run and the amount of the tenant's rent. In legal terms, the tenant's legal right to have the property is considered tenancy. Subleasing happens when the tenant transfers a part of their legal tenancy to an outsider as another tenant.

Subleasing can be laid out except if the original lease disallows it. Notwithstanding, as a rule, the owner must be informed and must endorse any renting arrangement made by the tenant. Control over the renting system could be written into the original lease so the owner has some control over who utilizes or potentially involves their property.

A tenant who rents property must comprehend that subleasing doesn't release them from their obligations on the original contracted lease. The tenant is responsible for paying rent and for repairs or damage to the property. That means that if a new subtenant doesn't pay rent for quite a long time, the original tenant that subleased the property is liable to the landlord for the past due rent amount and any [late fees](/late-charge). Thus, the subtenant is liable to the original tenant for the unpaid rent.

## Subleasing and State Laws

The laws of many states and neighborhood districts influence a tenant's right to sublease. These laws might permit an individual to sublease under certain conditions even on the off chance that their contract with the landlord restricts it. For instance, in New York City, a tenant who lives in a building with at least four units has the privilege to sublease, as long as the landlord assents — or on the other hand in the event that they deny the rent on unreasonable grounds, Any lease provision confining a tenant's right to sublease is void as an issue of public policy.

In San Francisco, a tenant can supplant a flat mate with another, even when denied by a written lease, as long as the replacement meets the landlord's application screening standards. For instance, a landlord could demand a certain credit score where a tenant is concerned. Subleases can apply to both residential and commercial properties.

## Illustration of a Sublease

Since a lease is generally for a predefined term, circumstances can emerge that make it troublesome or inconceivable for the original tenant to complete the lease term. For instance, on the off chance that a tenant is renting an apartment in Chicago with a year lease and, during month four, that tenant receives a job offer in Boston, the tenant might choose to sublease the apartment to one more tenant for the excess eight months. The sublease means that the original tenant can acknowledge the job and move and doesn't need to pay costly fees to escape the lease or pay rent on two apartments.

The landlord likewise benefits since they receive every one of the 12 rent payments and are saved the expense and exertion of finding a replacement tenant. The sublease arrangement likewise means that the original tenant holds an interest in the apartment. Hence, assuming the original tenant chooses to move back to Chicago, they might have the option to reestablish their lease on their old apartment.
