# Christmas Tree Options Strategy
## What Is a Christmas Tree Options Strategy?

A Christmas tree is an options trading spread strategy accomplished by buying and selling six call (or six put) options with various strikes yet a similar expiration dates for a neutral to bullish forecast. This is named a long call Christmas tree while utilizing calls or a put Christmas tree while utilizing put options.

The strategy is accessible long (bullish) or short (bearish).

This spread is basically the combination of a long vertical spread and two short vertical spreads.

## How Christmas Trees Work

The Christmas tree name comes from the strategy's extremely loose likeness to a tree when seen on an options chain display. The association is questionable, best case scenario.

Christmas trees are like [butterfly spreads](/butterflyspread) in that they utilize different [vertical spreads](/verticalspread) to enclose an ideal possible return. The difference is that one of the strike prices is skipped, which presents a directional bias.

For example, in the event that a condor spread included the 50-55-60-65 strikes, the relating Christmas tree would include just the 50-55-65 strikes (skirting the 60 strike).

The standard, or long Christmas tree with calls (once in a while alluded to just as a "call tree"), includes buying one call option with a [at-the-money](/atthemoney) strike, skirting the next strike, and afterward selling three options with the accompanying strike. At last, buy two additional calls with the next higher strike. The 1-3-2 structure probably shows up as a tree.

The strategy profits from a small increase in the price of the underlying asset and maxes when the underlying closes at the middle option strike price at options expiration.

- Maximum profit equals middle [strike](/strikeprice) minus lower strike minus the premium.
- Maximum loss is the net debit paid for the strategy.
- Breakeven happens at the most reduced strike plus the premium paid or the highest strike minus half the premium.

Time decay is on the holder's side as the holder needs all options with the exception of the most reduced to terminate worthless.
