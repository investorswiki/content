# Paper Profit (Paper Loss)
## What is a Paper Profit (Paper Loss)?

A paper profit or loss is an unrealized [capital gain](/capitalgain) (or [capital loss](/capitalloss)) in an investment. For a purchased long investment, it is the difference between the current price and the purchase price.

For a sold or short investment, it is the difference between the price when sold short and the current price. Paper profits or losses just become realized, or genuine money profits or losses, when the investment position is closed.

## Understanding Paper Profit (Paper Loss)

Paper profits and losses are equivalent to [unrealized gains](/unrealizedgain) and [unrealized losses](/unrealizedloss). The profit just exists in the investor's (or business element's) ledger, and it will stay that way until the asset positions are closed out and settled in real money. A few gains or losses may just be impermanent curios of accounting. For instance, portfolio valuations, mutual fund [net asset values (NAV)](/nav), and some tax treatments might be founded on accounting standards which characterize unrealized profits and losses using [mark-to-market (MTM)](/marktomarket) accounting.

Investors might hold on to paper profits since they accept the underlying asset will keep on valuing in value. On the other hand, they might hold the profit for tax purposes, expecting to push any tax burden into the next tax year. The investor may likewise hold the asset to turn [short-term capital gains](/short-term-gain) into [long-term capital gains](/long-term_capital_gain_loss).

Even however there is no capital loss for tax purposes, there is as yet a loss in value. Keep as a top priority that a 25% loss in value on paper actually requires a 33.3% gain on the leftover value just to break even. The chances that the investment will bring in money go down when paper losses mount
1. On the flip side, the website boom saw a large number "[paper millionaires](/papermillionaire)" made from [restricted stock](/restrictedstock) or options. The rules for these employee incentive rewards made it incomprehensible for individuals to sell their stock and realize their wealth. Thus, after the [dot-com market crashed](/dotcom-bubble), many paper tycoons went belly up.
1. Maybe a more pertinent model for most investors is the case when they effectively pick a stock and watch it take off in price. They have a great outlook on it and need even more gains. That drives them to disregard awful news and hold their position even however the price of the stock begins to fall. Their paper profit dissipates. Their elation dazed them to the signs that the time had come to get out, even it whenever implied leaving some [profit](/profit) on the table.
