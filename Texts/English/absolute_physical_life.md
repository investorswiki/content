An asset's absolute physical life reaches a conclusion when it turns out to be innovatively obsolete, physically disintegrates to the point of insufficiency, or the product [life cycle](/lifecycle) closes. Ascertaining the absolute physical life can be utilized to decide the risk implied in purchasing an asset.

Generally, the term's utilized to depict assets that are at low risk of becoming obsolete: structures, equipment, vehicles, devices, or furniture. It could allude to bigger kinds of electronic equipment, similar to generators, however once in a while to more modest goods, similar to a PC or mobile telephone.

## Absolute Physical Life versus Helpful Life

Absolute physical life is not the same as the [economic](/economic-life) or [useful life](/usefullife) of an asset, which is the expected period of time during which an asset is in a real sense valuable to the average owner. The absolute physical life is the genuine time span an asset offers some incentive, while the valuable life is the **expected** lifespan of an asset.

> A few specialists utilize economic life and valuable life interchangeably. Others recognize economic life as alluding to how long something can function at a cost that is comparable to alternatives (like buying a new thing).

For instance, in the event that a company purchases a piece of equipment for $10,000 and it anticipates that it should be usable for a long time, the valuable life is 10 years. In that case, accepting no salvage value it would devalue the asset at $1,000 each year. Notwithstanding, the real physical, or absolute physical life, of that asset could end sooner, or reach out past the projected valuable life.

### Changes in Useful Life

Hypothetically, an asset's helpful life is (or ought to be) equivalent to its absolute physical life, but since the valuable life is an estimate, errors can result.

Changes in the valuable life happen when the asset is delivered obsolete sooner than expected, as is much of the time the case with super advanced products. The IRS allows the reporting of such a change with a nitty gritty clarification of why. In this case, the IRS might permit [accelerated depreciation](/accelerateddepreciation) to account for the more limited than-expected lifespan of the asset.
