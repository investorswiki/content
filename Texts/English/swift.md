## What Is the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunications (SWIFT)?

Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunications (SWIFT) is a part claimed cooperative providing secure informing for international transfers of money between participating banks.

Begun in 1973 by 239 banks from 15 countries, SWIFT started providing informing services in 1977. Its SWIFTnet informing system allows banks to share information about financial transactions. [Financial institutions](/financialinstitution) utilize SWIFT to securely exchange information including payment directions.

SWIFT has developed rapidly over the course of the years to serve in excess of 11,000 institutions operating in north of 200 countries. In 2021, SWIFT handled 42 million messages every day, up 11.4% from 2020.

## Grasping SWIFT

SWIFT took over as the primary system for confirming international funds transfers from [Telex](/transmitted transfer), providing a unified coding convention to identify banks and depict transactions.

SWIFT is settled in Belgium and has offices in Australia, Austria, Brazil, China, France, Germany, Ghana, Hong Kong, India, Indonesia, Italy, Japan, Kenya, South Korea, Malaysia, Mexico, Russia, Singapore, South Africa, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, UAE, and the United Kingdom.

The around 3,500 shareholder institutions are assigned shareholding stakes in SWIFT and the right to select directors to its overseeing board in view of their country's utilization of its informing system. Shareholders from every one of the main six countries utilizing the system assign two directors for each country to the board. Shareholders from every one of the next 10 countries by SWIFT use designate one director each, while different shareholders can choose up to three directors altogether.

The board right now incorporates two directors each from the U.S., the U.K., France, Belgium, and Switzerland. Others are from Russia, the Netherlands, Spain, South Africa, Singapore, China, Italy, Sweden, Luxembourg, Canada, Australia, Germany, Japan, and Hong Kong.

Albeit the directors address shareholder institutions from specific countries as opposed to the actual countries, in practice national states might apply influence through their regulatory powers over financial institutions, as well as economic sanctions systems.

## Grasping SWIFT Transactions

For money transfers, SWIFT doles out each participating financial organization a unique code with one or the other eight or 11 characters. The code has three tradable names: the bank identifier code (BIC), SWIFT code, SWIFT ID, or ISO 9362 code.

For instance, the Italian bank UniCredit Banca, settled in Milan, has the eight-character SWIFT code UNCRITMM. The initial four characters mirror the institute code (UNCR for UniCredit Banca), while the next two are the country code (IT for Italy), and the last characters determine the area/city code (MM for Milan). In the event that an organization decides to utilize a code with 11 characters, the last three discretionary characters can reflect individual branches. For instance, the UniCredit Banca branch in Milan utilizes the code UNCRITMMXXX.

Expect a customer of a TD Bank branch in Boston needs to send money to a companion who banks at the UniCredit Banca branch in Venice. The Bostonian can walk into a TD Bank branch with the companion's account number and UniCredit Banca Venice's unique SWIFT code. TD Bank will send a SWIFT message for a payment transfer to the specific UniCredit Banca branch by means of its secure network. When UniCredit Banca gets the SWIFT message about the approaching payment, it will clear and credit the money to the companion's account.

## SWIFT versus IBAN

SWIFT and [international bank account numbers (IBANs)](/iban) are both used to identify parties in money transfers. In any case, while a SWIFT code is utilized to identify a specific bank, the IBAN code means a specific bank account engaged with an international transaction.

In 2012, SWIFT cut off access for Iranian institutions because of European Union economic sanctions forced on the country for its nuclear weapons program. It reestablished access for Iranian banks not impacted by different sanctions in 2016. In 2022, several Russian banks were taken out from SWIFT as discipline for Russia's attack of Ukraine.
