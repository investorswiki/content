# Copenhagen Stock Exchange (CSE)
## What Is the Copenhagen Stock Exchange (CSE)?

The Copenhagen Stock Exchange (CSE) fills in as Denmark's official market for [securities](/security). The CSE turned into a limited company in 1996 and records shares, fixed income instruments, and derivatives for trading. The CSE exchange utilizes an electronic ordering system to work with efficient order matching. It presently is part of the Nasdaq Nordic group.

Share prices on the CSE are listed in [Danish Krone](/dkk)r (DKK).

## Understanding the Copenhagen Stock Exchange (CSE)

Established in 1808, the Copenhagen Stock Exchange (CSE) has been Denmark's primary asset exchange. In 1998, the CSE entered the NOREX Alliance with Sweden's [Stockholm stock exchange](/stockholmstockexchange). NOREX ultimately developed to remember stock exchanges for Oslo, Iceland, and regional markets as it looked to make the most of greater international investment opportunities by utilizing a common trading platform and regulatory structure.

NOREX alongside the Copenhagen Stock Exchange turned into a member of the OMX Exchange group in 2005, which then, at that point, turned out to be part of Nasdaq in 2008. Nasdaq Nordic is the Nasdaq subsidiary that incorporates the Copenhagen, Stockholm, Helsinki, and Iceland exchanges.

The CSE deals with the OMX C20, a [stock index](/index) sent off in 1989 containing 20 of the exchange's blue chip companies. The C20 is Denmark's chief benchmark equity index. Investors can buy or sell futures and options with the C20 Index as the underlying asset. The OMX C25 stock index was sent off in 1996 which is a subsequent market value-weighted, free float-adjusted, and capped index. The C25 index contains the 25 largest and most traded shares on Nasdaq Copenhagen.

## Nasdaq Nordic

Denmark's economy is among the most developed in the world. "Denmark's economy performs prominently well in administrative proficiency. Open-market policies support flexibility, intensity, and large trade and investment flow, and the transparent and efficient regulatory and legal environment energizes robust pioneering activity. Banking regulations are reasonable, and lending practices are prudent," as indicated by the Heritage Foundation.

Parent company Nasdaq states that it's "the maker of the world's most memorable electronic stock market, its technology powers in excess of 90 marketplaces in 50 countries, and 1 of every 10 of the world's securities transactions. Nasdaq is home to roughly 3,900 total postings with a market value of around $13 trillion."

## International Investing

Notwithstanding the developing availability of trading opportunities on foreign exchanges, numerous domestic investors find cross-border tax issues and capital controls more muddled and costly than their craving for international diversification warrants. Devices like [American Depositary Receipts](/adr) (ADRs) and domestic funds that trade in shares of international stocks might give a more helpful method of investing in international equities.

ADRs permit investors to purchase blocks of shares of foreign stocks held and issued by U.S.- based banks. ADRs basically act as a domestic vehicle for foreign equities. Traders can buy and sell them in U.S. dollars, receive [dividend payments](/dividend), and generally receive tax treatment equivalent to shares of domestic stocks.

[Mutual funds](/mutualfund) and [exchange-traded funds](/etf) (ETFs) offer comparative flexibility and ostensibly greater commonality since most investors have more knowledge of these products than ADRs. Investors need just search out mutual funds or ETFs expected to give international exposure and purchase their shares. Such funds generally center around countries or areas with extra options accessible for [emerging markets](/emergingmarketeconomy) or developed markets outside the United States and Canada.
