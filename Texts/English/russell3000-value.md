## What Is the Russell 3000 Value Index?

Russell 3000 Value Index is a market-capitalization weighted equity index maintained by the Russell Investment Group and based on the [Russell 3000 Index](/russell_3000), which measures how U.S. stocks in the equity value segment perform by including just [value stocks](/valuestock).

Included in the Russell 3000 Value Index are stocks from the Russell 3000 Index with lower price-to-book ratios and lower expected growth rates. This value index can be contrasted with the [Russell 3000 Growth Index](/russell3000-growth).

## Understanding the Russell 3000 Value Index

The Russell 3000 Value Index is based on the Russell 3000 Index, which measures the performance of the 3,000 largest publicly held companies incorporated in America, as defined by total market capitalization.

Segmenting the US market by size and style is a useful logical tool for investors who need to understand high level trends in market performance, portfolio exposures, and fees. If an investor has any desire to put their money into stocks that exhibit broad growth and value characteristics, the Russell 3000 Value Index provides a simple method for viewing these market segments.

First launched on July 1, 1995, the companies in the Russell 3000 Value Index are selected based on float-adjusted market capitalization. On the last trading day of May, FSTE Russell positions eligible companies based on their total market capitalization values. On the last Friday of June, the index is reconstituted. To be eligible for inclusion in a U.S. equity market index, the securities must trade on the NYSE, NYSE MKT, NASDAQ, or ARCA exchanges. The performance of the Russell 3000 Value Index can be monitored by means of the iShares Core U.S. Value ETF symbol IUSV.

A value stock is a security trading at a lower price than what the company's performance may otherwise indicate. Investors in value stocks attempt to capitalize on inefficiencies in the market, since the price of the underlying equity may not match the company's performance.

Common characteristics of value stocks include high [dividend yield](/dividendyield), low [price-to-book ratio (P/B ratio)](/price-to-bookratio), as well as a low price-to-earnings ratio ([P/E ratio](/price-earningsratio)). Investors can find value stocks utilizing the "Canines of the Dow" investing strategy by purchasing the 10 highest dividend-yielding stocks on the Dow Jones toward the beginning of each year and adjusting the portfolio every year thereafter.

Rather than value stocks, growth stocks are equities of companies with strong anticipated growth potential.
