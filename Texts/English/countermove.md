# Countermove
## What Is a Countermove?

A countermove is a movement of a [security's](/security) price that goes against the trend in price. A countermove happens right after the original trend, however in a smaller amount than the original trend. Investors and traders watch for countermoves to have the option to enter the market in a favorable position.

A countermove is otherwise called a [retracement](/retracement).

## Grasping a Countermove

A countermove is a small reversal in the price trend for a given security. In the event that the price is trending down, a countermove is a small [rally](/rally) in price. On the off chance that the price is trending up, a countermove is a small dip in price. Investors and traders can become capable in perceiving countermoves with the goal that they can time their entry into the market accurately to create gains by buying or selling.

Having the option to decide a countermove is troublesome in light of the fact that foreseeing the movement of any stock price is troublesome. For instance, on the off chance that a stock's price dips, a trader might trust this to be a countermove, when as a matter of fact it very well may be the development of a recent fad where the stock price keeps on falling, with no return back to the previous higher level.

It is important to pay consideration regarding the [fundamentals](/fundamentals) and valuation of a stock as opposed to the changes in price to assist with assessing its most probable direction. For this, investors utilizing a [buy and hold](/buyandhold) strategy ordinarily don't play the market with countermoves as a strategy to create gains.

## Carrying out a Countermove

A trader who needs to take a [long position](/long), and that means buying low to sell high later, can perceive a price trending up. At the point when a countermove down happens, that is a great opportunity to buy, at a somewhat lower price than the quickly previous price, before the trend is reestablished and the price keeps on rising.

On the other hand, to take a [short position](/short), and that means selling high and expecting to buy low later, they stand by as the market falls to find a countermove, in which the price goes up somewhat from the quickly previous falling price. At the point when this countermove up happens, the trader will sell, and afterward the market will return to the previous downward trend, and the trader can buy low to close the short position.

Since countermoves are smaller than the general trend, profits made promptly on taking a position are small, and real profits are just realized after the trend proceeds. In the event that a trader or investor botches a [reversal](/reversal) for a countermove, and the market trend doesn't return, the trader or investor can lose money.

This risk is high, even for experienced traders and investors, and is the principal justification for founding a [stop-loss order](/stop-lossorder). A stop-loss can prevent the market from going too far down in an upmarket trend or too far up in a down-market trend.

In the event that the stock price, goes down to $12 before moving back up to $17, that would be viewed as a countermove. In the other course, a stock price going from $40 down to $32 would be a move, while a short move back up to $36 before going down to $30 would be a countermove.
