## What Is a Brokered Deposit?

A brokered deposit is a deposit made to a bank by a third-party [deposit broker](/deposit_broker). A brokered deposit is a type of investment that draws in individual investors in light of the fact that the deposits normally offer higher interest rates. The brokered deposits are normally large-section and are much of the time sold by a bank to a deposit broker, who then partitions the deposit into smaller pieces available to be purchased to their customers. Banks that acknowledge brokered deposits frequently do as such as a method for expanding their [liquidity](/liquidity).

## How a Brokered Deposit Works

In the United States, the [Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation](/fdic) (FDIC) is responsible for directing brokered deposits. The FDIC lays out the rules and regulatory structure with respect to what is a brokered deposit and characterizes who is viewed as a deposit broker. Overall terms, a deposit broker is an individual or firm that works with the placement of other people groups' deposits with insured institutions, like banks.

Normally, banks will sell deposits (frequently as large-category [certificates of deposit](/certificateofdeposit)) to deposit brokers, who will then, at that point, segment these large deposits into smaller investments to be exchanged to individual investors or smaller banks at an alluring interest rate.

Under FDIC rules, just [well-capitalized](/capital) banks with adequate assets can request and acknowledge brokered deposits. Satisfactorily capitalized ones might acknowledge them in the wake of being conceded a waiver, and undercapitalized banks can't acknowledge them by any means. By accepting brokered deposits, a bank can gain access to a larger pool of potential [investment funds](/investment-store) and work on its liquidity.

> As per the FDIC, the total amount of brokered deposits held in insured U.S. depository institutions was $986 billion as of Sept. 30, 2018, addressing 8.0% of the $12.3 trillion in industry domestic deposits.
