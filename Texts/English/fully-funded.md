# Fully Funded
## What Is Fully Funded?

Fully funded is a description of a pension plan that has adequate assets to accommodate all the [accrued benefits](/accrued-benefits) it owes and can in this manner meet its future obligations.

To be fully funded, the plan must have the option to make every one of the anticipated payments to both current and prospective pensioners. A plan's [administrator](/administrator) can foresee the amount of necessary funds consistently. The funding status is generally determined by the plan's outside actuaries. This can assist with determining the financial soundness of the pension plan. Fully funded can be diverged from a [underfunded](/underfunded_pension_plan) pension, which needs more current assets to fund its obligations.

## Seeing Fully Funded

Companies disseminate annual benefits statements indicating whether the pension plan is fully funded. Employees can utilize this to determine the financial strength of the plan.

A fully funded pension plan is one that has the financial stability to make current and future benefits payments to pensioners. The plan relies upon capital contributions and returns on its investments to accomplish stability.

A plan's [funded status](/fundedstatus) alludes to the amount of accumulated assets (out of all assets required for full funding) that have been set to the side for the payment of retirement benefits. The equation to determine a plan's funded status is:

>
> Funded status = plan assets - projected benefit obligation (PBO)

For instance, in July 2019, the CalPERS (California Public Employees' Retirement System) fund reported a funded status of 70% toward the finish of the June 30 fiscal year. This was down short of what one percentage point from the fiscal year ending on June 30, 2018, as per the plan's reports. In July 2019, the size of the CalPERS fund was more than $370 billion.

Underfunded pensions are a developing problem as they are unable to meet the pension cash flows vowed to current and retired workers. A [overfunded](/overfunded_pension_plan) plan, then again, is a company retirement plan that has a bigger number of assets than liabilities. As such, there is a [surplus](/surplus) in the amount of money expected to cover current and future retirements. Albeit this surplus can legally be recorded as company income, it can't be paid out to corporate shareholders like other income as it is saved for current and future retired people.

## Fully Funded and the Pension Footnote in Financial Statements

The pension note in a company's [financial statements](/financial-statements) subtleties the corporate pension plan that management has set for its employees, generally after a specific vesting period. This typically trails behind the section on [long-term liabilities](/longtermliabilities), since the pension fund is a specific type of long-term liability that isn't in many cases caught on the balance sheet. Hence, pensions are some of the time called [off-balance-sheet financing](/obsf).

Pension fund accounting is muddled, and the footnotes are frequently convoluted. There are different kinds of pension plans, yet the [defined benefit (DB) pension plan](/definedbenefitpensionplan) is one of the most famous. With a defined benefit plan, an employee knows the terms of the benefit that will be received upon retirement. The company is responsible for investing in a fund to meet its obligations to the employee, so the company bears the investment risk.

Then again, in a [defined contribution plan](/definedcontributionplan, for example, a [401(k)](/401kplan), the company might make contributions or matching contributions however doesn't guarantee the future benefit to the employee. Thusly, the employee bears the investment risk.
