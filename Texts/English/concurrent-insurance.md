# Concurrent Insurance
## What Is Concurrent Insurance?

Concurrent insurance is when there are at least two insurance policies that provide coverage for similar risks over a similar period of time. Concurrent insurance is most frequently involved when an insured person or business purchases policies notwithstanding a primary policy, with the extra policies providing excess coverage.

## How Concurrent Insurance Works

Concurrent insurance policies may be really smart for an individual or business that accepts that a specific peril represents a huge risk that can't be successfully covered by a single policy. Purchasing at least one concurrent policies might be a prudent course of action in the event that the cost isn't prohibitive.

Figuring out which insurance policy pays for a covered loss can be troublesome. Insurers will look to shift claim responsibility to the policies that they didn't guarantee, and they might prosecute the issue. The courts are then responsible for figuring out who pays â€” a process called [apportionment](/apportionment). Insurers will look at their own policy language, as well as that of different policies, to put forth a defense that the other policy is more specific to the covered loss.

## Special Considerations

Insurance policy contracts frequently incorporate provisions illustrating the structure that it utilizes for allocating coverage when risk is likewise covered by different policies. The three primary categories of [apportionment](/apportionment) are pro rata, excess, and no-liability. For instance, the policy might say that it will just provide coverage in excess of the coverage provided by different policies. Assuming that this equivalent claim is utilized in every policy, the overall guideline is that the language counteracts one another, and every insurer will be responsible for a proportional amount of coverage, called pro rata.

Due to the complexity of policy language, courts might provide a positioning of the order of policies with regards to which policy is required to offer coverage and by how much. This not set in stone by the language of every one of the insurance contracts yet may likewise utilize different factors, for example, the amount of [premiums](/premium) paid.
