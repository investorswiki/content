He went to Blair Academy which was paid for by his uncle, as his family had lost a large portion of their wealth in the 1929 stock market crash.

## Notable Accomplishments
### Vanguard

With Vanguard, Bogle employed a novel ownership structure in which the [shareholders](/investor) of mutual funds turned out to be part owners of the funds in which they invested. The actual funds own the investment firm, making the fund investors indirect owners of the firm itself. This structure allows the firm to integrate any profits into its operating structure, lessening investment costs for fund investors.

In 1976, Bogle presented the Vanguard 500 fund, which tracks the returns of the [S&P 500](/sp500) and denoted the first [index fund](/indexfund) marketed to retail investors.

### Heritage

John Bogle contributed essentially to the prominence of index investing, in which a fund keeps a mix of investments that track a major market [index](/index). Bogle's philosophy that average investors would track down it troublesome or difficult to beat the market after some time drove him to focus on ways of diminishing expenses associated with investing in mutual funds. For instance, Bogle zeroed in on no-load funds highlighting low [turnover](/portfolioturnover) and simple investment strategies.

The philosophy behind passive investing generally settles upon the possibility that the expenses associated with chasing high market returns cancel out most or every one of the gains an investor would somehow accomplish with a [passive strategy](/passiveinvesting) that depends upon funds with lower turnover, management fees, and [expense ratios](/expenseratio).

Passive investing remains as opposed to [active investing](/activemanagement), which expects managers to play an additional involved job with the intent of beating the market.

Index funds fit this model pleasantly in light of the fact that they base their holdings on the securities listed on some random index. Investors who purchase shares in index funds gain the benefit of the [diversity](/enhancement) addressed by every one of the securities on an index.

This safeguards against the risk that a given company will lower the performance of the overall fund. Index funds likewise pretty much run themselves, as managers just have to guarantee their holdings match those of the index they follow. This keeps fees lower for index funds than for funds with more active trading.

At long last, since index funds require less trades to keep up with their portfolios than funds with more active management schemes, index funds will generally deliver more tax-efficient returns than different types of funds.
