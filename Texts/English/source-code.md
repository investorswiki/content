# Source Code
Source code alludes to an assortment of lines of computer code, which are responsible for characterizing how a program (software) will function in view of a rundown of deterministic directions and statements. Generally, source code is the primary state of a software at the moment it is initially written.
Thusly, a source code comprises of a set of guidelines that can be written on different computer programming dialects, like Java, JavaScript, C, Python, PHP, Go, Rusty, Solidity, and Haskell. This multitude of programming dialects have a common characteristic: they comprise of a set of guidelines for computers to follow to perform certain activities and produce specific results.
Subsequent to being made the source code is frequently "made an interpretation of" or gathered into a machine language that computers are able to comprehend and execute. In certain circumstances, be that as it may, the source code is executed right away without the requirement for aggregation (these computer programs are known as translators).
During the development of computer software, the source code stage is the initial working phase where programmers are able to peruse, comment and make alters before the program is finished and in the end executed by a computer machine. Source code libraries make crafted by software engineers, computer researchers, and programmers significantly more straightforward on the grounds that they are able to incorporate comments inside the lines of code (for instance, bits of readable plain text with informative and keen comments).
