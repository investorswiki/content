# Zero-Gap Condition
## What Is a Zero-Gap Condition?

A zero-gap condition exists when a financial institution's interest-rate-sensitive assets and liabilities are in perfect balance for a given [maturity](/maturity). The condition gets its name from the way that the duration gap — or the difference in the sensitivity of an institution's [assets](/resource) and [liabilities](/responsibility) to changes in interest rates — is precisely zero. Under this condition, a change in interest rates won't make any surplus or shortfall for the company, since the firm is vaccinated to its [interest rate risk](/interestraterisk) for a given maturity.

## Understanding a Zero-Gap Condition

Financial institutions are presented to interest rate risk when the [interest rate sensitivity](/interest-rate-sensitivity) (otherwise called the [duration](/duration)) of their assets varies from the interest rate sensitivity of their liabilities. A zero-gap condition [immunizes](/immunization) an institution from interest rate risk by guaranteeing that a change in interest rates won't influence the overall value of the firm's net worth.

Due to vacillations in interest rates, firms and financial institutions face the risk of a duration gap in the interest rate responsive qualities between their assets and liabilities. Subsequently, a 1% change in interest rates might increase the value of its assets by a lesser degree than the value acquired to its liabilities, and this would bring about a shortfall. To moderate such interest rate risks, firms must ensure that any change in interest rates doesn't influence the overall value of the net worth of the firm. This "immunization" of the firm from interest rate risks is drilled by keeping up with the difference in the sensitivity of the assets and liabilities of the firm given a similar maturity, which is called the zero-gap condition.

The zero-gap condition can be accomplished by interest rate immunization strategies — otherwise called multi-period immunization. Immunization is a [hedging](/support) strategy that tries to limit or offset the effect that changes in interest rates can have on a portfolio of fixed income securities, including the mix of different interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities on a firm's balance sheet. Large banks must safeguard their current [net worth](/networth), and pension funds have the obligation of payments following a number of years. Both of these firms — and others — must safeguard the future value of their portfolios while likewise tending to the vulnerability of future interest rates.

Immunization strategies might utilize [derivatives](/subsidiary) and other financial instruments to offset however much risk as could be expected with regards to interest rates, considering both the portfolio's duration and its [convexity](/convexity) — the change in duration as interest rates move (or the arch of the duration). On account of fixed-income instruments, for example, bonds, immunization looks to limit changes to the price, as well as [reinvestment risk](/reinvestmentrisk). Reinvestment risk is the probability that a venture's cash flows will earn less when invested in another security.

## Features
- In a zero-gap condition scenario, the duration gap — or the difference in the sensitivity of an institution's assets and liabilities to changes in interest rates — is precisely zero.
- Large banks must safeguard their current net worth, and pension funds have the obligation of payments following a number of years, so they must safeguard the future value of their portfolios while likewise tending to the vulnerability of future interest rates.
- Under this condition, a change in interest rates won't make any surplus or shortfall for the company, since the firm is vaccinated to its interest rate risk for a given maturity.
- A zero-gap condition exists when a financial institution's interest-rate-sensitive assets and liabilities are in perfect balance for a given maturity.
