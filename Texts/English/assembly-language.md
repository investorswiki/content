# Assembly Language
## What Is an Assembly Language?

An assembly language is a type of low-level programming language that is planned to discuss straightforwardly with a computer's hardware. Not at all like machine language, which comprises of binary and hexadecimal characters, assembly dialects are intended to be readable by humans.

Low-level programming dialects, for example, assembly language are a fundamental bridge between the underlying hardware of a computer and the higher-level programming dialects — like Python or JavaScript — in which modern software programs are written.

## How Assembly Languages Work

Fundamentally, the most essential guidelines executed by a computer are binary codes, comprising of ones and zeros. Those codes are straightforwardly converted into the "on" and "off" states of the power moving through the computer's physical circuits. Basically, these simple codes form the basis of "machine language", the most fundamental assortment of programming language.

Of course, no human would have the option to build modern software programs by expressly programming ones and zeros. All things considered, human software engineers must depend on different layers of deliberation that can permit themselves to verbalize their orders in a format that is more natural to humans. In particular, modern developers issue orders in supposed "high-level dialects", which use natural linguistic structure like whole English words and sentences, as well as legitimate administrators, for example, "And", "Or", and "Else" that are recognizable to regular use.

Eventually, nonetheless, these high-level orders should be converted into machine language. As opposed to doing so physically, developers depend on assembly dialects whose purpose is to decipher between these high-level and low-level dialects naturally. The primary assembly dialects were developed during the 1940s, and albeit modern software engineers spend next to no time dealing with assembly dialects, they by and by stay essential to the overall working of a computer.

## Real World Example of an Assembly Language

Today, assembly dialects stay the subject of study by computer science understudies, to assist them with understanding how modern software connects with its underlying hardware platforms. At times, software engineers must keep on writing in assembly dialects, for example, when the requests are performance are particularly high, or when the hardware being referred to is contradictory with any current high-level dialects.

One such model that is applicable to finance are the [high-frequency trading (HFT)](/high-frequency-trading) platforms utilized by a few financial firms. In this marketplace, the speed and precision of transactions is of vital significance for the HFT trading strategies to demonstrate profitable. Consequently, to gain an edge against their rivals, some HFT firms have written their trading software straightforwardly in assembly dialects, subsequently making it pointless to hang tight for the orders from a higher-level language to be converted into machine language.

## Highlights
- It is an important bridge between software programs and their underlying hardware platforms.
- An assembly language is a type of programming language that makes an interpretation of high-level dialects into machine language.
- Today, collect dialects are rarely written straightforwardly, despite the fact that they are as yet utilized in some niche applications, for example, when performance requirements are especially high.
