# Fed Pass
## What Is a Fed Pass?

A Fed pass is an informal term for an action taken by the[ U.S. Federal Reserve ](/federalreservebank)to increase the availability of credit by making extra reserves in the banking system. The Fed "passes" more money to the banks in the hope that they will loan it out.

Most usually, the supply of bank reserves is increased through open market operations as the Fed purchases Treasury debt from primary dealers, fully intent on permitting lenders to start more mortgages and different loans at lower interest rates.

## Figuring out a Fed Pass

A Fed pass alludes to expansionary monetary policy directed by the Federal Reserve to influence the economy. It very well may be taken to combat economic challenges, for example, a credit crunch. Be that as it may, similar to all Fed actions, it meaningfully affects the economy. At the point when interest rates are high or credit conditions are tight, either due to a real [economic shock](/economic-shock), the collapse of asset price bubbles, or skeptical [expectations about the economy](/rationaltheoryofexpectations), the Fed frequently mediates to ease credit and increase lending and borrowing in the economy.

The Fed can't force individuals to buy more stuff, or even force banks to loan more money. Yet, by infusing more cash into the banking system it hopes that banks will be urged to loan more, and at lower interest rates that are more interesting to consumers and organizations. The goal is to compensate for anything that negative factors are delaying the economy by blowing up the supply of bank credit.

To infuse more money into the banking system, the Fed buys U.S. Treasury bonds on the secondary market from a rundown of approved banks and other institutional holders known as primary dealers. These are now and again alluded to as "[open market operations](/openmarketoperations)" (OMO). The Fed pays for those bonds by making new credits to the Federal Reserve accounts of the sellers, which is the genuine "pass." The Fed passes the recently made money to the banks. The banks, thus, can hold that cash as excess reserves, use it to buy different assets, or create more loans.

## The Multiplier Effect of a Fed Pass

There is no guarantee that a Fed pass will invigorate lending or borrowing, which are likewise influenced by outer economic factors and [consumer sentiment](/consumer-sentiment). The beneficiaries of the new money could continuously decide to buy different assets, for example, equity stocks, or to hold the new money as excess reserves to keep up with their own liquidity against their liabilities.

In the event that they truly do loan out the money, it results in a [multiplier effect](/multipliereffect) across the economy in view of the idea of fractional reserve banking. Banks will then issue more loans to organizations and consumers, who will, thus, spend the money on goods and services; the seller of those goods and services will then re-store the money in banks, which then re-loan the money.

As the economy warms up from this activity, eventually the Fed could become nervous about inflationary effects as the money streams down from the banks to consumers and organizations. By then, the Fed could reverse its pass and on second thought start selling bonds, which will tighten credit and hopefully delayed down economic growth.
