# Dividend Capture
## What Is Dividend Capture?

The term dividend capture alludes to a [investment strategy](/investmentstrategy) that spotlights on buying and selling dividend-paying stocks. It is a timing-focused strategy a stock just before its utilized by an investor [ex-dividend](/ex-dividend) or reinvestment date to capture the dividend. The investor then, at that point, sells it on or after the ex-dividend date at or over the purchase price. The purpose of the strategy is to receive the dividend, instead of just selling the stock at a profit.

## Understanding Dividend Capture

A dividend capture strategy is generally utilized on stocks that pay a sizable [dividend](/dividend) to make the strategy worthwhile. It is additionally utilized on stocks with high trading [volume](/volume). This strategy exploits standard cash implantations that outcome from dividends.

There is nobody size-fits-all approach to this strategy. As referenced over, a few investors purchase shares in dividend-paying stocks just before the ex-dividend date and sell it on that date. Others might decide to hold onto their shares for a little while before selling them.

The purpose of this strategy is to make a [profit](/profit) by selling the stock at or over the amount of purchase.

## Special Considerations

Stocks under heavy accumulation are less inclined to see a reduction in stock price on the ex-dividend date. A stock in a strong [uptrend](/uptrend) is likewise bound to appreciate, possibly bringing about a dividend plus a profit on the stock sale.

The flip side is that stocks in [downtrends](/downtrend) may fall more than expected on and after the ex-dividend date. Subsequently, a trader might opt to exit the stock at a more profitable time, rather than on the ex-dividend date. For example, an investor might sit tight for a better selling opportunity by holding the stock for a couple of extra days. The downside of this is the share price could keep on falling.

## Analysis of Dividend Capture

Under most conditions, the dividend capture strategy doesn't deliver a tax advantage. The dividend returns are taxed at the investor's ordinary [tax rate](/taxrate). That is on the grounds that the trade isn't held sufficiently long to benefit from the good tax treatment on dividends that a longer-term investor would receive. Nonetheless, the tax treatment of the strategy isn't an issue on the off chance that the strategy is employed in a tax-advantaged account, for example, a [individual retirement account](/ira) (IRA).

Transaction costs likewise should be accounted for by investors. With different major companies paying dividends consistently, this could be an extremely active strategy. The more active the strategy, the more trading [commissions](/commission) are paid. In any case, for certain brokers moving to a no-commission trading model, the chances of effectively utilizing certain active strategies increments.

## Example of Dividend Capture

We should expect a $50 stock pays investors a $1 dividend. The stock ought to open at $49 on the ex-dividend date. In a rising [market](/market), it opens the next morning at $49.75 or even $50.20. Regardless, the dividend capture investor can sell the stock and create a net gain. They receive $1 per share in dividends and just assume a $0.50 loss (at $49.50) on the stock. On the off chance that the stock were to open at $50.20 (conceivably in light of the fact that the more extensive market is up fundamentally), the trader nets $1.20 per share.

However, there are [risks](/risk). The price of the stock could likewise open lower than expected, say at $48. In this case, the trader winds up with a net loss of $1 per share ($48 - $50 + $1). The dividend amount is fixed, yet the potential loss amount isn't.
