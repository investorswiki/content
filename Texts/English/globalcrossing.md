## What Is Global Crossing?

Prior to its acquisition by Level 3 Communications, Global Crossing pulled in boundless media consideration in the wake of filing for [bankruptcy](/bankruptcy) in January 2002. This bankruptcy happened in the midst of an accounting scandal in which it had supposedly [inflated](/qualityofearnings) its reported earnings figures.

## Figuring out Global Crossing

For some investors, Global Crossing is essential to act as an illustration of the [irrational exuberance](/irrationalexuberance) that happened at the level of the [dot-com bubble](/dotcom-bubble). In this respect, it is in many cases refered to alongside the scandalous energy company, Enron Corporation.

The comparison between Global Crossing and Enron isn't without its merits. In 2001, for example, the two companies investigated a likely transaction in which they would expand their respective [revenues](/revenue) by $650 million in spite of no genuine goods or services evolving hands. Albeit this transaction was rarely completed, it is a pertinent illustration of the types of aggressive and ostensibly fraudulent strategies sought after by the two companies in their endeavors to drive their growth.

Eventually, Enron bowed out of all financial obligations in December 2001, with Global Crossing following short of what one month a while later. At that point, Global Crossing's bankruptcy was the fourth-largest in U.S. history. In 2005, it settled with the [Securities and Exchange Committee](/sec) (SEC). Under the terms of this settlement, it was resolved that Global Crossing had failed to agree with various accounting laws.

> ### Capacity Swaps
> One of the manners in which Global Crossing swelled its earnings was by the utilization of purported capacity swaps. This method alludes to the practice of legally trading telecommunications capacity rights among providers in order to legitimize the recording of new revenues. This practice was frequently managed with practically no money, goods, or services really evolving hands, accordingly making the illusion of useful activity.
