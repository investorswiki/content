A real estate agent is a licensed professional who organizes real estate transactions, assembling buyers and sellers and acting as their representative in talks. Real estate agents typically are compensated totally by a commission — a percentage of the property's purchase price — so their income relies upon their ability to close a deal. In pretty much every state a real estate agent must work for or be affiliated with a real estate broker (an individual or a brokerage firm), who is more experienced and licensed to a higher degree.

## How a Real Estate Agent Works

Real estate agents for the most part represent considerable authority in one or the other commercial or residential real estate. One way or the other, they perform various duties, contingent upon whether they work for the buyer or the seller. Agents who work for the seller, otherwise called listing agents, encourage clients on the most proficient method to price the property and prepare it for a sale, including giving tips on somewhat late improvements that can help the price or energize fast offers. Seller agents market the property through listing services, networking, and commercials.

Agents who work for the buyer look for accessible properties that match the buyer's price reach and list of things to get. These agents frequently take a gander at past sales data on comparable properties to assist prospective buyers with thinking of a fair bid.

Agents act as go-betweens for the principal parties, carrying offers and counteroffers and different inquiries to and fro. When a bid is accepted, agents on the two sides frequently keep on working, helping their clients through the desk work, conveying communications, exhorting on reviews and moving, and generally shepherding the deal through to closing.

Agents must disclose their representation, so buyers and sellers are aware of any irreconcilable circumstances.
