# Brazilian Real (BRL)
## What Is Brazilian Real (BRL)?

BRL is the currency truncation symbol for the Brazilian real (BRL), the currency for Brazil. The Brazilian real is comprised of 100 centavos and is frequently given the symbol R$. As of September 14, 2021, 1 USD is equivalent to generally 5.26 BRL.

## Figuring out Brazilian Real (BRL)

The Brazilian real (plural reais) is regulated by the [Central Bank](/centralbank) of Brazil's (BCB) [monetary policy](/monetarypolicy) committee (COPOM). It was first adopted as the official currency in July 1994, supplanting the cruzeiro real at a rate of 1 real to 2,750 cruzeiro real. This change was as per the Plano Real ("Real Plan"). In 1994, the real was moored to the U.S. dollar.

There have been various memorial coins delivered by the central bank, the latest being a 1 real coin for the 2016 Summer Olympics and one more for the 50th anniversary of the Brazilian central bank. Altogether, the central bank has issued seven memorial coins starting around 1995. Today, there are 6 named real coins in circulation, a 1, 5, 10, 25, and 50 centavos and a 1 real coin.

Upon its presentation, the real reinforced against the U.S. dollar to a rate of 1 BRL to 1.20 USD as its developing economy pulled in large capital inflows. This prompted the central bank stepping in to balance out the currency's appreciation by anchoring it to the US dollar. This went on until 1999 when the Russian debt default prompted a serious disruption in global financial markets, particularly emerging markets. Brazil's economy, alongside other emerging market economies, was impacted as foreign investors pulled out **en masse**. This prompted the real debilitating alongside most [emerging market](/emergingmarketeconomy) currencies and forced COPOM to some extent [float](/floatingexchangerate) the BRL against the U.S. dollar.

Brazil was one of the initial countries that was classified as an emerging market, alongside Russia, India and China ([BRIC](/bric)), and is presently reclassified as an advanced emerging economy.

As per the most recent IMF ([International Monetary Fund](/imf)) projections, Brazil's economy, in terms gross domestic product ([GDP](/gdp)), is positioned as the 13^th^ largest in the world at USD 1.491 trillion. The [GDP deflator](/gdppricedeflator) is expected to rise by 4.26% from its 2020 index level and the GDP per capita is forecast to be about USD 7010.8.

[Inflation](/inflation) is expected to average 4.6% for 2021 and the two imports and exports are projected to rebound after the COVID-19 pandemic induced contraction, however the former is expected to far dominate the last option.

## BRL Conversion Example

As of September 14, 2021, the USD/BRL exchange rate is at 5.2398. That means that 1 USD is worth 5.2398 BRL. If the USD/BRL rate climbs to 6.1234 that means that the Brazilian real has debilitated versus the U.S. dollar as 1 USD is currently worth more BRL, 6 .1234 to be definite. One more method for taking a gander at is that the dollar has reinforced versus the real.

On the off chance that, on the other had, the USD/BRL rate were to fall to 4.6789 then that means that the Brazilian real has increased in value relative to the USD as 1 USD is worth less BRL, 4.6789 to be precise. One more method for interpretting this is that the dollar has debilitated versus the real.
