# Unlimited Risk
## What Is Unlimited Risk?

Unlimited risk alludes to a situation where there is potential for unlimited losses on a trade or in a specific investment.

In practice, unlimited risk would be practically realized as a total loss or bankruptcy. In addition, positions that have unlimited risk can be hedged utilizing other market instruments.

## Grasping Unlimited Risk

Any time a resource's price can move endlessly against a trader's position means they are facing unlimited risk. A [short trade](/short) is an illustration of a strategy with unlimited risk. While unlimited risk trades theoretically have unlimited risk, the trader doesn't really need to accept unlimited risk. They can do whatever it may take to limit genuine losses, for example, [hedging](/fence) or setting [stop loss orders](/stop-lossorder).

Unlimited risk is something contrary to [limited risk](/limitedrisk). With unlimited risk, there is the possibility to lose more than your initial investment, which is conceivable in short selling, in trading futures contracts, or when [writing naked options](/naked-writer).

Risk itself alludes to the likelihood that an investment will have a [actual return](/actualreturn) unique in relation to the return that the investor expected. Risk goes from losing a portion of one's investment to possibly losing the entirety of the original investment. With unlimited risk, it is conceivable (yet not really prone) to lose ordinarily the amount of the original investment.

Risk changes from one investment to another, and one form of surveying risk can be calculated by utilizing the [standard deviation](/standarddeviation) of the historical returns or average returns of a specific investment, with a higher standard deviation demonstrating a higher degree of risk.

However the interaction might be scary, investors make high-risk investments consistently and for different legitimate reasons. That's what the fundamental legitimization is, in [finance](/finance), theoretically, the greater the risk to an investor the greater the likely return. The higher potential return makes up for the extra risk taken on by the investor.

## Controlling Risk and Unlimited Risk

Unlimited risk might make it sound like making certain trades or certain investments isn't beneficial. For example, since short selling has theoretically unlimited risk, certain traders might stay away from it. While risk is theoretically unlimited, it isn't really unlimited except if a trader (and their broker) permit that to occur.

A trader could enter a short trade in a stock at $5 and conclude that they will [close](/closeposition) the short trade assuming that the price climbs to $5.50. In this case, their real risk is $0.50 per share and isn't unlimited. The price could [gap](/gap) over their stop loss price of $5.50, say to $6 or $7. This would certainly increase the loss, yet the loss is as yet capped to $1 or $2 where the stop loss would trigger in these cases.

A similar concept applies to [futures contracts](/futures) or composing naked options. While losing money, a trade can be closed. The price at which a trader closes the position decides their genuine loss.

It is conceivable that the loss could be more than they initially invested in the trade, or even more than they have in their trading account. At the point when this happens, it is called a [margin call](/margincall) and the broker will ask the trader to deposit funds for them to keep up with their position (if still open) or bring their account balance up to zero. In the event that the trading account dips under zero due to a trading loss, this means the trader has a debt to the broker.

## Model: Unlimited Risk When Writing Naked Options

Expect that a trader is keen on composing [naked calls](/nakedcall) on Apple Inc. (AAPL). The writer will receive the [option premium](/option-premium), which is their maximum profit. In the event that the price of AAPL is below the [strike price](/strikeprice) at expiry, the option writer will keep the premium as their profit on the trade.

In the event that the price of AAPL rises over the strike price, the option writer faces theoretically unlimited risk, since there is no cap on how high the price could rise. The writer has agreed to sell shares of AAPL at the strike price to the buyer of the call option. This means the option writer should buy shares of AAPL to sell them to the buyer at the strike price, no matter what the market price of AAPL around then.

Expect one call option is written with a strike price of $250, which will terminate in 90 days. The current price of AAPL stock is $240.50. The option is sold for $6.35, and that means the writer receives $635 ($6.35 x 100 shares for one contract).

In the event that the price of AAPL stock stays below $250, the writer keeps the $635 or a portion of it assuming that they close the position early.

On the off chance that AAPL rises above $250, they face unlimited losses, yet they can in any case control the amount they lose, to a degree. For instance, on the off chance that AAPL rises to $255 before expiry, they might choose to cut their losses and exit their options trade.

Assuming the price of AAPL is trading at $255 at expiry, the writer actually hasn't lost money. This is on the grounds that they can buy AAPL for $5 over the strike price ($255) to sell it at the strike price ($250). They lose $5 there, yet made $6.35 on the option, so they actually pocket $1.35 per share, less fees.

Assuming the price of AAPL is trading at $270 at expiry, the naked option writer has lost money. They need to pay $20 more than the strike price ($270 - $250) to sell the shares at the strike price ($250). They lose $20 here, however made $6.35 on the option sale, so they wind up losing $13.65 per contract. Their hypothetical loss was unlimited, however the real loss was $13.65 per contract. This might actually be diminished using stop losses, exiting early while losing, buying the shares for a [covered call](/coveredcall) strategy, or hedging.

## Highlights
- While risk can be unlimited, generally talking the investor can relieve a significant part of the risks.
- Selling naked calls is an illustration of unlimited risk.
- Unlimited risk has to do with trades or investments that can theoretically face unlimited losses.
