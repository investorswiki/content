# Core Liquidity
## What Is Core Liquidity?

Core liquidity alludes to the cash and other financial assets that banks have that can without much of a stretch be [liquidated](/liquidate) and paid out as part of [operational cash flows](/operatingcashflow) (OCF). Instances of core liquidity assets would be cash, government (Treasury) bonds, and [money market](/money-marketfund) funds.

## Grasping Core Liquidity

The core liquidity of a bank are those assets (cash, cash equivalents, Treasuries, and so on) that can be utilized quickly for the bank's liquidity needs to meet its payment obligations. Then again, banks make liquidity for others through lending and finance activities. By making liquidity in the market, the banking industry earns profits and serves an important job in the economy, however thus must tie up a portion of its funds in less liquid assets.

Banks subsequently face two central issues with respect to dealing with their liquidity position. The primary management position of banks is to balance liquidity creation with liquidity risk. [Liquidity risk](/liquidityrisk) for a bank incorporates both the risk of being unable to fund its financing commitments (like lending activities or paying interest to its own lenders) and the risk of being unable to fulfill the need for withdrawals (the extreme case being a [run on the bank](/bankrun)). A shortage of liquidity at a bank can wind up leading to the disappointment and closure of the bank; liquidity shortages across a particularly large bank or many banks immediately can encourage a [financial crisis](/financial-crisis).

An expected shortage of liquidity is viewed as perhaps of the most unmistakable risk facing banks, and simultaneously a liquidity surplus is viewed as a drag on intensity since those funds are unable to be loaned to new borrowers and in this manner earn interest income. Banks ordinarily use estimates to expect the amount of cash that account holders should pull out, yet banks must don't misjudge the amount of endlessly cash equivalents required for core liquidity in light of the fact that unused cash left in core liquidity can't be utilized by the bank to earn increased returns. This presents a [opportunity cost](/opportunitycost) for the bank.

As per financial experts Chagwiza, Garira, and Moyo (2015), banks should develop a "core liquidity portfolio" to upgrade the liquidity buffer to limit these risks that banks face â€” instead of just holding an erratic reserve of cash. Along these lines, the balance between liquidity risk and opportunity cost is augmented for banks, and their productivity and overall profitability is increased.

## Illustration of Core Liquidity

Of course, foreseeing future cash needs is an interesting business and will rarely be spot on. For instance, accept that XYZ bank can charge 15% interest on the loans it expands. If the bank misjudges the amount of core liquidity required by $100,000, the bank will pass up $15,000 ($100K x 0.15) worth of interest income since it has $100,000 in cash tied up that can't utilized for loan. Then again, in the event that XYZ bank underrates its core-liquidity needs by $100,000, it might have to receive emergency support from a central bank, look for a bailout from another bank, or face the risk of a run on its assets and accounts.
