# Optimum Currency Area (OCA) Theory
## What Is Optimum Currency Area (OCA) Theory?

Optimum currency area theory (OCA) states that specific areas not limited by national boundaries would benefit from a common currency. As such, geographic regions might be better off utilizing the equivalent [currency](/currency) rather than every country inside that geographic region utilizing its own currency.

## Grasping Optimum Currency Area (OCA) Theory

Sharing a currency can benefit a geographic region by essentially expanding [trade](/trade). Nonetheless, this trade must offset the costs of every country surrendering a national currency as an instrument to change [monetary policy](/monetarypolicy). Areas utilizing OCA theory can in any case keep a flexible exchange rate system with the remainder of the world.

OCA theory was developed in 1961 by Canadian economist Robert Mundell in view of prior work by Abba Lerner. It conjectures that there is an optimum international area that ought to share a currency, yet this international area doesn't be guaranteed to compare with national boundaries. A [optimum currency area](/ideal currency-area) could be several nations, parts of several nations, or regions inside a single nation.

As indicated by the theory, a common currency can expand [economic efficiency](/economic_efficiency), given that the participants meet the accompanying four criteria:

1. A large, accessible, and integrated [labor market](/labor-market) that permits workers to move uninhibitedly all through the area and smooth out unemployment in any single zone.
1. The flexibility of pricing and wages, alongside the mobility of capital, to dispense with regional trade lopsided characteristics.
1. A centralized budget or control to rearrange wealth to parts of the area which experience due to labor and capital mobility. This is a politically troublesome one, as wealthy parts of the region may not wish to circulate their overflows to those that are inadequate.
1. The participating regions have comparative [business cycles](/businesscycle) and timing for economic data to stay away from a shock in any one area.

Princeton teacher and international economist Peter Kenen suggested the adding of a fifth standard of production diversification inside the international area.

## Special Considerations

A few economists contend that the United States ought to be partitioned into several more modest currency areas, as the country as a whole doesn't fit the criteria listed in Mundell's original OCA theory. Economists have calculated that the Southeast and Southwest regions of the United States don't be guaranteed to fit with the remainder of the country as an OCA.

## Optimum Currency Area Theory Example

Many point to the [euro](/euro) as proof of OCA theory in real life. Nonetheless, some contend that the area didn't meet the four criteria as spread out by Mundell's theory at the hour of the euro's creation in 1999. This absence of meeting the requirements, they say, is the explanation the [eurozone](/eurozone) has battled since its initiation.

Without a doubt, the OCA theory was put to the test in 2010 as [sovereign debt](/sovereign-debt) issues looked by numerous vigorously indebted nations in Europe compromised the practicality of the [European Union](/europeanunion) (EU), setting serious strains upon the euro.

As per Global Financial Integrity, a non-benefit located in Washington, D.C., fringe EU countries like Portugal, Italy, Ireland, Greece, and Spain (PIIGS) experienced easing back growth, needed international seriousness, and had a labor force that was useless.

As these economies eased back, private capital escaped, some to more grounded eurozone economies, and some to different countries. Likewise, due to language, culture, and distance challenges, the labor force in the eurozone isn't liquid or mobile. Wages are not uniform across the international area, by the same token.

## Features
- Optimum currency area (OCA) theory states that regions that are not limited by national lines and share certain traits ought to share a common currency.
- OCA theory posits that carrying out currencies by geographic and international region, rather than by country, prompts greater economic proficiency.
- OCA theory was developed in 1961 by Canadian economist Robert Mundell in light of prior work by Abba Lerner.
- An OCA must meet four criteria to qualify, and a few economists recommend a fifth.
