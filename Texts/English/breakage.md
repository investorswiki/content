# Breakage
## What Is Breakage?

Breakage is a term used to portray revenue gained by retailers through unredeemed gift cards or other prepaid services that are rarely guaranteed. In these cases, the company pockets the money paid for these things, without really offering the support or thing for which the customer initially paid. Albeit virtually this money is all viewed as a profit to the company, accounting vulnerability due to breakage has been a recurring problem over time.

## How Breakage Works

Breakage has been an accounting issue for quite a while. A few companies have been blamed for blowing up their revenue figures with breakage gauges. In 2006, it was estimated that consumers lost more than $8 billion every year due to breakage.

Most retailers never again place limitations (i.e., dormancy fees, expiration dates, and so on) on their gift cards in a purposeful work to dispose of accounting vulnerability. In 2007, the Federal Trade Commission ([FTC](/ftc)) settled a case it brought against Darden Restaurants for inability to uncover its gift cards [dormancy fees](/dormancy-charge). It arrived at a similar outcome in a comparative action it prior recorded against Kmart. The decisions required the two companies to repay customers who lost money, due to the insufficiently uncovered gift card fees.

## Illustration of Breakage

Think about the accompanying illustration of a breakage: on the off chance that a customer purchases a $50 gift card, the company received $50, as well as a future liability for $50 worth of goods or services. This could be for a clothing retailer, a restaurant chain, or whatever other merchant that introduces such gift card programs.

Presently we should expect that the beneficiary of the gift card utilizes it to make a $48 purchase. In this case, the company would eliminate $48 from its liability, which would be recognized as revenue. Furthermore, in the event that after the purchase, the customer discards the gift card, the $2 left on it could never be utilized. That extra amount is viewed as breakage.

### Breakage Solutions

The [Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB)](/fasb) developed another model for accounting for prepaid services and goods that tends to the breakage that accompanies selling these things. FASB expected to make a more transparent method of financial reporting through these better measures.

To assist with decreasing the accounting uncertainty brought about by reporting breakage, the FASB delivered an Accounting Standards Update in 2016, which expects companies to conform to new rules for recording liabilities associated with a gift card and other prepaid service sales and revenue/profits associated with breakage. All impacted companies are expected to embrace the new measures before December 15, 2019.
