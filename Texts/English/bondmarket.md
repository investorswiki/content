Bonds have been traded far longer than stocks have. As a matter of fact, loans that were assignable or transferrable to others appeared as soon as old Mesopotamia where debts named in units of grain weight could be exchanged among debtors. As a matter of fact, recorded debt instruments history back to 2400 B.C; for example, by means of a mud tablet discovered at Nippur, presently present-day Iraq. This curio records a guarantee for payment of grain and listed results on the off chance that the debt was not reimbursed.

Afterward, in the middle ages, governments started giving sovereign debts to fund wars.

## Types of Bond Markets

The general bond market can be segmented into the following bond orders, each with its own set of qualities.

### Corporate Bonds

Companies issue corporate bonds to fund-raise for a sundry of reasons, for example, financing current operations, growing product lines, or opening up new manufacturing facilities. Corporate bonds ordinarily depict longer-term [debt instruments](/debtinstrument) that give a maturity of something like one year.

Corporate bonds are normally classified as either [investment-grade](/investmentgrade) or, more than likely [high-yield](/high_yield_bond) (or "[junk](/junkbond)"). This order depends on the credit rating assigned to the bond and its issuer. An investment-grade is a rating that implies a high-quality bond that presents a somewhat low risk of [default](/default2). Bond-rating firms like [Standard and Poor's](/sp) and [Moody's](/moodys) utilize various designations, comprising of the upper-and lower-case letters "A" and "B," to recognize a bond's credit quality rating.

A bond is a debt or vow to pay investors interest payments along with the return of invested principal in exchange for buying the bond. Junk bonds address bonds issued by companies that are financially battling and have a high risk of [defaulting](/default2) or not paying their interest payments or repaying the principal to investors. Junk bonds are likewise called high-yield bonds since the higher yield is expected to assist offset with any risking of default. These bonds have credit ratings below BBB-from S&P, or below Baa3 from Moody's.

### Government Bonds

National-issued [government bonds](/government-bond) (or [sovereign bonds](/sovereign-debt)) tempt buyers by paying out the [face value](/facevalue) listed on the bond certificate, on the agreed [maturity date](/maturitydate), while likewise giving periodic interest payments along the way. This characteristic makes government bonds attractive to conservative investors. Since sovereign debt is backed by a government that can tax its residents or print money to cover the payments, these are viewed as the least risky type of bonds, overall.

In the U.S., government bonds are known as Treasuries, and are by a long shot the most active and liquid bond market today. A Treasury Bill ([T-Bill](/treasurybill)) is a short-term U.S. government debt obligation backed by the [Treasury Department](/ustreasury) with a maturity of one year or less. A Treasury note ([T-note](/treasurynote)) is a marketable U.S. government [debt security](/debtsecurity) with a fixed interest rate and a maturity somewhere in the range of one and 10 years. Treasury bonds ([T-bonds](/treasurybond)) are government debt securities issued by the U.S. Federal government that have [maturities](/maturitydate) greater than 20 years.

### Municipal Bonds

Municipal bonds — generally abbreviated as ["muni" bonds](/municipalbond) — are privately issued by states, urban communities, particular reason regions, public utility locale, school regions, publicly-owned air terminals and seaports, and other government-owned substances who look to raise cash to fund different projects.

Munis come in two fundamental types. A [general obligation bond](/generalobligationbond) (GO) is issued by governmental substances and not backed by revenue from a specific project, like a toll road. A few GO bonds are backed by dedicated [property taxes](/propertytax); others are payable from general funds. A [revenue bond](/revenuebond) rather gets principal and interest payments through the issuer or sales, fuel, inn occupancy, or different taxes. At the point when a municipality is a [conduit issuer](/conduit-issuer) of bonds, an outsider covers interest and principal payments.

### Mortgage-Backed Bonds (MBS)

[MBS](/mbs) issues, which comprise of pooled mortgages on [real estate](/realestate) properties, are locked in by the pledge of specific collateralized assets. The investor who buys a mortgage-backed security is basically lending money to homebuyers through their lenders. These regularly pay month to month, quarterly, or semi-annual interest.

The MBS is a type of [asset-backed security](/asset-backedsecurity) (ABS). As ended up being extremely clear in the subprime mortgage meltdown of 2007-2008, a mortgage-backed security is just essentially as stable as the mortgages that back it up.

### Emerging Market Bonds

These are bonds issued by governments and companies situated in emerging market economies, these bonds give a lot greater growth opportunities, yet additionally greater risk, than domestic or developed bond markets.

All through the vast majority of the twentieth century, countries with emerging economies issued bonds just intermittently.

Today, bonds are issued in agricultural countries and by corporations situated in these countries everywhere, including from Asia, Latin America, Eastern Europe, Africa, and the Middle East.

The risks of investing in emerging market bonds incorporate the standard risks that accompany all [debt issues](/debt-issue, for example, the factors of the issuer's economic or financial performance and the ability of the issuer to meet payment obligations. These risks are elevated, be that as it may, due to the likely political and economic volatility of non-industrial countries. Albeit emerging countries, overall, have taken great steps in restricting country risks or [sovereign risk](/sovereignrisk), it is evident that the chance of socioeconomic instability is more extensive in these nations than in developed countries, especially the U.S.

Emerging markets additionally present other cross-border risks, including [exchange rate](/exchangerate) changes and currency downgrades. Assuming a bond is issued in a nearby currency, the rate of the dollar versus that currency can decidedly or negatively influence your yield. At the point when that nearby currency is strong compared to the dollar, your returns will be decidedly influenced, while a weak neighborhood currency adversely influences the exchange rate and negatively impacts the yield.

## Bond Indices

Similarly as the S&P 500 and the Russell indices track [equities](/equity), huge name bond indices like the [Bloomberg Aggregate Bond Index](/lehmanaggregatebondindex), the Merrill Lynch Domestic Master, and the Citigroup U.S. Broad Investment-Grade Bond Index, track and measure corporate bond [portfolio performance](/reit).

## Bond Market versus Stock Market

Bonds contrast from [stocks](/stock) in more ways than one. Bonds address debt financing, while stocks equity financing. Bonds are a form of credit by which the borrower (for example bond issuer) must repay the bond's proprietor's principal plus extra interest along the way. Stocks don't qualifies the shareholder for any return of capital, nor must pay interest (or dividends). In view of the legal protections and guarantees in a bond expressing repayment to creditors, bonds are commonly safer than stocks, and in this way command lower expected returns than stocks. Stocks are innately riskier than bonds thus have a greater potential for greater gains or greater losses.

Both stock and bond markets will more often than not be exceptionally active and liquid. Bond prices, notwithstanding, will generally be exceptionally sensitive to interest rate changes, with their prices shifting conversely to interest rate moves. Stock prices, then again, are more sensitive to changes in future profitability and growth potential.
