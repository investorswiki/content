# Eric S. Maskin

Eric S. Maskin is an economist, mathematician, and Nobel prize victor. His areas of research incorporate [game theory](/gametheory), incentives, auction design, contract theory, social decision theory, political economy, and [intellectual property](/intellectualproperty).

In 2007, he shared the [Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences](/nobel-memorial-prize-in-economic-sciences) with Leonid Hurwicz and Roger Myerson for their work on the groundworks of mechanism design theory. This theory investigates how institutions can accomplish beneficial social or economic goals given the limitations of people's self-interest and inadequate data.

## Early Life and Education

Eric S. Maskin was brought into the world in New York City on Dec. 12, 1950, and experienced childhood in Alpine, New Jersey. He earned his Bachelor of Arts degree in 1972, his Master of Arts degree in 1974, and his Ph.D. in applied arithmetic in 1976, all from Harvard University.

At Harvard, he was first presented to early thoughts on mechanism design theory. He was a postdoctoral individual at Jesus College, Cambridge University. During his time at Cambridge, he worked together with Leo Hurwicz on creating mechanism design theory.

In 1977, he joined the workforce at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). Following his time at MIT, he returned to Harvard from 1985 to 2000 to seek after his research plan. He passed on Harvard to join the Institute for Advanced Study (IAS) from 2000 to 2011. While at IAS he likewise educated at Princeton University. He rejoined the personnel at Harvard in 2012.

## Striking Accomplishments

Maskin's most important contributions to economics have been in game theory. He has additionally led research on software patents, political economy, and different areas of economic idea.

### Mechanism Design Theory

While at Cambridge, Maskin dealt with propelling [mechanism design theory](/mechanism-design-theory). Mechanism design theory can be characterized as a sort of reverse game theory, where the ideal outcome of a cooperative game is given, and the goal is to design a set of rules for a game that will accomplish that outcome.

> Game theory accepts that all players in the game are rational and look to boost their outcome.

His goal was to decide mathematically when it is feasible to design a methodology or game that would carry out a given social goal. Maskin exhibited the mathematical properties of a cooperative outcome that make designing a mechanism to accomplish that outcome conceivable.

With regards to designing a voting rule that would fulfill elector inclinations, this requires that on the off chance that any citizen's inclinations for the outcome change, it means that they favor the new coming about outcome higher than the bygone one. This would come to be known as a Maskin monotonicity.

### Software Patents

Maskin has done applied research contending against the utilization of [patents](/patent) in software development or, by extension, other comparative industries. That's what he contends on the off chance that innovation is "consecutive" ( each successive development expands on its ancestors) and "reciprocal" (every potential trend-setter takes an alternate research line), then, at that point, patent protection isn't valuable for empowering innovation.

Society and creators themselves might even be better off without such protection since progress may actually be enhanced by greater competition and imitation.

### Political Economy

In a compelling 2004 paper, Maskin officially displayed the effects of unveiling officials accountable by making them subject to re-appointment. Such accountability permits the public to discipline officials, yet it can likewise incite those officials to pander to citizens and favor the voting majority over the rights of a minority.

He contends that not holding officials accountable through re-appointment is alluring when electors are ineffectively educated, obtaining important data is exorbitant, the impact of official actions consumes a large chunk of the day to become known, and the majority's inclinations are probably going to cause serious costs for a minority.

This proposes that exceptionally technical choices ought to be left to delegated judges or administrators, yet he contends that their attentiveness ought to be pointedly limited and important general dynamic power ought to be saved for chose officials.

## The Bottom Line

Eric S. Maskin is an economist and mathematician that won the Nobel Prize in Economic Sciences. His areas of skill cover many subjects, including game theory, incentives, auction design, contract theory, social decision theory, political economy, and intellectual property. His contributions to the field of science and economics have been important in the field of mechanism design, software patents, and political economy.

## FAQ
### Does Eric S. Maskin Teach at Harvard?
Indeed, Eric S. Maskin educates at Harvard. He is right now the Adams University Professor and Professor of Economics and Mathematics at Harvard.
### What Is Game Theory?
Game theory is an area of economics that arrangements with competitive circumstances and the strategies utilized in dealing with them. It takes a gander at the reasons individuals pursue certain choices, which centers around the thoughts of conflict and cooperation.
### What Is Prisoner's Dilemma?
The detainee's dilemma is a common illustration of a game that is concentrated on in game theory. The reason spins around two detainees and how they act. In the event that they act selfishly, the outcome is a poor outcome for both. The detainee's dilemma additionally exhibits that total cooperation isn't really great.
