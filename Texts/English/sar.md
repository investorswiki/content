# Stock Appreciation Rights (SARs)
## What Are Stock Appreciation Rights?

Stock appreciation rights (SARs) are a type of employee compensation linked to the company's stock price during a foreordained period. SARs are productive for employees when the company's stock price rises, which makes them like [employee stock options (ESOs)](/eso). Nonetheless, employees don't need to pay the [exercise price](/exerciseprice) with SARs. All things considered, they receive the sum of the increase in stock or cash.

The primary benefit of stock appreciation rights is that employees can receive proceeds from stock price increases without purchasing stock.

## Understanding Stock Appreciation Rights

Stock appreciation rights offer the right to the cash equivalent of a stock's price gains throughout a foreordained time interval. Employers quite often pay this type of bonus in cash. In any case, the company might pay the employee bonus in shares. By and large, employees can exercise SARs after they vest. At the point when SARs vest, it just means that they become accessible to exercise. Employers generally issue SARs alongside stock options. These stock appreciation rights are called tandem SARs. They help with funding the purchase of options and assist with paying off taxes due at the time the SARs are exercised.

Like several different forms of [stock compensation](/stockcompensation), SARs are transferable and are in many cases subject to [clawback](/clawback) provisions. Clawback provisions indicate conditions under which the company might reclaim some or all of the income received by employees under the plan. For instance, they could permit the firm to pull out SARs in the event that an employee goes to work for a contender before a predetermined date. SARs are likewise much of the time granted by a vesting schedule that attaches them to performance objectives set by the company.

SARs are taxed the same way as [non-qualified stock options (NSOs)](/nso). There are no tax results of any sort on either the grant date or when they are vested. Nonetheless, participants must perceive ordinary income on the spread at the hour of exercise. Most employers will likewise withhold supplemental [federal income tax](/federal_income_tax). Besides, they will hold back funds to pay state and neighborhood taxes where applicable.

Numerous employers will likewise withhold taxes on SARs as shares. For instance, an employer may just give a certain number of shares and withhold the remainder to cover the tax. Likewise with NSOs, the amount of income recognized upon exercise turns into the [cost basis](/costbasis) for taxes when holders sell the shares.

## Special Considerations

SARs are comparable here and there to [phantom stock](/phantomstock). The major difference is that phantom stocks are commonly intelligent of stock parts and dividends. Phantom stock is a commitment that an employee will receive either the value of the company's shares or the amount that the stock price increases during a predefined period. The phantom stock bonus an employee receives is taxed as ordinary income at the time it is received. Phantom stock isn't tax-qualified, so it doesn't need to follow the rules that [employee stock ownership plans (ESOPs)](/esop) and [401(k)s](/401kplan) must follow.

## Advantages and Disadvantages of SARs

The best advantage of SARs is flexibility. Companies can structure SARs in various ways that turn out best for various people. Notwithstanding, this flexibility requires pursuing various decisions. Companies offering SARs must conclude which employees receive them, the value of these bonuses, the liquidity of the SARs, and which vesting rules to embrace.

Employers like SARs in light of the fact that the accounting rules for them are more great than in the past. They receive fixed rather than variable accounting treatment, similar as conventional stock option plans. In any case, SARs require the issuance of less shares and weaken the share price not exactly traditional stock plans. Like any remaining forms of [equity compensation](/equity-compensation), SARs can likewise spur and hold employees.

These SARs could likewise have a clawback provision where employees lose them in the event that they leave the company before the two-year period closes.
