## What is a Direct-Access Broker?

A direct-access broker is a [stockbroker](/stockbroker) that focuses on speed and order execution — not at all like a full-service broker that spotlights on investment research and exhortation. Direct-access brokers generally utilize muddled computer software that allows clients to trade directly with an exchange or with others by means of [electronic communication organizations (ECN)](/ecn).

As markets become more efficient with technology improvements, the requirement for quicker trade-execution is truly increasing. Increasingly more retail investors are accessing the marketplace with their cell phones instead of using a desktop or voice-directed trades with a human.

## Understanding a Direct-Access Broker

Direct-access brokers have become exceptionally famous among active traders as a result of their speedy transaction times, yet different services, for example, streaming statements, interactive charts, Level II Nasdaq quotes and other real-time highlights have likewise contributed to this achievement. These brokers have cut down their costs and increased effectiveness by eliminating the job of the outsider, which in turn allows them to charge a lower commission than traditional brokers.

The most recent trend for online brokers is commission free trading on stocks, ETFs, and options. The majority of these free platforms, notwithstanding, sell the order-flow to market-creators and [HFT](/high-recurrence trading) hedge funds. These arrangements are [payment for order-flow](/paymentoforderflow) or PFOF.

Conventional online brokers generally direct customer trade orders to a centralized trading desk that then courses to the company's own market producers or other pre-determined [liquidity](/liquidity) suppliers through pre-arranged order flow arrangements. These platforms will quite often push research and fundamental analysis capabilities over pure execution services. These brokers take care of self-directed investors and retail swing traders.

There are benefits and impediments along the broker range of full service to hyper low-cost options. Sophisticated institutional investors with in-house research groups might not have any desire to pay for full-service execution which includes research and trading thoughts.

Notwithstanding, to capitalize on proprietary research and thoughts, on occasion, they will look for and pay a premium for fast trade execution. Interestingly, [buy-and-hold](/buyandhold) long-term investors don't need immediate execution, so paying a premium wouldn't check out. Be that as it may, research and counsel which can be costly to collect themselves can be a worth add service.

Headways in global capital markets, as well as information advances, continue to drive down the costs for financial market participants — in numerous ways, the traditional lines between full-service and online discount brokerages get ever blurrier.
