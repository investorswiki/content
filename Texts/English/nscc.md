## What Is a National Securities Clearing Corporation?

National Securities Clearing Corporation (NSCC) is a subsidiary of Depository Trust and Clearing Corporation (DTCC) that gives centralized clearing, risk management, information, and settlement services to the financial industry.

The NSCC offers multilateral netting so that brokers can offset buy and sell positions into a single payment obligation. This reduces their financial exposure and [capital requirements](/capitalrequirement).

## How the National Securities Clearing Corporation (NSCC) Works

The National Securities Clearing Corporation was established in 1976 and is a registered clearing corporation, regulated by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).

Before its inception, strong demand for paper stock certificates had become almost overpowering for some [stock brokerages](/stockbroker), making the stock exchanges close one time each week.

To defeat this problem, multilateral netting was proposed. This is an arrangement among multiple parties to sum transactions in a centralized area, rather than settle them separately. This keeps away from the requirement for multiple invoicing and payment settlements among different parties.

The decision to work with multilateral netting prompted the formation of the NSCC. Today, this corporation fills in as a seller for each buyer, and buyer for each seller for trades that settle in U.S. markets. The NSCC decreases the value of payments exchanged by an average of 98% daily. Likewise, it's important to note that NSCC generally clears and settles trades on a T+2 basis.
