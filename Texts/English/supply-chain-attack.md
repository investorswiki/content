# Supply Chain Attack
## What Is a Supply Chain Attack?

A supply chain attack is a cyberattack that endeavors to cause damage to a company by taking advantage of weaknesses in its [supply chain](/supplychain) network. A supply chain attack involves continuous network hacking or penetration processes to gain access to an association's network to cause disturbances or blackouts, which at last mischief the target company.

Interconnectivity of supply chains is raising risk. In 2020, Accenture indicated that 40% of cyberattacks originated from the extended supply chain.

## Understanding Supply Chain Attacks

The supply chain network is a successive targets for cyber crimes, as a weak connection in the supply chain can grant the cyber hoodlums access to the bigger organization in custody of the data pursued. Supply chain attacks uncover a problem in a company's supply network which unveils that an organization's cyber security controls are just that strong of the weakest party on the chain.

The adoption of different forms of emanant technology has brought about a colossal amount of data in different forms. Through resources like the internet, cell telephones, and [cloud computing](/cloud-computing), companies can now electronically acquire data and share it with their partners and outsider vendors. Substances like people, organizations, and legislatures accept that that important data that can be [mined from the data](/datamining) set can be utilized to better work on their operations and processes, and accordingly, further develop their customer engagement. In any case, the exchange of data directed among different companies carries with it a certain level of risk which involves cyber theft. Sophisticated cyber crooks likewise understand the significance of the data held by companies and gadget strategies to gain access to the sensitive data.

The drive to limit operational costs through innovative progress brought about the requirement for a supply network. A company's supply network as a rule comprises of outsider substances like manufacturers, providers, controllers, transporters, and buyers generally engaged with the most common way of making products that anyone could hope to find to the end consumers. Since the target company might have a security system that might be impervious for even the sophisticated cyber lawbreakers, supply chain attacks are carried out on the outsider organizations on the chain who are considered to have the weakest internal measures and processes in place. When one part's security conventions are found to be weak, the part's weaknesses become the target company's risk.

Another way a supply chain can be attacked is through malicious software, prominently known as [malware](/adware). By inserting malware like worms, infections, spyware, Trojan ponies, alongside fake parts that change the source codes of a maker's software, cyber attackers can gain entry into the target company's records and take its proprietary data.

## Illustration of Supply Chain Attacks

There are several different ways a supply chain can be attacked. Theft of a vendor's credentials can lead to the penetration of the companies affiliated with the vendor. For instance, Target was the casualty of a supply chain attack in 2013. Its [security measures](/cybersecurity) were breached when one of its outsider's security credentials was compromised. The credentials regularly included login, passwords, and network access to Target's computer. The vendor's sketchy security rehearses permitted programmers to gain entry into Target's system bringing about the theft of 70 million customers' personally identifiable data. The outcome of the breach prompted the CEO's resignation and gigantic costs for the company which bested $200 million.

## Features
- Supply chain attacks can be more commonplace than attacks on primary targets, and start by means of hacking endeavors or through embedding malware.
- The thought is that key providers or vendors of a company might be more defenseless against attack than the primary target, making them weak connections in the target's overall network.
- A supply chain attack tries to penetrate and upset the computer systems of a company's supply chain to hurt that target company.
