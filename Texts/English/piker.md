An individual is probably going to be considered a piker on the off chance that they make small [trades](/exchange) or don't prepare completely for the trading day. The word itself is believed to be more offensive than a term, for example, "novice."

That being said, informal investors are entirely proficient about the market as they need to go with quick choices trading over the course of the day. They don't hold positions overnight so having a thought of what course a security is moving during the day is critical in determining whether to buy or sell positions.

Presently, on the off chance that a trader had purchased 3,000 shares of similar stock, they would've made $6,000 gross, a lot higher number. Of course, their risk of loss is higher with a larger position.

In any case, on the off chance that they are exhausted at the moment and choose to execute the order if by some stroke of good luck for a small [commission](/commission), they'll do it; and afterward share a joke with their pal about the piker.
