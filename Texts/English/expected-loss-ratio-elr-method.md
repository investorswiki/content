# Expected Loss Ratio - ELR Method
## What Is the Generally anticipated Loss Ratio - ELR Method?

Expected loss ratio (ELR) method is a technique used to decide the projected amount of claims, relative to [earned premiums](/earnedpremium). The expected [loss ratio](/loss-ratio) (ELR) method is utilized when an insurer lacks the fitting past claims occurrence data to give in light of changes to its product offerings and when it lacks a sufficiently large sample of data for long-tail product lines.

## The Formula for the ELR Method Is

## Step by step instructions to Calculate Expected Loss Ratio - ELR Method

To ascertain the expected loss ratio method duplicate earned premiums by the expected loss ratio and afterward deduct paid losses.

## What Does the ELR Method Tell You?

Insurers set to the side a portion of their premiums from [underwriting](/underwriting) new policies to pay for future claims. The expected loss ratio is utilized to decide the amount they set to the side. It's likewise important to note that the frequency and seriousness of the claims they hope to experience additionally assumes a part. Insurers utilize an assortment of [forecasting](/forecasting) methods to decide claims reserves.

In certain examples, for example, new lines of business, the ELR method might be the main conceivable method for sorting out the fitting level of loss reserves required. The ELR method can likewise be utilized to set the loss reserve for specific business lines and policy periods. The expected loss ratio, duplicated by the proper earned premium figure, will deliver the estimated ultimate losses (paid or incurred). Nonetheless, for certain lines of business, government regulations might direct the base levels of [loss reserves](/loss-reserve) required.

## Illustration of How to Use Expected Loss Ratio (ELR) Method

Insurers can likewise utilize expected loss ratio to ascertain the [incurred however not reported (IBNR)](/incurredbutnotreported) reserve and total reserve. The expected loss ratio is the ratio of ultimate losses to earned premiums. The ultimate losses can be calculated as the [earned premium](/earnedpremium) duplicated by the expected loss ratio. The total reserve is calculated as the ultimate losses less paid losses. The IBNR reserve is calculated as the total reserve less the cash reserve.

For instance, an insurer has earned premiums of $10,000,000 and an expected loss ratio of 0.60. Throughout the span of the year, it has paid losses of $750,000 and cash reserves of $900,000. The insurer's total reserve would be $5,250,000 ($10,000,000 * 0.60 - $750,000), and its IBNR reserve would be $4,350,000 ($5,250,000 - $900,000).

## The Difference Between the ELR Method and the Chain Ladder Method (CLM)

Both the ELR and the [chain ladder method](/chain-ladder-method-clm) (CLM) measure claim reserves, where the CLM utilizes past data to anticipate what occurs from now on. While the expected loss ratio (ELR) is utilized when there's little past data to go off of, CLM is utilized for stable businesses and business lines.

## Limitations of Using the ELR Method

The amount of claims reserves that an insurer ought to set to the still up in the air by actuarial models and forecasting methods. Insurers frequently utilize the expected loss ratio on the amount and quality of data that is accessible. It is much of the time valuable in the beginning phases of forecasting since it doesn't consider genuine paid losses, however in later stages, this lack of sensitivity to changes in reported and paid losses makes it less accurate and hence, less helpful.
