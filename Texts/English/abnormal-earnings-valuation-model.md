# Abnormal Earnings Valuation Model
## What Is the Abnormal Earnings Valuation Model?

The abnormal earnings valuation model is a method for deciding a company's equity value in light of the two its [book value](/bookvalue) and its earnings. Otherwise called the [residual income](/residualincome) model, it sees whether management's choices will make a company perform better or more terrible than anticipated.

The model is utilized to forecast future stock prices and infers that investors ought to pay more than book value for a stock on the off chance that earnings are surprisingly high and not as much as book value if [earnings](/earnings) are lower than expected.

## Understanding the Abnormal Earnings Valuation Model

The abnormal earnings valuation model is one of several methods to estimate the value of stock or equity. There are two parts to equity value in the model: a company's book value and the current value of future expected residual incomes.

The formula for the last option part is like a [discounted cash flow ](/dcf)(DCF) approach, however rather than utilizing a [weighted average cost of capital](/wacc) (WACC) to compute the DCF model's discount rate, the surge of residual incomes are discounted at the firm's cost of equity.

## What Does the Abnormal Earnings Valuation Model Tell You?

Investors anticipate that stocks should have a "typical" rate of return from here on out, which approximates to its [book value per common share](/bookvaluepercommon) (BVPS). In any case, "abnormal" isn't generally a negative undertone. For instance, on the off chance that the current value of future residual incomes is positive, company management is assumed to make value far in excess of the stock's book value. If earnings per share come in higher than expected for the given period, investors should seriously mull over paying more than book value for the stock.

Nonetheless, in the event that the company reports earnings per share that comes in below expectations, management will assume the fault. Investors may not pay book value or they might anticipate a discount. The model is connected with the [economic value added](/eva) (EVA) model in this sense, yet the two models are developed with varieties.

## Special Considerations

The model might be more accurate for circumstances where a firm doesn't pay [dividends](/dividend), or it pays unsurprising dividends (in which case a dividend discount model would be suitable), or on the other hand in the event that future residual incomes are hard to forecast. The starting point will be book value; the scope of total equity value in the wake of adding the current value of future residual incomes would hence be smaller than, say, a reach derived by a DCF model.

In any case, similar to the DCF model, the abnormal earnings valuation method actually relies vigorously upon the [forecasting](/forecasting) ability of the analyst putting the model together. Erroneous suspicions for the model can deliver it to a great extent pointless as a method for assessing the equity value of a firm.

## Analysis of the Abnormal Earnings Valuation Model

Any valuation model is just all around as great as the quality of the presumptions put into the model. [Model risk](/modelrisk) happens when an investor or financial institution depends on an inaccurate model to settle on investment choices. While the finance industry utilizes models widely to forecast stock prices, models can fail due to data input errors, programming errors, or confusion of the model's outputs.

On account of the book value per share utilized in the abnormal earnings valuation, a company's book value can be impacted by occasions, for example, a [share buyback](/buyback) and this must be figured into the model. Furthermore, whatever other occasions that influence the firm's book value must be calculated in to ensure the consequences of the model are not twisted.
