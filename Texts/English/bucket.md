To Tobin, the arrangement of the risky bucket would meaningfully affect the overall risk assumed by the investor, as long as the investor held two buckets.

The medium-term bucket would contain assets not required for something like five to 10 years, for example, [dividend](/dividend) investments and [real estate investment trusts](/reit) (REITs).
