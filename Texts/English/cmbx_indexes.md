# CMBX Indexes
## What Are CMBX Indices?

CMBX Indices are a group of financial indexes that track the [commercial mortgage-backed securities](/cmbs) (CMBS) market. These indexes address 25 tranches (French word signifying "cut") of CMBS, each with an alternate credit rating. Since mortgage-backed securities are illiquid and non-normalized in the [over-the-counter](/otc) (OTC) market, they frequently lack the transparency and regulation of listed securities. These indexes assist with giving liquidity and transparency.

These indexes empower investors to measure the market and take long or short positions through [credit default swaps](/creditdefaultswap), which put specific interest rate spreads on each risk class. The pricing depends on the spreads themselves rather than on a pricing mechanism.

## Grasping CMBX Indexes

Commercial mortgage-backed securities are a pool of loans regularly held inside a trust, and they can be exceptionally diversified in terms, property types, and sums. The underlying loans that are securitized into CMBS incorporate loans for properties, for example, apartment complexes and edifices, industrial facilities, lodgings, office structures, office stops, and shopping centers, frequently inside a similar trust.

There are five separate CMBX indexes for ratings going from "AAA" to "BBB-" in light of a basket of 25 CDSs, which reference CMBS securities.

The CMBX indexes are reconstituted like clockwork to get new securities and thereby persistently mirror the current strength of the CMBS market. Daily trading includes cash settlements between the two gatherings to any transaction.

This "pay as you go" settlement process considers three occasions in the underlying securities as "credit occasions": principal [writedowns](/writedown), principal shortfalls (disappointments to pay on an underlying mortgage), and interest shortfalls (when current cash flows pay not exactly the CMBX coupon).

## Special Considerations

The presentation of indexes like the CMBX has prompted monstrous growth in the [structured finance](/structuredfinance) market, which incorporates credit default swaps, commercial mortgage-backed securities, [collateralized debt obligations](/cdo), and other collateralized securities.

Trading in the CMBX tranches is finished over the counter, and liquidity is given by a syndicate of large investment banks. While the average investor can't partake in the CMBX indexes straightforwardly, they can see current spreads for a given risk class to evaluate how the market is processing current market conditions, making it a possibly important research device.

The CMBX indexes are issued by the CDS Index Company and administered by Markit. For these indexes to work, they must have adequate [liquidity](/liquidity). Therefore, the issuer has commitments from the largest [dealers](/vendor) (large investment banks) to give liquidity in the market.
