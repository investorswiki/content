# Offset Mortgage
## What Is an Offset Mortgage?

An offset mortgage is a type of home loan that involves blending a traditional [mortgage](/mortgage) with at least one deposit accounts held by a similar financial institution. The savings balance maintained in the deposit account may then be utilized to offset the mortgage balance, lowering [interest](/interest) payments due.

Offset mortgages are standard in numerous nations, like the U.K., yet are presently not eligible for use in the U.S. due to tax laws. The nearest alternative to an offset mortgage in the U.S. would be an all-in-one mortgage.

## Understanding Offset Mortgages

An offset mortgage is a positive option for constant savers. The linked [savings account](/savingsaccount) won't earn interest during the life of the loan. In any case, most savings accounts are typically low-earning accounts that pay simply 1% to 3% each year, or less.

The mortgage interest rate is usually substantially higher than the rate paid on the savings account, so any savings there is a net benefit to the borrower. Likewise, the foregone interest on the savings account becomes non-taxable payments toward the mortgage.

> The savings account is typically a non-interest bearing account, which allows the bank to earn a positive return on any balances held in the account.

The calculation of interest is on the remaining balance of the note, less the aggregate amount of savings in at least one deposit accounts. The borrower actually approaches their savings account. Be that as it may, the next mortgage payment will be calculated on a higher [principal](/principal) balance in the event that the borrower pulls out funds from the account.

More than one savings account might link to the offset mortgage account, and family individuals from the borrower can link their savings accounts to the mortgage account to reduce the amount of the principal, and consequently, the interest on the remaining balance.

The principal is $225,000 with a 5% interest rate, and the family has $15,000 held in savings with similar lender without any withdrawals during the last month. Calculation of the next interest payment on an offset loan would be founded on the $210,000 balance, which mirrors the loan principal less the savings account balance: ($225,000 - $15,000 = $210,000).
