# Command Economy
## What Is a Command Economy?

A command economy is a key part of a political system wherein a central governmental authority directs the levels of production that are permissible and the prices that might be charged for goods and services. Most industries are publicly owned.

The fundamental alternative to a command economy is a free market system wherein demand directs production and prices.

The command economy is a part of a [communist](/socialism) political system, while a free market system exists in capitalist societies.

## Figuring out Command Economy

Cuba, North Korea, and the former Soviet Union all have command economies. China kept a command economy until 1978 when it started its change to a mixed economy that blends socialist and capitalist components. Its current system has been portrayed as a socialist market economy.

The command economy, otherwise called a planned economy, expects that a country's central government own and control the means of production.

Private ownership of land and capital is nonexistent or seriously limited. Central planners set prices, control production levels, and limit or disallow competition inside the private sector. In a pure command economy, there is no private sector, as the central government possesses or controls all business.

In a command economy, government officials set national economic needs, including how and when to produce economic growth, how to dispense resources, and how to disseminate the output. This frequently appears as a long term plan.

### Contentions Against Command Economies

Any capitalist would contend that command economies face no less than two major problems: first is the incentive problem and second is an information vacuum among the central planners pursuing every one of the choices.

**The Incentive Problem**

The incentive problem begins at the top. Policymakers, even in a command economy, are too human. Political interest gatherings and the power battles between them will overwhelm policymaking in a command economy even more than in capitalist economies since they are not obliged by market-based forms of discipline, for example, [sovereign credit ratings](/sovereign-credit-rating) or [capital flight](/capitalflight).

Wages are set centrally for workers, and profits are disposed of as an incentive for management. There is not a great explanation to create greatness, further develop proficiency, control costs, or contribute exertion past the base required to keep away from official assent.

Excelling in a command economy requires satisfying the party supervisors and having the right associations as opposed to expanding shareholder value or meeting consumer demands. Corruption will in general be unavoidable.

The incentive problem incorporates the issue known as the [tragedy of the commons](/tragedy-of-the-commons) on a bigger scale than is found in capitalist societies. Resources that are commonly owned are really unowned. Their users in general (or workers) lack any incentive to safeguard them. Things like housing improvements, plants, and machinery wear out, break down, and fall separated quickly in a command economy.

 **The Information Vacuum**

The problem of economic calculation in a command economy was first depicted by Austrian business analysts Ludwig von Mises and F. A. Hayek. Central planners must in some way work out the amount of each and every product and service ought to be created and delivered.

In a free market system, not entirely settled in a decentralized way through the interaction of [supply and demand](/law-of-supply-demand). Consumers shape demand by the products and services they buy or don't buy. Producers answer by making a greater amount of the products and services that consumers demand.

Additionally, these factors are quantifiable. At each step of the supply chain, somebody is keeping count of the number of avocados, pairs of blue pants, and carry torques that are in demand out there.

In a command economy, central planners ought to, initially, have a grip on the fundamental decisive requirements of the population in terms of food, dress, and shelter. Yet, without the powers of supply and demand to direct them, they have no rational method to adjust the production and distribution of goods with consumer needs and inclinations.

Over the long run, the incentive and economic calculation problems of a command economy mean that resources and capital goods are squandered, and the society is devastated.

## Contentions in Favor of Command Economies

Defenders of command economies contend that they assign resources to expand [social welfare](/social-welfare-system), in contrast to in free-market economies, where this goal is secondary to boosting private profit.

Command economies might have better control of employment levels than free-market economies. They can make responsibilities to put individuals to work when important, even without any a genuine need.

Finally, command economies are viewed as better able to take unequivocal, composed action in the face of a national emergency or crisis like a war or natural disaster. Albeit, even market-based societies might diminish property rights and enormously grow the emergency powers of their central governments during such events, for a brief time.
