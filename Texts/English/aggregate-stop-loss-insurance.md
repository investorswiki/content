# Aggregate Stop-Loss Insurance
## What Is Aggregate Stop-Loss Insurance?

Aggregate stop-loss insurance is a policy intended to limit claim coverage (losses) to a specific amount. This coverage guarantees that a catastrophic claim (specific stop-loss) or various claims (aggregate stop-loss) don't drain the financial reserves of a self-subsidized plan. Aggregate stop-loss safeguards the employer against claims that are surprisingly high. On the off chance that total claims surpass the [aggregate limit](/aggregatelimit), the stop-loss insurer covers the claims or [reimburses](/repayment) the employer.

## Grasping Aggregate Stop-Loss Insurance

Aggregate stop-loss insurance is held for self-subsidized insurance plans for which an employer accepts the [financial risk](/financialrisk) of giving healthcare benefits to its employees. In pragmatic terms, self-financed employers pay for each claim as it is introduced as opposed to paying a fixed premium to an insurance carrier for a completely insured plan. Stop-loss insurance is like purchasing high-deductible insurance. The employer stays responsible for claim expenses under the deductible amount.

Stop-loss insurance varies from conventional employee benefit insurance. Stop-loss just covers the employer and gives no direct coverage to employees and [health plan](/wellbeing plan-classes) participants.

### How Aggregate Stop-Loss Insurance Is Used

Aggregate stop-loss insurance is involved by employers as coverage for risk against a high value of claims. Aggregate stop-loss insurance accompanies a maximum level for claims. At the point when a maximum threshold is surpassed, the employer never again needs to make payments and may receive a few repayments.

Aggregate stop-loss insurance can either be added to an existing insurance plan or purchased freely. The threshold is calculated in view of a certain percentage of projected costs (called attachment points) â€” generally 125% of anticipated claims for the year.

An aggregate stop-loss threshold is generally variable and not fixed. This is on the grounds that the threshold vacillates as a percentage of an employer's enrolled employees. The variable threshold depends on an aggregate attachment factor which is an important part in the calculation of a stop-loss level.

Just like with high deductible plans, most stop-loss plans will have somewhat low premiums. This is on the grounds that the employer is expected to cover more than 100% of the value of claims they receive.

## Aggregate Stop-Loss Insurance Calculations

The aggregate attachment associated with a stop-loss plan is calculated as follows:

### Step 1

The employer and stop-loss insurance provider estimate the average dollar value of claims expected by employee each month. This value will rely upon the employer's estimate however frequently goes from $200 to $500 each month.

### Step 2

Expect the stop-loss plan utilizes a value of $200. This value would then be duplicated by the stop-loss attachment multiplier which for the most part goes from 125% to 175%. Utilizing a claims estimate of $200 and a stop-loss attachment multiplier of 1.25, the month to month deductible would be $250 each month per employee ($200 x 1.25 = $250).

### Step 3

This deductible must then be duplicated by the employer's plan enrollment for the month. Expecting that an employer has 100 employees in the principal month of coverage, their total deductible would be $25,000 for the month ($250 x 100).

### Step 4

Enrollment might possibly differ each month. Due to enrollment variance, aggregate stop-loss coverage might have either a month to month deductible or an annual deductible.

### Step 5

With a month to month deductible, the amount an employer must pay could change consistently. With an annual deductible, the amount the employer must pay would be added for the year and generally founded on estimates from the initial month of coverage. Many stop-loss plans will offer an annual deductible that is somewhat lower than the summation of deductibles north of 12 months.
