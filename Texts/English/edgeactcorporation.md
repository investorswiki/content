# Edge Act Corporation
## What Is an Edge Act Corporation?

An Edge Act corporation (EAC) is a subsidiary of a U.S. or on the other hand foreign bank that takes part in foreign banking operations; these auxiliaries are named after the 1919 Edge Act, which authorized them. The Edge Act, named after the U.S. congressperson who sponsored it, was an amendment to the [Federal Reserve Act of 1913](/1913-federal-reserve-act) that was acquainted with increase the seriousness of American financial firms on a global stage.

## Understanding Edge Act Corporations

Preceding the Edge Act, U.S. banks were not permitted to claim foreign banks. The regulation — which was sponsored by Senator Walter Evans Edge, a New Jersey Republican — corrected the Federal Reserve Act to permit them to do as such, subject to endorsement by the [Federal Reserve Board](/frb). The Edge Act likewise absolves banks' foreign auxiliaries from state laws, as the [Fed](/federalreservebank) is in charge of observing and controlling Edge Act corporations. Beginning around 1978, foreign banks have been permitted to possess Edge Act corporations.

There are two types of Edge Act corporations: banking Edge corporations, which take deposits from and make loans to companies carrying on with work internationally; and investment Edge corporations, which make an investment in foreign companies. Edge Act corporations might do some business locally, however provided that it is connected with their international business: for instance, financing imports and exports.

## State Regulations

A comparable vehicle, a [Agreement corporation](/agreement-corporation), is basically a state-contracted Edge Act corporation. In the U.S., banks might operate nationally as part of the National Association (NA) or as [state-sanctioned banks](/state-bank) inside its nation. An agreement corporation is a permission given to a bank by a state that permits it to take part in international banking and transactions.

Congress passed the Agreement Corporation Act in 1916. This new law authorized American banks to invest 10% of their capital into state-sanctioned banks and corporations permitted to internationally finance projects. The state-sanctioned bank would have to go into an agreement with the Federal Reserve, consenting to be limited by the rules and regulations set out in the Act. It was from these agreements that the term "agreement corporation" emerged.
