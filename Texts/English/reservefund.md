# Reserve Fund
## What is a reserve fund?
A reserve fund is a savings account or other liquid asset managed by a condominium, business or individual for anticipated future expenditures, like major repairs and improvements. Reserve funds ordinarily are set to the side in an account separate from the general operating funds.
## More profound definition
A reserve fund is typically set up to meet both scheduled and unscheduled expenses. Condominium corporations keep a reserve fund for non-routine repairs, like a pool renovation, and to supplant assets and different highlights of the property. An organization decides the amount of money to put into the reserve fund by doing a reserve fund study.
A reserve fund study, which is finished by an independent outside consultant, includes a physical inspection of the capital property of the condominium, for example, its cooling and heating system, rooftop and emergency generator. It likewise involves a financial analysis.
The reserve fund report frames the discoveries of the study, including which assets or highlights should be fixed or supplanted down the road and the amount it will cost. Like that, the townhouse's directors can make a financial arrangement and be prepared for major expenses.
Assuming the condominium causes expenses that are too large for the reserve fund to cover, the owner of every unit will be committed to pay a special assessment to cover such costs. Assessments can run into the a huge number of dollars.
Reserve funds are beneficial, as they assist with recovering major costs and shield owners from facing enormous, unmanageable bills.

The condominium's board of directors added a specific amount to every owner's quarterly maintenance fees to collect the $275,000 for the reserve fund in time for the anticipated elevator project.
