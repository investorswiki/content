## What Is Discover Card?

Discover is a credit card brand that is issued by the American financial services company Discover Financial (DFS).

Initially issued by retailer Sears, Roebuck and Co. in 1985, Discover cards sent off nationally in 1986, and first separated themselves for their decreased fee structure and spearheading [cash-back rewards program](/cash-back). Discover has been an independent company beginning around 2007. Today, Discover Cards are among the most widely accepted cards in the world, alongside Visa (V), Mastercard (MA), and American Express (AXP).

## History of Discover Card

Discover was made by a subsidiary of Sears in 1985, when many individual retailers and businesses were introducing branded credit cards for their individual stores to their customers. Discover immediately separated itself from the competition by charging no annual fee and offering one of the main cash-back rewards programs.

Discover initially was slow to develop, as few competing retailers were able to acknowledge the Sears department store card. Discover steadily expanded its network and is currently accepted in the vast majority of stores that acknowledge credit cards and in 200 countries. Starting around 2021, Discover is the seventh biggest issuer of cards worldwide.

## How Discover Cards Work

According to a consumer's point of view, Discover cards may appear to be very like those offered under competing brands, like Visa or Mastercard. Notwithstanding, in the background are a few important differences between the functions of Discover cards and those of its competitors.

We can see this by comparing Discover to Visa cards, for instance. While Visa basically licenses the utilization of its brand name to giving banks, which then offer Visa-branded credit cards to their customers, Discover really issues credit cards directly, utilizing its own brand.

Consequently, Discover Financial earns [interest income](/net-interest-income) from its credit card customers, as well as charging payment processing fees to the shippers that acknowledge the Discover card as payment. Visa, paradoxically, generates revenue from its payments network yet doesn't directly profit from the credit card balances of its [end user](/end-client). Along these lines, Discover's business model is more like that of [American Express](/american-express-card), which is additionally a direct issuer.

In light of this, it's a good idea that Discover cards have generally offered alluring terms to draw in new users, for example, being the main major credit card brand to offer cash-back rewards. All things considered, the company's profitability depends on expanding not just the card's acceptance among vendors (consequently supporting transaction processing fees) yet additionally the average outstanding balance of their cardholders.

Incentives to encourage customers to borrow really utilizing their Discover cards, for example, expanding [credit limits](/credit_limit) or postponing annual account fees, make sense given Discover Financial's overall business model.
