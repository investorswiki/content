# Closed-Market Transaction
## What Is a Closed-Market Transaction?

A closed-market transaction is an order placed by a company's insider to buy or sell restricted securities from inside the company's own treasury. Suitable documentation must be recorded before a closed-market transaction order can be placed.

Technically, closed-market transactions are a form of legal [insider trading](/insidertrading); these transactions are placed by an insider as indicated by the rules and regulations set out by the Securities and Exchange Commission ([SEC](/sec)). With a closed-market order, the insider is buying or selling shares at a price above or below the market and straightforwardly from and to the company — as opposed to openly on the market. These types of inside trades are generally not considered huge as they don't mirror the insider's sentiment towards the company. Such transactions don't typically influence the price of securities offered on the open market.

## Closed-Market Transactions versus Open-Market Transactions

Normally, closed-market transactions happen when an employee of a company trades shares or stock options in that company with the company itself. It is something contrary to a [open-market transaction](/openmarkettransaction), in which an ordinary investor buys or sells securities on a securities exchange that is open to the public. A closed-market transaction, then again, happens between the company and the insider, with no different parties included; it doesn't occur through the open exchange. Documentation recorded with the SEC shows different investors that the transaction happened.

## Employee Stock Options (ESOs) as a Closed-Market Transaction

A common illustration of a closed-market transaction is the point at which an employee gets, as part of their compensation, [employee stock options](/eso) (ESOs) or shares in the company. Closed-market transactions don't be guaranteed to mirror an insider's sentiments about or convictions in the value of the stock or different securities being traded. Nor are they essentially made willfully by the insider; they might be initiated by the company, which likes to offer its employees stock options or stock as part of their compensation. Stock options are a benefit frequently associated with startup companies, which might issue them to reward early employees when and in the event that the company opens up to the world.

An insider may likewise buy stocks openly on the open market. This isn't viewed as a closed-market transaction on the grounds that the transaction isn't directed between the company and the insider. However long fitting documentation is given, open-market transactions from company insiders are legal. As a voluntary transaction, an open-market transaction led by an insider can uncover that individual's sentiments about the stock or its worth, and such a transaction can influence the stock's market price.
