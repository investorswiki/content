# Discontinued Operations
## What Are Discontinued Operations?

In financial accounting, discontinued operations allude to parts of a company's core business or product line that have been stripped or closed down, and which are reported separately from [continuing operations](/consistent operations) on the [income statement](/incomestatement).

## Figuring out Discontinued Operations

Discontinued operations are listed separately on the income statement since investors genuinely must can obviously recognize the profits and [cash flows](/cashflow) from continuing operations from those activities that have stopped.

This qualification is especially helpful when companies converge, as parsing out which assets are being [divested](/divestment) or collapsed gives a clearer image of how a company will bring in money later on.

> On a company's income statement, discontinued operations are segregated from continuing operations with the goal that investors might see plainly the thing money is inflowing from current operations versus those which have stopped.

## Disclosure on Income Statements

At the point when operations are discontinued, a company has different details to report on its financial statements. Albeit the business part is being closed down, it actually could produce a gain or loss in the current accounting period.

The total gain or loss from the discontinued operations is consequently reported, trailed by the significant income taxes. This tax is in many cases a future tax benefit in light of the fact that discontinued operations frequently cause losses. To determine the company's total [net income (NI)](/netincome), the gain or loss from discontinued operations is collected with that of continuing operations.

So as not to befuddle acclimations to the financial statements that connect with recently reported discontinued operations, a company might group the changes separately in the discontinued operations section of its financials. Changes might happen in view of benefit plan obligations, contingent liabilities, or contingent contract terms.

In the event that the buyer of a discontinued operation expects the debt associated with the operation, any interest expense before the sale is allocated to discontinued operations. [Generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP)](/gaap) don't permit general corporate overhead to be allocated to discontinued operations.

### Discontinued Operations Under GAAP

A company might report discontinued operations under GAAP up to two conditions are met:

- To start with, the transaction to close down the stripped business will bring about killing the operations and cash flows of the stripped business from company operations.
- Second, whenever it has been discontinued, the closed business must have no significant continuous inclusion with its operations. In the event that these two conditions are met, a company might report discontinued operations on its financial statements.

### Discontinued Operations Under IFRS

The reporting rules under [international financial reporting standards (IFRS)](/ifrs) contrast somewhat from GAAP. A discontinued operation must meet two criteria:

- To start with, the asset or business part must be discarded or reported as being held available to be purchased.
- Second, the part must be discernable as a separate business that is being eliminated from operation intentionally or a subsidiary of a part being held with the intent to sell.

Dissimilar to GAAP reporting requirements, IFRS rules permit [equity method](/equitymethod) investments to be classified as held available to be purchased. Besides, under IFRS, substances might proceed with association with the discontinued operation. Similarly as with GAAP, discontinued operations are reported in a special section of the income statement.

## Features

- They are reported on the income statement as a separate entry from continuing operations.
