# Quitclaim Deed
## What Is a Quitclaim Deed?

A quitclaim [deed](/deed) releases a person's interest in a property without expressing the idea of the person's interest or rights, and without any guarantees of that person's interest or rights in the property. A quitclaim deed neither states nor guarantees that the person surrendering their claim to the property had legitimate ownership, yet it forestalls that person (the grantor) from later claiming they have an interest in the property.

## Figuring out a Quitclaim Deed

A quitclaim deed ordinarily incorporates a legal description of the property, the name of the person who is transferring their interest, the name of the person who is getting that interest (the grantee), the date, and the two players' authenticated marks.

Quitclaim deeds are commonly used to transfer property in non-deal circumstances, like transfers of property between family individuals. They can be utilized to add a spouse to a property title after marriage, eliminate a spouse from a title after divorce, explain ownership of inherited property, transfer property into (or out of) a revocable [living trust](/living-trust), explain a [easement](/easement), or change how a property's title is held.

A quitclaim deed makes no assurance that the [grantor](/grantor) really has an ownership interest in a property; it just states that on the off chance that the grantor does, they release those ownership rights. Thus, while accepting a quitclaim deed, the buyer of a property acknowledges the risk that the grantor of the deed might not have a substantial ownership interest as well as that there might be extra ownership interests in the property. [Title insurance](/title_insurance) isn't issued related to a quitclaim deed.

## Quitclaim Deed versus Warranty Deed versus Special Warranty Deed

Deeds are generally separated by what they state or guarantee when the ownership is transferred from the grantor to the grantee (buyer). In contrast to a quitclaim deed, a [warranty deed](/warranty-deed) can grant a certain level of assurances when ownership is transferred. Warranty deeds are regularly utilized in property sales and are granted in two common forms: general warranty deeds and special warranty deeds.

An overall warranty deed furnishes the grantee with the highest form of protection since it guarantees that the grantor owns the property completely (and that no other entity can place a claim on it). This guarantee covers the whole history of the property-even times when the grantor didn't possess the property. Assuming that there are any breaks in this contract, the grantor is held responsible.

A [special warranty deed](/special-warranty-deed) conveys that the grantor possesses the property and that no other person has a claim to it however long they have owned it. Special warranty deeds are generally commonly utilized during commercial real estate sales.
