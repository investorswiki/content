# Callable Bond
## What is a callable bond?
A callable bond is a type of bond that an issuer can recover or "call back" before its maturity date. The issuer does this by paying a call premium over the par value to the bondholder. A bond is redeemable if, before its [maturity date](/maturitydate), the issuer returns the investor's principle and stops future payments of interest.
## More profound definition
The call date on a callable bond differs with the issuer, however it tends to be found in the bond's prospectus. Numerous municipal bonds are callable following 10 years. A five-year, [high-yield bond](/junkbond) may be callable following two years.
A few corporate bonds and most [municipal bonds](/government-bond) are callable, where the issuer has flexibility while borrowing in terms of loan length and payment amount.
Callable bonds give issuers the right to successfully refinance [their debt](/unsecureddebt) later at a better rate, just as a homeowner could do by refinancing their mortgage.
In the event that rates have declined from the time the company or city previously issued the bond, the issuer might need to refinance its debt at a lower interest rate. Subsequent to calling its [current bonds](/tips), the issuer can then reissue them at a lower interest rate.
The prior a bond is called, the more its value increments, since the bond can be called just over the par value. Not at all like a noncallable bond, a callable bond pays a [higher coupon](/coupon) to an investor.
In this time of low interest rates, callable bonds by companies and urban communities have acquired in notoriety. In 2015, $1 trillion in callable corporate bonds were issued, compared to $234 billion of every 2005.
Undoubtedly, the impact of a bond being called can be huge, particularly on the off chance that an investor had erroneously figured it in as fixed income. That person is left with a gap in anticipated income.
## Callable bond model
The Sharp Razor Co. offered a callable bond on Nov. 1, 2016, with a 10 percent interest rate, developing on Oct. 30, 2021. Expect the issue amount is $100 million and the bond is callable at stretches following one year, subject to a 30-day notice, here is its value (as in the schedule below):
- Oct. 30, 2017 (Call date for one year) = 110 percent of face value.
- Oct. 30, 2018 (Call date for a considerable length of time) = 108 percent of face value.
- Oct. 30, 2019 (Call date for a considerable length of time) = 106 percent of face value.
- Oct. 30, 2020 (Call date for a considerable length of time) = 104 percent of face value.

In this model, Sharp Razor has an option to [redeem the bonds](/reclamation) from investors before the bonds mature on Oct. 30, 2021. The original call premium is higher at 10 percent of the bond's face value, and after some time it continuously declines to 4 percent.

## Highlights
- A callable bond benefits the issuer, thus investors of these bonds are compensated with a more appealing interest rate than on in any case comparative non-callable bonds.
- A callable bond allows companies to pay off their debt early and benefit from good interest rate drops.
- A callable bond is a debt security that can be reclaimed right on time by the issuer before its maturity at the issuer's prudence.
