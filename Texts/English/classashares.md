# Class A Shares
## What Are Class A Shares?

Then, at that point, one Class A share may be joined by five voting rights, while one Class B share could have just a single right to vote.

From that point forward, different shareholders could receive payment assuming anything is left. Sometimes, Class A shares are [convertible](/convertible-security) to more than one share of common stock, which further benefits these shareholders. Assume that they sell the company for $50.00 a share. Besides, the CEO of the company possesses 100,000 Class A shares that are convertible into 500,000 shares of common stock. Then, the CEO procures $25,000,000 upon conversion and sale.

Traditional Class A shares are not sold to the public and furthermore can't be traded by the holders of the shares. In theory, that permits the management team and other key executives to zero in on the company's long-term objectives.

Agency issues happen when a person focuses on personal objectives over the interests of their company.
