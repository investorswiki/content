# Acidizing
## What Is Acidizing?

In the oil and gas extraction industry, acidizing is a technique used to expand the helpful life of an oil and gas well. The most common way of acidizing includes pumping corrosive into the well to break down the stones that line the forms of the well.

Acidizing increases production rates by making channels into the stone through which the oil and gas can flow into the repository. An extra benefit of acidizing a well is that it can assist dissolve with any loosing debris found in the well.

## How Acidizing Works

Acidizing is frequently employed to extricate the excess resources from oil wells that have arrived at the finish of their useful lives. Without a doubt, since it is a somewhat costly interaction to utilize, acidizing might be utilized once less difficult methods, for example, [primary recovery techniques](/primary-recovery), have been completely used. In the event that the price of oil isn't adequately high to legitimize the investment, a company might forego acidizing and essentially continue on toward a more youthful well that can deliver oil and gas all the more efficiently.

As indicated by the American Petroleum Institute, the fundamental practice of acidizing has been broad for almost 120 years. During the 1930s, its ubiquity faded because of the damage it could do to the steel linings of the wells. The fact that effectively forestalled this damage makes in subsequent years, in any case, erosion inhibitor advancements developed. This has driven acidizing to by and by be widely utilized in the oil and gas services industry.

Acidizing might be more helpful than [hydraulic fracturing](/hydraulic-fracturing) in certain circumstances. Hydraulic fracturing-likewise called fracking-is a cycle that makes channels in underground stone developments by infusing a combination of water and fracking synthetic substances into the well at exceptionally high tensions. In contrast to hydraulic fracturing, acidizing doesn't need similar high-pressure infusions. Rather, acidizing depends on the corrosive substance to break up any penetrable residue in the well.

In districts where underground shale deposits are not consistently set up for instance in locales with substantial structural activity, for example, the state of California-acidizing may end up being more effective at opening oil deposits than hydraulic fracturing. Notwithstanding, at times, the two methods are utilized in tandem. This interaction is known as corrosive fracking.

## Special Considerations

The types and centralizations of acids utilized in the acidizing system are many times not uncovered by the companies that fabricate them, in spite of the fact that hydrochloric and hydrofluoric acids have been known to be utilized. In view of this equivocalness, it tends to be hard to precisely survey the safety and environmental risks associated with the practice.

One area of special concern is the potential impact that the practice of acidizing can have on the groundwater in the encompassing area. Damage to well linings might actually lead to acidizing synthetic compounds spilling into encompassing water sources, possibly undermining the nearby ecosystem or encompassing population centers.

Notwithstanding these expected risks, acidizing faces less regulations than other oil and natural gas production techniques. A few states, like California, have passed legislation to increase regulation on the practice and possibly impact people who are vigorously invested in oil and gas exploration companies.

## Highlights
- The most common way of acidizing includes pumping corrosive into the well to break down the stones that line the forms of the well.
- Acidizing is a technique utilized in oil and gas extraction that is intended to protract the helpful life of an oil well.
- The acidizing system is less vigorously regulated than other oil and gas extraction techniques.
