# Physical Presence Test
## What Is the Physical Presence Test?

The physical presence test is a device utilized by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) to decide if a taxpayer fits the bill for the [foreign earned income exclusion](/foreign-earned-income-exclusion) while filing their taxes.

The test expects that a person be physically present in a foreign country or countries for no less than 330 full days during a successive 12 months. The 330 days during which the person is abroad needn't bother with to be back to back.

## Understanding the Physical Presence Test

The physical presence test permits taxpayers to reject a certain amount of their foreign earned income. On the off chance that you are a U.S. citizen or a resident alien of the United States and you live abroad, you are taxed on your worldwide income. Nonetheless, you might fit the bill to avoid your foreign earnings from income up to an amount that is adjusted yearly for inflation: $108,700 for 2021 and $112,200 for 2022.

Individuals who fit the bill for this exclusion are likewise prone to meet all requirements for the [foreign housing deduction](/foreign-housing-exclusion-deduction), which can likewise get a good deal on their taxes.

The foreign income exclusion is accessible to the two citizens and resident aliens of the U.S. As indicated by the tax code, a person's justification for being abroad is irrelevant to this test. In any case, family crises, illness, and employer orders don't do the trick as motivations to consider the exclusion in the event that one of those reasons makes the taxpayer be available in a foreign country for not exactly the required 330 days. Besides, a "day" is viewed as a full 24-hour period, so long stretches of appearance and takeoff in a foreign country don't count toward the 330 days.

A person might go between foreign countries during their time abroad. Any time spent inside the United States while in transit, for example, during a delay between flights, doesn't count against the person's 330 days, the same length as the period of time inside the U.S. is under 24 hours.

## Special Considerations

There are exemptions for the rule. In the event that a person's presence in a foreign country disregards U.S. law, the government won't see them as physically present in that country for the time in which they abused the law. Any income earned inside that country while abusing U.S. law isn't viewed as foreign earned income by the IRS.

The base time requirement may likewise be postponed in the event that the taxpayer must leave a foreign country due to war, civil turmoil, or another condition that makes the country fundamentally dangerous or unacceptable. On the off chance that the taxpayer can show the way that they could have and would have sensibly met the requirements of the physical presence test notwithstanding the adverse conditions and that they had a [tax home](/taxhome) in that country and were a [bona fide resident](/bona-fide-foreign-resident) of the country at that point, they might in any case fit the bill for the exclusion.

Pay received as military or civilian income while positioned abroad isn't viewed as foreign earned income by the U.S. government.
