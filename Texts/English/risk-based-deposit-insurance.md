Risk-based deposit insurance became standard after the [Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) Improvement Act of 1991](/federal-deposit-insurance-corporation-improvement-act-fdicia). During the [savings and loan crisis](/sl-crisis), there was a 28% reduction in the number savings and loans associations somewhere in the range of 1980 and 1990, provoking regulators to change tact and switch from a level rate deposit insurance system, in which premiums were set at a uniform rate across all banks, to a risk-based assessment arrangement.

> The FDIC switched to variable risk-based premiums in 1994 for banks and in 1998 for savings institutions.

The [FDIC](/fdic), an independent federal agency whose primary purpose is to prevent a repeat of the [run-on-the-bank](/bankrun) situations that caused ruin during the Great Depression, utilizes the deposit insurance premiums it gathers from banks to fund the Federal Deposit Insurance program.

Checking accounts, savings accounts, [certificates of deposit](/certificateofdeposit) (CDs), and money market accounts are generally 100% covered by the FDIC, similar to clerk's checks and money orders issued by the failed bank. Coverage reaches out to trust accounts and [Individual Retirement Accounts](/ira) (IRAs) too, yet just to the parts that fit the type of accounts listed already.

Products not protected by FDIC insurance incorporate [mutual funds](/mutualfund), annuities, life insurance policies, stocks, and bonds, as well as the items in safe-deposit boxes.

## Benefits of Risk-Based Deposit Insurance
