In the picture over, the flagpole addresses the previous trend higher, the period of consolidation forms a pennant pattern, and traders watch for a breakout from the upper trend line of the [symmetrical triangle](/symmetricaltriangle).

Numerous traders hope to enter new [long](/long) or [short positions](/short) following a breakout from the pennant chart pattern.
