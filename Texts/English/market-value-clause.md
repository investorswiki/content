# Market Value Clause
## What Is Market Value Clause?

A market value clause is a [insurance](/insurance) policy clause by which the insurer must repay the insured the [market price](/market-price) of the covered property instead of the [actual cash value](/genuine cash-value) or the [replacement value](/replacementcost) of the covered property.

## Understanding Market Value Clause

Market value clauses assign a market rate value to the property instead of putting together it with respect to the genuine or replacement cost. The dollar amount guaranteed to insured parties on account of a loss is a fundamental element of the insurance policy. Other than market value, the value can be set at the genuine cash value of the asset or its replacement cost. The calculation option utilized frequently relies upon the type of policy. Commonly one sees [market value](/marketvalue) clauses covering property whose value might vary after some time as opposed to fixed assets. Commodities are the assets most often associated with a market value clause.

The market value clause lays out the dollar amount a claimant can collect on an asset, setting it at the level one would receive on the [open market](/open-market). This might incorporate some profit. On account of commodities, for example, farm crops, the market value shifts from one crop to another, contingent upon its thoughtful.

For instance, a farmer chooses to purchase insurance that covers their corn crops from storm damage. The money spent establishing the corn amounts to $700,000, and the potential overall [profit](/profit) produced using the farmer selling the corn equals $800,000, netting the farmer $100,000 profit. At the point when a heavy tempest hits the district where the farmer develops the crops, the high breezes and rain obliterate a certain portion of the crops. On account of a market value clause, the farmer won't be repaid for that portion at the $700,000 valuation; rather the insurance company will repay the farmer for that portion at the $800,000 valuation.
