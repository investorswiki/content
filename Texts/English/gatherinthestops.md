# Gather In The Stops
## What is Gather In The Stops?

Gather in the stops is a trading strategy where investors endeavor to drive down the price of a stock by selling large amounts of stock to trigger [stop orders](/stoporder).

## Understanding Gather In The Stops

The practice of the gather in the stops strategy is to force stop orders into [market orders](/marketorder). A stop order is a standing order to purchase or sell stock once a laid out price is reached. When the price is reached, a market order finishes a sale at the current market price.

When the stop orders become market orders, the sales are completed at the current lower prices. This is otherwise called snowballing, or making a snowball effect, and it will go on until trading is suspended or investors pull back and stop the orders all alone.

Some [exchanges](/exchange) have policies in place to stop trading when this happens so that prices aren't falsely driven down, or driven down to extraordinary levels that might have catastrophic outcomes on the exchange. The practice isn't unlawful, which is the reason it is permitted partially. Be that as it may, the market settles on a decision on whether they will permit the activity to proceed with once the ball is moving.

There are many forms of strategies with regards to trading on the stock market, and not every one of them have epithets like gather in the stops does. Notwithstanding, every strategy is executed in light of a goal or accomplishment. To decide the best strategy to utilize, an investor must initially figure out what their ultimate objective is. In light of that they can decide, all alone or with a licensed broker, the best method for accomplishing that goal.

## An Example of a Stop Order

An illustration of a stop order would be on the off chance that ABC Inc was trading at $35 each. An investor, wishing to purchase shares of ABC Inc, sets up a stop order with their broker. They state that once ABC Inc shares arrive at their stop price of $30 per share, the investor might want to purchase up to 15 of the shares.

The broker will keep an eye on ABC Inc and when the price comes to the ideal $30 per share, the stop order will turn into a market order and the 15 accessible shares will be purchased in the interest of the investor at the market price of $30 per share or close to that level.

Envision now that the shares of ABC Inc don't drop down to $30 per share and on second thought climb consistently until they are drifting around $45 per share. The broker won't purchase these shares for their investor since they are not at the ideal price.
