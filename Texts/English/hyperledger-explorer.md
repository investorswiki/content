# Hyperledger Explorer
## What Is Hyperledger Explorer?

Hyperledger Explorer is an open source [blockchain](/blockchain) utility module that permits users to make an easy to use web-based application, with which a client can see, start, sort out or inquiry different relics and improvements that form a vital part of the blockchain network. It is to be utilized explicitly on arrangements of blockchains made utilizing the Hyperledger umbrella.

## Grasping Hyperledger Explorer

Hyperledger Explorer appeared as the [Hyperledger project](/hyperledger) has been reliably developing since its origin in 2016, and is currently being utilized and contributed to by in excess of 130 organizations across the globe, under the support of the [open source](/open-source) Linux Foundation. With such wide level versatility, there emerged a requirement for a simple to utilize, human-interpretable utility that offers a dashboard perspective on blockchain happenings. Accordingly emerged Hyperledger Explorer, which was initially contributed to by technology stalwarts like IBM and Intel, and by the leading financial sector clearing and settlement company DTCC. Every one of them initially developed their own variants of Explorer, and later merged their efforts to accomplish the common goal under the Hyperledger project.

Like the standard utilities of Windows Explorer and Task Manager, Hyperledger Explorer can be viewed as a simple method for utilizing a connection point that permits users to see the essential network information of the blockchain. It incorporates subtleties like name, state and rundown of network hubs, subtleties of [blocks](/block-bitcoin-block), transactions and related data, transaction families, chain codes, and whatever other pertinent subtleties that might be stored on the blockchain.

Since all such raw blockchain data is as a rule in a format that is challenging to peruse for people, Hyperledger Explorer endeavors to give a simple perception by utilizing diagrams, charts, pictures, and layouts, notwithstanding the typical hunt and monitoring facility.

## How Hyperledger Explorer Works

Its architecture remembers a web server that runs for the backend and is responsible for cooperating with any remaining parts and keeping up with the vital question server response. The web attachments are utilized to convey between the server and the different client parts of Hyperledger Explorer. A RethinkDB database is utilized to store the important insights concerning blockchain parts like information about blocks, transactions, and smart contracts, and this can be questioned for any essential information. A security vault deals with guaranteeing just secure and authorized access is kept up with for accessing the Hyperledger Explorer.

Hyperledger Explorer considers a unified endeavor level perception, which might be required in real-time by a blockchain designer fostering a particular feature or part on the blockchain, or by a specialist seeking to concentrate on verifiable turns of events, or by blockchain administrators who are responsible for dealing with the blockchain, or by top management.

The accompanying energized picture presents different features of how Hyperledger Explorer is designed and what it gives.

## Features
- Notwithstanding fundamental blockchain explorer usefulness, the device gives endeavor level perceptions that can help decision producers through instinctive diagrams, charts, and tables.
- Hyperledger Explorer is an easy to understand Web application device used to see or summon transactions, digital wallets, and other information stored in a Hyperledger blockchain sending.
- The explorer is a valuable device in finding and seeing in any case machine-decipherable data stored as encoded ledger passages.
