## History of Ginnie Mae

Thirty years after it was laid out, the Federal National Mortgage Association (FNMA), better known as Fannie Mae, had developed so large that it in 1968 it was split into two separate elements with two separate capabilities. Fannie Mae would purchase conventional loans, and Ginnie Mae would purchase government-backed mortgages, like FHA and VA (Veterans Administration) loans.

The genesis of Ginnie Mae can be followed back to the Great Depression, when generally high unemployment rates prompted an uncommon wave of loan defaults. At the point when the flood in home dispossessions further depressed housing values and the country's overall economy, Congress passed the National Housing Act of 1934, a key part of the [New Deal](/new-deal), which made the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) to assist with reviving the U.S. housing market and safeguard lenders from mortgage default. As a national mortgage loan insurance program, it gave greater incentive to banks, building and loan associations, and different institutions to make loans to ordinary A mericans.

At the point when the split occurred, Fannie Mae was changed over from a [government-sponsored enterprise ](/gse)(GSE) to a publicly traded company. Ginnie Mae was laid out as a GSE and remains so today as part of the Department of Housing and Urban development, or HUD. Right now, Ginnie Mae is the main home-loan agency unequivocally backed by the full faith and credit of the United States government.

## Special Considerations

As a government guaranteeing agency, there are a few things that Ginnie Mae doesn't do. As indicated over, the agency starts no loans itself and gives no financing to mortgage issuers. The GNMA likewise gives no insurance to lenders against any credit risks that stem from borrowers. Besides, Ginnie Mae sets no standards for loan issuers, for example, underwriting or credit standards.

## Ginnie Mae versus the Other Maes and Freddie Mac

There are several organizations that are like Ginnie Mae, quite its cousins [Freddie Mac](/freddiemac), Fannie Mae, and Sallie Mae. Like Ginnie Mae, Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae include mortgage and home loans, while Sallie Mae deals basically with education loans. The key difference between Ginnie Mae and the others is that Ginnie Mae is a federally owned corporation. Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae are [government-sponsored enterprises](/gse) (GSEs) or federally chartered corporations that are owned by private shareholders. Sallie Mae used to be a GSE however is currently a privately held corporation following its privatization in 2004.

Where Ginnie Mae guarantees just securities that include mortgages guaranteed by federal agencies, for example, the FHA and VA, its family members might back securities whose mortgages are not insured by those federal bodies. Fannie Mae likewise has its own [portfolio](/portfolio), ordinarily alluded to as a retained portfolio, which puts resources into its own and other institutions' mortgage-backed securities.

The GNMA is additionally apparently the main Mae or Mac backed by the full faith and credit of the federal government. Be that as it may, In the last half of 2008, during the [housing crisis](/housing_bubble), Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac were taken over by the government by means of a [conservatorship](/conservatorship) of the Federal Housing Finance Committee. Both were rescued as much as $190 billion starting around 2019, which saved them from collapse. Some contend that the [bailout](/bailout) everything except eradicated Ginnie Mae's qualification as the main federal agency guaranteeing mortgage securities that appreciate government protection against failure.
