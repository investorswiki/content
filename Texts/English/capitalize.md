# Capitalize
## What Is Capitalize?

To capitalize is to record a cost or expense on the [balance sheet](/balancesheet) for the reasons for postponing full recognition of the expense. As a rule, capitalizing expenses is beneficial as companies getting new assets with long-term lifespans can amortize or devalue the costs. This cycle is known as [capitalization](/capitalization).

Capitalization may likewise allude to the concept of changing over some thought into a business or investment. In finance, capitalization is a quantitative assessment of a company's capital structure. At the point when utilized along these lines, it some of the time likewise means to monetize.

## Understanding How to Capitalize

One of the main principles of accounting is the matching principle. The matching principle states that expenses ought to be recorded for the period incurred paying little heed to when payment (e.g., cash) is made. Perceiving expenses in the period incurred permits businesses to distinguish amounts spent to produce revenue. For assets that are quickly consumed, this interaction is simple and reasonable.

In any case, large assets that give a future economic benefit present a different opportunity. For instance, a company purchases a delivery truck for daily operations. The truck is expected to offer some benefit over a period of 12 years. Rather than expensing the whole cost of the truck while purchased, accounting rules permit companies to discount the cost of the asset over its [useful life](/usefullife) (12 years).

All in all, the asset is written off as it is utilized. Most companies have an asset threshold, where assets valued over a certain amount are automatically treated as a capitalized asset.

## Benefits of Capitalization

Capitalizing assets has many benefits. Since long-term assets are costly, expensing the cost over future periods decreases huge variances in income, particularly for small firms. Numerous lenders expect companies to keep a specific [debt-to-equity ratio](/debtequityratio). Assuming large long-term assets were expensed right away, it could compromise the required ratio for existing loans or could keep firms from getting new loans.

Likewise, capitalizing expenses builds a company's asset balance without influencing its liability balance. Therefore, numerous financial ratios will seem ideal. Regardless of this benefit, it ought not be the motivation for capitalizing an expense.

## Depreciation

The most common way of discounting an asset over its valuable life is alluded to as [depreciation](/depreciation), which is utilized for fixed assets, like equipment. [Amortization](/amortization) is utilized for elusive assets, like intellectual property. Depreciation deducts a certain value from the asset consistently until the full value of the asset is written off the balance sheet.

### Income Statement

Depreciation is an expense recorded on the [income statement](/incomestatement); it isn't to be mistaken for "[accumulated depreciation](/accumulated-depreciation)," which is a balance sheet contra account. The income statement depreciation expense is the amount of depreciation expensed for the period indicated on the income statement.

The accumulated depreciation balance sheet contra account is the cumulative total of depreciation expense recorded on the income statements from the asset's securing until the time indicated on the balance sheet.

### Leased Equipment

For leased equipment, capitalization is the conversion of a working lease to a capital lease by characterizing the leased asset as a purchased asset, which is recorded on the balance sheet as part of the company's assets. The value of the asset that will be assigned is either its fair market value or the current value of the lease payments, whichever is less. Likewise, the amount of principal owed is recorded as a liability on the balance sheet.

## Market Capitalization

One more part of capitalization alludes to the company's capital structure. Capitalization can allude to the [book value](/bookvalue) of capital, which is the sum of a company's long-term debt, stock, and [retained earnings](/retainedearnings), which addresses a cumulative savings of profit or [net income](/netincome).

The alternative to the book value is market value. The market value of capital relies upon the price of the company's stock. It is calculated by duplicating the price of the company's stock by the number of [equity](/equity) shares outstanding in the market. If the total number of [shares outstanding](/outstandingshares) is 1 billion, and the stock is currently priced at $10, the market capitalization is $10 billion.

Companies with a high market capitalization are alluded to as large covers; companies with medium market capitalization are alluded to as mid-covers, while companies with small capitalization are alluded to as small covers.

It is feasible to be overcapitalized or [undercapitalized](/undercapitalization). Overcapitalization happens when earnings are sufficiently not to cover the [cost of capital](/costofcapital), like interest payments to bondholders, or dividend payments to shareholders. [Dividends](/dividend) are cash payments made to shareholders by companies. Undercapitalization happens when there's no requirement for outside capital since profits are high and earnings were underrated.

## Capitalized Cost versus Expense

While attempting to observe what a capitalized cost is, it's first important to make the differentiation between what is defined as a cost and an expense in the world of accounting. A cost on any transaction is the amount of money utilized in exchange for an asset.

A company buying a forklift would mark such a purchase as a cost. An expense is a monetary value leaving the company; this would incorporate something like paying the power bill or rent on a building.
