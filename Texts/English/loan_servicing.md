## What Is Loan Servicing?

Loan servicing alludes to the administrative parts of a loan from the time the proceeds are spread to the borrower until the loan is paid off. Loan servicing incorporates sending regularly scheduled payment statements, gathering regularly scheduled payments, keeping up with records of payments and balances, gathering and paying taxes and insurance (and overseeing escrow funds), dispatching funds to the [note holder](/bondholder), and circling back to any [delinquencies](/delinquent).

## How Loan Servicing Works

Loan servicing can be carried out by the bank or financial institution that issued the loans, a non-bank entity specializing in loan servicing, or a third-party vendor for the lending institution. Loan servicing may likewise allude to the borrower's obligation to make convenient payments of principal and interest on a loan as a method for keeping up with creditworthiness with lenders and credit score agencies.

Loan servicing was generally viewed as a core function held inside banks. Banks issued the original loan, so it appeared to be legit that they would be responsible for dealing with the administration of the loan. That was, of course, before boundless [securitization](/securitization) of loans changed the idea of banking and finance overall. When loans — and mortgages in particular — were repackaged into securities and sold off a bank's books, the servicing of the loans proved to be a less productive business line than the origination of new loans.

So the loan servicing part of the loan life cycle was isolated from origination and opened up to the market. Given the record-keeping burden of loan servicing and the improving on propensities and expectations of borrowers, the industry has become especially dependent on technology and software.

## Loan Servicing Example

Loan servicing is presently an industry all by itself. Loan servicers are compensated by holding a moderately small percentage of the outstanding balance, known as the servicing fee or servicing strip. This fee generally amounts to 0.25 to 0.5 percentage points of each [periodic loan payment](/repayment).

For instance, assuming the month to month mortgage payments are $2,000 and the servicing fee is 0.25%, the servicer is qualified for hold $5 — or (0.0025 x 2,000) — of every payment before passing the excess amount to the note holder.

## Special Considerations

Starting around 2018, just three companies were responsible for gathering payments on 93% of outstanding government-owned student loans amounting to $950 billion from around 30 million borrowers.

In the mean time, the trend among big mortgage loan servicers is to gradually move in an opposite direction from the marketplace in response to developing regulatory worries. In their place, smaller, regional banks, and non-bank servicers are moving into the space.

In the interim, some loan servicers have embraced technology to try to reduce [compliance costs](/compliance-cost) and there has likewise been a pull together by a banks on servicing their own loan portfolio to keep the association with their retail clients.
