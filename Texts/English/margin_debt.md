# Margin Debt
## What Is Margin Debt?

Margin debt will be debt a brokerage customer takes on by [trading on margin](/buying-on-margin). While purchasing securities through a broker, investors have the option of utilizing a cash account and covering the whole cost of the actual investment, or utilizing a [margin account](/marginaccount) — meaning they borrow part of the initial capital from their broker. The portion the investors borrow is known as margin debt, while the portion they fund themselves is the margin, or equity.

## How Margin Debt Works

Margin debt can be utilized while borrowing a security to [short sell](/shortselling), as opposed to borrowing money with which to buy a security. For instance, envision an investor needs to buy 1,000 shares of Johnson and Johnson (JNJ) for $100 per share. She would rather not put down the whole $100,000 right now, however the Federal Reserve Board's [Regulation T](/regulationt) limits her broker to lending her half of the initial investment — additionally called the initial margin.

Brokerages frequently have their own rules with respect to buying on margin, which might be more severe than regulators. She deposits $50,000 in [initial margin](/initialmargin) while assuming $50,000 in margin debt. The 1,000 shares of Johnson and Johnson she then, at that point, purchases act as collateral for this loan.

## Benefits and Disadvantages of Margin Debt
### Drawbacks

Two scenarios show the possible risks and rewards of assuming margin debt. In the first, Johnson and Johnson's price drops to $60. Sheila's margin debt stays at $50,000, yet her equity has dropped to $10,000. The value of the stock (1,000 \u00d7 $60 = $60,000) minus her margin debt. The [Financial Industry Regulation Authority](/finra) (FINRA) and the exchanges have a [maintenance margin](/maintenancemargin) requirement of 25%, implying that customers' equity must be over that ratio in margin accounts.

Falling below the maintenance margin requirement sets off a [margin call](/margincall) except if Sheila deposits $5,000 in cash to bring her margin up to 25% of the securities' $60,000 value, the broker is qualified for sell her stock (without telling her) until her account consents to the rules. This is known as a margin call. In this case, as per FINRA, the broker would liquidate $20,000 worth of stock as opposed to the $4,000 that may be expected ($10,000 + $4,000 is 25% of $60,000 - $4,000). This is due to the manner in which margin rules operate.

### Benefits

A subsequent scenario exhibits the possible rewards of trading on margin. Say that, in the model above, Johnson and Johnson's share price ascends to $150. Sheila's 1,000 shares are presently worth $150,000, with $50,000 of that being margin debt and $100,000 equity. In the event that Sheila sells commission-and expense free, she gets $100,000 in the wake of repaying her broker. Her [return on investment](/returnoninvestment) (ROI) is equivalent to 100%, or the $150,000 from the sale less the $50,000 not exactly the $50,000 initial investment separated by the initial $50,000 investment.

Presently we should expect that Sheila had purchased the stock utilizing a cash account, implying that she funded the whole initial investment of $100,000, so she doesn't have to repay her broker in the wake of selling. Her ROI in this scenario is equivalent to half, or the $150,000 not exactly the $100,000 initial investment separated by the $100,000 initial investment.

In the two cases, her profit was $50,000, yet in the margin account scenario, she brought in that money involving half as her very own lot capital as in the cash account scenario. The capital she's freed up by trading on margin can go towards different investments. These scenarios delineate the essential compromise engaged with taking on leverage: the potential gains are greater, just like the risks.
