# Joseph Effect
## What Is the Joseph Effect?

The Joseph Effect is a term derived from the Old Testament story about the Pharaoh's dream as related by Joseph. The vision drove the old Egyptians to expect a crop starvation enduring seven years to follow seven years of a plentiful harvest.

## Understanding the Joseph Effect

The Joseph Effect is a term instituted by mathematician Benoit Mandelbrot and hypothesizes that developments over the long run will generally be part of bigger trends and [cycles](/market_cycles) more frequently than being random. Mandelbrot drew his hypotheses from the Old Testament story of Joseph relating the Pharaoh's dream of seven fat cows being eaten up by seven lean cows. The interpretation was that following seven great long periods of crop harvesting, seven awful years would follow.

Seven great years are known as the Joseph Effect, while the seven terrible years are known as The Noah Effect. Strangely, the seven-year cycle is usually found in modern economic analysis as a predictor of [recession](/recession) timing.

The Joseph Effect and the Noah Effect are early models taken from history showing that man was sensitive to cycles in nature and wanted to turn out to be better able to foresee future results from recent experience. Human behavior is impacted by and large by recent experience, with a propensity to fail to remember a portion of the more random, and disruptive, illustrations of the far off past.

Mathematicians set out to evaluate these noticed cycles into predictable recipes, and Mandelbrot measured The Joseph Effect utilizing the Hurst part. The Hurst part evaluates [regression toward the mean](/meanreversion) over the long run for quite a few price developments.

At the core of each term is the thought that trends will generally persevere after some time. On the off chance that an area of the world has been in a dry spell, the chances are high it will stay in dry season for quite a while to come. A ball club that has been dominating recent matches is probably going to win. In the event that a stock price has been rising consistently, the probability of this continuing is. Technical analysts use trend lines to show this persistence principle.

## The Joseph Effect and Leading Indicators

The Joseph Effect and the Noah Effect are just two of numerous mathematical trend examinations utilized by wise investors. For instance, chart analysis is an important device in foreseeing future stock price developments. Investors see volume trends, price ranges, momentum indicators, leading indicators, and lagging indicators.

Leading indicators and lagging indicators are particularly important to characterize and comprehend. Normally utilized leading indicators incorporate the [Consumer Confidence Index](/cci), the [Purchasing Managers Index](/pmi), and developments in bond yields, particularly when a [inverted yield](/invertedyieldcurve) happens. Corporate hiring plans are likewise a critical leading indicator.
