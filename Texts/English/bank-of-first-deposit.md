## What Is a Bank of First Deposit (BOFD)?

A bank of first deposit (BOFD) is a bank at which an individual initial deposits a check into their account. In the event that the issuer of the check in like manner banks at exactly the same financial institution, clearing the check is known as a ["on-us" item](/on-us-thing).

At the point when a depositor draws a check from the very institution that composed the check, this transaction is called an "on-us" thing, where the depositor can promptly cash the check or deposit it into any account he holds at that specific bank. Moreover, on-us things can manifest as electronic debits or transfers.

Let us expect that an individual deposits their paycheck into his retail bank, which is named Bank A, and that his employer moreover executes with Bank A. In this scenario, the money basically moves starting with one account then onto the next, all under a similar rooftop, which makes for a swifter clearing process.

Contrarily, in the event that a worker conducts his business at Bank A, yet his employer works through Bank B, the check consequently must go through a private clearinghouse or one more outside institution. This perpetually defers the cycle for a check to go through, consequently, an individual must stand by longer to access or clear the deposit on his well deserved cash.

Normally, for the principal scenario to work, the employer's account, which is alluded to as the "drawing account," must contain an adequate balance to cover the paycheck cut to an employee. Generally talking, on-us things benefit banks, who ordinarily earn revenue from both the gaining and giving gatherings, with these transactions.

During the 1940s, the introduction of routing numbers to the bottoms of checks assisted banks of first deposit with working with a developing volume of transactions. This nine-digit mathematical code recognizes the banks and other financial institutions that cycle checks. Specifically, the initial four digits of any routing code assign the Federal Reserve Bank situated in the district where the BOFD is found. The next four digits mean the specific financial institution. At long last, the last digit arranges the check.
