# Asset Ledger
## What Is An Asset Ledger?

The asset ledger is the portion of a company's accounting records that subtleties the [journal](/journal) passages relating just to the [asset](/asset) section of the [balance sheet](/balancesheet). Asset ledgers will have numerous [sub-accounts](/sub-account). The larger the company, the more various and complex the asset ledgers will be.

## Grasping the Asset Ledger

At the point when a business embraces any transaction, it will record a journal entry for the two sides of the transaction. Instances of run of the mill business transactions incorporate purchasing goods from providers, making sales to customers, and purchasing machinery and equipment to utilized in fabricate.

The two parts to a journal entry are called [debit](/debit) and credit. For asset accounts, a debit builds the account while a credit diminishes the account. This is stood out from [liability](/liability) and [equity](/equity) accounts, in which a credit expands the account and a debit diminishes it.

Basically, the asset ledger is the log of passages influencing asset accounts from all recorded journal sections. Current assets are separated from [long-term assets](/longtermassets), and the part accounts of current and long-term assets are broken down. The sub-accounts to the asset ledger can be broad. Types of [fixed assets](/fixedasset), for instance, would be arranged into specific [property, plant, and equipment](/ppe) (PP&E) categories and itemized individually.

The asset ledger is one of numerous subsidiary ledgers that feed into a company's [general ledger](/generalledger). The data contained in the overall ledger is utilized to build the company's financial statements, including the [income statement](/incomestatement), balance sheet, and [cash flow statement](/cashflowstatement). The overall ledger is viewed as a company's "official accounting record." Consolidated data from the asset ledger appears in the asset section at the highest point of the balance sheet.

## Instances of an Asset Ledger

Utilizing our models from a higher place, we should investigate how this data would appear in an asset ledger.

### Purchasing Goods From Suppliers

While purchasing goods from a provider, a company would debit supplies (or inventory) and credit the cash account. This journal entry includes two asset accounts. The supplies account would be increased, and the cash account would be diminished. The sums in this specific transaction will build with sums from different transactions to work out the supplies and cash account sums toward the finish of a [fiscal](/fiscalyear) period.

### Making Sales to Customers

While making sales to customers, a company might offer a decent or service on credit. In this case, at the hour of sale, the journal entry would incorporate a debit to accounts [receivable](/receivables) (AR) and a credit to sales revenue. This journal entry includes just a single asset account, AR, since sales revenue is an equity account. At the point when the customer takes care of their balance, the AR account will be credited (diminished) and the cash account will be debited (increased).

### Purchasing Machinery to Be Used in Manufacturing

In the event that a company purchases machinery, it will record the transaction as a debit to machinery (a fixed asset account) and a credit to the cash account. This journal entry includes two asset accounts. Machinery would be increased, and cash would be diminished.

We should accept these transactions occurred during an accounting period. The company made $250,000 in credit sales on 1/1, purchased $10,000 in supplies on 1/15, and purchased a $100,000 piece of machinery on 1/31. The customers paid their outstanding AR balance on 1/11. With just this accessible data, the asset ledger would appear as does below.

## Asset Ledger versus Asset Section of the Balance Sheet

Asset ledgers are internal records for a company; consequently, they are not uncovered publicly. For public companies administered by the [Securities and Exchange Commission](/sec) (SEC), financial statements are accessible to the public. The balance sheet of a company will organize current and long-term assets, yet the individual transaction data won't be accessible as it would be in an asset ledger.

Honeywell International (HON) listed the accompanying assets on its consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2019:

- Current assets
- Endlessly cash reciprocals
- Short-term investments
- Net receivables
- Inventories
- Other current assets
- Noncurrent assets
- Property, plant, and equipment
- Investments and long-term receivables
- Altruism
- Theoretical assets
- Other long-term assets

By and large, a few extra subtleties might be given in a company's [notes to financial statements](/reference), however the specifics of individual business transactions are stayed with in records by the. The transaction subtleties are contained in specific asset accounts, which are then used to "build up" the asset details that you see on a balance sheet.

Both [internal auditors](/internalauditor) and [independent auditors](/independentauditor) may survey these and different ledgers to check for completeness and precision to ensure the course of financial statement gathering is sound.
