# Inside Days
## What Are Inside Days?

Inside days allude to a [candlestick](/candlestick) pattern that forms after a security has encountered daily price ranges inside the previous day's high-low reach. That is, the price of the security has traded "inside" the upper and lower limits of the previous trading session. It might likewise be known as "inside bars." Inside days might demonstrate [consolidation](/consolidation) or lower price volatility.

Inside days might be stood out from [outside days](/outside-days), in which daily's candlestick chart surpasses the limits of a prior day's high and low.

## Figuring out Inside Days

A candlestick chart is a well known approach to outwardly portraying the [intraday](/intraday) trading activity of an asset over the long haul. A vertical line denotes the day's high and low points (known as the "wick" of the candle), while the thicker "body" of the candle demonstrates the security's open and closing price for the trading day. An inside day happens when the candlestick of one trading day's high and low falls inside the limits of the prior day or days' highs and lows.

Inside days can be indicative of uncertainty in the market for a security, showing little price movement relative to the previous trading days. Nonetheless, when several inside days happen successively, there is a higher likelihood that the stock will before long break out of its trading range, as a persistently diminishing price range is unreasonable. How it breaks out, however, can't be determined exclusively by candlesticks appearing inside days. The pattern of inside days must be combined with another technical analysis instrument to assist with anticipating whether the break is to the upside or downside.

Trading with technical instruments like candlesticks is a highly specific practice and subsequently, must be done carefully. Spotting inside days is of interest to a trader since he might accept that the subject security is setting up for a drop up or down of some kind. The application of another technical device could give them adequate confidence to place a bet on an expected pending move in the security price.

## Instances of Inside Days

For instance, a [ascending triangle](/ascendingtriangle) chart pattern, combined with inside days, may predict a bullish movement in the stock; on the other hand, a descending triangle is generally a bearish signal. Other common pairings with inside days as a short-term trading strategy are the [relative strength index](/rsi) (RSI), [moving average convergence divergence](/macd) (MACD), and [simple moving averages ](/sma)(SMA).

One more set is the [three inside up and three inside down](/three-inside-updown). These are three-candle [reversal](/reversal) patterns, with the bullish version made out of a large down candle, a smaller up candle held inside the prior candle, and afterward one more up candle that closes over the close of the subsequent candle. The bearish reversal is made out of a large up candle, a smaller down candle held inside the prior candle, then, at that point, one more down candle that closes below the close of the subsequent candle.

## Highlights

- Frequently signaling some consolidation, series of inside days can set up indicators for trend reversals in technical analysis.
- The inside pattern shows a smaller trading range comparable to previous days' intraday trading ranges.
