# Business and Personal Property Coverage Form (BPPCF)
## What Is the Business and Personal Property Coverage Form (BPPCF)?

The business and personal property coverage form (BPPCF) is a form that characterizes the part of a commercial insurance policy that safeguards against accidental damage to owned structures, owned business [personal property](/personalproperty) and non-owned business personal property.

## Understanding the Business and Personal Property Coverage Form (BPPCF)

Most business and personal property coverage forms (BPPCF) safeguard against all categories of peril, fundamental reasons for loss, broad reasons for loss and special reasons for loss. That means the BPPCF ordinarily covers basically all perils with the exception of those explicitly excluded on the special reasons for loss form. Policies ordinarily bar flood, war, wear and seismic tremor from coverage.

Owned structures incorporate structures declared in the policy as well as permanent fixtures and improvements to those structures. Owned business personal property incorporates property having a place with the insured. Non-owned business personal property incorporates permanent improvements the insured has made to leased property as well as personal property having a place with another party however in the custody of the insured.

Insurance policies might extend BPPCFs through [endorsements](/underwriting). For instance, BPPCF may, through supports, safeguard against seismic tremor and radioactive defilement and stretch out coverage to personal effects, papers and records and off-premises property on a location not owned by the insured. Supports may likewise increase the coverage limits for things like open air property and trees.

Many individuals use SCLP and BPPCF conversely, as the BPPCF is the most unmistakable part of a SCLP policy.
