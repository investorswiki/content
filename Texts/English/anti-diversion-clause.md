# Anti-Diversion Clause

The anti-diversion clause is a U.S. government regulation that prohibits exported goods from being delivered to unapproved objections. The Bureau of Industry and Security under the Department of Commerce requires industrially exported goods to be joined by an objective control statement. This document states that the goods are just authorized for export to certain areas and that U.S. law prohibits their diversion. The last option part of this statement is the anti-diversion clause.

In practice, you might see "anti-diversion" abbreviated to "diversion."

## Grasping the Anti-Diversion Clause

The objective control statement and anti-diversion clause must show up on the invoice and ocean bill of lading or [air waybill](/airway-bill) that accompanies the exported goods. The statement ensures that to the best of the transporter's information, the shipment is gone to its stated objective. National security, peace settlements and foreign policy are a portion of the justifications for why a government might be concerned with controlling its exports. In the U.S., most exports of things on the Commerce Control List must contain an objective control statement.

Diversion happens when products are sold in unauthorized spots. These limitations could be for a number of reasons, including sanctions, trade issues and consumer safety concerns. At the point when concerns emerge, certain categories of goods are distinguished as those probably going to be unlawfully redirected to a restricted country. The [bill of lading](/billoflading) or different documents of such products will display official phrasing (called the objective control statement) that the license of the exporter isn't legitimate with the exception of indicated recipients of the goods.

Anti-diversion stresses are a fairly standard concern for companies exporting domestic goods.
