# Reciprocal Currency
## What Is a Reciprocal Currency?

In the [foreign exchange (forex) market](/foreign-exchange-markets), a reciprocal currency depicts a situation where a currency pair includes the U.S. dollar (USD), however the USD isn't the [base currency](/basecurrency); all things considered, it is the [quote currency](/quotecurrency) (otherwise called the counter currency).

A reciprocal currency is in this way quoted in terms of U.S. dollars per unit of foreign currency rather than units of currency per dollar. A common model would be the [EUR/USD](/eur-usd-euro-us-dollar-currency-pair) currency pairs, where a quote of 1.20 would mean that one euro buys $1.20 U.S. dollars.

## Figuring out Reciprocal Currencies

The majority of USD currency pairs feature the U.S. dollar as the base currency, which shows up first in a FX quote. For instance, the USD/JPY (dollar versus the [Japanese yen](/jpy-japanese-yen)) or the USD/CAD (dollar versus the [Canadian dollar](/cad-canadian-dollar)).

In such a quote, it would let you know the number of units of a foreign currency one U.S. dollar could buy. For example, if the quote for Israeli Shekels (USD/ILS) is 3.25, one dollar buys 3.25 shekels.

In any case, reciprocal currencies are rather quoted in what's commonly alluded to as "European" terms, meaning the currency other than the U.S. dollar is the base currency.

"Reciprocal currency" in this way depicts currency pairs utilized in the foreign exchange market where the U.S. dollar (USD) and another currency are paired, however the USD isn't the primary currency quoted.

> A [direct quote](/directquote) is a currency pair quote where the foreign currency is communicated in per-unit terms of the domestic currency. For U.S. people or firms, a reciprocal currency would be a direct quote convention. A [indirect quote](/indirectquote) would on the other hand show up as the contrary articulation.

Major currency pairs that include the USD, yet where the USD isn't the base currency, incorporate EUR/USD (euro to U.S. dollar); GBP/USD (British pound to U.S. dollar); and AUD/USD (Australian dollar to U.S. dollar).

## Illustration of Reciprocal Currency

An illustration of a reciprocal currency would be the quotes for the NZD/USD. This currency pair has the [New Zealand dollar](/nzd-new-zealand-dollar) as its base currency and the U.S. dollar as its quote currency.

All in all, one would quote the [exchange rate](/exchangerate) of NZD/USD as the New Zealand dollar versus the U.S. dollar. So if the NZD/USD quote is 0.70, it means that you can exchange one NZD for seventy pennies, U.S.

> The highest traded currencies in the world are the U.S. dollar, euro, Japanese yen, pound sterling, and Australian dollar.

The EUR/USD exchange rate is likewise communicated in dollar terms, even however the [euro](/euro) is listed as the base currency. For instance, the EUR/USD rate may be $1.15 to 1 euro, yet while citing the rate, a trader would agree that the euro/U.S. rate is $1.15.

## The Bottom Line

A reciprocal currency in foreign exchange trading is a currency pair where the USD isn't the base currency yet rather the counter currency. It is quoted in terms of U.S. dollars per unit of foreign currency. Reciprocal currencies are a large part of FX trading globally, with common reciprocal currencies being EUR/USD, GBP/USD, and AUD/USD.
