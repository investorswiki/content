# Auditing Standards Board (ASB)
## What Is the Auditing Standards Board (ASB)?

The Auditing Standards Board (ASB) issues rules and rule declarations that [certified public accountants](/cpa) (CPAs) must comply to in audits and [attestations](/attestation).

Part of the [American Institute of Certified Public Accountants](/american-foundation of-certified-public-accountants) (AIPCA), the Auditing Standards Board's (ASB) mission is to serve the public interest by creating, refreshing, and imparting thorough standards and practice guidance for CPAs. A set of principles, known as [generally accepted auditing standards](/gaas) (GAAS), are planned, reconsidered, and deciphered by the ASB to guarantee that CPA practitioners give superior grade, objective audit and attestation services to nonissuers in an effective and efficient way.

## Understanding the Auditing Standards Board (ASB)

The Auditing Standards Board (ASB) is a senior technical committee of the AIPCA, the preeminent professional organization of CPAs in the United States. The AIPCA, which has issued guidance to [accountants](/bookkeeper) and auditors beginning around 1927, made the Auditing Standards Board's (ASB) in 1978 to supplant previous technical committees, making it the highest authority in laying out auditing standards in the U.S.

The ASB is responsible for auditing, attestation, quality control, reporting, and performance monitoring. It exists to work on existing — and empower new — [audit](/audit) and attestation services, laying out the rules that accountants — professionals responsible for keeping or assessing [financial accounts](/financial-account) — should comply with.

Up until the mid 21^st^ century, the Auditing Standards Board (ASB) was the chief authority of the GAAS. The hierarchy was then altered, following the presentation of [the Sarbanes-Oxley (SOX) Act of 2002](/sarbanesoxleyact). That particular piece of legislation (which was passed to shield investors from fraudulent financial reporting by corporations), put the Auditing Standards Board (ASB) in control of standards and guidance to CPAs for non-[public company](/publiccompany) audits.

The recently made [Public Company Accounting Oversight Board ](/pcaob)(PCAOB), along with the [Securities Exchange Commission](/sec) (SEC), in the interim, were given last authority over the auditing practices of public companies that trade on the stock market.
