# Dark Wallet
## What Was Dark Wallet?

Dark Wallet was an early endeavor to work on the obscurity of [Bitcoin](/bitcoin) transactions. As of December 2020, it seemed the Dark Wallet site could never again be reached through standard web crawlers or the [dark web](/dark-web). Cody Wilson and Amir Taaki made Dark Wallet. It was a digital wallet that enhanced [data anonymization](/data-anonymization) by jumbling Bitcoin transactions. Dark Wallet was additionally some of the time alluded to as DarkWallet or Darkwallet.

Despite the fact that it was never truly completed, Dark Wallet propelled numerous later obscurity projects. Samourai Wallet and Electrum on Tails offer a considerable lot of the obscurity benefits for Bitcoin users that Dark Wallet once guaranteed. In any case, other [cryptocurrencies](/cryptocurrency) have since outperformed Bitcoin for namelessness. [Monero](/monero) has a considerable lot of the features of Dark Wallet incorporated into the cryptocurrency. [ZCash](/zcash) adopts an alternate strategy, but at the same time is viewed as a fantastic decision for secrecy.

## How Dark Wallet Worked

Dark Wallet was an underground site that required programming to be introduced in either the Chrome or Firefox browser. When the means for establishment were complete, another digital wallet was made with a wallet seed or key — a secret word expected to access the wallet. The wallet came outfitted with three pockets — spending, business, and reserve funds — and with no restriction to the number of client made pockets. Each pocket had its own stealth address from which bitcoin transactions could be made.

Dark Wallet offered obscurity and privacy to its users in two ways: [stealth addresses](/stealth-address-cryptocurrency) and coin blending.

### Stealth Addresses

A client getting payment from a transaction utilizing the Dark Wallet application had another address produced for the funds to be deposited. By encoding the transaction, not even the payer had the option to pull up or follow the payee's address. Above all, the payment was hidden from unsolicited gatherings attempting to investigate the two users' transaction accounts.

### Coin Mixing (or CoinJoin)

This feature decreased traceability by blending or joining a client's transaction in with those of random users who turned out to make transactions simultaneously. In the event that the coins were gotten together with enough Bitcoin users in the system, following transactions from the ledger would end up being testing. Consider the accompanying transactions made simultaneously. A purchases a thing from B, C purchases a thing from D, and E purchases a thing from F. The general blockchain ledger, in the entirety of its transparency, would record three transactions for each address.

Dark Wallet, in any case, just recorded one single transaction by consolidating them. The ledger would show that bitcoins were paid from the addresses of A, C, and E to those of B, D, and F. By covering the arrangements made by all gatherings, a tracker can't decide with certainty who sent bitcoins to whom.

Coin blending is likewise done when a client is transferring coins starting with one of his pockets then onto the next. Wilson and Taaki communicated interest in expanding the number of users whose transactions could go along with one of these pools. Expansion of coin blending was viewed as one of the most clear ways to increased obscurity in cryptocurrency trading. Monero eventually sought after this strategy.

> Despite the fact that coin blending and stealth addresses increase secrecy, they don't give perfect privacy. Decided enemies with adequate resources can frequently trace back transactions.

## Worries About Dark Wallet

Pundits were concerned that Dark Wallet would make the way for some criminal operations, including fear based oppressor funding, [money laundering](/moneylaundering), drug dealing, and child sexual entertainment. In any case, real businesses careful about surveillance and data hacks invited Dark Wallet as a device for dealing with developing issues encompassing data privacy and secrecy.

## Fate of Dark Wallet

The main alpha adaptation of Dark Wallet was delivered in May 2014, and the platform went through several updates before an eighth alpha rendition turned out in January 2015. There have been no further updates, and the project doesn't appear to be a work in progress any longer. Be that as it may, numerous comparative privacy-centered wallets and cryptographic forms of money arose before very long.

## Features
- Dark Wallet included stealth addresses and coin blending, which became features of different wallets and cryptographic forms of money.
- Later projects, like Samourai Wallet and Monero, were propelled by Dark Wallet.
- Dark Wallet was an early endeavor to work on the secrecy of Bitcoin transactions.
