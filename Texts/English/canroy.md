# Canadian Royalty Trust (CanRoy)
## What Is a Canadian Royalty Trust (CanRoy)?

A Canadian Royalty Trust-likewise called a CanRoy trust-is an oil, gas or mineral company that is organized as a [trust](/trust) as opposed to as a traditional [corporation](/corporation). These companies are domiciled in Canada.

## How Canadian Royalty Trusts Work

Putting resources into a CanRoy permits an investor to gain indirect exposure to the energy industry without having direct exposure to individual companies in the industry. CanRoy trusts will generally be invested in more established mines and wells. This means that the productivity of these assets is on the decline, so [income](/income) from the trust declines over the long haul except if more assets are purchased. CanRoys physically operate no oil, gas or mineral tasks; these activities are run by outside parties with direct interests.

Since the primary draw of a CanRoy trust is that it pays a high dividend, investors can experience higher [volatility](/volatility) and risk when [interest rates](/interestrate) or oil prices change. Investors are drawn to these investments in view of the income they give, so the quality and stability of that income is an important factor in the unit price. CanRoy trusts were initially not taxed at the corporate tax rate, yet the Canadian government's tax policy has developed so presently some CanRoy trusts pay corporate taxes.

Since CanRoy trusts have various designs, the IRS treats their distributions in an unexpected way. As a rule, the IRS groups a CanRoy trust as a consistently operating company and deals with their distributions like dividends. Some of the time they are treated as partnerships and investors receive a [Schedule K-1](/schedule-k-1) statement every year.

At times, CanRoy trusts have an ownership twist. While certain trusts are structured unbounded on non-Canadian ownership, others have structured their trust indenture with the goal that non-Canadian ownership is capped at a predetermined level. Assuming that level is at any point surpassed, the company can force non-Canadian owners to sell their units.

## Energy Trusts

[Energy trusts](/energy-trust) are unexpected in Canada in comparison to they are in the U.S. Energy trusts in Canada can add new mineral properties to the trust, so the trust has an endless life as an actively-managed mineral investment fund. Energy trusts in the U.S. can't procure new properties so they have a fixed quantity of reserve assets that decline bit by bit as the minerals are mined and sold.

At last, U.S. energy trusts run out of mineral assets and become worthless. Energy trusts in the U.S. generally exist exclusively for the purpose of holding oil, gas and mineral rights. Energy trusts pay out the overwhelming majority of the profits they collect to their investors. Energy trusts are beneficial in the U.S. since they are exempt from corporate taxation in the event that they appropriate in excess of 90 percent of their earnings to investors. Along these lines, energy trusts are like real estate investment trusts, or [REITs](/reit).
