# Sales Draft
## What Is a Sales Draft?

A sales draft is a record demonstrating that a cardholder has completed a purchase. A sales draft is given toward the finish of a [transaction](/transaction) made by a payment card, for example, a credit card, it was handled to affirm that the transaction. It is a legally binding agreement between the cardholder and the organization that gave the great or service that the cardholder purchased.

## How a Sales Draft Works

At the point when a payment card is utilized in the purchase of a decent or service, the swipe of that card into a terminal sets off a series of digital processes intended to decide if the cardholder has the funds accessible to make the purchase. A card [acquirer](/acquirer) scrambles the cardholder's data and sends it to the card processor, which decodes this data, checks that the cardholder has adequate funds, and afterward sends a confirmation to the card terminal demonstrating that the transaction is legitimate. This whole cycle is regularly instantaneous.

When the card processor has approved a transaction the cardholder demonstrates that the sale is last by signing a receipt. The [receipt](/receipt) is customarily printed, yet for certain transactions, the receipt might be given electronically. The cardholder signs the physical receipt or electronic receipt recognizing that a decent or service has been purchased and that they vow to pay the amount indicated on the receipt. The receipt then fills in as a record of the transaction.

## Why a Sales Draft Is Retained After a Purchase Is Made

The sales draft contains specific data about the transaction, including the credit card number (regularly the last several digits to guarantee security), the transaction authorization number (TAN) given by the card processing company, the card's expiration date, the amount of sale, a description of what is purchased, and the signature of the cardholder.

Traders that issue the sales draft are required to keep a copy of the original marked paper for a specific period of time — normally several years — and will involve the receipt as a reference if a [chargeback](/chargeback) is made or on the other hand on the off chance that the cardholder questions the transaction.

In the event that a copy of a sales draft is mentioned to validate the transaction, there might be a retrieval fee charged by the credit card processor to the cardholder's responsible bank. That fee isn't part of a potential chargeback. Retrieval of a sales draft might happen in the event that the cardholder sees charges they don't perceive and need more data, assuming the cardholder is questioning charges to their account, or on the other hand on the off chance that the credit card issuer suspects fraud in light of the fact that the charge appears to be outside the standard purchase behavior of the cardholder.
