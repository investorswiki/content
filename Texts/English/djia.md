# Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA)
## What Is the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA)?
At the point when investors need to know how the stock market is doing, they go to stock indexes like the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA). Ordinarily known as "the Dow," it is an assortment of 30 blue-chip American companies that, when taken together, give a snapshot of the overall stock market: When the Dow closes the trading day higher, investors interpret that as meaning the overall market is up. At the point when the Dow closes the day lower, the market is down.
The Dow is a price-weighted index, and that means that every part company is weighted by its share price. Higher-priced companies have a larger weight than lower-priced companies, thus their movement biggerly affects the index's overall value. [Stock splits](/switch forward-split), which happen when companies issue more shares to shareholders without weakening their value, generally affect price-weighted indexes since the recently split stock has a lower price and in this way is worth essentially less to the index.
The Dow contrasts from different indexes like the [S&P 500](/sp500) and the [Russell 2000](/russell2000) in that it is price-weighted, while different indexes are capitalization-weighted, and that means every part is valued by its [market cap](/capitalization), or the total value of all [outstanding shares](/outstandingshares).
## Why Is the DJIA Important?
The Dow is comprised of 30 of the largest publicly traded companies in America, and it is one of the most notable market indicators. Stock indexes like the Dow are important intermediaries for the New York Stock Exchange, and you'll frequently hear it quoted on the evening news. Stock indexes give a quick image of the total performance of the stock market consistently — the DJIA is known as a benchmark index for U.S. [blue-chip stocks](/bluechipstock), in particular.
## Might I at any point Buy the DJIA? What Is Its Ticker Symbol?
New investors might find the concept of the Dow a bit confounding: It is abbreviated as DJIA, yet that is not its ticker symbol. Its ticker symbol is DJI, yet it's anything but a stock, and you can't buy or trade shares. While the Dow itself isn't tradable, you can invest in the companies that make up the Dow; what's more, specific [ETFs](/indexfund) and [mutual funds](/mutualfund) are intended to mirror the Dow's composites. The explanation the Dow's ticker symbol is unmistakably shown on Wall Street's trading screens and financial data suppliers is so investors can see the market's performance initially.
## How Is the Dow Jones Industrial Average Calculated?
To work out the Dow, you would just include the prices of its 30 stocks and gap the sum by the Dow Divisor, a numeral that factors in stock splits and stock [dividends](/dividend). The Dow Divisor is a universal method for understanding the effect of a one-point move in any of the 30 stocks that make up the Dow.
The Dow Divisor changes much of the time and is kept up with by Dow Jones Indices. On January 10, 2022, the Dow Divisor was 0.152.

## How Are Stocks Selected for the Dow? Who Selects Them?
Curiously, the Dow is chosen by a committee of editors of **The Wall Street Journal**. They have the tremendous responsibility of concluding which companies get added to (or dropped from) the Dow Jones Industrial Average. There are no rules for consideration — just the common principles that a company's market capitalization must be large, it must have a magnificent reputation, and it must exhibit supported growth.
As a matter of fact, the main true requirements are that each company must be a non-transportation or non-service company in the S&P 500.
"While choosing stocks for the Dow, we **Journal** editors basically try to mirror the market in just 30 stocks (minus transportations and utilities)," proofreader Mike Prestbo said in an article itemizing a portion of the mysteries of the Dow.
