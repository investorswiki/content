# Interest Shortfall
## What Is an Interest Shortfall?

An interest shortfall is the [accrued interest](/accruedinterest) due that remaining parts after a borrower has made their regularly scheduled payment. This can lead to negative amortization on some adjustable rate loans. Negative amortization is a financial term alluding to an increase in the [principal](/principal) balance of a loan made by a disappointment cover the [interest](/interest) due on that loan.

## How Interest Shortfalls Work

Interest shortfalls are a feature of [adjustable-rate mortgages](/arm) (ARMs), in which the interest rate applied to the outstanding balance differs over the lifetime of the loan. At the point when rate [caps](/cap) limit month to month loan payments, the property holder's payments might be not exactly the real interest due. This unpaid interest increases the outstanding principal balance of the loan, which is called [negative amortization](/negativeamortization).

While negative amortization shields borrowers from [payment shock](/paymentshock) associated with a sudden increase in the ARM interest rate, it will take more time to completely [amortize](/amortization) the loan. Assuming interest rates keep rising, the equity in the home will decline as opposed to rise, except if the price of the house rises. Most mortgages have limits on interest shortfall, to safeguard both borrower and lender. A [lifetime cap](/lifetimecap) is the maximum upper limit interest rate passable on an ARM. The cap applies to the life of the mortgage. This cap illuminates a borrower regarding the maximum interest rate they could pay during the life of the loan.

> Payment shock is the risk that a loan's scheduled future periodic payments might increase substantially and may make the borrower default on the loan, and is associated with ARMs.

## Interest Shortfalls in MBS

In the [mortgage backed security](/mbs) (MBS) market, interest shortfalls happen when the interest distributed is not exactly the amount of interest accrued because of mortgage prepayments. Interest shortfalls happen when fees and expenses associated with troubled loans reduce the amount of interest accessible to be paid on a mortgage backed security. On the off chance that there's an interest shortfall, interest is deferred, with [subordinate](/subordinateddebt) classes generally the first to be impacted with additional senior tranches get repaid first.

## Features
- This might happen on a variable rate loan where an interest rate cap limits regularly scheduled payments to a level not exactly the total interest due in any case.
- An interest shortfall happens when the accrued interest owed on a debt payment isn't completely covered.
- Interest shortfalls on ARM mortgages can bring about negative amortization, leading to a more drawn out repayment period for the loan.
