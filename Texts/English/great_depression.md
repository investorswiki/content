# Great Depression
## What Was the Great Depression?

The term "Great Depression" alludes to the greatest and longest economic [recession](/recession) in modern world history. The Great Depression ran somewhere in the range of 1929 and 1941, which was that very year that the United States entered World War II in 1941. This period was highlighted by a number of economic contractions, including the [stock market crash of 1929](/stock-market-crash-1929) and banking panics that happened in 1930 and 1931.

Business analysts and students of history frequently refer to the Great Depression as one of the largest — if not the most — devastating economic events of the 20th century.

## The Stock Market Crash

During the short depression that endured from 1920 to 1921, known as the Forgotten Depression, the U.S. [stock market](/stockmarket) fell by almost half, and corporate profits declined by more than 90%. The U.S. economy delighted in robust growth during the remainder of the decade. The Roaring Twenties, as the time came to be known, was a period when the American public found the stock market and dove in heedlessly.

Speculative crazes impacted both the real estate markets and the [New York Stock Exchange](/nyse) (NYSE). Loose money supply and high levels of [margin trading](/margincall) by investors assisted with filling an exceptional increase in asset prices.

The lead-up to October 1929 saw equity prices rise to all-time high multiples of more than 19-times after-tax corporate earnings. This, combined with the benchmark [Dow Jones Industrial Index](/djia) (DJIA) expanding 500% in just five years, eventually caused the stock market crash.

The NYSE bubble burst fiercely on Oct. 24, 1929, a day that came to be known as [Black Thursday](/blackthursday). A short rally happened Friday the 25th and during a half-day session Saturday the 26th. Be that as it may, the following week brought Black Monday (Oct. 28) and Black Tuesday (Oct. 29). The DJIA fell over 20% over those two days. The stock market would eventually fall practically 90% from its 1929 pinnacle.

Swells from the crash spread across the Atlantic Ocean to Europe setting off other financial crises like the collapse of the Boden-Kredit Anstalt, Austria's most important bank. In 1931, the economic calamity hit the two mainlands in full force.

## The U.S. Economy Tailspin

The 1929 stock market crash cleared out [nominal](/nominal) wealth, both corporate and private, sending the U.S. economy into a spiral. In mid 1929, the U.S. unemployment rate was 3.2%. By 1933, it rose above 25%.

In spite of phenomenal mediations and government spending by both the Hoover and Roosevelt administrations, the unemployment rate stayed above 18.9% in 1938. Real [per capita gross domestic product](/per-capita-gdp) (GDP) was below 1929 levels when the Japanese bombarded Pearl Harbor in late 1941.

While the crash probably set off the decade-long economic downturn, most antiquarians and financial specialists concur that the crash alone didn't cause the Great Depression. Nor does it make sense of why the downturn's depth and persistence were so serious. Various specific events and policies contributed to the Great Depression and assisted with drawing out it during the 1930s.

## Botches by the Young Federal Reserve

The moderately new [Federal Reserve](/federalreservesystem) mismanaged the supply of money and credit before and after the crash in 1929. As indicated by monetarists like [Milton Friedman](/milton-friedman) and recognized by former Federal Reserve Chair [Ben Bernanke](/benbernanke).

Made in 1913, the Fed remained genuinely inactive all through the initial eight years of its presence. After the economy recuperated from the 1920 to 1921 depression, the Fed allowed critical [monetary expansion](/expansionary_policy). The total money supply developed by $28 billion, a 61.8% increase somewhere in the range of 1921 and 1928. Bank deposits increased by 51.1%, savings and loan shares rose by 224.3%, and net life insurance policy reserves hopped 113.8%. All of this happened after the Federal Reserve cut required reserves to 3% in 1917. Gains in gold reserves through the Treasury and Fed were just $1.16 billion.

By expanding the money supply and keeping the [interest rate](/interestrate) low during the decade, the Fed affected the fast expansion that went before the collapse. A large part of the surplus money supply growth inflated the stock market and real estate bubbles.

After the bubbles burst and the market crashed, the Fed took the contrary course by cutting the money supply by almost a third. This reduction caused serious [liquidity](/liquidity) issues for the majority small banks and interfered with expects a quick recovery.

## The Fed's Tight Fist

As Bernanke noted in a November 2002 address, before the Fed existed, bank panics were typically settled in no time. Large private financial institutions would loan money to the most grounded smaller institutions to keep up with system integrity. That kind of scenario had happened two decades sooner, during the [Panic of 1907](/bank-panic-of-1907).

While excited selling sent the NYSE spiraling downward and prompted a bank run, investment banker J.P. Morgan stepped in to rally [Wall Street](/wallstreet) natives to move critical measures of [capital](/capital) to banks lacking funds. Ironically, it was that panic that drove the government to make the Federal Reserve to cut its dependence on individual lenders like Morgan.

After Black Thursday, the heads of several New York banks had attempted to impart confidence by conspicuously purchasing large blocks of [blue-chip stocks](/bluechipstock) at above-market prices. While these actions caused a short rally Friday, the panicked sell-offs continued Monday. In the decades starting around 1907, the stock market developed past the ability of such individual efforts. Presently, just the Fed was adequately big to prop up the U.S. financial system.

The Fed failed to do as such with a [cash injection](/capital-injection) somewhere in the range of 1929 and 1932. All things considered, it watched the money supply collapse and let huge number of banks fail. At that point, banking laws made it undeniably challenging for institutions to develop and differentiate to the point of enduring a huge withdrawal of deposits or [run on the bank](/bankrun).

While hard to comprehend, the Fed's brutal reaction might have been the aftereffect of its fear that [bailing out](/bailout) imprudent banks would just encourage fiscal flightiness later on. A few students of history contend that the Fed made the conditions that made the economy overheat and afterward exacerbated a generally desperate economic situation.

## Hoover's Propped-Up Prices

Herbert Hoover took action after the crash happened even however he's frequently characterized as a "sit idle" president.

Somewhere in the range of 1930 and 1932, he executed:

- An increase to federal spending by 42%, which engaged in gigantic public works programs, for example, the [Reconstruction Finance Corporation](/rfc) (RFC)
- Taxes to pay for new programs
- A ban on movement in 1930 to keep low-gifted workers from flooding the [labor market](/labor-market)

Hoover was basically worried about the fact that wages would be cut following the economic downturn. He contemplated that prices expected to remain high to guarantee high paychecks in all industries. To keep prices high, consumers would have to pay more.

Be that as it may, the public was scorched severely in the crash, passing on many individuals without the resources to spend luxuriously on goods and services. Nor could organizations count on overseas [trade](/trade), as foreign nations were not ready to buy overpriced American goods anything else than Americans were.

> A considerable lot of his and Congress' other post-crash mediations, like wage, labor, trade, and price controls, damaged the economy's ability to adjust and reallocate resources.
>
## U.S. Protectionism

This distressing reality forced Hoover to utilize regulation to prop up prices and consequently wages by gagging out less expensive foreign competition. Following the practice of [protectionists](/protectionism), and against the fights of more than 1,000 of the country's financial experts, Hoover endorsed into law the [Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act of 1930](/smoot-hawley-tariff-act).

The act was initially a method for safeguarding farming however expanded into a multi-industry [tariff](/tariff), forcing gigantic duties on in excess of 880 foreign products. Almost three dozen countries fought back, and imports tumbled from $7 billion out of 1929 to just $2.5 billion out of 1932. By 1934, international trade had declined by 66%. As anyone might expect, economic conditions deteriorated worldwide.
Hoover's craving to keep up with occupations and individual and corporate income levels was justifiable. In any case, he encouraged businesses to raise wages, keep away from [layoffs](/cutback), and keep prices high when they naturally ought to have fallen. With previous cycles of recession/depression, the United States experienced one to three years of low wages and [unemployment](/unemployment) before dropping prices prompted a recovery. Unfit to support these artificial levels, and with global trade successfully cut off, the U.S. economy deteriorated from a recession to a depression.

## The New Deal

President Franklin Roosevelt guaranteed huge change when he was casted a ballot in 1933. [The New Deal](/new-deal) he initiated was an inventive, extraordinary series of domestic programs and acts intended to reinforce American business, reduce unemployment, and safeguard the public.

Loosely founded on [Keynesian economics](/keynesianeconomics), it depended on the fact that the government would be able and ought to stimulate the economy. The New Deal set elevated objectives to make and keep up with the national [infrastructure](/infrastructure), full employment, and sound wages. The government set about achieving these objectives through price, wage, and even production controls.

A few financial specialists claim that Roosevelt proceeded with a significant number of Hoover's mediations, just on a larger scale. He kept in place an unbending spotlight on price supports and least wages and eliminated the country from the [gold standard](/goldstandard), restricting individuals to store gold coins and bullion. He banned monopolistic business practices and organized many new public works programs and other occupation creation agencies.

The Roosevelt administration paid farmers and ranchers to stop or cut back on production. One of the most appalling problems of the period was the destruction of excess harvests, regardless of the requirement for large number of Americans to access affordable food.

Federal taxes significantly increased somewhere in the range of 1933 and 1940 to pay for these drives as well as new programs like [Social Security](/socialsecurity). These increases remembered hikes for excise taxes, personal income taxes, inheritance taxes, corporate income taxes, and an excess profits tax.

## New Deal Success and Failure

The New Deal prompted quantifiable outcomes, for example, financial system reform and stabilization, supporting public confidence. Roosevelt pronounced a bank holiday for a whole week in March 1933 to prevent institutional collapse due to panicked [withdrawals](/withdrawal). This was followed by a construction program for a network of dams, extensions, passages, and roads. These activities opened up federal work programs, utilizing huge number of individuals.

Albeit the economy showed some recovery, the rebound was very weak for the New Deal's policies to be unequivocally considered fruitful in hauling America out of the Great Depression. Students of history and financial experts differ on the explanation:

- Keynesians fault a lack of federal spending, saying that Roosevelt didn't go far an adequate number of in his government-driven recovery plans
- Others claim that by attempting to spark immediate improvement as opposed to letting the economic/[business cycle](/businesscycle) follow its standard two-year course of ending up in an almost impossible situation and afterward rebounding, Roosevelt might have drawn out the depression, just like Hoover did before him

A study by two financial specialists at the University of California, Los Angeles estimated that the New Deal extended the Great Depression by something like seven years. However, it is conceivable that the somewhat quick recovery, which was characteristic of other post-depression recuperations, might not have happened as quickly post-1929. That is on the grounds that it was the initial time the overall population (in addition to the Wall Street elite) lost large sums in the stock market.

American economic antiquarian Robert Higgs contended that Roosevelt's new rules and regulations came so fast and were progressive to such an extent that businesses became reluctant to hire or invest. Philip Harvey, a teacher of law and economics at Rutgers University, suggested that Roosevelt was more interested in addressing social welfare worries than making a Keynesian-style macroeconomic [stimulus package](/stimulus-package).

## The Impact of World War II

The Great Depression seemed to end unexpectedly around 1941 to 1942. That is assuming we take a gander at employment and GDP figures. This was just around the time that the United States entered World War II. The unemployment rate tumbled from eight million of every 1940 to just north of 1,000,000 out of 1943. In any case, in excess of 16 million Americans were recruited to fight in the Armed Services. In the [private sector](/private-sector), the real unemployment rate developed during the war.

The [standard of living](/standard-of-living) declined due to wartime shortages brought about by [rationing](/rationing), and taxes rose dramatically to fund the war exertion. Private investment dropped from $17.9 billion out of 1940 to $5.7 billion out of 1943, and total private-sector production fell by almost half.

Albeit the thought that the war ended the Great Depression is a broken window fallacy, the conflict put the United States on the road to recovery. The war opened international trading channels and switched price and wage controls. Government demand opened up for economical products, and the demand made a monstrous fiscal stimulus.

In the initial 12 months after the war ended, private investments rose from $10.6 billion to $30.6 billion. The stock market broke into a [bull run](/bullmarket) in a couple of short years.

## The Bottom Line

The Great Depression was the consequence of an unfortunate combination of factors, including a back-peddling Fed, [protectionist](/protectionism) tariffs, and conflictingly applied government interventionist efforts. This period might have been shortened or even stayed away from by a change in any of these factors.

While the discussion go on concerning whether the intercessions were appropriate, a large number of the reforms from the New Deal, like Social Security, unemployment insurance, and agricultural [subsidies](/endowment), exist right up 'til now. The supposition that the federal government ought to act in times of national economic crisis is currently emphatically upheld. This legacy is one reason the Great Depression is viewed as one of the original events in modern American history.
