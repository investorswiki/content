# Short Covering
## What Is Short Covering?

Short covering alludes to buying back borrowed securities to close out an open short position at a profit or loss. It requires purchasing the very security that was initially [sold short](/shortselling), and giving back the shares initially borrowed for the short sale. This type of transaction is alluded to as [buy to cover](/buytocover).

For instance, a trader sells short 100 shares of XYZ at $20, in light of the assessment those shares will head lower. At the point when XYZ declines to $15, the trader buys back XYZ to cover the short position, booking a $500 profit from the sale.

## How Does Short Covering Work?

Short covering is important to close an open short position. A short position will be profitable in the event that it is covered at a lower price than the initial transaction; it will cause a loss on the off chance that it is covered at a higher price than the initial transaction. At the point when there is a great deal of short covering happening in a security, it might result in a [short squeeze](/shortsqueeze), wherein short sellers are forced to [liquidate](/liquidate) positions at dynamically higher prices as they lose money and their brokers summon [margin calls](/margincall).

Short covering can likewise happen automatically when a stock with exceptionally high short interest is subjected to a "buy-in". This term alludes to the closing of a short position by a broker-dealer when the stock is very challenging to borrow and lenders are requesting it back. Regularly, this happens in stocks that are less liquid with less shareholders.

## Special Considerations
### Short Interest and Short Interest Ratio (SIR)

The higher the [short interest](/shortinterest) and [short interest ratio](/shortinterestratio) (SIR), the greater the risk that short covering might happen in a disorderly fashion. Short covering is generally responsible for the initial phases of a rally after a prolonged [bear market](/bearmarket), or an extended decline in a stock or other security. Short sellers for the most part have shorter-term holding periods than investors with [long positions](/long), due to the risk of runaway losses in a strong uptrend. Subsequently, short sellers are generally quick to cover short sales on indications of a turnaround in market sentiment or a security's terrible strokes of luck.

## Illustration of Short Covering

Consider that XYZ has 50 million shares outstanding, 10 million shares sold short, and an average daily trading volume of 1 million shares. XYZ has a short interest of 20% and a SIR of 10, the two of which are very high (proposing that short covering could be troublesome).

XYZ loses ground over a number of days or weeks, empowering even greater short selling. One morning before they open, they report a major client that will greatly increase quarterly income. XYZ gaps higher at the opening bell, lessening short seller profits or adding to losses. A few short sellers need to exit at a better price and hold off on covering, while other short sellers exit positions forcefully. This disorderly short covering, powers XYZ to head higher in a feedback loop that go on until the short squeeze is exhausted, while short sellers waiting for a beneficial reversal cause even higher losses.

## Highlights
- Short covering can bring about either a profit (in the event that the asset is repurchased lower than where it was sold) or for a loss (assuming it is higher).
- Short covering might be forced in the event that there is a short squeeze and sellers become subject to margin calls. Measures of short interest can assist with foreseeing the possibilities of a squeeze.
- Short covering is closing out a short position by buying back shares that were initially borrowed to sell short utilizing buy to cover orders.
