# Annuity falling behind financially
## What Is Annuity falling behind financially?

Annuity falling behind financially alludes to the payment of an equivalent amount of money that is made toward the finish of a standard term. It doesn't allude to a [annuity](/annuity) product, in essence, however rather alludes to a payment structure that an annuity could utilize. A common illustration of an annuity financially past due is a mortgage payment.

Annuity financially past due — a legal, accounting and actuarial term — is otherwise called an "[ordinary annuity](/ordinaryannuity)." something contrary to an annuity falling behind financially is known as an "[annuity in advance](/annuity-in-advance)" or "[annuity due](/annuitydue)."

## How Annuity financially past due Works

One more approach to portraying annuity falling behind financially is a series of periodic, recurring payments that are due toward the finish of a predetermined period. Such a payment could be interest, a mortgage payment comprising of principal and interest, or some other recurring payment — most frequently a payment on an installment credit — that permits interest to accrue.

Different instances of this concept are the semiannual interest payments made on a bond or quarterly or annual dividend payments. While the term "financially past due" is part of "annuity falling behind financially," their implications are tremendously unique. "The fact that a payment is late makes monetarily past due" basically used to mean.

## Annuity falling behind financially and Present Value

Since payments on an annuity falling behind financially (or ordinary annuity) are made toward the finish of a given period, the present value of such payments is lower than in an annuity in advance or annuity due, which includes a payment toward the beginning of a term. The value of an annuity financially past due will decrease when interest rates rise and increase when interest rates fall.

The justification behind this is that the present value of future cash payments relies upon the interest rate used in working out the [present value](/present-value-annuity). At the point when the time value of money (TVM) changes, the annuity valuation changes also.

Thusly, assuming you are the one making the payment, an annuity falling behind financially is ideal because of inflation and the opportunity to earn interest on investments or interest-bearing accounts given that a sum of money today is worth more than a similar sum from now on. Reflexively, on the off chance that you are the party getting a payment, an annuity due (or annuity in advance) is ideal for a similar explanation.
