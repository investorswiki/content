## What Was the Accounting Standards Executive Committee (AcSEC)?

The Accounting Standards Executive Committee (AcSEC) is the former senior technical organization inside the [American Institute of Certified Public Accountants](/american-institute-of-certified-public-accountants) (AICPA) that decided the AICPA's technical policies related to financial reporting standards.

FinREC is authorized to unveil statements in the interest of the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants without explicit consent from the AICPA's board of directors.

The Accounting Standards Executive Committee's (AcSEC) duties have been assumed by the Financial Reporting Executive Committee (FinREC). As per then Chair of AICPA, Robert R. Harris, the name change was to better mirror the committee's steadily changing job and its more extensive obligations.

FinREC exists to make technical policies for, and to act as, the spokesbody for the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants. FinREC meets four to six times each year and meetings are available to the public (aside from while the meeting relates to administrative or generally confidential issues). FinREC is responsible for aggregating letters of remarks in the interest of the AICPA to outside groups including the [Securities and Exchange Commission](/sec) (SEC) and the [Financial Accounting Standards Board](/fasb) (FASB).

During the 1970s, the [Financial Accounting Standards Board](/fasb) (FASB) took over responsibility for setting [generally accepted accounting principles](/gaap) (GAAPs). Be that as it may, the AICPA actually holds its standards-setting liabilities in such areas as professional ethics, business valuation, financial statement auditing, attest services, and CPA firm quality control.

It sets standards for getting and keeping up with the CPA assignment, which is earned by accountants who finish a series of accounting exams and fulfill other experience requirements, and directs CPA practitioners to ensure they are meeting skill and performance standards.
