# Thirty-Year Treasury
## What Is Thirty-Year Treasury?

A thirty-year treasury is a U.S. Treasury debt obligation that develops following 30 years.

## Figuring out Thirty-Year Treasury

Thirty-year [treasury bonds](/treasurybond) are among the world's most widely followed [fixed-income](/fixedincome) assets. All treasury bonds receive the backing of the U.S. Treasury, setting them among the most secure and most famous investments among investors worldwide. Since most debt issuances come from institutions or people with a higher risk of default than the U.S. government, interest rates for treasury bonds are probably not going to surpass rates on different bonds of comparable duration. Notwithstanding, the yield on treasury bonds changes in light of market demand and the overall outlook for the economy.

The primary risk associated with treasury bonds implies changes to winning [interest rates](/interestrate) over the bond's life. Assuming interest rates rise the bondholder passes up higher returns than the ones earned on the current holding. As compensation for this, bonds with longer terms to maturity generally carry higher [yields](/yield) than shorter maturity bonds issued simultaneously. Thirty-year treasuries are the longest maturity bonds offered by the federal government, and consequently deliver higher returns than contemporary 10-year or three-month issues.

## Yield Curves and Long-Duration Bonds

The greater compensation associated with longer maturity bonds portrays a situation with a [normal yield curve](/normalyieldcurve). Under certain economic conditions, the yield curve might become compliment or even [inverted](/invertedyieldcurve), with shorter maturity bonds paying better interest rates than longer maturity bonds. The normal yield curve generally infers investors foreseeing economic expansion and an expectation that interest rates on long-term debt will rise. That moves the demand away from longer maturity bonds and toward shorter maturity bonds as investors park their funds in anticipation of better-yielding longer-term bonds down the road. The more the demand imbalance, the more extreme the yield curve as the high demand for short maturity bonds pushes down yields and bond issuers raise yields on longer-term bonds trying to draw in additional investors.

At the point when investors suspect poor economic times ahead and falling interest rates, the situation can transform. High demand for longer maturity bonds at reasonable present rates and low demand for short-term debt that bondholders hope to reinvest into a falling interest rate environment can cause a rise in short-term rates and a fall in long-term rates. At the point when that occurs, the yield curve turns out to be more shallow as the difference in interest rates turns out to be less articulated between bonds of various maturities. At the point when the yield on short-term bonds rises over those of long-term bonds, an inverted yield curve results.
