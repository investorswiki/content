# Exchange-Traded Notes (ETN)
## What Are Exchange-Traded Notes (ETNs)?

Exchange-traded notes (ETNs) are types of [unsecured](/unsecured) debt securities that track an underlying index of securities and trade on a major exchange like a stock. ETNs are like bonds yet don't have interest payments. All things being equal, the prices of ETNs vary like stocks.

## How Exchange-Traded Notes Work

An ETN is commonly issued by financial institutions and bases its return on a market index. ETNs are a type of bond. At maturity, the ETN will pay the return of the index it tracks. Nonetheless, ETNs pay no interest payments like a bond.

At the point when the ETN develops, the financial institution takes out fees, then gives the investor cash in view of the performance of the underlying index. Since ETNs trade on major exchanges like stocks, investors can buy and sell ETNs and have money from the effect between the purchase and sale prices, minus any fees.

ETNs are not the same as [exchange-traded funds](/etf) (ETFs). ETFs own the securities in the index they track. For instance, an ETF that tracks the S&P 500 will possess every one of the 500 stocks in the S&P.

ETNs don't give investors ownership of the securities yet are just paid the return that the index produces. Accordingly, ETNs are like debt securities. The investors must trust that the issuer will follow through with the return in light of the underlying index.

ETNs were first issued by Barclays Bank PLC. Banks and other financial institutions regularly issue ETNs at $50 per share. Part of the market price relies on how the underlying index is performing.

## Risk From an ETN Issuer

The repayment of the principal invested depends, in part, on the performance of the underlying index. In the event that the index either goes down or doesn't go up to the point of covering the fees engaged with the transaction, the investor will receive a lower amount at maturity than what was initially invested.

The ETN's ability to pay back the principal — in addition to gains from the index it tracks — relies upon the financial viability of the issuer. Subsequently, an ETN's value is affected by the [credit rating](/creditrating) of the issuer. The value of the ETN could decline due to a [downgrade](/downgrade) in the issuer's credit rating, even however there was no change in the underlying index.

Investors must know about the risk that the issuer of an ETN might be unable to repay the principal and [default](/default2) on the bond. Additionally, political, economic, legal, or regulatory changes might influence the financial institution's ability to pay ETN investors on time.

The financial institution giving the ETN could utilize options to accomplish the return from the index, which can increase the risk of losses to investors. Options are agreements that can amplify gains or losses where the issuer has the privilege to execute shares of stocks by paying a premium in the options market. Options are normally short-term contracts, and the [premiums](/choice premium) can vacillate ridiculously founded on market conditions.

Investors additionally have closure risk, meaning the issuer could possibly close the ETN before maturity. In this case, the investor would be paid the overall price in the market. On the off chance that the sale price is lower than the purchase price, the investor can understand a loss. The early redemption feature of an ETN is stated upfront.

## Risk in Tracking an Index

The price of the ETN ought to follow the index closely, yet there can be times when it doesn't associate well — called tracking errors. Tracking errors occur assuming there are credit issues with the issuer and the price of the ETN veers off from the underlying index.

## Risks From Liquidity

On the off chance that a financial institution chooses not to issue new ETNs for a period, prices of existing ETNs could bounce fundamentally due to the lack of supply. Subsequently, existing ETNs could trade at a premium to the value of the index it tracks. Alternately, in the event that the bank abruptly chooses to issue extra ETNs, prices of existing ETNs could fall due to excess supply.

Trading activity for ETNs can be low or change emphatically. The outcome can be ETN prices that are trading at far higher prices than their real value for those hoping to buy. Additionally, these products might sell at far lower prices than their value for investors hoping to sell. Due to the shifting prices of ETNs, investors who sell an ETN before maturity can understand a large loss or gain.

## Tax Treatment of ETNs

The investor might concede the gain until the ETN is sold or develops. Notwithstanding, investors ought to look for counsel from a tax professional for any potential tax repercussions that could exist for their specific situation.
