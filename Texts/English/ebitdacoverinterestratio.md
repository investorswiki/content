## What Is the EBITDA-to-Interest Coverage Ratio?

The EBITDA-to-interest coverage ratio is a financial ratio that is utilized to evaluate a company's financial durability by looking at whether it is essentially sufficiently profitable to pay off its interest expenses utilizing its pre-tax income. Explicitly it hopes to see what proportion of [earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization](/ebitda) (EBITDA), can be utilized for this purpose.

The EBITDA-to-interest coverage ratio is likewise referred to just as EBITDA coverage. The principal difference between EBITDA coverage and the [interest coverage ratio](/interestcoverageratio), is that the last option utilizes [earnings before income and taxes](/ebit) (EBIT), instead of the really including EBITDA.

> - The EBITDA-to-interest coverage ratio, or EBITDA coverage, is utilized to perceive how effectively a firm can pay the interest on its outstanding debt.

## Understanding the EBITDA-to-Interest Coverage Ratio

The EBITDA-to-interest coverage ratio was first widely utilized by [leveraged buyout](/leveragedbuyout) bankers, who might involve it as a first screen to determine whether a recently rebuilt company would have the option to service its [short-term debt](/shorttermdebt) obligations. A ratio greater than 1 demonstrates that the company has a very sizable amount of interest coverage to pay off its interest expenses.

While the ratio is an exceptionally simple method for surveying whether a company can cover its interest-related expenses, the applications of this ratio are likewise limited by the pertinence of utilizing EBITDA (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization) as a proxy for different financial figures. For instance, assume that a company has an EBITDA-to-interest coverage ratio of 1.25; this may not mean that it would have the option to cover its interest payments since the company could have to spend a large portion of its profits on supplanting old equipment. Since EBITDA doesn't account for depreciation-related expenses, a ratio of 1.25 probably won't be a definitive indicator of financial durability.

## EBITDA-To-Interest Coverage Ratio Calculation and Example

There are two formulas utilized for the EBITDA-to-interest coverage ratio that contrast marginally. Analysts might contrast in assessment on which one is more applicable to utilize contingent upon the company being dissected. They are as per the following:

>
> EBITDA-to-interest coverage = (EBITDA + lease payments)/(loan interest payments + lease payments)
>

also,

>
> Interest coverage ratio, which is EBIT/interest expenses.

For instance, think about the accompanying. A company reports sales revenue of $1,000,000. Salary expenses are reported as $250,000, while utilities are reported as $20,000. Lease payments are $100,000. The company additionally reports [depreciation](/depreciation) of $50,000 and [interest expenses](/interestexpense) of $120,000. To work out the EBITDA-to-interest coverage ratio, initial an analyst needs to ascertain the EBITDA. EBITDA is calculated by taking the company's [EBIT](/ebit) (earnings before interest and tax) and adding back the depreciation and amortization sums.

In the above model, the company's EBIT and EBITDA are calculated as:

- EBIT = revenues - operating expenses - depreciation = $1,000,000 - ($250,000 + $20,000 + $100,000) - $50,000 = $580,000
- EBITDA = EBIT + depreciation + amortization = $580,000 + $50,000 + $0 = $630,000

Then, involving the formula for EBITDA-to-interest coverage that incorporates the lease payments term, the company's EBITDA-to-interest coverage ratio is:

- EBITDA-to-interest coverage = ($630,000 + $100,000)/($120,000 + $100,000)
- = $730,000/$220,000
- = 3.32
