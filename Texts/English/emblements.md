Emblements likewise become an integral factor in the event that the land passes to another person due to the tenant's death. In this case, the yields pass to the tenant's heirs.

There are numerous situations wherein the right to emblements would apply. For instance, a farmer is renting a plot of land from a neighbor for a very long time to develop corn and soybeans. The lease is on a year-to-year basis and is naturally recharged every July.
