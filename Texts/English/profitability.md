## What Is the Profitability Index (PI)?

The profitability index (PI), on the other hand alluded to as value investment ratio (VIR) or profit investment ratio (PIR), depicts an index that addresses the relationship between the costs and benefits of a proposed project. It is calculated as the ratio between the [present value](/presentvalue) of future expected cash flows and the initial amount invested in the project. A higher PI means that a project will be viewed as more appealing.

## Understanding the Profitability Index (PI)

The PI is useful in positioning different projects since it allows investors to measure the value made per every investment unit. A profitability index of 1.0 is sensibly the most reduced acceptable measure on the index, as any value lower than that number would demonstrate that the project's current value (PV) is not exactly the [initial investment](/initialcashflow). As the value of the profitability index increments, so does the financial allure of the proposed project.

The profitability index is an appraisal technique applied to likely capital outlays. The method isolates the projected capital inflow by the projected capital outflow to decide the profitability of a project. As indicated by the previously mentioned formula, the profitability index utilizes the current value of future cash flows and the initial investment to address the previously mentioned factors.

While utilizing the profitability index to compare the allure of projects, it's essential to consider how the technique ignores project size. In this manner, projects with bigger cash inflows might bring about lower profitability index calculations in light of the fact that their [profit margins](/profitmargin) are not as high.

## Parts of the Profitability Index
### PV of Future Cash Flows (Numerator)

The current value of future cash flows requires the implementation of time value of money calculations. Cash flows are discounted the suitable number of periods to liken future cash flows to current monetary levels. Discounting accounts for the possibility that the value of $1 today doesn't rise to the value of $1 received in one year since money in the current offers seriously acquiring potential by means of revenue bearing bank accounts, than money yet inaccessible. Cash flows received further in the future are in this manner considered to have a lower present value than money received nearer to the present.

### Investment Required (Denominator)

The discounted projected cash outflows address the initial capital outlay of a project. The initial investment required is just the cash flow required toward the beginning of the project. Any remaining outlays might happen anytime in the project's life, and these are factored into the calculation using discounting in the numerator. These extra capital outlays might factor in benefits connecting with taxation or [depreciation](/depreciation).

## Computing and Interpreting the Profitability Index

Since profitability index calculations can't be negative, they therefore must be changed over completely to positive figures before they are considered valuable. Calculations greater than 1.0 show what was to come anticipated discounted cash inflows of the project are greater than the anticipated discounted cash outflows. Calculations under 1.0 demonstrate the deficit of the outflows is greater than the discounted inflows, and the project ought not be accepted. Calculations that equivalent 1.0 achieve circumstances of indifference where any gains or losses from a project are insignificant.

While utilizing the profitability index exclusively, calculations greater than 1.0 are positioned in light of the highest calculation. At the point when limited capital is free, and projects are mutually exclusive, the project with the highest profitability index is to be accepted as it shows the project with the most useful utilization of limited capital. The profitability index is likewise called the benefit-cost ratio hence. Albeit a few projects bring about higher net present values, those projects might be disregarded on the grounds that they don't have the highest profitability index and don't address the most beneficial use of company assets.

## Highlights
- The profitability index (PI) is a measure of a project's or alternately investment's engaging quality.
- A PI greater than 1.0 is considered as a wise investment, with higher values relating to additional appealing projects.
- The PI is calculated by separating the current value of future expected cash flows by the initial investment amount in the project.
- Under capital limitations and mutually exclusive projects, just those with the highest PIs ought to be embraced.
