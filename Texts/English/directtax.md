# Direct Tax
## What is direct tax?
A direct tax is a tax on the property or income of the person who pays it, rather than on goods or services. American taxpayers pay different direct taxes, as [income tax](/incometax), notwithstanding [indirect taxes](/indirecttax), like sales tax. Since they're assessed relatively to a taxpayer's income or the value of his property, direct taxes bring a degree of fairness into the economy when that tax revenue pays for social services.
## More profound definition
The U.S. presented direct taxes in 1913, with the section of the Sixteenth Amendment to the Constitution. Prior to this amendment, the tax code prohibited the burden of any direct taxes by the federal government.
Not at all like indirect taxes, which are paid by an intermediary and afterward went to the taxpayer, direct taxes are the responsibility of the taxpayer. They must be recorded on the individual's tax return every year.
Probably the most common direct taxes are:
1. **Income tax:** A tax paid to federal and state governments every year.
1. **Corporate tax:** A tax an organization pays on its profit.
1. **Property tax:** A tax in view of the value of a taxpayer's property, generally real estate.

While indirect taxes are assessed at a similar rate for each transaction no matter what the person, direct taxes are assessed in relation to the value of what's being taxed. They're calculated as not entirely set in stone by state and federal law.
That makes direct taxes quite possibly of the best way governments disseminate social services to bring down income individuals. The rich wind up paying a higher extent of taxes, whether on income they earn or through the ownership of their more important property, and lower-income individuals are at times not committed to pay taxes by any means or receive tax payments back as credit.
## Direct tax model
Every year, individuals in the U.S. need to pay taxes on the home they own, which are collected by their neighborhood government. This is a direct tax called a property tax, and it's calculated as a small percentage of the value of the home. Assuming that they sell the home, the value of the sale is subject to an indirect tax.
