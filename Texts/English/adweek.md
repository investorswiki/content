## Adweek History

Adweek was first distributed in 1979 during the prime of print and TV advertising by A/S/M Communications Inc. In 1990, Affiliated Publications Inc. (distributer of the Boston Globe), bought a controlling interest (80% of its outstanding common stock) in the publication.

In 2009, a recently framed e5 Global Media, a venture of Pluribus Capital Management and Guggenheim Partners, agreed to buy eight brands having a place with Nielsen Business Media, including AdweekMedia (which included Adweek, Mediaweek, and Brandweek).

As per Adweek, "in 2014, Adweek's then-parent company Prometheus Global Media — proprietors of The Hollywood Reporter and Billboard — acquired Mediabistro.com and merged the publication, job board, and education platforms with Adweek and the Clio Awards. Mediabistro, Adweek, and Clio, alongside Film Expo, were then turned out from Guggenheim Partners/Prometheus Global into another company, Mediabistro Holdings."

Beringer Capital therefore bought Adweek from Mediabistro Holdings, which was then liquidated. In mid-2020, Shamrock Capital acquired Adweek.
