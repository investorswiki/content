# Depletion
## What is Depletion?

Depletion is a [accrual accounting](/accrualaccounting) technique used to designate the cost of extricating natural resources like timber, minerals, and oil from the earth.

Like [depreciation](/depreciation) and [amortization](/amortization), depletion is a [non-cash expense](/noncashcharge) that brings down the cost value of an asset gradually through scheduled charges to income. Where depletion contrasts is that it alludes to the progressive exhaustion of natural resource reserves, instead of the wearing out of depreciable assets or aging life of [intangibles](/intangibleasset).

## How Depletion Works

Depletion for accounting and financial reporting objects is intended to aid precisely recognizing the value of the assets on the [balance sheet](/balancesheet) and recording expenses in the proper time span on the [income statement](/incomestatement).

At the point when the costs associated with natural resource extraction have been [capitalized](/underwrite), the expenses are deliberately allocated across various time spans based upon the resources extricated. The costs are held on the balance sheet until expense recognition happens.

## Recording Depletion

To ascertain what expenses should be spread out for the utilization of natural resources, each unique phase of production must be thought about. The depletion base is the [capitalized costs](/capitalizedcost) exhausted across numerous [accounting periods](/accountingperiod). There are four principal factors that influence the depletion base:

- **Acquisition**: Costs associated with purchasing or leasing the property rights to land that the company accepts has natural resources.
- **Exploration:** Expenses linked to digging under the land that was leased or bought.
- **Development:** The costs important to prepare the land for natural resource extraction, for example, tunneling or creating wells.
- **Restoration:** Expenses associated with reestablishing the land to its original condition after completion.

## Percentage Depletion Method

One method of working out depletion expense is the [percentage depletion](/percentage-depletion) method. It doles out a fixed percentage to gross revenue — sales minus costs — to designate expenses. For instance, if $10 million of oil is separated and the fixed percentage is 15%, $1.5 million of capitalized costs to remove the natural resource are drained.

The percentage depletion method requires a ton of evaluations and is, subsequently, not an intensely depended upon or accepted method of depletion.

## Cost Depletion Method

The second method of ascertaining depletion is the [cost depletion](/cost-depletion) method. Cost depletion is calculated by taking the property's [basis](/basis), total [recoverable reserves](/recoverabel-save) and number of units sold into account. The property's basis is distributed among the total number of recoverable units. As natural resources are extricated, they are excluded and taken from the property's basis.

For instance, the capitalized costs of $1 million yields 500,000 barrels of oil. In the first year, assuming 100,000 barrels of oil are extricated, the depletion expense for the period is $200,000 (100,000 barrels * ($1,000,000/500,000 barrels)

## Reporting Requirements

The [Internal Revenue Service](/irs) (IRS) requires the cost method to be utilized with timber. It requires the method that yields the highest deduction to be utilized with mineral property, which it characterizes as oil and gas wells, mines and other natural deposits, including geothermal deposits.

Since the percentage depletion takes a gander at the property's [gross income](/grossincome) and [taxable income](/taxableincome) limit, instead of the amount of the natural resource removed, it's anything but an acceptable reporting method for certain natural resources.

## Features
- There are two essential forms of depletion allowance: percentage depletion and cost depletion.
- At the point when the costs associated with natural resource extraction have been capitalized, the expenses are methodicallly allocated across various time spans based upon the resources separated.
- Depletion is an accrual accounting method used to apportion the cost of removing natural resources like timber, minerals, and oil from the earth.
