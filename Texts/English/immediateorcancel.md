# Immediate or Cancel Order (IOC)
## What Is an Immediate or Cancel Order (IOC)?

An immediate or cancel order (IOC) is an order to buy or sell a security that endeavors to [execute](/execution) all or part immediately and afterward cancels any unfilled portion of the order. An IOC order is one of several "duration," or [time in force](/timeinforce) orders, that investors can use to determine how long the order stays active in the market and under what conditions the order is canceled.

Other normally utilized duration order types incorporate [fill or kill](/fok) (FOK), [all or none](/aon) (AON) and great 'till canceled (GTC). Most online trading platforms permit IOC orders to be set physically or customized into automated trading strategies.

## Fundamentals of an IOC Order

Investors can submit either a "[limit](/limitorder)" or "market" immediate or cancel order (IOC) contingent upon their specific execution requirements. An IOC limit order is placed at a specific price, though an IOC market order has no price joined and executes with the best offer price for a buy and best [bid price](/bidprice) for a sell.

IOC orders vary from other duration orders in that they just require a partial fill, while both FOK and AON orders must be filled completely or canceled. GTC orders stay active until either executed in the market or canceled by the client, albeit most brokers cancel them somewhere in the range of 30 and 90 days. IOC orders assist investors with limiting risk, speed execution and give price improvement by giving greater flexibility.

## When to Use an IOC Order

Investors commonly use IOC orders while presenting a large order to try not to have it filled at a variety of prices. An IOC order naturally cancels any part of the order that doesn't [fill](/fill) immediately. Expect, for instance, that a client submits an IOC request to purchase 5,000 shares of International Business Machines Corporation (IBM). Any portion of the 5,000 shares not purchased immediately is consequently canceled. The people who trade several stocks over the course of the day might utilize an IOC order to limit the risk of neglecting to physically cancel an order at the close.

## Certifiable Example of an IOC Order

Assume an investor submits an IOC market request to buy 1,000 shares of Apple Inc. (AAPL). Suppose the [order book](/order-book) shows 2,000 shares bid at $170.95 and 500 shares offered at $171.00. The order would immediately fill 500 shares at the offer price ($171) and cancel the unfilled portion of 500 shares.

How about we accept another investor submits an IOC limit request to buy 1,000 shares of Apple at $169 around the market open when the stock is currently offered at $170. The S&P 500 drops somewhat in the early evening, when a seller offers 700 shares of AAPL at $169. The IOC order, nonetheless, wouldn't be filled on the grounds that it was cancelled immediately after not being filled before in the day.

IOC limit orders safeguard against getting a terrible fill in a fast going or [illiquid](/illiquid) market. Then again, IOC market orders guarantee a complete or partial execution in an emphatically trending stock that has heavy buying demand.
