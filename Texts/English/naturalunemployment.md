# Natural Unemployment
## What Is Natural Unemployment?

Natural unemployment, or the natural rate of unemployment, is the base [unemployment](/unemployment) rate coming about because of real or voluntary economic forces. Natural unemployment mirrors the number of individuals that are unemployed due to the structure of the labor force, for example, those supplanted by technology or the people who lack certain skills to gain employment.

## Grasping Natural Unemployment

We frequently hear the term "[full employment](/fullemployment)," which can be accomplished when the U.S. economy is performing great. Nonetheless, full employment is a misnomer, since there are consistently workers searching for employment, including new college graduates or those displaced by mechanical advances. As such, there is in every case some movement of labor all through the economy. The movement of labor all through employment, regardless of whether it's voluntary, addresses natural unemployment.

Any unemployment not viewed as natural is frequently alluded to as cyclical, institutional, or strategy based unemployment. Exogenous factors can cause an increase in the natural rate of unemployment; for instance, an economic crash or steep recession could increase the natural unemployment rate in the event that workers lose the skills important to figure out full-opportunity work or on the other hand assuming certain businesses close and are unable to return due to exorbitant loss of revenue. Financial analysts call this effect "[hysteresis](/hysteresis)."

Significant supporters of the theory of natural unemployment incorporate [Milton Friedman](/milton-friedman), [Edmund Phelps](/edmund-s-phelps), and [Friedrich Hayek](/friedrich-hayek), all Nobel victors. Crafted by Friedman and Phelps were instrumental in fostering the [non-accelerating inflation rate of unemployment](/non-accelerating-rate-unemployment) (NAIRU).

## Why Natural Unemployment Persists

It was customarily accepted by financial experts that in the event that unemployment existed, it was due to a lack of demand for labor or workers. Thusly, the economy would should be invigorated through fiscal or [monetary](/monetarypolicy) measures to support business activity and eventually the demand for labor. Nonetheless, this method of reasoning become undesirable as it was realized that, even during robust economic growth periods, there were still workers unemployed due to the natural flow of workers to and from companies.

The natural movement of labor is one reason why true full employment can't be accomplished, as it would mean that workers were inflexible or unmoving through the U.S. economy. As such, 100% full employment is unattainable in an economy over an extended time. True full employment is undesirable in light of the fact that a 0% long-run unemployment rate requires a totally inflexible labor market, where workers are unable to stop their current job or leave to see as a better one.

As indicated by the [general equilibrium model](/general-equilibrium-theory) of economics, natural unemployment is equivalent to the level of unemployment of a labor market at perfect equilibrium. This is the difference between workers who need a job at the current wage rate and the people who are willing and able to perform such work. Under this definition of natural unemployment, it is workable for institutional factors — like the lowest pay permitted by law or high degrees of unionization — to increase the natural rate long term.

## Unemployment and Inflation

Since [John Maynard Keynes](/john_maynard_keynes) stated "The General Theory" in 1936, numerous financial experts have accepted there is a special and direct relationship between the level of unemployment in an economy and the level of inflation. This direct relationship was once officially arranged in the supposed [Phillips curve](/phillipscurve), which addressed the view that unemployment moved the other way of inflation. In the event that the economy was to be fully employed, there must be inflation, and on the other hand, assuming there was low inflation, unemployment must increase or persevere.

The Phillips curve become undesirable after the great [stagflation](/stagflation) of the 1970s, which the Phillips curve suggested was incomprehensible. During stagflation, unemployment and inflation both rise. During the 1970s stagflation was in part due to the oil embargo, which sent oil and fuel prices higher while the economy sank into recession.

Today financial analysts are substantially more suspicious of the implied correlation between strong economic activity and inflation, or among deflation and unemployment. Many consider a 4% to 5% unemployment rate to be full employment and not particularly concerning.

The natural rate of unemployment addresses the lowest unemployment rate by which inflation is stable or the unemployment rate that exists with non-accelerating inflation. Nonetheless, even today numerous financial experts differ with regards to the particular level of unemployment that ought to be viewed as the natural rate of unemployment.

## Highlights
- Natural unemployment is the base unemployment rate coming about because of real or voluntary economic forces.
- Natural unemployment perseveres due to the flexibility of the labor market, which allows for workers to flow to and from companies.
- It addresses the number of individuals unemployed due to the structure of the labor force, including those supplanted by technology or the people who lack the skills important to get recruited.
