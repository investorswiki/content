# Hidden Value
## What Are Hidden Values?

Hidden values are assets that are undervalued on a company's balance sheet and thusly may not be incorporated into or reflected in the company's share price.

Purported value investors try to reveal hidden values on a company's balance sheet that are much of the time ignored by the average investor, frequently using [fundamental analysis](/fundamentalanalysis). An asset that is set apart at [book value](/bookvalue) however worth more in terms of its [fair market price](/fairmarketvalue) would be viewed as a hidden value.

## Figuring out Hidden Value

The embodiment of [value investing](/valueinvesting) is buying undervalued protections â€” that is, undervalued relative to their [intrinsic values](/intrinsicvalue). A value investor will decide a fair value in quite a few different ways, contingent upon the type of company, and afterward compare this intrinsic value to the value concurred to the security by the market. Assuming the discount is alluring enough for this value investor, they will buy the shares and persistently anticipate the likely convergence of the current market value to the intrinsic value.

An asset that is assigned by a company a certain value on the balance sheet to adjust to [generally accepted accounting principles](/gaap) (GAAP) might be worth more in terms of fair market value. [Intangible assets](/intangibleasset, for example, brand names and licenses could contain hidden values, as could reserves of natural resource companies. At times, in the event that an asset has long been held at a cost-premise on the books, it very well may be worth substantially more than whatever is pondered the balance sheet. In like manner, assuming an asset has been [depreciated](/depreciation) for accounting, particularly while utilizing a [accelerated depreciation](/accelerateddepreciation) schedule, it might really hold more market value than it is credited to have on the association's [balance sheet](/balancesheet).

## Illustration of Hidden Value

A classic illustration of a hidden value is land. Land must be held at [historic cost](/historical-cost) as per GAAP accounting rules, however there is a high probability that this sort of asset has fundamentally valued in value whenever owned for a long period of time. On the off chance that the land is isolated from the balance sheet and valued at current market prices, it would most likely have a value greater than whatever is kept in the financial statements and maybe contain a non-immaterial part of the company's [market capitalization](/marketcapitalization).

A retailer like Tiffany or Macy's, with prime property in Manhattan, for example, could have this type of hidden value. The value investor would separately compute the current market value of their properties in the determination of whether or the amount of a discount to intrinsic value exists.
