# Cost of Tender
## What Is Cost of Tender?

Cost of tender is the total charges associated with the delivery and certification of commodities underlying a [futures](/futures) contract. The cost of tender addresses the total costs connected with taking the physical delivery of a commodity. These costs are assessed provided that the futures [contract holder](/contractholder) wishes to receive the commodity as opposed to close the position prior to expiration.

## Cost of Tender Explained

The cost of tender is essentially the cost of carrying on with work. Any costs associated with the genuine physical delivery of the commodity involve the cost of tender. For instance, in the event that an investor is long corn (claims a futures contract on corn), the seller must deliver the corn to the contract holder when the contract terminates (except if the contract holder closes the position prior to expiration). The holder must repay the seller for the cost of tender including transportation, [carrying costs](/carrying-costs), and whatever other expenses that are associated with the delivery.

In a wide range of financial markets, to "[tender](/tender)" means to pull out, in this case to a trade's clearinghouse, that delivery of the physical [commodity](/commodity-etf) underlying the [futures contract](/futurescontract) will start. Most investors who invest in commodity futures decide to close their positions before expiration, so they aren't financially responsible for delivering the commodity. Along these lines, an investor can benefit from movement in the commodity price without managing the major confusions of taking physical delivery.

In the event that physical delivery is chosen, cost of tender will become an integral factor and will differ in view of several factors. The [delivery point](/delivery-point), for example, is a crucial element recorded as a hard copy futures contracts. The picked delivery point will influence the net [delivery price](/deliveryprice) or cost of the [underlying asset](/underlying-asset). The terms of the delivery endorse the value of the goods delivered. With physical delivery, the price of commodities varies by location due to the costs of moving them from their source to the delivery point. In this manner, to determine a single price of a commodity for contract purposes, the delivery point is an essential detail.

## How Cost of Tender Works

Frequently, traders will just roll over a futures contract that is close to expiration to one more contract in a farther month. Futures contracts have expiration dates (while stocks exchange unendingness). Rolling over assists an investor with keeping away from the costs and obligations associated with the settlement of the contracts. Costs of tender are most frequently settled by physical settlement or [cash settlement](/cashsettlement). Numerous financial futures contracts, like the well known e-smaller than usual contracts, are cash settled upon expiration. This means on the last day of trading, the value of the contract is set apart to market and the dealer's account is charged or credited relying upon whether there is a profit or loss.

Tender charges are typically paid to official warehouses where certification and delivery occur. At times, they can likewise be due to a clearing house. Tender costs can change widely between various warehouses, and exchanges are not committed to implement limits of any sort on tender charges. Most exchanges will list their costs on their official sites. Once in a while, the specific cost is handed-off in the futures contract.
