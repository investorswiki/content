# Substantially Identical Security
## What Is a Substantially Identical Security?

The term "substantially indistinguishable security" comes from the language and clarification distributed by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (IRS) in regards to the rules of a wash sale. Securities that meet this definition are not recognized as various enough to be viewed as separate investments. Substantially indistinguishable securities can incorporate both new and old securities issued by a corporation that has gone through reorganization, or convertible securities and common stock of a similar corporation. Securities normally fall into this category assuming that the market and conversion prices are something very similar and are subsequently not permitted to be included in tax swap or other tax-loss harvesting strategies.

## Grasping a Substantially Identical Security

Tax swaps, or tax-loss harvesting strategies, permit an investor to sell a stock or exchange-traded fund (ETF) that has gone down in price and in this way cause a capital loss. This assists investors with decreasing taxes from capital gains earned somewhere else. Notwithstanding, to safeguard their overall portfolio strategy, a few investors will quickly purchase a fundamentally the same as security to the one that was sold for a tax loss, trusting that it will return to, and maybe surpass, its former value.

For instance, in the event that an investor sells the [SPDR](/bugs) S&P 500 ETF (SPY) at a loss, they can quickly pivot and purchase the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF. Tax-loss harvesting has become progressively famous as algorithmic trading and investment management services, for example, [robo-advisors](/roboadvisor-roboadviser) are able to tax loss harvest for your benefit consequently.

The reasoning is that the two S&P 500 ETFs have different fund managers, different expense ratios, may imitate the underlying index utilizing an alternate methodology, and may have various levels of liquidity in the market. By and by, the IRS doesn't consider this type of transaction as including substantially indistinguishable securities thus it is permitted, albeit this might be subject to change in the future as the practice turns out to be more broad.

In another model, assuming a trader sells Berkshire Hathaway Class A shares at a loss to buy Berkshire Hathaway Class B shares, that might be viewed as a wash sale including substantially indistinguishable securities on the grounds that the two securities market a similar portfolio at various price points. Nonetheless, on the off chance that they sold the Berkshire Class A shares to buy shares of a closely related stock issued by another company, the wash sale rules wouldn't make a difference.

## Wash Sales

On the off chance that the IRS considers Berkshire Class An and Berkshire Class B shares to be substantially indistinguishable securities, the tax benefits acquired from the strategy wouldn't be permitted by the IRS , and would rather be viewed as a wash sale. In the United States, wash sale laws are arranged in the Internal Revenue code and Treasury regulations. Capital gains and losses, including those connected with wash sales, are reported utilizing IRS Schedule D (Form 1040).

Under Section 1091 of the treasury regulations, a wash sale happens when an investor sells a stock (or different securities) at a loss, and in something like 30 days before or after the sale:

-    Buys substantially indistinguishable stock or securities,
-    Procures substantially indistinguishable stock or securities in a completely taxable trade,
-    Goes into a contract or option to buy substantially indistinguishable stock or securities, or
-    Gets substantially indistinguishable stock for an individual retirement account (IRA) or Roth IRA.

## Features
- Generally, this can be tried not to by purchase comparable stock or securities issued by an alternate corporation.
- Traders can't anticipate utilizing tax-loss harvesting strategies in the event that they have sold and, reacquired substantially indistinguishable securities in 30 days or less.
- Substantially indistinguishable security is a phrase that comes from the tax clarification of the wash-sale rule.
