# Against Actual
## What Is an Against Actual Transaction?

The term "against genuine" alludes to a type of transaction consistently carried out in the [commodities futures markets](/commodityfuturescontract). In an against genuine transaction, holders of contradicting futures contracts for a similar commodity consent to settle their separate contracts by trading them with each other alongside a payment in view of the excess value of one contract over the other. This transaction permits the two players to close out their positions without expecting to one or the other make or receive physical delivery of the underlying commodity.

Against real transactions are important for futures market participants who aim to [speculate](/hypothesis) on the future price of commodities or to achieve financial objectives, for example, [hedging risk](/fence). Conversely, industrial buyers who depend on physical commodities for their production processes are bound to require physical delivery of their commodities.

## How Against Actual Transactions Work

Futures markets have existed for quite a long time for an extremely pragmatic purpose: to permit producers and buyers of essential goods to set reasonable prices for commodities in advance of their genuine production. A rancher who develops corn, for instance, has an agreement with a [wholesale buyer](/wholesaling) to supply a certain amount of corn at a set price on a specific date.

Today, be that as it may, a large percentage of the participants in the futures markets don't really plan to get physical delivery of the commodities underlying their contracts. All things being equal, they are financial buyers whose goal is to estimate on the future course of commodity prices. These buyers assist with supporting the commodities futures market by contributing [liquidity](/liquidity), making it more straightforward for other market participants to acquire efficient prices and take care of large requests.

Since these buyers don't plan to take physical delivery of the commodities they buy, they need a method for finishing off their positions for cash. In an against real transaction, the holder of a commodities futures contract that is coming close to its [delivery date](/deliverydate) will exchange that contract with another market participant who had recently sold a futures contract for that equivalent commodity. The two gatherings will then exchange cash in light of the price differential between the two futures contracts at the hour of the sale.

## Illustration of an Against Actual Transaction

Let us analyze this scenario in more detail. Assume we have two investors: Speculator An and Speculator B. The two players entered the commodity futures market fully intent on guessing on the price of oil, however they made inverse speculative wagers. Speculator A bought oil futures since she accepted oil prices would rise, while Speculator B sold oil futures since he accepted prices would fall.

Let us envision that oil prices fell after the two speculators made their trades, and that the two players are currently close to their delivery dates. This means that Speculator A will before long be getting delivery of physical oil, though Speculator B will before long be expected to deliver physical oil. Neither one of the gatherings has the goal to either receive or deliver oil, implying that the two speculators basically wish to settle out their contracts for cash.

The way that the two speculators can achieve their goal is by participating in an against real transaction, trading their futures contracts with each other. Since the price of oil fell, Speculator A would pay an extra premium to Speculator B to mirror the way that Speculator B's futures contract was more valuable. Along these lines, the two traders are able to understand their losses and profits without expecting to take or make physical delivery.
