# Catastrophe Swap
## What Is a Catastrophe Swap?

A catastrophe swap is an adjustable financial instrument traded in the [over-the-counter](/otc) (OTC) derivatives market that empowers insurers to prepare for enormous potential losses coming about because of a major natural disaster, like a hurricane or quake. These instruments empower insurers to transfer a portion of the risks they've assumed through policy issuance and give an alternative to purchasing reinsurance or giving a [catastrophe bond](/catastrophebond) (CAT), a high-yield debt instrument.

## Understanding a Catastrophe Swap

In finance, a [swap](/swap) is a contractual agreement between two parties to exchange cash flows for a given period. For a catastrophe swap, two parties — an insurer and a financial backer — exchange surges of periodic payments. The insurer's payments depend on a portfolio of the financial backer's securities, and the financial backer's payments depend on potential catastrophe losses as anticipated by a [catastrophe loss index](/catastrophe-loss-index) (CLI).

A catastrophe swap safeguards [insurance](/insurance) companies in the wake of a huge natural disaster when various policyholders file claims inside a short time period. This type of event puts significant financial pressure on insurance companies.

A catastrophe swap is a way for insurance companies to transfer a portion of the risks they've assumed, rather than purchasing [reinsurance](/reinsurance) or giving a CAT — a high-yield [debt instrument](/debtinstrument), as a rule insurance-linked, intended to bring funds up in case of a catastrophe, like a hurricane or a tremor.

In some catastrophe insurance swaps, insurers trade policies from various districts of a country. The goal here is to [diversify](/diversification) their portfolios. For example, a swap between an insurer in Florida or South Carolina and one in Washington or Oregon could moderate huge damage from a single hurricane.

## Illustration of a Catastrophe Swap

In 2014, the [World Bank](/worldbank) issued a three-year, $30 million catastrophe bond as part of its Capital-At-Risk notes program, which permits its clients to [hedge](/hedge) against natural disaster risk. The catastrophe bond, linked to the risk of damage by quakes and typhoons in 16 countries inside the Caribbean, was part of a catastrophe swap with the Caribbean Catastrophic Risk Insurance Facility (CCRIF).

Concurrent to the issuance of the $30 million [bond](/bond), the World Bank entered an agreement with the CCRIF, which repeated the terms of the bond. The World Bank's [balance sheets](/balancesheet) held the proceeds from the bond. In the event that a natural disaster happened, the principal of the bond would have been decreased by a settled upon amount spread out under the terms, and the proceeds would then have been paid to the CCRIF.
