## What Are Liabilities?
Liabilities' owed by an individual or a company. They are — in accounting terms — a company's current obligations, starting from past transactions, through which economic benefits are expected.
As such, liabilities are a source of funding generally as debt or borrowing from one more party that can be utilized to purchase assets or finance operations. Liabilities are likewise asserted by creditors who are committed to repay.
Liabilities are found below [assets](/assets) yet to be determined sheet section of the financial statement. For publicly traded companies, the financial statement is recorded quarterly and every year with the [Securities and Exchange Commission](/sec).
Liabilities, assets, and [shareholders' equity](/shareholdersequity) are the fundamental parts of the balance sheet. What's more, a company's balance sheet must be balanced — assets must rise to liabilities and shareholders' equity. Liabilities are measures that follow generally accepted accounting principles.
## What Are the Types of Liabilities?
Most liabilities can be generally sorted as one or the other current or non-current in light of how soon payments are due.
### Current
Liabilities that ordinarily are expected to be settled in something like one year after the date of the distributed balance sheet for a period are classified as current. This incorporates short-term borrowings and accounts payable, which are bills or solicitations for the purchase of goods or the payment of services from a vendor on credit.
Another important current liability is deferred income, otherwise called deferred revenue or unearned revenue, which is the point at which a company gets payment in advance of delivery of its goods or services.
Other current liabilities incorporate wages payable, interest payable, and accruals expenses that haven't been recorded on the company's books, which can be for employee and other operating costs. A few companies give a breakdown of their current liabilities, while others lump it all together.
### Non-Current
All liabilities not arranged as current are classified as non-current, or long-term. Deferred income can at times be classified as non-current since delivery of goods or services might take longer than a year after payment has been made. Different types of non-current liabilities are long-term financial liabilities like long-term debt, and deferred tax liabilities
Debt can be either current or non-current, contingent upon the length of maturity. Debt of a year or less can be quicker to change over into cash, while a company might hold longer onto debt with maturities surpassing one year.
## What Are Contingent Liabilities?
Once in a while, a company's potential liabilities are taken into account, and money is set to the side to cover them (practically similarly that banks have reserves against likely terrible loans). Contingent liabilities can incorporate money set to the side to cover lawsuits or guarantees, for instance. The downside to contingent liabilities is that a large amount may negatively influence a company's share price.
Contingent liabilities are generally referenced in the notes of the financial statement yet aren't recorded until they are followed through or are likely to happen. A contingent liability that is recognized is listed as an expense in the income statement and as a liability on the balance sheet.
## Liabilities Example: Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL)
Below is Apple's rundown of liabilities on its balance sheet, broken down into current and non-current liabilities. Companies, and Apple is no exception in spite of its large cash heap, take on debt as part of financing their operations. Term debt — both current and non-current — expanded, and Apple notes in its financial statement what changes in interest rates can mean for its interest payments.

## Why Are Liabilities Important?
Liabilities assist investors with figuring out a company's financial strength. A greater number of liabilities than assets could mean that a company has numerous debt obligations to meet and that could mean zeroing in more on repayment than on investing or growing its operations.

## FAQ
### Might Liabilities at any point Be Negative?
Negative liabilities are profoundly unusual. A negative liability would infer that a company has paid more than it was committed to repay.
### What's the Difference Between Liabilities and Debt?
Liabilities address all forms of financial obligations, while debt is a liability that explicitly addresses borrowing as a loan that must be repaid.
