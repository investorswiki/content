# Mid-Cap Fund
## What Is a Midcap Fund?

A mid-cap fund is a pooled investment vehicle (for example a mutual fund or ETF) that expressly invests in the stocks of [mid-cap](/midcapstock) companies, or companies with [market capitalizations](/marketcapitalization) ranging from approximately $2 billion to $10 billion.

## Understanding Mid-Cap Funds

Mid-cap funds give a diversified portfolio of mid-cap companies for investors. Mid-cap stock funds invest in firms with established organizations. Consequently, these companies have made equity capital markets a substantial part of their capital designs. Overall, mid-cap companies will generally offer more growth potential than large-cap stocks and with less [volatility](/volatility) than the small-cap segment. Mid-cap funds try to capitalize on this capital appreciation potential by creating funds that are diversified among mid-cap companies.

Many fund companies and indexes center around mid-cap stocks with an additional part like growth or value. Mid-cap funds can be actively managed or passively managed. The mid-cap segment of the market offers an extensive variety of investment options for investors. A portion of the mid-cap segment's most popular benchmarks are the S&P MidCap 400, the Russell 1000 MidCap Index, and the Wilshire US Mid-Cap Index. As of December 2020, the smallest member of the Wilshire US Mid-Cap Index was valued at $0.8 billion. The largest had a market capitalization of $23.4 billion.

## Characterizing Midcap

"Mid-cap" is the term given to companies with a market capitalization (or value) between $2 billion and $10 billion. As the name suggests, a mid-cap company falls in the middle between [large-cap](/large-cap) (or huge cap) and [small-cap](/small-cap) companies. Classifications like large-cap, mid-cap, and small-cap are just approximations and may change after some time.

Most [financial advisors](/financial-advisor) propose that the key to limiting risk is a diversified portfolio; investors ought to have a mix of small-cap, mid-cap, and large-cap stocks. In any case, a few investors see mid-cap stocks as a way to broaden risk as well. Small-cap stocks offer the most growth potential, yet that growth accompanies the most risk. Large-cap stocks offer the most stability, yet they offer lower growth possibilities. Mid-cap stocks are a hybrid of the two, giving both growth and stability.

## Benefits of Mid-Cap Funds

Mid-cap funds have a few advantages over both individual mid-cap stocks and other fund types. While less volatile than small-cap stocks, holding a couple of mid-cap funds is usually a lot riskier than holding several large-cap stocks. By investing in a mid-cap fund, investors can capture the growth potential of mid-cap funds without company-explicit risks.

Mid-cap funds can follow a somewhat unexpected pattern in comparison to one or the other large or small stocks. Because of this they are valuable for portfolio diversification. Historically, there have been long periods when either large or small stocks outflanked. Picking a mid-cap fund can keep investors from heading too far in some unacceptable path.

## Analysis of Mid-Cap Funds

By investing in a mid-cap fund rather than holding individual mid-cap stocks, investors can pass up massive gains. In particular, the [CAN SLIM](/canslim) system developed by [William J. O'Neil](/william-j-oneil) is frequently applied effectively to mid-cap stocks. The idea is that triumphant stocks can be spotted on their way up through the small caps. When stocks reach the mid-cap funds, the speculators are ready to profit. For example, O'Neil flagged Netflix (NFLX) as a top pick in 2009. Be that as it may, most investors are less fruitful at picking victors.
