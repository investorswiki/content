## Gapping and Stop Loss Orders

A trader can have a [stop-loss order](/stop-lossorder) filled essentially below their stop-loss price (for a long position) due to gapping.

The trader is finished off of their position at $25, not $22, bringing about an extra $3 per share loss.

## Gapping Trading Strategies

A position could be required on the day the stock gaps with a stop-loss order normally placed underneath the low of the gap bar. The gap ought to happen over a critical resistance level and trade on heavy volume to increase the possibilities of a profitable trade.

A stop-loss order is placed over the gap bar's high, following a gap up, with a profit target set close to the previous day's close. For a gap down, the trader buys, places a stop loss below the gap bar's low, and sets a profit target close to the previous day's close.

### Gaps as an Investing Signal

The following day the stock opened at $174.89 (just below the second arrow from the left) after a more regrettable than-expected earnings announcement. As such, investors who had purchased META at $217 would have lost almost 20% overnight, demonstrating the way that staggering a gap can be, even if utilizing a stop loss.
