The term Ras Al Khaimah Investment Authority (RAKIA) alludes to a licensing and promotional organization that advanced the economic development of and investment in Ras Al Khaimah (RAK) in the United Arab Emirates.

The organization was laid out by a decree issued by the region's ruler in 2005.

RAKIA turned out to be part of the RAK Economic Zone (RAKEZ) in April 2017.

## Figuring out the Ras Al Khaimah Investment Authority (RAKIA)

Ras Al Khaimah is an emirate in the northern part of the UAE, found under an hour's drive from Dubai. The region is known for its historic locales, mosques, and strongholds.

As referenced over, the Ras Al Khaimah Investment Authority was sent off in 2005 following a decree by Sheik Saqr Bin Muhammad Al Qasimi. His intent was to lay out "a business and industrial arena offering competitive free zone and non-free zone offices" in the region. RAKIA was comprised of two industrial parks with an area of in excess of 300 million square feet and housed in excess of 500 manufacturers and small-to fair sized ventures.

The organization, also known as the RAK Investment Authority, allowed the royal family to meet its objective of making the emirate a regional hub for manufacturing, service, and the travel industry while building a strong economy with sustainable growth in the emirate.

Businesses set up in the region's free trade zones partake in several benefits, for example, complete exemption from all taxes, total [repatriation](/repatriation) of capital and profits, and land leases at profoundly [concessional](/concession) rates.

> The United Arab Emirates has in excess of 40 free zones, which are economic areas that have special tax treatment on goods and services, and where companies are allowed to have 100% foreign ownership.

In April 2017, the RAK government announced the [merger](/merger) of both RAKIA and Ras Al Khaimah Free Trade Zone (RAK FTZ) into a single entity called the Ras Al Khaimah Economic Zone (RAKEZ).

It means to RAK an unmistakable place for [investment](/investment) through strategic infrastructure and business arrangements.
