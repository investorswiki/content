# Philippine Peso (PHP)
## What Is the Philippine Peso (PHP)?

The Philippine peso, abbreviated as PHP in foreign exchange (forex) markets, is the national currency of the Republic of the Philippines. The peso is known as the "piso" in the Filipino and Tagalog dialects.

The Philippine peso is comprised of 100 pennies or "sentimos" and is frequently addressed with the symbol \u20b1.

As of Jan. 9, 2022, one U.S. dollar was equivalent to 51.38 PHP. Throughout the course of recent years, its value has gone from lows below 48 pesos to a dollar to a high of 53.89 in late 2018.

## Grasping the Philippine Peso (PHP)

The southeast Asian archipelago presently known as the Republic of the Philippines was under Spanish rule for quite a long time and under U.S. rule for quite a long time. It was occupied by Japan from mid 1942 until Sept. 2, 1945, when World War II ended with Japan's surrender to the Allied powers.

The independent Republic of the Philippines was made in 1946. English and Filipino are the official dialects.

### Provincial Rule of the Philippines

The country momentarily acquired its independence in 1899 after a revolution contrary to Spanish rule prompted the creation of the First Philippine Republic. The Republic was fleeting. By 1901, the United States had attached the Philippines as part of the treaty with Spain that ended the Spanish-American War. The U..S. sent in military powers to shield its claim to the Philippines against the nation's nationalists, bringing about the three-extended Philippine-American War.

By 1901, the principal coins and paper money issued by the Philippine government had left circulation.

The U.S. then, at that point, laid out a Philippine currency that was pegged to the price of gold, and was around then worth about half the price of a U.S. dollar (USD). The peg of \u20b12/USD lasted until the country accomplished independence in 1946.

### The Republic of the Philippines

The Central Bank of the Philippines was made in 1949, and through the 1950s it endeavored to keep up with the 2:1 peg with the USD. This became unimaginable as a [black market](/blackmarket) for pesos began outside of the fixed system, where the \u20b1 regularly traded at 3:1.

The currency was devalued to \u20b13.90/USD, and in 1970 was devalued again to \u20b16.43/USD. While the country attempted to balance out the [exchange rate](/exchangerate), the currency kept on debasing. In 1983, it traded close \u20b111/USD and by 1986 it was close \u20b120/USD.

The New Central Bank Act of 1993 set the Philippine peso on a path to being a [free-drifting currency](/floatingexchangerate). While this permitted the exchange rate to turn out to be substantially higher than the previous pegged levels, it brought stability to the currency. The black market for the currency (which almost consistently mirrored a lower value of the \u20b1 than official channels) failed to exist.

At the point when our explorers return, they might have a few Philippine pesos they need to switch back over completely to U.S. dollars. Suppose they have \u20b15,000. Accept the exchange rate is as yet unchanged at 52.27, however recall that banks and currency exchanges normally take 3% to 5% on the two sides of the transaction.

Rather than just charging 52.27 for each USD, they will charge 53.84 to 54.88. That means that \u20b15,000 won't buy as numerous USDs. At 52.27, \u20b15,000 converts to $95.66. Yet, at 54.88, it just proselytes to $91.11, which is around 5% less.
