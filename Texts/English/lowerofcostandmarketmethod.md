The value of a decent can shift over the long haul. This holds significance, since, in such a case that the price at which the inventory can be sold falls below the [net realizable value](/nrv) of the thing, hence triggering a loss for the company, then the lower of cost or market method can be employed to record the loss.

## Grasping Lower of Cost or Market Method

The lower of cost or market method allows companies to record losses by recording the value of the impacted inventory things. This value might be diminished to the market value, which is defined as the middle value while contrasting the cost with supplant the inventory, the difference between the net realizable value and the commonplace profit on the thing, and the net realizable value of the thing. The amount by which the inventory thing was written down is recorded under cost of goods sold on the balance sheet.

The LCM method is part of the [GAAP](/gaap) rules utilized in the U.S. what's more, in international commerce. Practically all assets enter the accounting system with a value equivalent to acquisition cost. GAAP recommends a wide range of methods for adjusting asset values in subsequent reporting periods.

As of late, the [FASB](/fasb) issued an update to their code and standards that influence companies that utilization the [average cost](/averagecostmethod) and LIFO methods of inventory accounting. Companies that utilization these two methods of inventory accounting must now utilize the lower of cost or net realizable value method, which is more reliable with IFRS rules.

## Features
