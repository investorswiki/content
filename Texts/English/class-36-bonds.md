# Class 3-6 Bonds
## What Are Class 3-6 Bonds?

Class 3-6 bonds get their name because of their bond classification, not entirely settled by their [investment grade](/investmentgrade). These bonds are classified as non-investment grade for the motivations behind life insurance organizations' fixed-income portfolios in their general fund. Classes 1 and 2 are viewed as investment grade.

A non-investment grade bond conveys a rating that connotes a higher level of risk, or the probability that the bond issuer will go into [default](/default2). Credit ratings are critical on the grounds that they convey the risk associated with buying a certain bond.

## Grasping Class 3-6 Bonds

[The National Association of Insurance Commissioners](/nainsurancec) (NAIC), the standard-setting regulatory body represented by state insurance regulators, separates bonds into various classes in light of their investment grade. Classes 1 and 2 are viewed as investment-grade bonds, which are the least risky, or the least liable to go into default. Classes 3 through 6 are considered non-investment grade bonds; they are viewed as an inferior quality investment on the grounds that the issuer might default. Class 6 bonds are the most risky type of bonds to invest in.

Class 3-6 bonds are one of several classes of non-investment grade bonds held by an insurance company as reserves. Class 3-6 bonds are viewed as the most risky type of bonds issued by insurance regulators and are bound to go into default.

There are many types of bonds that can be classified in the Class 3 through 6 bond range. For instance, bonds that are at or close to their default limit are viewed as Class 6 bonds and carry a high amount of risk.

## Special Considerations

Examiners utilize various ratios to decide the feasibility of an insurance company. A fundamental analysis can incorporate a survey of the percentage of each bond class compared to the company's total bonds. Robust bond portfolios carry less risk; they will have more Class 1 and Class 2 bonds.

By assessing the classes of bonds an insurance company invests in, investors can gain a comprehension for the risks a company might face on the off chance that the number of claims it gets increments. In the event that an insurance company can't meet its obligations it could be considered an impaired insurer, and assuming it can't further develop its finances when impaired it might at last fail.

Instances of bond ratios include:

### Non-Investment Grade Bonds (Class 3-6) to Total Bonds

This ratio shows the extent of a company's bond portfolio at a greater risk for default and nonperformance compared to all bonds.

### Non-Investment Grade Bonds to Surplus and Asset Valuation Reserve (AVR)

This ratio shows how possibly non-performing bonds compare to the company's reserves.

### Class 6 Bonds to Total Bonds

This ratio shows the extent of a company's portfolio that is considered non-performing or close to default.

### Class 6 Bonds and Non-Performing Mortgages Compared to Total Bonds and Mortgages

This ratio shows the amount of a company's bond and real estate assets are non-performing.
