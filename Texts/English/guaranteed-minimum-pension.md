# Guaranteed Minimum Pension (GMP)
## What Is the Guaranteed Minimum Pension (GMP)?

The Guaranteed Minimum Pension is the base [pension](/pensionplan) that a United Kingdom occupational pension scheme must give those public sector employees who were contracted out of the State Earnings Related Pension Scheme (SERPS), between April 6, 1978, and April 5, 1997.

## Figuring out the Guaranteed Minimum Pension (GMP)

The guaranteed least pension amount paid was generally equivalent to the amount an employee would have received in the event that they had not been contracted out of the state pension scheme. Starting April 6, 1997, a reference scheme test supplanted the guaranteed least pension system. The test assessed the overall benefits given by the scheme rather than an individual guarantee for every participant. Assuming the scheme finished the assessment, it retained its ability to be contracted out, nonetheless.

There were two principal parts to the U.K's. old pension system: an essential state pension and the State Earnings Related Pension Scheme, otherwise called the Additional State Pension. Employees who paid [National Insurance Contributions](/national-insurance-contributions-nic) at the full rate developed an essential state pension. In any case, not all employees developed a SERPS. Many were contracted out of the state pension, either intentionally or in light of the fact that their pension plan did as such for their sake.

The government permitted employers that offered [defined benefit](/definedbenefitpensionplan) schemes to contract out their staff and pay a diminished rate of National Insurance Contributions. In exchange for paying lower rates into the National Insurance, the companies guaranteed that their pension would satisfy a base guideline of benefits. In short, they needed to basically match the SERPS pension that the worker would have received in any case. This payment became known as the guaranteed least pension.

Remarkably, workers whose employers offered defined contribution pensions didn't have a similar guarantee. Additionally excluded were those individuals who put their National Insurance [rebates](/discount) into personal pension schemes.

At the start, the state paid [cost-of-living](/cost-of-living) increments with the individual's state pension. In any case, after April 6, 1988, any cost-of-living increments turned into the responsibility of the occupational pension scheme. Starting there, increments followed the [Consumer Price Index](/consumerpriceindex) to a maximum of 3%.

## April 2016 GMP Changes

As of April 2016, the U.K. government impacted the state pension scheme in more than one way. As part of the adjustment, workers would never again build up [pension rights](/pensionable-administration) under SERPS.

Additionally, the government discontinued the practice of contracting out of the pension scheme. Starting April 2016, a system based on an oddball calculation decided the pension amount that resigning individuals would receive. Somebody who has been widely contracted out just receives the fundamental state pension figure.

## Features
- The Guaranteed Minimum Pension exists to offset wages to public sector U.K. employees.
- This approach to overseeing pensions was nullified in 2016. Assuming that there were employees getting a pension that would have recently been considered as a benefit for GMP, presently they are essentially paid the base rate.
- The GMP was brought forward as a method for ensuring companies were paying employees their merited pensions, even on the off chance that they deferred contributions.
