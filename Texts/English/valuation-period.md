## Computing Present and Future Values

In contemplating valuation, understanding the process is useful. With regards to valuation and annuities, there are available and future value formulas.

### Present Value

The [present value of an annuity](/present-value-annuity) is the present value of future payments from an annuity while figuring in a predefined rate of return or discount rate. The annuity's future cash flows are cut at the discount rate. The higher the discount rate, the lower the current value of the annuity.

This calculation depends on the concept of the [time value of money](/timevalueofmoney), which says that a dollar currently is worth in excess of a dollar earned later. This concept means that getting money today is worth more than getting a similar amount of money in the future in light of the fact that the money today can be invested at a given [rate of return](/rateofreturn).

For instance, getting a lump sum of $10,000 today is worth more than getting $1,000 each year for a very long time. The lump sum, whenever invested today, will be worth more toward the decade's end than incremental investments of $1,000 each. This is true even whenever invested at a similar rate of interest.

### Future Value

Knowing the [future value](/futurevalue) (FV) of an ordinary annuity formula is helpful when an investor knows the amount they can invest per period for a certain time frame period and needs to figure out the amount they will have from here on out. FV is likewise valuable information while making payments on a loan as it assists with working out the total cost of the loan.

Computing the [future value of the annuity](/future-value-annuity) requires working out the future value of each cash flow throughout some undefined time frame. Annuities have a number of cash flows. The future value calculation requires taking the value of each cash flow, figuring in the original investment and interest rate, and adding these values together to decide the accumulated future value.
