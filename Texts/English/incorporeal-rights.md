# Incorporeal Rights
## What Are Incorporeal Rights?

Incorporeal rights are rights to property that shouldn't be visible or contacted however are as yet enforceable by law. Generally, incorporeal rights have to do with [intangible property](/immaterial personal-property) like copyrights, licenses, rights-of-way, and [easements](/easement). Incorporeal rights are otherwise called elusive rights, and the incorporeal property is additionally called immaterial property.

## How Incorporeal Rights Work

Not at all like real property that can be physically measured, theoretical property is applied in nature. In any case, the rights associated with the elusive property — the incorporeal rights — are just all around as substantial as the rights associated with real property. Incorporeal rights don't cover unmistakable property, like real and personal property, for example land and equipment.

There are two types of elusive property: pure intangibles and documentary intangibles. Pure intangibles incorporate things, for example, obligations and intellectual property rights. Documentary intangibles incorporate assets tied to records, like bills of landing or promissory notes. In any case, because of the rise of technology and electronic reports, the distinction among pure and documentary intangibles are less distinct.

## Special Considerations

As a rule, incorporeal rights give the owner a set of legally enforceable claims, either over substantial property or over the ownership of elusive property. For instance, a creator who holds [copyright](/copyright) of their work has the incorporeal right to control when and how that work can be replicated.

Be that as it may, the writer doesn't have substantial rights over the completed book. The reader who purchases that book likewise purchases substantial or corporeal rights over the physical book as a piece of personal property that can be bought, sold, or obliterated at the owner's carefulness. Along these lines, incorporeal rights are unique in relation to the corporeal rights over the property carrying those incorporeal rights.

Just like different rights, incorporeal rights are transferable and inheritable. Theoretical property can be sold, traded, willed, or given. The rights associated with the elusive property will transfer alongside the property.

Such rights can incorporate [leases](/lease), easements, rights-of-way, [mortgages](/home loan), and subjugations. Along these lines, one can have incorporeal (or elusive) rights over a corporeal (or unmistakable) property, for example, justified to quiet delight in a property that is consulted with a legitimate lease agreement.

The second sort of incorporeal right is **jura in re propria**, which alludes to the ownership of elusive property. This type of right incorporates brand names, copyrights, [patents](/patent), and different types of [intellectual property](/intellectualproperty). Along these lines, one can have full ownership of property that is incorporeal (or theoretical) and doesn't have a physical presence.
