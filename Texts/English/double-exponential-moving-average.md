# Double Exponential Moving Average (DEMA)
## What Is a Double Exponential Moving Average (DEMA)?

The double exponential moving average (DEMA) is a [technical indicator](/technicalindicator) that was formulated to reduce the lag in the outcomes delivered by a traditional moving average. Technical traders use it to reduce the amount of "[noise](/noise)" that can distort the movements on a price chart.

Like any [moving average](/movingaverage), the DEMA is utilized to demonstrate the trend in the price of a stock or other asset. By tracking its price after some time, the trader can spot an uptrend, when the price moves over its average, or a downtrend, when the price moves below its average. At the point when the price crosses the average, it might signal a supported change in the trend.

As its name suggests, the DEMA utilizes two [exponential moving averages](/ema) (EMAs) to dispense with [lag](/laggingindicator) in the charts.

This variation on the moving average was presented by Patrick Mulloy in a 1994 article "Smoothing Data With Faster Moving Averages" in **Technical Analysis of Stocks and Commodities** magazine.

## The Formula for the Double Exponential Moving Average Is:

## Step by step instructions to Calculate the Double Exponential Moving Average

There are just four moves toward this calculation:

1. Pick any lookback period, like five periods, 15 periods, or 100 periods.
1. Ascertain the EMA for that period. This is EMA(n).
1. Apply an EMA with the equivalent lookback period to EMA(n). This delivers a smoothed EMA.
1. Duplicate two times the EMA(n) and deduct the smoothed EMA.

## What Does the Double Exponential Moving Average Tell You?

Albeit the indicator is called a double exponential moving average, the equation doesn't depend on utilizing a double exponential smoothing factor. All things considered, the equation doubles the EMA, however at that point offsets the lag by deducting a smoothed EMA.

On account of the complexity of the equation, DEMA calculations require a greater number of data than straight exponential moving average (EMA) calculations. Notwithstanding, accounting sheets and technical charting software can without much of a stretch compute DEMAs.

> The DEMA is utilized most frequently by informal investors and swing traders. Long-term investors might be better off utilizing a standard moving average.
>
### Who Uses DEMAs and Why

DEMAs respond faster than traditional moving averages, so their users are bound to be informal investors or [swing traders](/swingtrading). Long-term investors, who trade less habitually, may find that a traditional moving average turns out better for them.

DEMAs are utilized fundamentally to spot a vertical or descending trend in price and break down its strength. Traders watch at a cost to move above or below the DEMA. Some utilization numerous DEMAs with various lookback periods, looking for the DEMAs to cross one another.

Like any moving average, a DEMA additionally can be utilized to show price support or resistance. That is, it can assist with distinguishing the price point at which a trend will delay or even reverse.

### Instructions to Read the DEMA

It is straightforward to Read the DEMA. At the point when the price of an asset is over the DEMA, and the DEMA is rising, it affirms an uptrend in price. At the point when the price is below the DEMA, and the DEMA is falling, that affirms a downtrend.

As verified over, a few traders display at least two DEMAs with various think back periods on a single chart. Trade signals could be produced when these [lines cross](/movingaverage).

For instance, a trader might buy on the off chance that a 20-period DEMA crosses over a 50-period DEMA, or sell when the 20-period crosses back below the 50-period.

The DEMA might be less dependable when used to show possible support and resistance price points. A trader seeing a DEMA, or any moving average, to pinpoint likely support or resistance points ought to ensure that it has served this function in the past. If not, it probably won't from here on out.

## Double Exponential Moving Average (DEMA) and the Triple Exponential Moving Average (TEMA)

As the names infer, the double EMA incorporates the EMA of an EMA. The [triple EMA](/triple-exponential-moving-average) (TEMA) has an even more complex calculation, including an EMA of an EMA of an EMA.

The goal is still to reduce lag, and the triple EMA has even less lag than the double EMA.

> A DEMA, or any moving average, will probably be more dependable in the event that a longer period of time is chosen for tracking. Time reduces the effects of "noise" in the markets.
>
## Limitations of the Double Exponential Moving Average

Moving averages can give practically zero understanding during times when the price of an asset is [choppy](/choppymarket) or range-bound. No dependable trend can be recognized at such times. The price will as often as possible cross this way and that across the DEMA.

Also, the strength of the DEMA is its ability to reduce lag, yet that can be its weakness in certain conditions.

The reduced lag gets the trader out faster, decreasing losses. Yet reduced lag can likewise energize [overtrading](/overtrading) by giving too many signals. The indicator might advise a trader to sell when the price takes a minor action, in this way missing out on a greater opportunity in the event that the trend proceeds.

The DEMA is best utilized related to different forms of analysis, for example, [price action](/price-action) analysis and fundamental analysis.

## Features
- A moving average tracks the average price of an asset throughout some stretch of time to spot the place where it lays out a recent fad, moving above or below its average price.
- The DEMA tends to this flaw, decreasing lag time in the indicator.
- The double exponential moving average (DEMA) is a variation on a technical indicator that is utilized to distinguish a potential uptrend or downtrend in the price of a stock or other asset.
- The DEMA, consequently, has a more grounded filter for the "noise" of irrelevant market action that can distort charted results.
- A few traders see a flaw in the standard moving average: It makes some lag memories that increments with the length of the time span being charted.
## FAQ
### What Is the Difference Between a Simple Moving Average and DEMA?
The double exponential moving average might be best depicted as a "smoothed" simple moving average.A standard moving average displays a lag time that increments with the amount of time being charted. The double exponential moving average looks to shorten that lag time to a predictable level.Overall, it provides the trader with a prior warning of a change toward an asset's price.
### What Is the Most Accurate Moving Average?
The precision of a moving average depends by and large on the length of the time span being followed. The most generally utilized moving average periods are 50-day, 100-day, and 200-day moving averages.Historically talking, the longer the term the more accurate the indicator. This is on the grounds that the everyday "noise" of the markets lessens in impact after some time. It requires investment for a trend to explain.
### What Is MACD DEMA?
The [moving average intermingling/divergence](/macd) (MACD) is an indicator that looks to add greater knowledge to the moving average by determining the relative momentum of the price movement. The MACD is calculated by deducting the 26-period EMA from the 12-period EMA.The result might assist a trader with determining whether a price trend has all the earmarks of being acquiring or losing strength.Some traders use MACD in combination with the DEMA as opposed to with a standard moving average.
### How Do You Use a Double Exponential Moving Average?
The double exponential moving average, similar to any moving average, is intended to trigger a buy or sell signal in view of the price movements over the long haul of a given asset. The signal is triggered by a supported change upwards or downwards of the asset's price.
