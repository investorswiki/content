## What Is a Disclaimer Trust?

A disclaimer trust is a type of [trust](/trust) that contains embedded provisions, generally remembered for a will, permitting an enduring spouse to put specific [assets](/asset) under the trust by disclaiming ownership of a portion of the estate. Disclaimed property interests are then transferred to the trust, without being taxed.

## How Disclaimer Trusts Work

On the off chance that an individual passes away and leaves their [estate](/estate) to a spouse, the spouse may [disclaim](/disclaim) a few interests in the estate, which then pass straightforwardly to the trust like it were the original beneficiary.

Provisions can be written into the trust that accommodate ordinary [payouts](/payout) from the trust to support survivors. For instance, a trust can accommodate enduring minor children as long as the enduring spouse chooses to disclaim [inherited](/inheritance) assets, passing them on to the trust.

Disclaimer trusts expect that the survivor act as indicated by the desires of the deceased, and disclaim ownership of a portion of the assets that the deceased has passed on. In the above model, in the event that the enduring spouse doesn't disclaim ownership of any portion of the estate, then, at that point, the deceased's desire to transfer assets to the enduring minor children goes unfulfilled.

An enduring spouse or the predetermined inheritors of an estate make some legal memories period, generally as long as nine months from the date of death, to lay out a trust for the disclaimed assets. On the off chance that they fail to do as such, every one of the assets contained in a [will](/will) are [taxed](/taxes).
