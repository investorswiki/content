# Price-to-Cash Flow (P/CF) Ratio
## What Is the Price-to-Cash Flow (P/CF) Ratio?

The price-to-cash flow (P/CF) ratio is a stock valuation indicator or multiple that measures the value of a stock's price relative to its [operating cash flow](/operatingcashflow) per share. The ratio uses operating cash flow (OCF), which adds back non-cash expenses, for example, depreciation and amortization to net income.

P/CF is especially useful for esteeming stocks that have positive cash flow yet are not profitable because of large [non-cash charges](/noncashcharge).

### Instructions to Calculate the Price-to-Cash Flow (P/CF) Ratio

To keep away from volatility in the multiple, a 30-or 60-day [average price](/averageprice) can be utilized to get a more stable stock value that isn't skewed by random market movements.

The operating cash flow (OCF) used in the denominator of the ratio is obtained through a calculation of the [trailing 12-month](/ttm) (TTM) OCFs generated by the firm divided by the number of [shares outstanding](/outstandingshares).

As well as figuring it out on a per-share basis, the calculation should likewise be possible on a whole-company basis by isolating a company's total [market value](/marketvalue) by its total OCF.

## What Does the Price-to-Cash Flow (P/CF) Ratio Tell You?

The P/CF ratio measures how much cash a company generates relative to its stock price, rather than what it records in earnings relative to its stock price, as measured by the [price-earnings (P/E) ratio](/price-earningsratio).

The P/CF ratio is supposed to be a better investment valuation indicator than the P/E ratio because cash flows can't be manipulated as easily as [earnings](/earnings), which are affected by accounting treatment for items, for example, [depreciation](/depreciation) and other non-cash charges. Some companies might appear unprofitable because of large non-cash expenses, for example, even however they have positive cash flows.

## Example of the Price-to-Cash Flow (P/CF) Ratio

Consider a company with a share price of $10 and 100 million shares outstanding. The company has an OCF of $200 million in a given year. Its OCF per share is as follows:
<span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mfrac><mtext>$200 Million</mtext><mtext>100 Million Shares</mtext></mfrac><mo>=</mo><mi mathvariant="normal">$</mi><mn>2</mn></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\frac{\text{\$200 Million}}{\text{100 Million Shares}} = \$2</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:1.2639999999999998em;vertical-align:-0.345em;"></span><span class="mord"><span class="mopen nulldelimiter"></span><span class="mfrac"><span class="vlist-t vlist-t2"><span class="vlist-r"><span class="vlist" style="height:0.9189999999999999em;"><span style="top:-2.6550000000000002em;"><span class="pstrut" style="height:3em;"></span><span class="sizing reset-size6 size3 mtight"><span class="mord mtight"><span class="mord text mtight"><span class="mord mtight">100 Million Shares</span></span></span></span></span><span style="top:-3.23em;"><span class="pstrut" style="height:3em;"></span><span class="frac-line" style="border-bottom-width:0.04em;"></span></span><span style="top:-3.394em;"><span class="pstrut" style="height:3em;"></span><span class="sizing reset-size6 size3 mtight"><span class="mord mtight"><span class="mord text mtight"><span class="mord mtight">$200 Million</span></span></span></span></span></span><span class="vlist-s">​</span></span><span class="vlist-r"><span class="vlist" style="height:0.345em;"><span></span></span></span></span></span><span class="mclose nulldelimiter"></span></span><span class="mspace" style="margin-right:0.2777777777777778em;"></span><span class="mrel">=</span><span class="mspace" style="margin-right:0.2777777777777778em;"></span></span><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.80556em;vertical-align:-0.05556em;"></span><span class="mord">$</span><span class="mord">2</span></span></span></span>
The company consequently has a P/CF ratio of 5 or 5x ($10 share price/OCF per share of $2). This means that the company's investors will pay $5 for every dollar of cash flow, or that the association's market value covers its OCF five times.

Alternatively, one can calculate the P/CF ratio on a whole-company level by taking the ratio of the company's [market capitalization](/marketcapitalization) to its OCF. The market capitalization is $10 x 100 million shares = $1,000 million, so the ratio can likewise be calculated as $1,000 million/$200 million = 5.0, which is the same result as computing the ratio on a [per-share basis](/persharebasis).

## Special Considerations

The optimal level of this ratio depends on the sector in which a company operates and its stage of maturity. A new and rapidly developing technology company, for instance, may trade at a lot higher ratio than a utility that has been in business for quite a long time.

This is because, albeit the technology company may just be possibly profitable, investors will actually want to give it a higher valuation because of its growth prospects. The utility, then again, has stable cash flows yet few growth prospects and, as a result, trades at a lower valuation.

There is no single figure that points to an optimal P/CF ratio. However, generally speaking, a ratio in the low single digits might indicate the stock is undervalued, while a higher ratio might suggest potential overvaluation.

## The P/CF Ratio versus the Price-to-Free-Cash Flow Ratio

The [price-to-free-cash flow](/pricetofreecashflow) ratio is a more thorough measure than the P/CF ratio.

However very like P/CF, this metric is considered a more exact measure because it uses [free cash flow](/freecashflow) (FCF), which deducts capital expenditures (CapEx) from a company's total OCF, thereby reflecting the genuine cash flow available to fund non-asset-related growth. Companies use this metric when they need to expand their [asset bases](/asset-base) either to develop their businesses or simply to keep up with acceptable levels of FCF.

## Features
- The P/CF multiple functions admirably for companies that have large non-cash expenses like depreciation.
- Some analysts prefer P/CF over price-to-earnings (P/E) since earnings can be more easily manipulated than cash flows.
- A low P/CF multiple may imply that a stock is undervalued in the market.
- The price-to-cash flow (P/CF) ratio is a multiple that compares a company's market value to its operating cash flow or its stock price per share to operating cash flow per share.
