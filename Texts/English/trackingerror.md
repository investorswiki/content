# Tracking Error
## What Is a Tracking Error?

Tracking mistake is the [divergence](/divergence) between the price behavior of a position or a portfolio and the price behavior of a benchmark. This is many times with regards to a [hedge fund](/hedge), [mutual fund](/mutualfund), or [exchange-traded fund](/etf) (ETF) that didn't function as really as planned, making an unforeseen profit or loss.

Tracking blunder is reported as a [standard deviation](/standarddeviation) percentage difference, which reports the difference between the return an investor gets and that of the [benchmark](/benchmark) they were endeavoring to emulate.

## Grasping a Tracking Error

Since portfolio risk is frequently measured against a benchmark, tracking mistake is a generally utilized measurement to check how well an investment is performing. Tracking mistake shows an investment's consistency versus a benchmark over a given period of time. Even portfolios that are impeccably indexed against a benchmark act uniquely in contrast to the benchmark, even however this difference on an everyday, quarter-to-quarter, or year-to-year basis might be very slight. The measure of tracking blunder is utilized to evaluate this difference.

Tracking blunder is the standard deviation of the difference between the returns of an investment and its benchmark. Given a sequence of returns for an investment or portfolio and its benchmark, tracking blunder is calculated as follows:

>
> Tracking Error = Standard Deviation of (P - B)
>
- Where P is portfolio return and B is benchmark return.

According to an investor's point of view, tracking mistake can be utilized to assess [portfolio managers](/portfoliomanager). On the off chance that a manager is acknowledging low [average returns](/averagereturn) and has a large tracking blunder, it is an indication that there is something fundamentally amiss with that investment and that the investor should no doubt track down a replacement.

It might likewise be utilized to forecast performance, especially for quantitative portfolio managers who build risk models that incorporate the probable factors that influence price changes. The managers then, at that point, build a portfolio that utilizes the type of constituents of a benchmark (like style, leverage, momentum, or market cap) to make a portfolio that will have a tracking mistake that closely sticks to the benchmark.

## Special Considerations
### Factors That Can Affect a Tracking Error

The net asset value (NAV) of an index fund is normally disposed toward being lower than its benchmark since funds have fees, while an index doesn't. A high [expense ratio](/expenseratio) for a fund can adversely affect the fund's performance. In any case, it is workable for fund managers to defeat the negative impact of fund fees and outperform the underlying index by doing a better than expected job of portfolio [rebalancing](/rebalancing), overseeing dividends or interest payments, or securities lending.

Past fund fees, a number of different factors can influence a fund's tracking mistake. One important factor is the degree to which a fund's holdings match the holdings of the underlying index or benchmark. Many funds are comprised of just the fund manager's concept of a representative sample of the securities that make up the genuine index. There are regularly likewise differences in weighting between a fund's assets and the assets of the index.

[Illiquid](/illiquid) or thinly-traded securities can likewise increase the chance of a tracking mistake, since this frequently leads to prices contrasting essentially from market price when the fund buys or sells such securities because of larger [bid-ask spreads](/bid-askspread). At last, the level of volatility for an index can likewise influence the tracking mistake.

Sector, international, and dividend ETFs will more often than not have higher absolute tracking errors; broad-based equity and bond ETFs will generally have lower ones. [Management expense ratios](/expenseratio) (MER) are the most noticeable reason for tracking blunder and there will in general be a direct correlation between the size of the MER and tracking mistake. Yet, different factors can mediate and be more critical now and again.

### Premiums and Discounts to Net Asset Value

[Premiums](/premium) or [discounts](/rebate) to NAV might happen when investors bid the market price of an ETF above or below the NAV of its basket of securities. Such divergences are typically rare. On account of a premium, the authorized participant ordinarily [arbitrages](/exchange) it away by purchasing securities in the ETF basket, trading them for ETF units, and selling the units on the stock market to earn a profit (until the premium is no more). Premiums and discounts as high as 5% have been known to happen, especially for thinly traded ETFs.

### Optimization

At the point when there are thinly traded stocks in the benchmark index, the ETF provider can't buy them without pushing their prices up substantially, so it utilizes a sample containing the more liquid stocks to proxy the index. This is called portfolio optimization.

### Diversification Constraints

ETFs are registered with regulators as mutual funds and have to abide by the applicable regulations. Of note are two diversification requirements: 75% of its assets must be invested in cash, government securities, and securities of other investment companies, and something like 5% of the total assets can be invested in any one security. This can make issues for ETFs tracking the performance of a sector where there are a ton of predominant companies.

### Cash Drag

Indexes don't have cash holdings, however ETFs do. Cash can gather at stretches due to dividend payments, overnight balances, and trading activity. The lag among getting and reinvesting the cash can lead to a decline in performance known as [drag](/performance_drag). Dividend funds with high payout yields are generally powerless.

### Index Changes

ETFs track indexes and when the indexes are refreshed, the ETFs need to follow suit. Refreshing the ETF portfolio causes transaction costs. What's more, it may not generally be imaginable to do it the same way as the index. For instance, a stock added to the ETF might be at an unexpected price in comparison to what the index maker chose.

### Capital-Gains Distributions

ETFs are more tax-efficient than mutual funds however have in any case been known to convey [capital gains](/capitalgain) that are taxable in the hands of unitholders. Despite the fact that it may not be promptly apparent, these distributions make an unexpected performance in comparison to the index on an after-tax basis. Indexes with a high level of turnover in companies (e.g., mergers, acquisitions, and [spin-offs](/side project)) are one source of capital-gains distributions. The higher the turnover rate, the higher the probability the ETF will be constrained to sell securities at a profit.

### Securities Lending

Some ETF companies might offset tracking errors through security lending, which is the practice of lending out holdings in the ETF portfolio to hedge funds for [short selling](/shortselling). The lending fees collected from this practice can be utilized to lower tracking mistake provided that this is true wanted.

### Currency Hedging

International ETFs with currency hedging may not follow a benchmark index due to the costs of currency hedging, which are not generally typified in the MER. Factors influencing hedging costs incorporate market volatility and interest-rate differentials, which impact the pricing and performance of forward contracts.

### Futures Roll

Commodity ETFs, generally speaking, track the price of a commodity through the futures markets, buying the contract nearest to expiry. As the weeks pass and the contract approaches expiration, the ETF provider will sell it (to try not to take delivery) and buy the next month's contract. This operation, known as the "roll," is rehashed consistently. In the event that contracts further from expiration have higher prices ([contango](/contango)), the roll into the next month will be at a higher price, which causes a loss. In this way, even on the off chance that the spot price of the commodity remains something very similar or rises marginally, the ETF might in any case show a decline. Vice versa, assuming that futures further away from expiration have lower prices ([backwardation](/backwardation)), the ETF will have a vertical bias.

### Keeping up with Constant Leverage

** **Leveraged and inverse ETFs use trades, forwards, and futures to repeat consistently a few times the direct or inverse return of a benchmark index. This requires rebalancing the basket of derivatives daily to guarantee they deliver the predetermined various of the index's change every day.

## Illustration of a Tracking Error

For instance, expect that there is a [large-cap](/large-cap) mutual fund benchmarked to the S&P 500 index. Next, expect that the mutual fund and the index realized the following returns over a given five-year period:

- Mutual Fund: 11%, 3%, 12%, 14% and 8%.
- S&P 500 index: 12%, 5%, 13%, 9% and 7%.
Given this data, the series of differences is then, at that point (11% - 12%), (3% - 5%), (12% - 13%), (14% - 9%) and (8% - 7%). These differences equivalent - 1%, - 2%, - 1%, 5%, and 1%. The standard deviation of this series of differences, the tracking blunder, is 2.50%.

## Highlights
- The tracking blunder can be seen as an indicator of how actively a fund is managed and its relating risk level.
- Tracking blunder is the difference in real performance between a position (normally a whole portfolio) and its comparing benchmark.
- Assessing a past tracking blunder of a portfolio manager might give understanding into the level of benchmark risk control the manager might demonstrate from here on out.
