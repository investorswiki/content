The different investment levels are utilized to reduce risk in changing market conditions. You can risk more in a rising market since you are bound to get your ARV or better when you sell. In a falling market, you are less inclined to get your ARV, so your investment ought to be more modest.

## The Bottom Line

By and large, short-sale homes are in reasonable condition, and keeping in mind that the purchase price may be higher than a foreclosure, the costs of making the home marketable can be a lot of lower, and the disadvantages to the seller less serious.

Be that as it may, due to the extended cycle, buyers and sellers must stand by. An experienced real estate agent can assist you with deciding a fair offer and haggle with the bank.
