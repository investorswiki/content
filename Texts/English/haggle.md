## What Is to Haggle?

To haggle is when two parties engaged with a transaction, for example, the purchase of a decent and service [negotiate](/exchange) the price until the two players can mutually settle on a fair price. The most common way of wheeling and dealing includes two parties making sequential offers and [counteroffers](/counteroffer) to one another until a price is agreed upon. The individual attempting to buy the great and service is attempting to pay the least amount conceivable, while the seller's primary objective is to expand the selling price. Wheeling and dealing likewise may go by the names bargaining, objecting, trading, or casual arranging.

The act of wrangling has been around since antiquated times and proceeds right up to the present day. It is a common practice in real estate [negotiations](/discussion), vehicle acquisitions, and at casual swap meets — while it is rarely utilized in retail settings, for example, at supermarkets, drug stores, or brand-name clothing stores.

## Grasping Haggle

Not all transactions are available to bargaining. Both strict convictions and regional customs might decide if the seller will engage in bargaining. Internationally, wrangling has different accepted levels of tolerance. In Europe and North America, wrangling is generally accepted for bigger ticket things like vehicles, jewelry, and real estate — yet not for more modest everyday things like brushes or a gallon of milk.

Notwithstanding, in different areas around the world, wrangling for more modest things is generally accepted and is part of the culture. In these locales, children are educated to haggle early on to guarantee that they are getting the best-seen deal while making any type of purchase.

The acceptance of wheeling and dealing can not entirely set in stone by location. In department and supermarkets, wrangling is frequently explicitly disallowed, however at places like swap meets, open air marketplaces, and markets, wheeling and dealing is accepted and encouraged. Many believe wrangling to be an art and an expertise of influence as opposed to a rational economic activity.

## Special Considerations

Different economic hypotheses have been proposed to make sense of the most common way of wrangling. The behavioral theory suggests that certain individuals have various characters or attitudes toward dealings as opposed to accepting prices as they are given. The [game theory](/gametheory) proposes answers for bargaining issues as part of strategic action and can be deciphered as part of arriving at a [Nash](/nash-equilibrium) Equilibrium.

Wrangling is likewise thought about while considering retail pricing theory. Mainstream ([neoclassical](/neoclassical)) economics, in any case, assumes that all market prices not entirely settled by supply and demand thus there would be no requirement at wheeling and dealing since all costs would constantly mirror an equilibrium level.
