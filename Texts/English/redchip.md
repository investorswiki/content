Red-chip stocks are thus expected to keep up with the filing and reporting requirements of the Hong Kong exchange. This makes them an important source for foreign investors who wish to take part in the fast growth of the Chinese economy.

## Figuring out Red Chips

The name "red chip" may sound like "[blue chip](/bluechip)," however the two terms should not be confused. A large, notable, and financially stable company might be referred to as a blue chip. A distinguishing feature of a red-chip stock, in contrast, is a sizable Chinese government stake in the company. Red chips take their name from China's red flag, and the name mirrors the Chinese government's partial ownership of the company. Red-chip firms are not really large or notable.

H-shares are shares of companies that are incorporated in central area China yet traded on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange or another foreign exchange. Red chips, then again, must be incorporated outside central area China.
