It accounts for the job of technology in an economy by measuring its productivity with respect to steady labor and capital. The concept has its underlying foundations in a 1957 article, called "Technical Change and Aggregate Production Function." Based on Gross National Product (GNP) data, Solow reasoned that half of its overall growth happened due to labor and capital. Technical change represented the leftover.

In 1958, Solow co-wrote the book **Linear Programming and Economic Analysis**. He later distributed **Growth Theory â€” An Exposition** in 1970 and **The Labor Market as a Social Institution** in 1990. Solow's collaborations with Samuelson bore a lot of natural product, with the two economists creating cooperate on Von Neumann's Growth Theory, Theory of Capital, Linear Programming, and the Phillips Curve.
