# Black's Model
## What Is Black's Model?

Black's Model, in some cases called Black-76, is an adjustment of his prior and more well known [Black-Scholes](/blackscholes) options pricing model. Not at all like the previous model, the reexamined model is helpful for esteeming options on [futures contracts](/futurescontract). Black's Model has likewise been utilized in the application of capped variable rate loans and is additionally applied to price an assortment of others derivatives.

## How Black's Model Works

In 1976, American economist Fischer Black, one of the co-designers along with [Myron Scholes](/myron-scholes) and [Robert Merton](/robert-c-merton) of the Black-Scholes model for options pricing (which was presented in 1973), demonstrated how the Black-Scholes model could be modified to value European call or put options on futures contracts. He spread out his theory in a scholarly paper named, "The Pricing of Commodity Contracts." For this explanation, the Black model is likewise alluded to as the Black-76 model.

Black's objectives recorded as a hard copy the paper were to work on the current comprehension of commodity options and their pricing and present a model that could be utilized to model pricing. Existing models around then, including Black-Scholes and [Merton models](/mertonmodel), had been not able to address this problem. In his 1976 model, Black portrays the futures price of a commodity as, "the price at which we can consent to buy or sell it at a given time in the future without putting up any money now." He likewise hypothesized the total long interest in any commodity contract must rise to the total short interest.

Black's model additionally can apply to other financial instruments typically utilized by financial institutions like global banks, mutual funds, and hedge funds: to be specific [interest rate derivatives](/interest-rate-subordinate), covers, and floors (which are intended to offer protection from big swings in interest rates), as well as bond options and swaptions (financial instruments that join an interest rate swap and an option, they can be utilized to hedge against interest rate risk and to save financing flexibility).

## Black 76 Model Assumptions

Black's 76 model makes several presumptions, including that future prices, are log-normally distributed and that the expected change in futures price is zero. One of the key differences between his 1976 model and the Black-Scholes model (which expects a realized risk-free interest rate, options that must be practiced at maturity, no commissions and that volatility is held steady), is that his reconsidered model purposes forward prices to model the value of a futures option at maturity versus the spot prices Black-Scholes utilized. It additionally accepts that volatility is dependent on time, instead of being steady.

## Features
- Like other financial models, Black 76 depends on several suppositions, for example, a log-normal distribution of prices and zero trading costs - some of which are more sensible than others.
- The model was developed by Fischer Black by explaining on the prior and all the more notable Black-Scholes-Merton options pricing formula.
- Black's Model, otherwise called the Black 76 Model, is a flexible derivatives pricing model for esteeming assets like options on futures and capped variable rate debt securities.
