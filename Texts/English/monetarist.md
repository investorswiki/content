## What Is a Monetarist?

A monetarist is a [economist](/economist) who holds the strong conviction that [money supply](/moneysupply) — including physical currency, deposits, and credit — is the primary factor influencing demand in an economy. Thusly, the economy's presentation — its growth or contraction — can be regulated by changes in the money supply.

The key driver behind this conviction is the impact of [inflation](/inflation) on an economy's growth or wellbeing and the possibility that by controlling the money supply, one have some control over the inflation rate.

## Grasping Monetarists

At its core, [monetarism](/monetarism) is an economic formula. It states that money supply duplicated by its velocity (the rate at which money changes hands in an economy) is equivalent to nominal expenditures in the economy (goods and services) duplicated by price. While this seems OK, monetarists say velocity is generally stable, which has been bantered since the 1980s.

The most notable monetarist is [Milton Friedman](/milton-friedman), who composed the first serious analysis involving monetarist theory in quite a while 1963 book, **A Monetary History of The United States, 1867-1960**. In the book, Friedman alongside Anna Jacobson Schwartz contended for monetarism as a method for combatting the economic impacts of inflation. They contended that a lack of money supply enhanced the financial crisis of the late 1920s and prompted the [Great Depression](/great_depression), and that a consistent increase in the money supply in accordance with growth in the economy would deliver growth without inflation.

The monetarist view was a minority view in both scholar and applied economics until the financial difficulties of the 1970s. As unemployment and inflation soared, the predominant economic theory [Keynesian economics](/keynesianeconomics) couldn't make sense of the current economic riddle introduced by economic contraction and simultaneous inflation.

Keynesian economics said that high unemployment and economic contraction would lead to deflation through a collapse in demand and on the other hand that inflation was the consequence of demand exceeding supply in an over-warmed economy. The last collapse of the gold standard in 1971, the oil shocks of the mid-1970s, and the beginning of de-industrialization in the United States in the late 1970s all contributed to [stagflation](/stagflation), another phenomenon that was challenging for Keynesian economics to make sense of.

Monetarism, in any case, contended that limiting the money supply would kill inflation, which would be an essential step to directing the economy even assuming it came at the cost of a short-term recession. That is precisely exact thing Paul Volcker, the head of the Federal Reserve from 1979 to 1987, did. The outcome was a last justification of monetarism according to economists and policymakers.

## Instances of Monetarists and Monetarism

Most monetarists went against the gold standard in that the limited supply of gold would slow down the amount of money in the system, which would lead to inflation, something monetarists accept ought to be controlled by the money supply, which is absurd under the gold standard except if gold is ceaselessly mined.

Milton Friedman is the most well known monetarist. Different monetarists incorporate former Federal Reserve Chair [Alan Greenspan](/alangreenspan) and former British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher.
