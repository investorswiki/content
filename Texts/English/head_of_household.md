# Head of Household (HOH)
## What Is Head of Household (HOH)?

Taxpayers might file tax returns as head of household (HOH) on the off chance that they are unmarried and pay the greater part the cost of supporting and housing a qualifying person. Taxpayers eligible to group themselves as a HOH get higher [standard deductions](/standarddeduction) and lower tax rates than taxpayers who file as single or married filing separately.

## Figuring out Head of Household (HOH)

Head of household is a [filing status](/filingstatus) available to taxpayers who meet certain qualifying thresholds. They must file separate individual tax returns, be viewed as unmarried, and have a qualifying [dependent](/dependent), like a child or parent. Further, the HOH must pay more than one-half the cost of supporting the qualifying person and more than one-half the cost of keeping up with that qualifying person's primary home.

> The IRS gives a breakdown of what comprises a qualified person in Table 4 of Publication 501.

### Unmarried

To be considered unmarried, the HOH must be single, divorced, or viewed as unmarried. For instance, married taxpayers would be viewed as unmarried on the off chance that they didn't live with their spouse during the last six months of the [tax year](/taxyear). The status further expects that the HOH meet both of these two requirements:

- The HOH is married to a [nonresident alien](/nonresidentalien) whom they choose not to treat as a [resident alien](/residentalien).
- The HOH is legally separated under a divorce or separate maintenance decree by the last day of the tax year.

> Married taxpayers are thought of as unmarried in the event that they have not lived with their spouse throughout the previous six months of the tax year.

### Monetarily support a qualifying person

A HOH must pay for more than one-half of the cost of a qualifying person's support and housing costs. The HOH must likewise pay more than one-half of the rent or [mortgage](/mortgage), utilities, repairs, [insurance](/insurance), taxes, and different costs of keeping up with the home where the qualifying person resides for the greater part of the year. The home must be the taxpayer's own home except if the qualifying person is the taxpayer's parent and the house is the property of that parent.

> In the event that the qualifying person is a parent who lives at another address, it's as yet conceivable to file as head of household — gave they are dependent on you and you cover the greater part the cost of keeping up their home.

### Personal exemption suspended

The enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (TCJA) brought about the suspension of the [personal exemption](/personal-exemption) through 2025. A while ago when there was one, HOH filers must have the option to claim a [exemption](/exemption) for their qualifying person. Taxpayers could release their exemption to a noncustodial parent in a divorce continuing or a legal separation agreement and stay eligible to file as a HOH.

In comparison, a taxpayer filing as [single](/single) or [married filing separately](/mfs) meets all requirements for a standard deduction of $12,550, decreasing their taxable income from $70,000 to $57,450. Of that $57,450, $9,950 will be taxed at 10%, $30,574 at 12%, and the excess $16,926 at 22%, bringing about a total tax bill of $995 + $3,668.88 + $3,723.72 = $8,387.60.
