# Progressive Web application (PWA)
The term Progressive Web Application (PWA) alludes to a special sort of application that is made using modern web innovations and that observes fundamental web guidelines. Basically, a PWA is a web app that operates similar as a native app. Yet, what are the differences among web and native applications?

### Web app versus native app
From one perspective, web apps are more open (especially to new users) as they can be handily arrived at through a web browser. While utilizing web apps, users don't have to introduce the application on their computer or mobile gadget. Likewise, web apps are facilitated online, on a web server, and that means they can be effectively refreshed and utilized in a wide range of gadgets and operating systems. As such, there is compelling reason need to push updates to numerous app stores nor to users straightforwardly.
Native apps, then again, are the ones that users need to download and introduce locally on their gadgets. These are the apps we consistently download through app stores or app commercial centers. By and large, native apps have a greater speed and performance than web apps on the grounds that they can work in better synchrony with the gadget's hardware and native highlights (counting the camera, GPS, and receiver). Be that as it may, native apps are more costly to create and are not generally viable with all gadgets (each operating system needs its own rendition of the app).

### Progressive Web Application (PWA)
In short, progressive web applications (PWAs) are solid, fast, and locking in. They unite the best of both native and web apps. So regardless of being a web application, PWAs are viable with any gadget and, in practice, seem to be a native app than a web browser application. PWAs can chip away at any browser that conforms to the most fundamental browser standards.
Normally, PWAs utilize advancements like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, which permit them to operate with increased speed and with considerably more functionalities. As the name proposes, PWAs can be improved progressively, for their whole life expectancy.
Dissimilar to conventional web apps, PWAs are not stringently dependent on an internet association, meaning they can keep on running under poor network conditions or even offline. Likewise, PWAs can run behind the scenes, are generally state-of-the-art, and can undoubtedly be shared with a simple connection.
Other than that, PWAs count against web traffic, really intending that, not at all like native apps, they can support the analytics of a webpage in terms of site hits, which is beneficial for their overall ads, and search performance.
