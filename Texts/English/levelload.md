## What Is a Level Load?

A level load is an annual charge deducted from an investor's mutual fund assets to pay for distribution and marketing costs however long the investor holds the fund. Generally, this fee goes to mediators who sell a fund's shares to the retail public. The level load will reduce the reality [profit margin](/profitmargin) from an investment.

A level load is alluded to as a "[12b-1 fee](/12b-1fees)" with the 12b-1 fee included as part of the level load. Different fees are inside of a level load share classes. The fee is an expense the investor pays for holding this particular type of security. All loads, including front-end and back-end loads, are a type of sales charge forced on the purchase of a mutual fund.

## How Level Loads Work

Level load shares, or [Class C shares](/cshare), accompany annual charges, set at a fixed percentage, and presented by the investor over time. A level load pays for fund marketing, distribution, and servicing In comparison, a [front-end load](/front-endload) conveys charges paid when the shares are bought and a [back-end load ](/back-end-load)assesses charges when the investor sells shares.

Fund loading is a fee or service charge assessed on a mutual fund holding. There are three primary ways an investor will pay these charges. Loads are separated from a fund's expense charges and are an extra charge for claiming the security.

The Calculation of the level load share fees comes from the mutual fund's average net assets. Another difference between the level load and different loads is in the calculation of a fund's expense ratio. Front-and back-end loads are not part of the [expense ratio](/expenseratio). In any case, the expense ratio incorporates level load and 12b-1 fees. While the load percentage doesn't change, assuming the fund's net asset value increments through [capital appreciation](/capitalappreciation), the dollar value of the load will turn out to be more costly and ceaselessly disintegrate the fund's return.

The [Investment Company Act of 1940](/investmentcompanyact) set the maximum amount passable for 12b-1 charges. These fees run somewhere in the range of 0.25 and 1%. Fees cover the cost of running the mutual fund and incorporate advisory costs, marketing, distribution, and advertising. Funds that don't surpass the 0.25 fee level might call themselves [no-load funds](/no-loadfund).

This bit of magic, as well as the questionable necessity for the 12b-1 in a robust mutual fund environment, has put the justification for proceeded with utilization of level load under impressive consumer and regulatory examination.

## Benefits of Level Loads

Level-load payments permit investors to spread out commission payments, and they additionally empower the whole investment amount to be invested in the fund from the beginning since there is no front load commission to pay. Also, with the back-end load, the investor will receive the profit upon sale without the deduction of the last commission fees.

Level-loads show up among different fees uncovered in a mutual fund's [prospectus](/prospectus), however it is only one of several types of expenses that the investor might pay. Consequently, while investigating investments, investors ought to be careful to consider the full scope of the multitude of associated fees with every investment, not just the dollar amount of the level load.

## Illustration of a Level Load

Consider an investor that puts $100,000 in the XYZ Company mutual fund. It has a 4% annual level load. In year one, the investment develops to $120,000, however the intent is to keep on holding the fund.

Toward the end of year one, the expense is $4,800 ($120,000 x .04) paid from proceeds to the fund company, leaving $115,200 in the account. The investor holds the fund for another year, and it develops to $140,000. Toward the end of year two, they owe 4% of $140,000 ($5,600) leaving the investor with a $134,400 balance.

This payment structure go on for up to an investor possesses the shares in the fund. The rate of the load is consistent level, however the payment amounts develop as the investment expansions in value.

Now, suppose an investor invested a similar amount of cash in a similar XYZ mutual fund however chose to sell the shares short of what one year after the fact. They actually need to make a payment at the level-load rate. If the $100,000 had developed to $105,000 toward the end of eight months, then they would in any case owe 4% of the $105,000. Along these lines, when an investor is ready to sell an investment with a level-load payment structure, the last payment is like a back-end load, albeit the rate is normally more modest.
