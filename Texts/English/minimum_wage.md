## Special Considerations

Like all [price floors](/floor), a lowest pay permitted by law possibly has a quantifiable effect when set over the market-[clearing price](/clearingprice) for a transaction. For instance, a lowest pay permitted by law of $10 each hour won't influence workers whose marginal [productivity](/productivity) in a given profession is greater than $10 each hour. The legal [supply and demand](/law-of-supply-demand) rate stays unchanged for such labor.

For those with marginal productivity under $10 each hour, in any case, a $10 each hour the lowest pay permitted by law makes an artificial shortage of beneficial labor. An unskilled worker with marginal productivity of $8 each hour in California or Massachusetts can offer to work at a loss to their possible employer. This means the employer can hire the worker assuming they will pay more in salary than the [marginal revenue](/marginal-revenue-mr) created by the worker or on the other hand in the event that the employer mistakenly gauges the worker's marginal productivity to be above $10 each hour.

> Productivity wages are a level of wages paid to workers over the lowest pay permitted by law to hold a skilled and efficient labor force. Effectiveness wage theory posits that an employer must pay its workers high enough so workers are boosted to be useful and that highly skilled workers don't stop.

There is a high [elasticity of demand](/priceelasticity) for low-wage labor. This means that a small change in the price for low-wage labor could generally affect its demand. Thus, too high a lowest pay permitted by law could lead to expanding unemployment among low-wage workers.

In modern times, the expansion of further developed technology additionally increases the [marginal rate of technical substitution](/marginal-rate-technical-substitution) for low-wage labor.
