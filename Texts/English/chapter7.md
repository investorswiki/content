# Chapter 7
## What is Chapter 7?
Chapter 7 alludes to a chapter of the bankruptcy code that accommodates "liquidation." Under Chapter 7, your debt is discharged, yet your nonexempt property is sold, with the proceeds distributed to your creditors.
## More profound definition
Bankruptcy exists to give individuals a new financial beginning. While Chapter 7 permits you to become debt free, it isn't without a price. In return for a clean record, you will be expected to turn over personal belongings available to be purchased.
Contingent upon the state where you reside, your home, pension, vehicle, personal assets, coin collections, jewelry and other personal property may be liquidated to pay creditors.
Each state has its very own set exemptions, albeit 17 states permit you to pick either your state exemptions and federal bankruptcy exemptions spread out by Congress.
California offers two sets of state exemptions for debtors to browse. Assuming you live in one of the 17 states that permit you to pick either state and federal exemptions, you must pick one. You can't pick from provisions under the two codes.
Exemptions work like this: Say you own a vehicle that is worth $5,000, and the vehicle exemption in your state is $6,000. You would have the option to keep your current vehicle.
Nonetheless, in the event that your vehicle is worth $15,000, the bankruptcy trustee probably will sell your vehicle, pay off the loan and pay you $6,000 for the exemption. Some other money from the sale of the vehicle would go toward repaying other unsecured creditors.
