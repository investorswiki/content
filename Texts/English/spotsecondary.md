# Spot Secondary
## What Is a Spot Secondary?

The term "spot secondary" alludes to the sale of securities that have proactively been issued. These types of sales don't need a [Securities and Exchange Commission](/sec) (SEC) registration statement and distributions are regularly paid out with next to no time delays.

A spot secondary offering is normally introduced to [institutional investors](/institutionalinvestor) rather than the overall population and is closed the next business day after it is made. Investors in spot secondary trades ordinarily expect a [underwriting](/underwriting) discount for executing the trade rapidly.

## How a Spot Secondary Works

The term spot in [financial markets](/financial-market) is short for "on the spot" and alludes to immediate cash [transactions](/transaction) with practically no deferral. As a rule, the term secondary alludes to trades made between a buyer and seller in the financial market who are not the original issuers of the product.

These transactions are initiated by just one entity, typically, an institutional investor after a [initial public offering](/ipo) (IPO) happens. Companies frequently make a secondary stock offering after an IPO since they need to fund-raise, in which case new shares are issued. Be that as it may, in different cases, secondary offerings are held in light of the fact that major investors in the IPO are hoping to sell.

Shares that are issued through a spot secondary offering are commonly priced at a discount to institutional investors. This energizes participation in what are normally cash transactions that happen overnight. An overseeing underwriter, or [book runner](/bookrunner), generally acts as the agent for the firm in purchasing, carrying, and distributing the spot secondary offering.

## Special Considerations

A spot secondary offering isn't registered with the SEC. Certain requirements must be met to keep away from registration and hence permit a spot secondary offering. This incorporates making the offering to a [accredited investor](/accreditedinvestor), like an institutional investor.

However, not all secondary share offerings are viewed as spot secondary. Conventional secondary offerings — to be specific, those that are sold to the overall population — must be registered with the SEC, which can be a tedious interaction intended to shield retail investors from misrepresentation and [fraud](/fraud).

Thusly, a spot offering is typically performed significantly more rapidly than different types of secondary offerings. But since the SEC has not overlooked these offerings, spot secondary trades are generally limited to institutional investors, who probably are more learned about the possible risks and rewards of such a transaction.
