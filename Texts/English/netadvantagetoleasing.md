# Net Advantage to Leasing (NAL)
## What Is Net Advantage to Leasing (NAL)?

Net advantage to leasing (NAL) alludes to the total monetary savings that would possibly result from a person or a business deciding to lease an asset instead of purchasing it outright. The benefits of leasing not set in stone by looking at the [net present value](/npv) of purchasing the asset outright to the net present value of leasing it. A method called the friction cost analysis may likewise be utilized to measure both the direct and indirect costs; friction costs change by the buyer.

## How Net Advantage to Leasing (NAL) Works

Net advantage to leasing is a measure that can be utilized by the two individuals and businesses while computing the differences in the cost of buying versus leasing. Both leasing and buying have different direct and indirect costs. These costs can be analyzed and perceived through net present value calculations and a [friction cost](/frictioncost) analysis.

A net present value calculation is an effective method for recognizing the direct cost comparison of leasing versus buying a vehicle, for instance. To get an accurate net present value calculation, buyers must decide an estimated time span for the comparison. On the off chance that the asset viable is a vehicle, this time period would be based on the standard lifecycle of the purchased vehicle. The calculation would likewise incorporate the purchased vehicle's terminal [salvage value](/salvagevalue).

According to the ownership viewpoint, net present value calculations will incorporate the payments for a car loan, the expected interest rate, and the number of payments required for the [loan](/loan). (Interest rates will change based on a borrower's credit quality.)

According to the leasing viewpoint, net present value calculations will incorporate the contracted regularly scheduled payment and the leasing time span, which ordinarily goes from one to three years.

With a net present value calculation, buyers can compute the net present value of their investment over the full lifecycle and compare the average annual cost. Generally, everything equivalent, leasing will regularly have a lower cost (expecting a car loan would be required to purchase the vehicle).

A friction cost analysis permits an individual to integrate both direct and indirect costs into the net advantage of leasing calculations. Friction cost analysis can be derived from the base net present value calculations. An individual can change the value of a [asset](/asset) based on certain assigned measures of indirect costs, including the advantage of trading for another vehicle after the [lease](/lease) or the costs of holding a vehicle through its full lifecycle.

Generally, in the event that a consumer chooses leasing over buying, this decision is made on the basis of the likely cost savings, added benefits, and lower month to month expenses.

In any case, even assuming the net present value calculations of a lease seem good for a purchase, certain rights that accompany ownership, for example, the right to change or exchange a thing are absent with leased things (in light of the fact that leased things are as yet owned by the lessor).
