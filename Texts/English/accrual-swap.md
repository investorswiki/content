# Accrual Swap
## What Is Accrual Swap?

An accrual swap is a type of [interest rate swap](/interestrateswap) in which the interest on one side accrues provided that certain conditions are met. Payment of interest in the accrual swap happens on the off chance that the reference rate is above or below a certain level. A reference rate is the benchmark interest rate against which other interest rates are pegged.

## Understanding Accrual Swap

Parties in an accrual swap will normally utilize the [London Inter-bank Offered Rate](/libor) (LIBOR) or [Euro Inter-bank Offer Rate](/euribor) (EURIBOR) as their reference rates. Accrual swaps are likewise alluded to as corridor accrual swaps or range accrual swaps.

> The Intercontinental Exchange, the authority responsible for LIBOR, will stop distributing one-week and two-month USD LIBOR after Dec. 31, 2021. Any remaining LIBOR will be discontinued after June 30, 2023.

In an accrual swap, one party pays the standard floating reference rate and, thus, receives the reference rate plus a [spread](/spread). Interest payments to the counterparty will just accrue for quite a long time in which the reference rate stays inside a certain range. Financial institutions, corporations, and investors will utilize interest rate swaps to oversee credit risk, hedge expected losses, and earn interest through speculation. Accrual swaps are derivative contracts that trade in the [over-the-counter (OTC) market](/over-the-countermarket).

Most accrual swaps utilize one-month, two-month, half year, or year LIBOR for the [reference rate](/referencerate), despite the fact that accrual swaps should be possible utilizing other rates, for example, the 10-year treasury rate. The counterparties engaged with the accrual swap must decide the range in advance and the range might be fixed for the life of the swap. Be that as it may, contingent upon the type and terms of the accrual swap, the rate range can be reset after set periods of time, ordinarily on the [coupon](/coupon) date, which is the date on which a holder will receive an interest payment.

An accrual swap is some of the time portrayed as a combination of an interest rate swap and a pair of [binary options](/binary-choice) that set a floor and a cap, as no interest accrues on the off chance that the reference rate is over the cap or below the floor. Investors and companies using accrual swaps are basically betting that the reference rate will remain in a certain range. However long the reference rate stays in the predefined range, interest isn't accrued. The more extensive the lower floor and upper cap, the greater the possibilities that the reference rate will fall inside this range.

## Types of Accrual Swaps

Accrual swaps arrive in different types that are tailored to the sort of protection and exposure the two gatherings are seeking to accomplish.

### Callable Range Accrual Swap

A [callable range accrual swap](/callable-swap), for instance, can be called on any coupon date by the party paying the accrual coupon after an initial lock-out period has passed. Basically, the party paying the coupon has the right (however not the obligation) to cancel or call back the swap to end the contract before the expiration date.

### Floating Rate Accrual Swap

For the majority accrual swaps, the coupon rate stays fixed for the life of the swap. In any case, in a [floating rate](/floatinginterestrate) accrual swap, the reference range floats. It is set once again at every accrual period, moving up or down with the reference rate.

### Binary Accrual Swaps

There are even one-touch accrual swaps — or binary accrual swaps — where any movement outside of the set range cancels generally future accruals. For example, the range will comprise of a binary cap and floor. In the event that the interest rate goes past [the cap](/cap), no payment will be made.

### Range-Bound Derivatives

Notwithstanding interest rate accrual swaps, there are other range-bound derivatives that can utilize equity indexes, commodity prices, and other reference rates. These trading products with more extensive or even different reference rates are typically alluded to as [range accruals](/rangeaccrual).

## Special Considerations

An impediment of accrual swaps is that they can be muddled to set up and require information about interest rate movements. Be that as it may, they really do permit large financial institutions and corporations an important opportunity to oversee debt and risk.

Private gatherings interested in utilizing interest rate swaps will frequently utilize the [plain vanilla swap](/plain-vanilla-swap), which is the most fundamental type of swap where an investor will exchange a fixed interest rate for a floating interest rate, or vice versa. Investors can trade these swaps in the over-the-counter (OTC) market. An interest rate swap is just one type of plain vanilla swap; others incorporate commodity swaps and foreign currency swaps.
