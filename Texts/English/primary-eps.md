# Primary Earnings Per Share (EPS)
## What Is Primary Earnings Per Share (EPS)?

Primary earnings per share (EPS) is a measure of a company's earnings for every common share, prior to the conversion of any remaining convertible securities. It is one of two methods for arranging shares outstanding. The other method is completely [diluted earnings per share](/dilutedeps) (Diluted EPS).

The term "essential EPS" is all the more commonly utilized rather than "primary EPS." Basic EPS is the less complex method to arrange [outstanding shares](/outstandingshares), as it utilizes the number of shares at present accessible for trading. To ascertain fundamental EPS, partition net income by the number of shares outstanding. Primary Earnings Per Share has to a great extent been called [Basic Earnings Per Share](/essential earnings-per-share) starting around 1998.

## Grasping Primary Earnings Per Share (EPS)

Diluted EPS is more confounded to figure than Primary Earnings Per Share (EPS), however it is viewed as more conservative since it considers every one of the outstanding convertible shares, [warrants](/warrant), and options that might actually be changed over completely to tradable shares. On the off chance that none of these [financial instruments](/financialinstrument) are outstanding, diluted EPS and primary EPS will be equivalent.

Primary EPS doesn't think about the dilution of earnings accessible to every common share upon the conversion of convertible securities or the exercise of certain warrants which might be outstanding. Assuming there are securities outstanding that could be changed over into common shares, the primary EPS will be higher than completely diluted EPS.

EPS can be calculated in various ways relying upon the [accounting methods](/accountingmethod) and suspicions the company utilizes. Investors considering EPS in any dynamic cycle ought to comprehend how the EPS figure they are utilizing was calculated.

## Illustration of Primary Earnings Per Share Calculation

For instance, a company has a net income of $40 million and delivers out $5 million in dividends to preferred investors. The company has 12 million shares outstanding for the principal half of the quarter and 13 million shares outstanding for the last part, or an average of 12.5 million shares. In this case, you would work out earnings per share as follows:

$40 million - $5 million = $35 million

$35 million \u00f7 12.5 million shares = $2.80 per share

Accordingly this company's earnings came to $2.80 per share.

We can stretch out this guide to incorporate the effects of dilution. Suppose this company had 2 million convertible preferred shares. Presently, the denominator (outstanding shares) becomes 14.5 million effective shares outstanding. Thus, $35 million \u00f7 14.5 million shares = $2.41 per share. Here we can see the effects of earnings dilution.
