The interest earned by investors on housing authority bonds is exempt from federal taxes, and may likewise be exempt from state and nearby [income taxes](/incometax).

Like most [municipal bonds](/municipalbond), housing authority bonds have generally been seen as exceptionally safe investments. In this case, the bonds are backed by the federal government, which sees them for of empowering the construction of housing for low-income individuals.

## Understanding Housing Authority Bonds

A municipal authority might issue debt as bonds to raise capital to finance projects. The two types of municipal bonds are [general obligation](/generalobligationbond) bonds and [revenue bonds](/revenuebond). The interest payment and principal repayment of an overall obligation (GO) bond are funded from the state or neighborhood government's financial money vaults.

These bonds are backed by the [full faith and credit](/full-faith-credit) of the municipal government which might have the authority to increase taxes to satisfy its payment obligations in a hurry bond. Then again, payment obligations on a revenue bond are backed by the projected revenue stream of the project for which the bond was issued. One form of a revenue bond is the housing bond.

State and nearby governments issue housing bonds to finance the construction or rehabilitation of affordable rental housing. As well as repaying the bond principal, the state or territory must pay interest on the money it gets. As [private activity bonds](/privateactivitybond) (PABs), housing bonds can be issued in the interest of qualified profit and non-profit designers to finance low-income multifamily and senior housing projects.

Likewise, the proceeds from housing bonds may likewise be issued to give low-cost mortgage financing to low-income families or people so they can purchase a home. Mortgages gave through housing bonds are restricted to first-time homebuyers who earn something like the area median income. Moreover, the price of a home purchased with a housing bond mortgage is limited to 90% of the average area purchase price.

## Special Considerations

Housing bonds regularly have low-interest rates and can be issued as either a fixed or [variable rate demand obligation](/variable-rated-demand-bond) (VRDO). The principal and interest payments to bondholders are produced using pledged mortgage repayments and investment earnings.

The repayments made on mortgages by borrowers are collected by the trustee of the housing bond who puts the funds in short-term investments until the scheduled time to pay interest to bondholders. In effect, payment on housing bonds is backed by the timely and predictable interest payment and principal repayment of the underlying mortgages by borrowers.

Housing bonds are beneficial to the state as well as to private investors. From one perspective, the government gains access to a large amount of cheap financing. On the other, the tax benefits offered by housing bonds are highly alluring to those in the upper tax brackets.

For investors, the interest paid by housing bonds is exempt from federal and sometimes state income tax. The higher the minor tax rate, the more important a housing revenue bond's tax exemption is. Despite the fact that investors subject to the [alternative least tax](/alternativeminimumtax) (AMT) might be subject to taxes, the exemption means that investors in high federal-tax brackets benefit from revenue bonds and other municipal bonds. This tax exemption assists with making up for the bonds' low-interest rate.

Federal [low-income housing tax credits](/long-income-housing-tax-credit) are one more source of capital that might be utilized rather than or as well as housing bonds to finance affordable housing projects. The credits are non-refundable federal income tax credits for part of the mortgage interest that qualified home buyers pay every year.

Since they involve government debt, the sale of housing authority bonds sometimes requires the endorsement of neighborhood citizens.
