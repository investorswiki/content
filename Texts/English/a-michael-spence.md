### Data Economics

Spence is generally notable for his theory of market signaling under conditions of [asymmetric information](/asymmetricinformation). This model is for the most part applied to labor markets, yet it tends to be alluded to in other market settings. Market signaling can happen when a job candidate has better data about their own productivity than a prospective employer and productivity changes across various types of workers.

Higher productivity candidates have an incentive to believably impart their type to the prospective employer by taking part in some expensive activity that is just conceivable (or more probable workable) for a higher productivity employee. In Spence's original 1973 paper, this signal comprised of getting a college degree.

By spending the time and money to complete a degree, an activity that requires a certain amount of expertise, intelligence, hard working attitude, and so on to succeed, a job market candidate can signal their higher productivity to prospective employers.

It is important to note that the signal has value to the job candidate independent of any increase in expertise or information acquired in the course of their studies; they probably won't even gain any new skills, information, or other increase in ability from their education. This is as opposed to previous (regardless common) hypotheses of education that make sense of it as an investment in human capital.
