# Pretax Operating Income (PTOI)
## What Does Pretax Operating Income Mean?

Pretax operating income (PTOI) is an accounting term that alludes to the difference between a company's operating revenues (from its primary businesses) and its direct expenses (with the exception of taxes) tied to those revenues. It is a measure of a company's operating productivity, and is calculated as:

PTOI = Gross Revenue - Operating Expenses - Depreciation

## Figuring out Pretax Operating Income (PTOI)

Pretax operating income (PTOI) is a company's [operating income](/operatingincome) created from its business activities, before taxes are considered in. PTOI bars nonoperating forms of revenue and [nonrecurring](/nonrecurring-gain-or-loss) transactions like capital gains on assets and profits from unrelated investments in different companies (except if its fundamental business is investment in different companies). For example, it rejects legal expenses, investments, and rents received, which are forms of noncore business income.

It is one of the most outstanding indicators for the fundamental soundness of a business since it measures both the revenue and expenses associated with the company's primary business activities. While taxes must at last be deducted from this amount, seeing the company's primary operations on a pretax basis gives its shareholders, analysts, and leaders a clearer picture into the parts of profitability that the company have some control over. Likewise excluding taxes serves to really compare the financial strength of comparative companies, given that these companies might have different [capital structures](/capitalstructure) which evoke different tax rates, even assuming the companies have similar revenues.

It's additionally important to note that the PTOI disposes of a false feeling of safety or panic associated with certain inconsistent events like lawsuits, [gains or losses on currency exchanges](/currency-interpretation), or the appreciation of capital assets. As these are remembered for the last accounting of a company's profit or loss, they can make a false feeling that all is well with the world or peril. In any case, the PTOI is a [non-GAAP](/non-gaap-earnings) measure, so what is incorporated and excluded for its deduction varies by company and industry.

Another metric that prohibits earnings that happen outside of a business' overall operations is the [Earnings Before Interest and Taxes](/ebit) (EBIT). The EBIT is basically the pretax operating income a firm would earn in the event that it had no debt. Its calculation rejects [interest expenses](/interestexpense), interest income, and [nonoperating income](/non-operating-income)/loss.

The pretax operating margin, a measure of operating profitability, is calculated by partitioning the pretax operating income by revenues produced by a company. This margin permits investors to see true business costs of running a company. To compute the [after-tax operating income](/atoi) (ATOI), duplicate the EBIT by one minus the corporate income tax on operational income.
