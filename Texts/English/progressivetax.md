## What is progressive tax?
Progressive tax is the concept that a taxpayer ought to pay higher [taxes](/incometax) in the event that he earns more income and lower taxes assuming that he earns less. In the U.S., individuals are taxed in light of what tax brackets they fall into, with higher income ranges corresponding to a higher percentage. Progressive taxes are the principal apparatus utilized by governments to reduce income inequality.
## More profound definition
As a function of overall tax revenue, progressive tax for the most part alludes just to income tax and associated [deductions](/tax-derivation) and tax credits. In such a system, taxes demanded against an individual become **progressively** higher or lower contingent upon the taxpayer's income, with credits and deductions helping offset the tax at any point further.
Progressive taxes take the burden off lower-income individuals to pay for the things a society needs to function, similar to streets, schools, or other government services. This diminishes the effects of income inequality by guaranteeing that individuals who earn more put more back in, while the people who earn less keep a bigger percentage of their income while as yet consuming similar services.
For taxpayers in the U.S., progressive taxation is achieved by taxing every dollar of income that falls into a certain reach, called a marginal [tax bracket](/taxbracket), with each dollar past that reach falling into the next highest tax bracket. Starting around 2017, the highest individual income [tax bracket rate](/marginaltaxrate) is 39.6%, and the most reduced is 10%; for married taxpayers filing jointly, the rates continue as before yet the income limits are higher, promising a possibly lower tax obligation. Each tax bracket's income range is adjusted every year for [inflation](/inflation).
## Progressive tax model
Green Hill Zone is a recently settled country in the Pacific Ocean. None of its citizens right now pay any income tax, however the government needs to build a hospital and requirements the funds to make it happen. The legislative collection of Green Hill Zone passes a progressive income tax that lays out three tax brackets:
**$0 - $10,000 = 10% tax.**
**$10,001 - $1,000,000 = 20% tax.**
**$1,000,001 and up = 30% tax.**
Miles, a citizen of Green Hill Zone, makes $50,000 a year fixing helicopters. Under the new tax scheme, Miles pays 10% in taxes on the first $10,000 he earns, and 20% in taxes on the leftover $40,000. His total tax burden is $9,000, or just 18% of his income on average.
