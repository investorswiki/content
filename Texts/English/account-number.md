## What Is an Account Number?

An account number is a unique string of numbers and, at times, letters and different characters that distinguishes the owner of an account and awards access to it. In the U.S., the Social Security number was the primary identifier until its weakness to identity theft forced the practice to be abandoned. In the present electronic age, the main account number for some individuals is the checking account number.

## How an Account Number Works

The checking account number is situated at the lower part of the paper check. You'll see three sets of numbers in a PC lucid text style at the lower part of the check:

- The primary number on the left is the nine-digit bank routing number.
- The middle number is your account number.
- The third number is the number of the check.

Payroll processing offices use checking account numbers to set up direct deposit payments for employees.

## Special Considerations

Notwithstanding checks, account numbers are connected to just about any transaction a consumer or business can make. Sales receipts, subscription services, credit card accounts, and store club participations all have them.

These are just a portion of the means of protecting clients' account numbers in an undeniably weak online environment.

## Account Number versus Account Number

On a paper check, the nine-digit routing number distinguishes specific financial institutions inside the U.S. The number distinguishes the check as having been issued by a federal-or state-sanctioned bank that keeps an account with the Federal Reserve.

This system traces all the way back to 1910 and was developed initially as a method for aiding bank representatives sort through heaps of checks and assign them to the right drawer. Today, electronic services use them similarly for [wire transfers](/wiretransfer), to draw a payment from a deposit at the right institution.

The account number cooperates with the routing number to distinguish the right account holder at the right institution.
