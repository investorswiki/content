# Resolution Funding Corporation (REFCORP)
## What is Resolution Funding Corporation (REFCORP)?

Resolution Funding Corporation (REFCORP or RefCorp) is a government sponsored corporation which was made by the United States Congress to fund the Resolution Trust Corporation (RTC).

## Understanding Resolution Funding Corporation (REFCORP)

REFCORP, a 501(c)(1) organization, was a significant mechanism to assist Resolution With trusting Corporation (RTC) liquidate or prop up savings and loans during the crisis, which started in the late 1980s and endured through the primary half of the '90s.

The RTC is the federally-possessed asset management company which was made to rescue savings and loan (S&L) institutions which fizzled during the [Savings and Loan Crisis](/sl-crisis) of the late 1980s and mid 1990s. REFCORP gave liquidity to these organizations by giving bonds, and furthermore directed a portion of the striving S&Ls. Both REFCORP and RTC were laid out as a part of the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery, and Enforcement Act of 1989.

During this time S&L participation in hazardous activities, for example, commercial real estate lending and investing in junk bonds, incurred big financial losses. Their deposits were insured by the [Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation](/federal-savings-and-loan-insurance-corporation-fslic) (FSLIC), which itself became ruined. This forced the U.S. government to leverage monstrous taxpayer funds to determine the crisis.

REFCORP gave bonds somewhere in the range of 1989 and 1991. Throughout the span of over six years, the Resolution Trust Corporation (RTC) liquidated, rescued, or generally settled, 747 bankrupt S&Ls, and thrift institutions. This activity cost taxpayers almost $500 billion.

## REFCORP Recovery Timeline
- In 1997, over a decade after the finish of the S&L crisis, Resolution Funding Corporation (REFCORP ) still had outstanding debt of about $200 billion.
- Beginning around 1999, the FHL banks were required to pay 20-percent of their profits, after payments to the Affordable Housing Program, toward bond repayments.
- By August 2011, the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) announced the Federal Home Loan Banks (FHL), had satisfied their statutory requirements to pay the interest due on the REFCORP bonds. The August announcement framed another capital plan for the cross country Federal Home Loan Banks.

This 2011 plan committed FHL banks to assign funds, recently applied to interest on the REFCORP bonds, to new restricted retained earnings accounts. The point is to support the banks' retained earnings and capital, which started in September 2011. Under the plan's rules, FHL banks will save 20-percent of their net income to the restricted retained earnings accounts, until the accounts approached 1-percent of the bank's outstanding consolidated obligations.

Through this August 2011 announcement, then, at that point, Acting Director, Ed DeMarco said, "FHFA emphatically upholds the Banks' coordinated effort in fostering this Joint Agreement, which upgrades their capital and the safety and adequacy of the Federal Home Loan Bank System. The approach taken by the banks mirrors the longstanding practice and requirements pre-REFCORP of coordinating something like 20 percent of earnings to building retained earnings," he made sense of.

"The Banks' cooperative approach to laying out and building restricted retained earnings accounts will improve the System's safety and adequacy and is an appropriate action considering the Banks' joint and several obligations to pay System debt obligations."
