# Hope Credit
## What Is the Hope Credit?

The Hope Credit, or the Hope Scholarship Tax Credit, is a [nonrefundable education tax credit](/nonrefundabletaxcredit) offered to eligible American taxpayers. In particular, qualifying students who presently can't seem to complete four years of postsecondary education can claim this tax credit.

The Hope and other [lifetime learning credits](/lifelearningcredit) were enacted to support higher education and give a measure of tuition reimbursement for parents (or students) who are paying college tuition and fees.

## The Basics of the Hope Credit

The Hope Credit is one of two nonrefundable education credits accessible for taxpayers. Beneficiaries can assume the Hope Acknowledgment for tuition and fees and different expenses like books. Room and board, medical expenses, and insurance don't meet all requirements for the Hope Credit. The student bringing about the expenses can be either the [taxpayer](/taxpayer), spouse, or dependent.

The other accessible credit is the [Lifetime Learning Credit](/lifelearningcredit), which can be claimed after the Hope Credit has been exhausted. Starting around 2009, the Hope Credit turned out to be part of the [American Opportunity Tax Credit (AOTC)](/american-opportunity-tax-credit). In 2018, the maximum Hope Credit was $2,500. Any individual who brings about qualifying educational expenses can claim an education credit. Qualifying educational expenses incorporate tuition and fees. Parents who pay tuition and fees for their children can claim this type of credit on their [tax returns](/taxreturn), subject to certain income limitations.

At the point when the Hope Credit was expanded and renamed the American Opportunity Tax Credit, a portion of the tax credit likewise became refundable. This means assuming that the credit brings the amount of tax the taxpayer owes to zero, they can have 40% of the excess amount of the credit (up to $1,000) refunded to them.

## Do You Qualify for the Hope Credit?

The [American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA)](/american-recovery-and-reinvestment-act) expanded the Hope Credit in 2009. This made the credit more available to parents and students. Presently more individuals meet all requirements for the Hope Credit under the sponsorship of the American Opportunity Tax Credit. The AOTC made the Hope Credit accessible to a more extensive scope of taxpayers, extending qualification to those with higher incomes and the people who owe no tax. The tax is accessible to individuals with a [modified adjusted gross income (MAGI)](/magi) of $80,000 or less ($160,000 or less for joint filers).

The IRS considers a student qualified on the off chance that they are enrolled at an accredited postsecondary institution part time in one scholarly year. That student must in any case be enrolled at the institution toward the beginning of the [tax year](/taxyear), taking courses toward a degree or one more recognized educational qualification, and must not have been sentenced for any crime drug offense toward the finish of the tax year.

Taxpayers can claim the credit for as long as four years of postsecondary education to reduce the costs of tuition and other eligible expenses. As per the IRS, a [qualified educational expense](/qhee) incorporates tuition paid to the school and expenses for books, supplies, and equipment that might have been bought from outer sources. These expenses qualify on the off chance that taxpayers use student loans to pay for them yet not assuming they use scholarships, awards, or funds from a 529 savings plan.
