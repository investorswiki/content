# De-Escalation Clause
## What Is a De-Escalation Clause?

A de-escalation clause is an article in a contract that calls at a cost decrease assuming there is a decrease in certain costs. It is something contrary to an escalation clause.

## Understanding De-Escalation Clauses

De-escalation clauses are designed to guarantee that the terms of a contract stay fair even assuming that market conditions change after the contract is agreed upon.

These clauses can be particularly helpful in situations where there is huge volatility in the price of the goods or services exchanged. For example, transporting costs might be higher than normal when a contract is endorsed during times of curiously high oil prices. A de-escalation clause will address for that by bringing down the contracted transportation price assuming that oil prices decline during the life of the contract.

The specific form of de-escalation clauses will vary depending on the industry. For example, professional competitors could have de-escalation clauses in their contracts that reduce their pay in the event that they don't play in that frame of mind of standard season games. An equipment maintenance company, then again, could have a clause specifying that its maintenance fees will be reduced assuming the value of the equipment being kept up with depreciates in value.

## De-Escalation Clause Example

For instance, assume a factory consents to buy a part for $100 per unit when the cost of delivering that part is $80 per unit. The two players concur that a 20% [profit margin](/profitmargin) for the provider is fair and will permit the provider to keep regarding the contract however long the supplies are required by the factory.

However, imagine a scenario in which the cost of delivering the part falls after the contract is marked, for example to $40 per unit? In that situation, the provider's profit margin would increase to 60%. The customer might feel that this situation is preposterously costly. In the event that no change is made to the contracted price, the factory could turn out to be progressively enticed to search somewhere else for less expensive supplies.

To relieve this, the gatherings can settle on a de-escalation clause expressing that, assuming that the price of providing the parts decreases after the contract is marked, some or that decrease will be all given to the customer as lower prices. This can assist with limiting contractual debates and keep business flowing flawlessly for the two players.
