## What Is a Salary Reduction Contribution?

A salary reduction contribution is a contribution that is made to a retirement savings plan, which generally addresses a percentage of an employee's compensation. For certain plans, salary reduction contributions (otherwise called [elective deferral contributions](/electivedeferralcontribution)) may likewise take the state of a specific dollar amount contributed to an employer-sponsored retirement savings plan, for example, a 401(k), [403(b)](/403bplan), or a [SIMPLE IRA](/simple-ira).

Normally, the saver or employee concedes paying taxes on their contributions until they take [distributions](/circulation) or withdrawals in retirement. Subsequently, the funds that have been saved fill in a [tax-deferred](/taxdeferred) way.

## Grasping a Salary Reduction Contribution

Salary reduction contributions offer employees the opportunity to lay out automatic, recurring deductions from their paychecks, which are contributed to an employer-sponsored retirement account. Salary reduction contributions are traditionally pre-tax, meaning the contribution amounts reduce the individual's taxable income in the extended period of the contribution.

At times, contributions can be made with after-tax dollars as on account of a [Roth 401(k)](/roth401k), which doesn't give a tax deduction upfront however the withdrawals or distributions are tax-free in retirement.

Regularly, salary reduction contributions are typically a percentage of the employee's compensation or salary. A few plans permit the employee to contribute a specific dollar amount for each pay period over time.

## Salary Reduction Contribution Limits

The [Internal Revenue Service](/irs) (IRS) draws the annual line on how much money can be contributed to a retirement plan. The annual employee contribution limit for a 401(k), 403(b), and Roth 401(k) — for 2021 — is $19,500 each year. This increments to $20,500 in 2022. For the two years, a catch-up contribution limit of $6,500 is permitted.

The maximum amount an employee might add to a SIMPLE IRA is $13,500 for 2021 (expanding to $14,000 in 2022), with a catch-up contribution limit of $3,000 in the two years for the people who are 50 or over.

The IRS likewise offers a salary reduction contribution-based plan called the [Salary Reduction Simplified Employee Pension Plan](/sarsep) (SARSEP). Such plans are offered by small companies that ordinarily utilize less than 25 staff members, accordingly allowing employees to make pre-tax contributions to their individual retirement accounts (IRAs) through salary reductions.

As per the Small Business Job Protection Act of 1996, no new SARSEPS were permitted to be made after Jan. 1, 1997, yet existing plans were permitted to stay in place. Employees can contribute something like 25% of their income every year or $19,500 in 2021 (expanding to $20,500) in 2022.

## Salary Reduction Contribution: After-Tax

Salary reduction contributions that are made with after-tax dollars must be declared in an employee's tax return as income. On the off chance that a plan considers after-tax contributions, such compensation isn't excluded from income. Accordingly, an employee can't deduct them on their tax return in the tax year of the contribution.
