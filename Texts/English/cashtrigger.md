# Cash Trigger
## What Is a Cash Trigger?

A cash trigger is a condition that triggers an investor to make a trade or make a specific move, like buying or selling a financial product like a stock, [option](/option), futures contract, bond, or [currency](/currency). Willful cash triggers are generally common among retail investors. They include deciding to make a purchase if a stock transcends a predetermined price, or selling a stock on the off chance that it falls below a specific price.

Market-forced cash triggers can happen on [over-the-counter](/otc) options, when a transaction or action is taken, or when the price of an asset arrives at a certain level.

## How the Cash Trigger Works

For instance, on the off chance that a trader is [long](/long) a stock at $20, however needs to escape the trade if the stock falls below $15, they could put a [stop-loss order](/stop-lossorder) at $15. The stop-loss order gets them out of the trade on the off chance that the price dips under $15, with $15 being the trigger price as well as the order price in this case.

This means that the genuine sale price could happen below your trigger point.

Essentially, in the event that a trader has been watching a stock begin to move higher after a prolonged decline, they might choose to buy the stock, yet provided that it continues to transcend a prior top. On the off chance that the former price top was $60, the trader could place a [stop buy order](/buystoporder) just above $60. The order won't fill until the price moves above $60. The cash trigger is $60, however in this case, it is additionally where an order can be placed.
