## What Is a Pop-Up Option?

A pop-up option is a [joint and survivor annuity](/jointandsurvivorannuity) or pension option, generally limited to married couples, that is set off on the off chance that the annuitant or pension plan member's spouse predeceases the plan member. The pop-up option then, at that point, supports the plan member's pension after the spouse's death.

The increase in the pension amount is made conceivable by the way that the pension plan no longer needs to give a spousal pension once the plan member dies.

## How Pop-Up Options Work

Taking everything into account, a plan member who settles on the pop-up option will receive a more modest pension than a not member pick the pop-up option.

For example, in 2018 (the latest data that anyone could hope to find as of Dec. 1, 2020), in the NYC Employees' Retirement System (NYCERS) employees could choose the pop-up option. The retired person's benefit will "pop up" to the Maximum Retirement Allowance of $20,000 if the spouse or beneficiary passes away rashly. All payments will then cease upon the retired person's death. In the event that a NYCERS retired person chooses this method, they can't change her or his beneficiary after the option is upheld.
