# Mortgage Rate Lock Float Down
## What Is a Mortgage Rate Lock Float Down?

The term [mortgage rate](/mortgage-rate) lock float down alludes to a [financing](/financing) option that locks in the [interest rate](/interestrate) on a mortgage with the option to reduce it assuming that market rates fall during the lock period. An ordinary rate lock furnishes a borrower with security against an increase during the rate lock period. The float down option specifically allows the borrower to exploit a fall in interest rates during the lock period.

## How a Mortgage Rate Lock Float Down Works

A [mortgage](/mortgage) rate lock float down is a type of mortgage product that offers borrowers both security and flexibility when interest rates change. The mortgage rate float down allows the borrower to lock in their mortgage rate. In any case, assuming that rates fall during the [underwriting](/underwriting) process, they can opt into the float down option to have the mortgage handled at the lower rate. This might be a reasonable option when mortgage rates vacillate or on the other hand on the off chance that they've been rising and falling over a short period of time.

Borrowers can request to exercise the float down option whenever before the mortgage closes to exploit a lower mortgage interest rate. Practicing the float down option might happen as soon as multi week after the mortgage procedures start off, contingent upon the terms with the [lender](/lender). The terms ought to characterize the time span that the lock is in place, which could be 30 or 60 days. The time span allows the borrower to exploit further developed interest rates while the [mortgage application](/mortgage-application) is being handled.

Lenders might offer a rate lock float down option to borrowers since they don't believe that they should shop around or finance their loan with another institution or [broker](/broker). In a perfect world, the lender needs the borrower's business over the long term since banks earn the interest on the mortgage minus any costs to the bank to service the mortgage.

The float down option on a rate lock includes some major disadvantages. The borrower pays a [fee](/fee) for the flexibility of the float down option, which could be a couple or several hundred dollars relying upon the [lender](/lender). Thus, rate locks with a float down option are more costly than rate locks without the float down option.

## Special Considerations

Despite the fact that they might have the float down option accessible to them, borrowers don't automatically receive lower rates. This means it's their responsibility to opt into the lower rate as the lender has no obligation to illuminate the borrower that rates have fallen. The borrower must call the mortgage [broker](/broker) or lender to ask for the float down option.

> Ensure you keep up with mortgage rates as your lender isn't probably going to illuminate you regarding the right opportunity to exercise your float down option.
>

Here is another consideration. On the off chance that rates fall and settle, have all the earmarks of being at the lower part of the rate cycle, it most likely doesn't check out to pay for the float down option. Borrowers might need to see rates fall enough to more than pay for the fee of the float down option. A drop from 5.10% to 5.00% during the underwriting system most likely isn't sufficient to offset the cost of the float down option. In any case, assuming there's an expectation that rates will move from 5.10% to 4.60%, the savings over the [long term](/longterm) would probably eclipse the fee for the float down, making it a decent option.

Refinancing might be an option on the off chance that rates fall sufficiently low to set aside cash over the long term and enough to cover the [closing costs](/closingcosts) of another mortgage. Numerous lenders allow borrowers to [refinance](/refinance) as soon as six months after the mortgage closes. All in all, on the off chance that you pass up the float down and rates fall by a half a percentage point or more, you can constantly refinance and make the most of the lower rate.

## Mortgage Rate Lock Float Down versus Convertible Adjustable-Rate Mortgage (ARM)

The mortgage rate lock float down begins with the rate lock or with a fixed-rate mortgage, yet the borrower can exercise the option to take a lower rate in the event that rates fall. The option to get the lower rate lapses typically inside 30 to 60 days. A [convertible adjustable-rate mortgage](/convertible-arm) (ARM), then again, allows the borrower to exploit lower rates for a couple of years before switching over completely to a [fixed-rate mortgage](/fixed-rate_mortgage).

A [adjustable-rate mortgage](/arm) starts with a much lower basic teaser rate, however after a set period — typically three to 10 years — the rate is adjusted by an index plus a [margin](/margin). The rate is generally adjusted like clockwork and can go up or down relying upon the terms framed in the contract.

Convertible ARMs are marketed as a method for exploiting falling interest rates and ordinarily incorporate specific conditions. The [financial institution](/financialinstitution) generally charges a fee to switch the ARM to a fixed-rate mortgage.

- The rate lock for the mortgage is 4.25% for quite a long time.
- The borrower pays a fee for the option to lower the rate lock on the mortgage.
- After fourteen days, mortgage rates fall to 3.80%, and the borrower exercises the option for the float down.
- At the closing, the rate for the mortgage is set at 3.80% for the life of the mortgage. As such, 3.80% is the fixed rate for the life of the mortgage.
