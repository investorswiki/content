# Carrying Charge Market
## What Is a Carrying Charge Market?

In a carrying charge market, the [futures price](/futures) of a commodity is higher than its spot price as a result of the costs — or "carrying charges" — associated with truly putting away that commodity.

In these markets, one can rough the probable futures price of a commodity by taking its [spot price](/spotprice) and adding its carrying charges. Notwithstanding, the real futures price will frequently veer off from this prediction due to powers of [supply and demand](/law-of-supply-demand).

## How Carrying Charge Markets Work

The commodities futures markets are a large and important part of the modern financial markets. Through them, companies that depend on commodities for their operations can source them at scale in a manner that limits [counterparty risk](/counterpartyrisk). Simultaneously, commodity producers can benefit from forward [hedging](/support) and price transparency, while financial purchasers can utilize the markets to [speculate](/hypothesis) on commodity prices.

As a result of the wide assortment of commodities traded on these markets, a few commodities futures market will show different examples of pricing. For instance, commodities like corn, gold, and [crude oil](/crude-oil) will generally have futures prices that are higher than their spot prices. One of the primary purposes behind this is that these commodities cost money to store, due to factors like feed for animals, insurance for precious metals, or rent for warehouses. Simultaneously, these commodities don't pay any [yield](/yield) through dividends or interest, so possessing them adversely affects the proprietor's short-term cashflow.

These types of commodity futures are known as having "carrying charge markets" in light of the fact that their futures prices are affected by their [carrying charges](/carryingcharge). On the other hand, the equivalent wouldn't be true for [equity index futures](/indexfutures) contracts, since in this case the [underlying asset](/underlying-asset) — specifically, an equity index, for example, the [S&P 500](/sp500) — doesn't have similar sorts of carrying charges. Truth be told, the inverse is true: individuals who own the companies that make up an equity index frequently receive dividends from their portfolio, implying that possessing these assets emphatically affects their short-term cashflow. Consequently, equity index futures normally have futures prices that are below their spot prices, to mirror the way that the futures owners are "passing up" the dividend income earned by the asset holders.

> ### Important
> In spite of the fact that commodity futures markets will generally follow broad examples, for example, these, it is important to keep as a primary concern that the real futures prices will vacillate progressively founded on a lot more extensive set of factors. Eventually, supply and demand sets the futures prices, so these examples don't necessarily in every case hold.

## Illustration of a Carrying Charge Market

A carrying charge market can address the variances seen because of these types of circumstances. For instance, in the event that it costs $1 every month to guarantee and store a bushel of corn, and the spot price is $6 per bushel, a contract for a bushel of corn that develops in 90 days ought to cost $9 in a carrying charge market. Be that as it may, when a commodity is in low supply, spot prices might be higher than future prices. The increased price assists with proportioning the limited supply in the market. In this scenario, you could have a [inverted futures curve](/invertedmarket), otherwise called backwardation.

In certain markets, most eminently the energy market, [backwardation](/backwardation) is standard. For instance, expect an investor goes long with a futures grain contract at $100 which is due in one year. Assuming the expected future spot price is $70, the market is in backwardation. In that scenario, the futures price should fall, or the future spot price change, to unite with the expected future spot price.

## Features
- According to this point of view, the futures holders in a carrying charge market will pay extra for the futures contract since it allows them to abstain from paying these carrying charges.
- This reflects, in part, the costs associated with actually holding the underlying assets.
- A carrying charge market is one in which futures prices are higher than spot prices.
