## Understanding the Water Quality Improvement Act of 1970

Federal regulation of water pollution traces all the way back to 1886, when the River and Harbor Act was endorsed into law. Quite possibly the earliest and most important laws that tended to water quality and pollution in the United States was the Federal Water Pollution Control Act of 1948, which was laid out by Congress to upgrade water quality and to make a national policy to control and forestall water pollution.

The new act expanded federal authority and laid out a state certification method to forestall the debasement of water below applicable standards. As per the [Environmental Protection Agency](/environmental-protection-agency) (EPA), improvements to the 1948 act brought about "irregular legislation," which was to a great extent due to changes in the obligations of federal agencies that made it challenging to implement the law.

Corrections were acquainted in 1972 with assistance mitigate these issues by restructuring water pollution control specialists and amalgamating them.

A major reason for pollution is currently pesticides, while in the mid 1970s it was the direct dumping of synthetics and different contaminations into the water by [industries](/industry). As per the EPA, nitrogen "pollution has impacted many streams, rivers, lakes, coves, and beach front waters for the past several decades, bringing about serious environmental and human medical problems, and impacting the economy."
