# Throwback Rule
## What Is the Throwback Rule?

The "throwback rule" is a statute that states can embrace and use to guarantee corporations pay their state taxes on 100% of their profits. Each state that demands a corporate income tax must decide, for each company carrying on with work inside its nation, the amount of the company's profits it can tax.

Traditional state apportionment calculations base state corporate taxes on a formula that looks at where as a corporation's property, [payroll](/payroll), and sales are found. These formulas bring about "no place income," or income on which a corporation doesn't pay tax in any state. The throwback rule is intended to kill this tax loophole and cut down on corporate tax avoidance.

## How the Throwback Rule Works

Under traditional taxation formulas utilized by states, some income is left un-taxable as "no place income." Critics consider such traditional apportionment formulas unfair to small businesses that have profits that are 100% taxable in light of the fact that their business activities are all situated in a single state. These businesses wind up paying taxes on a greater percentage of their profits than some multi-state corporations do.

Pundits likewise think that multi-state corporations with "no place income" are troubling state inhabitants by not paying for their fair share of public services and that the corporate income tax has declined essentially as a source of state revenue because of the "no place income" loophole.

The best state solution for the problem of no place income is instituting a supposed "throwback rule," which commands that sales into different states or to the federal government that are not taxable will be "tossed back" into the state of beginning for tax purposes. As such, the throwback rule is a backup for the objective rule: when the objective rule assigns a sale to a state that can't [tax](/taxes) that sale, the sale is re-assigned back to the state that is the source of the sale.

One alternative to the throwback rule is the "throwout rule" recently utilized by New Jersey and West Virginia. As opposed to seeking to assign all sales to the states in which the company works, the throwout rule essentially prohibits from overall sales any sales that are not assigned to any state.
