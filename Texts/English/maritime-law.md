# Maritime Law
## What Is Maritime Law?

Maritime law, otherwise called admiralty law, is a collection of laws, conventions, and deals that oversee private maritime business and other nautical issues, for example, shipping or offenses happening on vast water. International rules, overseeing the utilization of the seas and seas, are known as the Law of the Sea.

## Grasping Maritime Law

In most developed nations, maritime law observes a separate code and is an independent jurisdiction from national laws. The [United Nations](/united-nations-un) (UN), through the [International Maritime Organization (IMO)](/international-maritime-organization), has issued various conventions that can be enforced by the naval forces and coast watchmen of countries that have marked the treaty illustrating these rules. Maritime law oversees large numbers of the [insurance claims](/insurance_claim) connecting with ships and freight; civil issues between shipowners, seamen, and travelers; and piracy.

> Conventions are consistently amended to keep up with new business practices and innovations.

Also, maritime law directs registration, license, and inspection procedures for ships and shipping contracts; maritime insurance; and the carriage of goods and travelers.

The IMO (laid out in 1948 as the Inter-Governmental Maritime Consultative Organization, and coming into force in 1958) is responsible for guaranteeing that existing international maritime conventions are stayed up with the latest, as well as growing new agreements as necessary.

Today, there are many conventions controlling all parts of maritime commerce and transport. The IMO names three conventions as its core:

- The International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea
- The International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships
- The International Convention on Standards of Training, Certification, and Watchkeeping for Seafarers

On its website, the IMO has a complete rundown of existing conventions, historical amendments, and illustrative notes.

The legislatures of the 174 IMO member states are responsible for the implementation of IMO conventions for ships registered in their nation. Nearby legislatures enforce the provisions of IMO conventions, taking everything into account and set the punishments for encroachments. Now and again, ships must carry certificates installed to show that they have been investigated and have satisfied the required guidelines.

## Special Considerations

The country of registration decides a ship's nationality. For most ships, the national library is the country where the owners reside and work their business.

Ship owners will frequently register their ships in countries that permit foreign registration. Called "banners of convenience," the foreign registration is valuable for tax planning and to exploit indulgent neighborhood laws. Two instances of "banners of convenience" countries are Panama and Bermuda.
