# Mortgage Recast
## What Is a Mortgage Recast?

A mortgage recast, likewise called a loan recast, is a feature of certain types of mortgages where staying regularly scheduled payments are recalculated in light of another [amortization schedule](/amortization_schedule). During a mortgage recast, the borrower pays a large sum toward their [principal](/principal), and their mortgage is then recalculated in view of the new, lower balance outstanding.

A few mortgages have a [scheduled recast date](/scheduledrecast), which is the date when the lender will compute another amortization schedule in light of the mortgage's excess principal balance and term.

## How a Mortgage Recast Works

For the borrower, the primary benefit of recasting a mortgage is to reduce regularly scheduled payments. Frequently, a mortgage lender will essentially reduce the term of a loan on the off chance that extra principal payments are made, yet keep up with a similar fixed month to month amount due — basically by expanding the principal amount and decreasing the [interest](/interest) portion of the payment.

Recasting can bring down the amount of interest the borrower will pay over the life of the loan on the off chance that an adequately large principal payment is made, lessening both the interest and principal staying on the loan's new regularly scheduled payments.

## Mortgage Recast versus Refinancing

A mortgage recast can be a more comfortable option than [refinancing](/refinance). With a refinance, you supplant your current mortgage with another mortgage loan, which can be exorbitant and relies upon your [credit standing](/creditrating). A mortgage recast doesn't include a credit check and go on with the original mortgage.

Then again, refinancing a mortgage means paying off the existing loan and supplanting it with another one. Justifications for why homeowners refinance include:

1. The opportunity to get a lower [interest rate](/interestrate).
1. To abbreviate the term of their mortgage.
1. The longing to change over from a [adjustable-rate mortgage](/arm) (ARM) to a fixed-rate mortgage or vice versa.
1. An opportunity to tap into a [home's equity](/home_equity) to finance a large purchase.
1. To consolidate debt.

> Not at all like refinancing a mortgage, recasting a mortgage won't bring down the interest rate on your mortgage.

## Types of Mortgages That May Be Recast
### Negative Amortization Loans

Mortgage recasting can be composed into the loan terms and is associated with a [negative amortization loan](/negativelyamortizingloan). A negatively amortizing loan has a payment structure that takes into consideration a scheduled payment that is not exactly the loan's interest charge.

At the point when a payment is not exactly the interest charge at that point, it makes [deferred interest](/deferredinterest). The amount of deferred interest made is added to the principal balance of the loan, leading to a situation where the principal owed increments over the long haul as opposed to decreasing. Due to this rising principal, negative amortization mortgages expect that the loan is recast eventually so it will be paid off toward its scheduled term's end.

Negative amortization mortgages likewise here and there have [triggers](/recast_trigger) that could cause an unscheduled recast to happen. This might kick in, for instance, on the off chance that the principal balance of the loan arrives at a set limit through negative amortization.

### Option Adjustable-Rate Mortgages (Option ARM)

Negative amortization mortgages are otherwise called payment [option adjustable-rate mortgages](/option_arm) (Option ARM). These mortgages give borrowers options that incorporate paying the entirety of the principal and interest or paying just the absolute interest.

While the decisions accessible with an option ARM take into account greater flexibility on payments, the borrower could undoubtedly wind up with more long-term debt than before. As with other [adjustable-rate mortgages](/arm) (ARMs), there is the possibility of interest rates changing radically and quickly founded on the market.

## Illustration of a Mortgage Recast

Regardless of whether a mortgage have a recast option included, you can approach your lender to check whether a mortgage recast will benefit you and lower your regularly scheduled payments. By paying a lump sum and recasting your mortgage, you can reduce your housing costs. On the other hand, on the off chance that you present a lump sum without recasting, you bring down your balance however your regularly scheduled payments will continue as before.

Suppose you have a $500,000, 30-year [fixed-rate mortgage](/fixed-rate_mortgage) with a 4% interest rate. Your joined interest and principal payment would be around $2,400 each month in terms of principal and interest.

After tend years, you receive a windfall lump sum of $375,000. On the off chance that you chose to utilize that lump sum to pay down the mortgage without recasting it, you would keep on paying around $2,400 per month, yet the length of the loan would become more limited as you are really paying down extra principal.

If, then again, you recast the loan over the excess 25 years of the mortgage, the regularly scheduled payment would go down to around $900 each month in terms of principal and interest.

**Correction** — **April 13, 2022:** A prior rendition of this article erroneously calculated the recast month to month mortgage payment amount in the model.

## Features
- A recast happens when a borrower pays a large sum toward their mortgage's principal, and the lender recalculates the loan in light of the new balance.
- Negative amortization loans or option adjustable-rate mortgages (option ARM) habitually have a mortgage recast clause as part of the loan contract.
- At the point when the lender recalculates the loan, they will make another amortization schedule, which is a table of loan payments showing the principal and interest that contains every payment until the loan is paid in full.
- The primary benefit to the borrower of recasting a mortgage is the opportunity to reduce regularly scheduled payments.
