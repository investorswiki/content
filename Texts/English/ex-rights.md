# Ex-Rights
## What Is Ex-Rights?

The term ex-rights alludes to shares of stock that are trading however never again have [rights](/rightsoffering) appended to them. Rights, in this context, allude to the opportunity to purchase more shares of another issue or offering at a given price.

Shares of stock that give such rights are considered to have a [additional value](/hypothetical value-of-a-right) in view of the opportunity addressed by those rights.

## Grasping Ex-Rights

Shares trading ex-rights have either passed the expiration of the rights offering period, been moved to another party (subsequently making the rights presently not feasible to trade), or currently exercised by the original holder. In any of these circumstances, the shares never again give the holder any special privileges.

### Rights Offerings

Here and there, [shareholders](/shareholder) are welcome to take part in rights offerings, which ordinarily permit them to purchase more shares of stock at a discounted price. In determining who receives those rights, companies set a date for the distribution of rights to current shareholders. When that decision has been made, and showed shareholders are eligible to receive the recognized rights, the stock is said to trade ex-rights. Following that point, a shareholder is qualified exclusively for the shares they purchase, however not to the rights that could somehow accompany them.

Rights offerings, likewise called rights issues, are a strategy companies use to raise capital. Companies will utilize the proceeds from rights issues to pay down debt, [acquire](/obtaining) another company, or another purpose.

Rights offerings are structured to circumvent shareholders from having their interest [diluted](/weakening) against their will. Distribution is corresponding to an investor's percentage of total property; for example, assuming somebody owned one percent of the [outstanding shares](/outstandingshares) of the company, that investor would get rights equivalent to one percent of the total new shares offered by the company.

## Ex-Rights versus Cum Rights

Ex-rights shares are worth not as much as shares that are as yet trading [cum rights](/cumrights) (not yet ex-rights) since they don't give a shareholder access to a rights offering. [Renounceable rights](/renounceablerights) may trade separately, permitting shareholders to decide to sell their rights as opposed to exercise them.

Rights have their own value that is traded with shares before they are ex-rights; investors can buy and sell rights between the time they're issued and the last exercise date, set under the rights offering. In this manner, stocks that trade with rights are more valuable than if they trade ex-rights.

Having the option to exercise the rights and buy shares at a discount gives the rights holder an immediate gain in value. Selling the rights basically likens to free money for the shareholder.

## Calculation of a Theoretical Ex-Rights Price

A basic method for assessing the [theoretical ex-rights price](/theoreticalexrightsprice) is to add the current market value of all shares existing before the rights issue and the funds raised because of the rights issue sales. This number is then partitioned by the total number of shares in existence after the rights issue is complete to show up at a per-share value of those rights.
