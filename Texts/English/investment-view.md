# Investment View
## What Is an Investment View?

An investment view accounts for how an individual or firm perceives the market alongside the underlying decision-production processes that lead to an investment. Often one's investment view takes into account the external market environment alongside one's available resources and risk profile. An investment view will examine an investment or project to determine in the event that there is an attractive risk-reward tradeoff.

## Understanding Investment Views

An investment view is the best method for ensuring you make the best decisions for your household or business. Some investors might search for "value," which they determine by taking a gander at a company's [price-earnings ratio](/price-earningsratio) (P/E) compared to the industry standard, while others might seek a reliable, [dividend-yielding](/dividendyield) stock. Of course, as people age or experience other material changes in life, their investment view often changes.

Having a firm and clear investment view can help investors maximize profits by zeroing in their efforts on investments that they know and understand. At its core, a strong investment view will encompass general ideas, like profit potential and [risk tolerance](/risktolerance), as well as more specific items like preferred industries and economic sectors.

## How an Investment View Works

One's investment view differs from one situation to another but consistently keeps the [investment objective](/investmentobjective) as the basis of its analysis. The investment objective is the primary goal of the investment, and this goal will depend on many factors. The most common financial investment objectives are safety, income, and growth. These goals are often mutually exclusive, so the investor must choose one goal to use in shaping their investment view.

Business decisions might have several different reasons for their building a brand or reducing potential entrants to the industry. However, when an investment view is taken, there will be a structured gander at the cost-return relationship.

## Different Investment Views

On the off chance that safety is the underlying factor in your investment view, you might wish to make conservative investments. Such conservative investments include government-issued securities in stable economic systems, corporate bonds issued by large, stable companies, government [Treasury bills](/treasurybill) (T-Bills), certificates of deposit (CD), or the fixed-income municipal and government bonds. The safest investments for the most part have the lowest rate of income return or yield.

In the event that high-risk, high-reward is instead your view, taking bets on growth stocks with no current earnings but a lot of potential could be your strategy. Leveraging bets with derivatives contracts may likewise fit a more speculative view of investing.

## Special Considerations

A [bearish](/bear) investment view is typically associated with a negative market outlook, with bears placing bets that the market will fall. Because they are pessimistic concerning the direction of the market, bears use different techniques that, unlike traditional investing strategies, profit when the market falls and lose money when it rises.

The most common of these techniques is known as [short selling](/shortselling). This strategy represents the inverse of the traditional buy-low-sell-high mentality of investing. Short sellers buy low and sell high, but in reverse order, selling first and buying later once - - they hope - - the price has declined.

A [bullish](/bull) view would instead be indicative of an optimistic outlook, with the expectation of price increases. Investors who adopt a bull approach purchase [securities](/security) under the assumption that they can sell them later at a higher price. Bulls are optimistic investors who are attempting to profit from the upward movement of stocks, with certain strategies suited to that theory.
