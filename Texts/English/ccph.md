# Central Counterparty Clearing House (CCP)
## What Is a Central Counterparty Clearing House (CCP)?

A central counterparty clearing house (CCP) is an entity that works with trading in different European [derivatives](/subordinate) and equities markets. Normally worked by the major banks in every country, CCPs endeavor to bring productivity and stability into different financial markets. It reduces counterparty, operational, settlement, market, legal, and default risk for traders.

## Grasping a Central Counterparty Clearing House (CCP)

Central counterparty clearing houses (CCPs) perform two primary capabilities as the intermediary in a transaction: clearing and settlement. As counterparties to the buyers and the sellers, CCPs guarantee the terms of a trade — regardless of whether one party defaults on the agreement. CCPs bear the overwhelming majority of the buyers' and sellers' [credit risk](/creditrisk) while clearing and settling market transactions.

The CCP gathers sufficient money from every buyer and seller to cover potential losses incurred by neglecting to follow through on an agreement. In such cases, the CCP replaces the trade at the current market price. Monetary requirements depend on every trader's exposure and open obligations.

## Elements of a Central Counterparty Clearing House (CCP)

For the purpose of privacy protection, CCPs shield the associated traders' personalities from each other. CCPs additionally shields trading firms against default from buyers and sellers who are matched by an electronic [order book](/order-book) and whose creditworthiness is obscure. Besides, CCPs reduce the number of transactions that are being settled. This helps smooth operations while lessening the value of the obligations, which assists money with moving all the more efficiently among traders.

> In the U.S., the equivalent of a CCP is known as a derivatives clearing organization (DCO) or a derivatives clearinghouse and is regulated by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC).

## Moody's Rating Methods for Central Counterparty Clearing Houses

In January 2016, Moody's Investors Service stood out as truly newsworthy by uncovering its new methodology for rating CCPs worldwide. In its **Clearing Counterparty Rating (CCR)** report, Moody's assesses the way that a CCP might meet its clearing and settlement obligations in an efficient way, and how much money will probably be lost assuming a trader defaults on an obligation. The CCR report factors in the following contemplations:

- A CCP's management capacities for obligation defaults and related protections
- A CCP's business and financial essentials
- A CCP's operating climate
- A CCP's quantitative estimations and qualitative issues, which Moody's purposes while deciding a given CCP's creditworthiness

## Blockchain Technology and CCPs

Blockchain technology, which is portrayed as an ethical digital ledger of economic transactions that can be modified to record financial transactions, seemingly addresses another frontier for CCPs. In November 2015, [clearinghouses](/clearinghouse) from several nations combined efforts to make a think tank known as the Post Trade Distributed Ledger Group, which studies how blockchain technology can influence the manner by which security trades are cleared, settled, and recorded. The Group, which in 2018 started collaborating with the Global Blockchain Business Council, presently incorporates around 40 financial institutions from one side of the planet to the other.

The PTDL Group accepts new technology can reduce risk and margin requirements, save money on operational costs, increase settlement cycle productivity, and work with greater regulatory oversight — both before and in the wake of trading. What's more, since this group's individuals address different parts of the securities settlement process, they exhaustively comprehend how the [blockchain](/blockchain) technology can aid the settlement, clearing, and reporting processes.
