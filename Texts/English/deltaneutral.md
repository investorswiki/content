Long [put options](/putoption) consistently have a delta going from - 1 to 0, while long [calls](/calloption) consistently have a delta going from 0 to 1. The underlying asset, typically a stock position, consistently has a delta of 1 in the event that the position is a long position and - 1 assuming that the position is a short position. Given the underlying asset position, a trader or investor can utilize a combination of long and short calls and puts to make a portfolio's effective delta 0.

On the off chance that an option has a delta of one and the underlying stock position increases by $1, the option's price will likewise increase by $1. This behavior is seen with deep [in-the-money](/inthemoney) call options. Moreover, on the off chance that an option has a delta of zero and the stock increases by $1, the option's price won't increase by any means (a behavior seen with deep [out-of-the-money](/outofthemoney) call options).

To get a delta-neutral position, you really want to go into a position that has a total delta of - 200. Expect then you find [at-the-money](/atthemoney) put options on Company X that are trading with a delta of - 0.5.

You could purchase 4 of these put options, which would have a total delta of (400 x - 0.5), or - 200. With this combined position of 200 Company X shares and 4 long at-the-cash put options on Company X, your overall position is delta neutral.
