# Currency Binary Option
## What Is a Currency Binary Option?

Currency binary options offer a go big or go home fixed payoff in view of an exchange rate in the [forex](/forex) market when the option terminates, which can be just five minutes subsequent to buying the option.

[Binary options](/binary-option) are in many cases utilized as a means to estimate on currencies, as opposed to an investment or hedge.

## How Currency Binary Options Work

Currency binary options are frequently viewed as a form of online gambling on currency markets, as opposed to investing or hedging. Not at all like [spot trading](/spottrade), you lose your whole stake in the event that the binary option isn't [in the money](/inthemoney) (ITM) at the hour of expiration. The premium on a currency binary addresses the consensus chances that the strike exchange rate will be reached by [expiration](/expirationdate). Also, currency binary options will more often than not have rather short expiration cycles, enduring from days to hours, or even minutes. To bring in any money, you must be right above and beyond half the time.

Since the chances are stacked for the house, short-term volatility in currency markets makes winning reliably with binary options undeniably challenging. Nobody, not even the best professional forex traders, can understand what will befall an exchange rate in the next 5 or 10 minutes. In any case, binary options trading, which is a generally new and to a great extent unregulated market, requests to individuals who appreciate habit-forming gambling products, as online poker.

Currency binary options are for the most part limited to major currency pairs like EUR/USD, GBP/USD and USD/YEN.

In the U.S., binary options are exceptionally regulated and just accessible on a small number of exchanges, like Nadex. They have all the earmarks of being more famous in European markets.

## Instances of Binary Currency Options

How about we utilize the [EUR-USD](/eur-usd-euro-us-dollar-currency-pair) currency pair to demonstrate how binary options can be utilized to trade forex. We utilize a week by week option that will lapse at 3 P.M. on Friday, or four days from now (or Monday). Expect the current [exchange rate](/exchangerate) is EUR 1 = USD 1.2440.

Think about the accompanying situations:

### 1. You accept the euro is probably not going to debilitate by Friday and ought to remain above 1.2425

The binary option EUR/USD>1.2425 is quoted at 49.00/55.00. You buy 10 contracts for a total of $550 (excluding commissions). At 3 P.M. on Friday, the euro is trading at USD 1.2450. Your binary option settles at 100, giving you a payout of $1,000. Your gross gain (before considering commissions) is $450, or around 82%. Notwithstanding, in the event that the euro had closed below 1.2425, you would lose your whole $550 investment, for a 100% loss.

### 2. You are bearish on the euro and accept it could decline by Friday, share with USD 1.2375

The binary option EUR/USD>1.2375 is quoted at 60.00/66.00. Since you are bearish on the euro, you would sell this option. Your initial cost to sell every binary option contract is, thusly, $40 ($100 - $60). Expect you sell 10 contracts, and receive a total of $400. At 3 P.M. on Friday, suppose the euro is trading at 1.2400.

Since the euro closed over the strike price of $1.2375 by expiration, you would lose the full $400 or 100% of your investment. Consider the possibility that the euro had closed below 1.2375, as you had expected. In that case, the contract would settle at $100, and you would receive a total of $1,000 for your 10 contracts, for a gain of $600 or 150%.
