Meta (formerly Facebook) gives nearby businesses a [social media](/social-media) platform to discuss directly with customers and advance their products.

This potential was realized somewhat, particularly by small independent businesses and website operators. In any case, online marketing specialists before long arose to deal with the message for businesses anxious to reevaluate the work. This cycle is once in a while called reintermediation.

Rather than depending on a confided in outsider, blockchain systems utilize a distributed consensus mechanism, for example, [proof of work](/proof-work) (PoW) or [proof of stake](/proof-stake-pos) (PoS).
