# Stripped MBS
## What Is a Stripped MBS?

A stripped mortgage-backed security (MBS) is a type of [mortgage-backed security](/mbs) that is split into [principal-only](/postrips) and [interest-only](/iostrips) [strips](/strip). They determine their cash flows either from principal or interest payments on the underlying mortgages, dissimilar to conventional MBSs that generate income from both of these two sources.

Stripped MBSs are extremely sensitive to [interest rate](/interestrate) changes, making them famous among investors who accept they can anticipate the future cost of borrowing.

## Grasping Stripped MBS

Mortgage-backed securities (MBSs) are investments comprised of a bundle of home [loans](/loan) bought from the banks that issued them. Investing in a MBS means purchasing the rights to these different mortgages. In the event that all goes to plan and the homebuyers don't [default](/default2), they ought to pay out standard month to month interest payments, the amount the lender charges to borrow the money, as well as the genuine repayment of the loan, also called the principal.

Stripped MBSs were made to appeal to various types of investors, giving them the option to get their hands on either the interest or the principal payments, instead of both. The investor is free to choose which strategy to seek after, in view of their income needs and the market outlook. In particular, this requires foreseeing where interest rates are going.

## Principal-Only Strips versus Interest-Only Strips

There are a few fundamental differences between principal-only strips and interest-only strips.

Principal-only strips comprise of a realized dollar amount yet an obscure payment timing. They are sold to investors at a discount on [face value](/facevalue), still up in the air by interest rates and [prepayment](/prepayment) speed.

Interest-only strips, then again, generate high levels of cash flow in the previous years and substantially lower cash flows in the later years. Investors can pick between the principal-only strips and the interest-only strips in view of their thought process interest rates will do from here on out.

## Special Considerations
### Interest Rates

As a result of their structure, interest rate changes oppositely affect principal-only and interest-only strips. Rising rates increase the [discount rate](/discountrate) applied to cash flows, diminishing the price of principal-only strips.

The [yield](/yield) on principal-only strips is impacted straight by the prepayment speed â€” the quicker the prepayment on the principal, the higher the overall yield for the principal-only strip investor. Since prepayment increases as interest rates fall, principal-only investors long for lower interest rates.

Conversely, interest-only strips rise in price when interest rates are pushed up. Higher interest rates likewise reduce prepayment levels, leading the mortgages to last longer. Under these conditions, the interest-only strips will move in value since they will gather interest over a lengthier period of time.

> A stripped MBS can be tailored to comprise of more interest or more principal, offering the investor a modified amount of [interest rate risk](/interestraterisk).

Basically, when interest rates are falling, principal-only strips will rise in price and interest-only strips will decline. Then again, when interest rates are rising, interest-only strips move in price and principal-only strips will decline. All in all, assuming that an investor accepts interest rates are on the rise, they will buy the interest-only strips. If all things considered, an investor accepts interest rates will decline, they will buy the principal-only strips.

## Highlights
- Income is derived either from principal or interest payments on the underlying mortgages, not at all like conventional MBSs whose cash flows depend on both.
- The profitability of principal-only strips and interest-only strips pivots fundamentally on the course of interest rates.
- A stripped mortgage-backed security (MBS) isolates the principal and interest bits of the MBS into individual securities.
