Along with your management team, you foster a plan for managing [cash flow](/cashflow) all through this critical period. With 20 team individuals and an average salary of $70,000, you estimate that payroll expenses will total $4.2 million over the period, for an average of $1.4 million every year. Office and administrative expenses, meanwhile, are estimated at $300,000 altogether, or $100,000 each year. Altogether, you hope to spend $4.5 million over the initial three years, leaving a contingency budget of $500,000.
