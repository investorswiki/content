# Tax And Price Index (TPI)
## What Does Tax And Price Index Mean?

The tax and price index (TPI) is a measure of the percentage that a purchaser's income must rise for them to keep up with a similar level of [purchasing power](/purchasingpower). The tax and price index (TPI) considers changes in retail prices due to [inflation](/inflation), as well as changes to direct taxes that reduce a purchaser's disposable income. This index is utilized in the United Kingdom.

Margaret Thatcher's administration previously presented the TPI metric. This additional TPI as a third method for estimating taxpayers' purchasing power and ability to keep up with expectations for everyday comforts, joining the [Retail Prices Index](/rpi) (RPI) and RPI(X).

An index, for example, the TPI assists policymakers with understanding how much a person's salary needs to rise for them to keep up with their quality of life over time.

## Understanding the Tax And Price Index (TPI)

The tax and price index considers a bigger number of factors than the Retail Prices Index. The RPI involves changes in retail prices just, though the TPI additionally considers different factors that influence [disposable income](/disposableincome), to be specific taxes. An increase in both [direct taxes](/directtax) and the price of retail goods requires shopper's income to increase more than retail prices alone. If direct taxes, for example, income taxes, decline while the price of retail goods increases, the RPI shows a greater increase than the TPI.

Metrics, for example, the TPI are important instruments for molding [fiscal policy](/fiscalpolicy) and labor regulations. Say the average salaried worker in a country procures $60,000 per year, and when they start that job, that salary allows this worker to reside serenely and purchase a home. Nonetheless, on the off chance that this equivalent representative keeps on working at a similar job at a similar precise salary, that $60,000 won't go as far 20 years after the fact. This is due to inflation and rising taxes.

## The TPI Today

The TPI is distributed consistently by the Office for National Statistics. In January of 2017, the rate of inflation as measured by the index rose 3.1% over the previous 12 months. This number is generally low, generally talking. For instance, the TPI mirrored a 25.5 year-over-year change in January 1975, mirroring the requirement for incomes to rise 25.5% over the year for a person to keep up with a similar purchasing power and quality of life.
