# Grid Trading
## What Is Grid Trading?

Grid trading is when orders are placed above and below a set price, making a grid of orders at gradually expanding and decreasing prices. Grid trading is generally commonly associated with the [foreign exchange](/foreign-exchange) market. Overall the technique tries to capitalize on normal price volatility in an asset by putting in buy and sell requests at certain ordinary intervals above and below a predefined base price.

For instance, a forex trader could put buy orders each 15 [pips](/pip) over a set price, while likewise putting sell orders each 15 pips below that price. This takes advantages of [trends](/pattern). They could likewise place buy orders below a set price, and sell orders above. This takes advantages of [ranging](/tradingrange) conditions.

## Understanding Grid Trading

An advantage of grid trading is that it requires little forecasting of market heading and can be handily automated. Major disadvantages, be that as it may, are the possibility of causing large losses in the event that stop-loss limits are not stuck to and the complexity associated with running or potentially closing different positions in a large grid.

The thought behind with-the-pattern grid trading is that assuming the price moves in a supported bearing the position gets greater to capitalize on it. As the price climbs, more buy orders are triggered bringing about a greater position. The position gets greater and more profitable the further the price runs that way.

However, this prompts a dilemma. Eventually the trader must decide when to end the grid, exit the trades, and understand the profits. Any other way, the price could [reverse](/inversion) and those profits will vanish. While losses are controlled by the sell orders, likewise similarly dispersed, when those orders are arrived at the position might have gone from profitable to losing money.

Thus, traders commonly limit their grid to a certain number of orders, like five. For instance, they place five buy orders over a set price. In the event that the price runs through all the buy orders they exit the trade with a profit. This should be possible at the same time or through a sell grid starting a target level.

In the event that the price action is choppy it could trigger buy orders over the set price and sell orders below the set price, bringing about a loss. This is where the with-the-pattern grid wavers. Eventually, the strategy is generally profitable on the off chance that the price runs in a supported heading. The price swaying to and fro regularly doesn't create great outcomes.

In swaying or running markets, against-the-pattern grid trading will in general be more effective. For instance, the trader places buy orders at normal intervals below a set price, and places sell orders at customary intervals over the set price. As the price falls, the trader gets [long](/long). As the price rises the sell orders are triggered to reduce the long position and possibly get [short](/short). The trader profits as long as the price keeps on swaying sideways, triggering both and sell orders.

The problem with the against-the-pattern grid is that the risk isn't controlled. The trader could wind up accumulating an increasingly large losing position in the event that the price continues to run in one heading as opposed to going. At last, the trader must set a stop loss level, as they can't keep on holding a losing (let alone make greater) position endlessly.

## Grid Trading Construction

To build a grid there are several moves toward follow.

- Pick an interval, like 10 pips, 50 pips, or 100 pips, for instance.
- Decide the starting price for the grid.
- Decide if the grid will be with-the-pattern or against-the-pattern.

In a with-the-pattern grid, expect a trader picks a starting point of 1.1550 and a 10 pip interval. Place buy orders at 1.1560, 1.1570, 1.1580, 1.1590, and 1.1600. Place sell orders at 1.1540, 1.1530, 1.1520, 1.1510, and 1.1500. This strategy requires an exit when things are working out positively to [lock in profits](/lock_in_profits).

Expect the trader selects to utilize an against-the-pattern grid. They likewise pick 1.1550 as the starting point and a 10 pip interval. They place buy orders at 1.1540, 1.1530, 1.1520, 1.1510, and 1.1500. They place sell orders at 1.1560, 1.1570, 1.1580, 1.1590, and 1.1600. This strategy will lock in profits as both buy and sell orders are triggered, however it requires a stop loss in the event that the price moves in a single bearing.

## Illustration of Grid Trading in the EURUSD

Expect an informal investor sees that the [EURUSD](/eur-usd-euro-us-dollar-money pair) is going somewhere in the range of 1.1400 and 1.1500. The price is as of now close to 1.1450, so the trader picks to utilize a 10 pip interval against-the-pattern grid to capitalize on the reach possibly.

The trader places a sell order at 1.1460, 1.1470, 1.1480, 1.1490, 1.1500, and 1.1510. A stop loss is placed at 1.1530. This guarantees there is a cap to the risk. The risk is 270 pips on the off chance that all the sell orders are triggered, no grid buy orders are triggered, and the stop loss is reached.

They likewise place buy orders at 1.1440, 1.1430, 1.1420, 1.1410, 1.1400, and 1.1390. They place a stop loss at 1.1370. The risk is 270 pips in the event that all the buy orders are triggered, no grid sell orders are triggered, and the stop loss is reached.

The trader is trusting the price will move higher and lower, or lower and higher inside the scope of 1.1510 and 1.1390. Despite the fact that they are likewise trusting that the price doesn't move too far outside that reach, any other way they will be forced to exit with a loss to control their risk.

## Features

- Grid trading includes submitting buy and sell requests at set intervals around a set price.
- To profit from ranges, place buy orders at intervals below the set price, and sell orders over the set price.
- To profit from trends, place buy orders at intervals over the set price, and sell orders below the set price.
