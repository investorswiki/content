# Special Assessment Bond
## What is Special Assessment Bond?

Special assessment bonds are [general obligation bonds](/generalobligationbond), usually issued to fund development projects, where the interest owed is paid by taxes demanded exclusively on the beneficiaries of that project.

## Understanding Special Assessment Bond

A [municipal bond](/municipalbond) is issued by a state or nearby government to raise capital to fund projects like highways, sewage systems, sporting parks, public schools, etc. At the point when a municipal bond is issued to sponsor the improvement of properties in a specific area of a city, town, or province, the bond is alluded to as a special assessment bond.

Investors that purchase a special assessment bond receive periodic interest from the [issuer](/issuer) until the bond develops, when the [principal](/principal) will be repaid to bondholders. The payment obligations on the bond are guaranteed from revenue that is received from the portion of taxes demanded on occupants that straightforwardly benefit from the project. All in all, extra tax is forced exclusively on the people who will benefit straightforwardly from the improvement to settle the payments on the bond issue. Special assessment taxes can't surpass the total cost of the project.

For instance, in the event that a special assessment bond was issued to pay for walkways to be re-cleared in a certain community, an extra tax would be demanded on homeowners in the area benefiting from this project. Area homeowners get more pleasant strolling ways, and will presumably see the value of their property increase likewise, yet this includes some significant pitfalls. Their [property taxes](/propertytax) will increase to pay the interest owed to the bondholders by the municipality. Since the interest on special assessment bonds is paid by taxes of the community that benefit from the development, it isn't unusual for the individuals from the benefiting community to invest in the issue, accordingly, offsetting the extra taxes that are required to finance the bond.

The interest on a special assessment bond might be fixed or variable. The length of maturity will fluctuate contingent upon how complex the project is, with the common maturity range falling between one to 20 years. Moreover, these bonds could possibly be backed by the [full faith and credit](/full-faith-credit) of the municipal government. On the off chance that it isn't secured by a full faith and credit pledge, it is more unsafe than a [general obligation bond](/generalobligationbond) of a similar issuer.

Like most municipal bonds, the interest on special assessment bonds is exempt from federal taxes, and most state and neighborhood taxes in the event that the investor lives in the state or municipality giving the debt. The higher an investor's [marginal tax rate](/marginaltaxrate), the more important the bond's tax exemption is and, subsequently, more alluring. Thusly, there is generally more grounded demand for special assessment bonds in states with high tax rates. On the off chance that a state or the federal government diminishes tax rates, the bonds lose a portion of their advantage for high-tax-section people and, in this way, become less alluring.
