# Market Index Target-Term Securities (MITTS)
## What Are Market Index Target-Term Securities (MITTS)?

The [market index](/marketindex) target-term security is a type of principal-protected note intended to give equity exposure while protecting the initial investment. It was initially designed by Merrill Lynch and was intended to limit the amount of downside risk an investor is presented to, while likewise giving a return that is proportional to that of a predetermined stock market index. Market index target-term securities typically don't bear the cost of their owner the right to reclaim the security before maturity, nor do they generally bear the cost of the right to call the issue in ahead of schedule.

## Understanding Market Index Target-Term Securities (MITTS)

The purpose of a market index target-term security is to give equity exposure to an investor's portfolio while as yet giving a guarantee that, even if the [stock market](/stockmarket) performs ineffectively during a predetermined investment horizon, they will in any case be left with a predefined least amount of capital. However market index target-term securities invest in equity markets, they are viewed as debt instruments.

## MITTS Examples

For instance, expect an investor could purchase market index target-term security units today at a price of $10 per unit. The market index target-term securities mature in precisely one year, when they require the return of the $10 principal value to the investor, plus a proportional return in light of the performance of the chose index, like the S&P 500, during that time span.

In this way, if the [S&P 500](/sp500) crashes during the year, the investor actually receives the $10 per unit back. Nonetheless, assuming the S&P 500 in all actuality does well during the year, the investor will receive the $10 per unit back, plus an extra amount for each unit that is calculated in view of the S&P 500's return. A percentage of any earnings acquired by the market index target-term security is generally guaranteed by the issuer of the security, alongside standard fees.

In this 2019 offering from Bank of America, market index target-term securities were offered at a price of $10 per unit, linked to the S&P 500, with a maturity of approximately six years. The securities were subject to a maximum return of half to 70% at the maturity date. In the event that the S&P 500 index was flat or had declined at the hour of the maturity date, the holder would in any case be guaranteed a return of the principal amount.

## Downsides of MITTS

Second, holders are completely restricted from selling market index target-term securities prior to the maturity date. Also, investors who purchase these securities are trading likely upside for downside protection. While the principal is protected, the investor will just understand a portion of any possible gains.
