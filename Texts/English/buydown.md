Builders or sellers might offer a buydown option to assist with expanding the possibilities selling the property, by making it more affordable.

## Buydown Structuring

Buydown terms can be structured in different ways for mortgage loans. Most buydowns last for a couple of years, then the mortgage payments increase to a standard rate once the buydown lapses. A 3-2-1 and 2-1 mortgage buydown are two common structures lenders can utilize.

### 3-2-1 Buydown

In a [3-2-1 buydown](/3-2-1_buydown), the buyer pays lower payments on the loan for the initial three years. For every one of the initial three years of the mortgage, the buyer's interest rate would increase steadily by 1% yearly. The full interest rate would apply beginning with the fourth year of the mortgage loan.

While the buyer received savings from the lower interest rate in the initial three years, the difference in the payments would have been made by the seller to the lender as a subsidy.

### 2-1 Buydown

A [2-1 buydown](/2-1_buydown) is structured equivalent to a 3-2-1 buydown; notwithstanding, its discount is just available for the initial two years. So you would have a 2% interest rate reduction for the principal year of the mortgage, then, at that point, a 1% rate discount for the second year of the mortgage. Your interest rate — and your regularly scheduled payments — would increase after some time until your loan arrives at its genuine percentage rate.

This occurs in year three of the loan. Right now, your month to month mortgage payment would mirror the true loan rate. You would pay up front for the 2-1 buydown at closing, and, hypothetically, the money that you save over the initial two years would cancel out that payment.
