# Asset Allocation
Asset allocation is the means by which your assets are split between different asset classes to reduce risk and possibly increase your returns. Each type of asset - stocks, bonds, and even cash - performs contrastingly over the long haul, and smart asset allocation includes making a portfolio that upgrades your long-term return and limits your risks while you accomplish it.
Smart investors use asset allocation to make a portfolio that meets their financial requirements and demeanor - calculating in their risk tolerance, time horizon, and need for investment returns.
This is the very thing you really want to be aware of asset allocation and how it can benefit you.
## How asset allocation functions
Asset allocation relies upon asset classes having various traits. Every asset class might perform diversely when an economy moves in a given heading. As the economy develops, a few assets climb, while others might remain flat or even go down, contingent upon the specific conditions.
This quality of being non-connected allows investors to build portfolios that zig when the market crosses. By mixing and matching the characteristics of the asset classes, an investor or financial adviser can make a portfolio less unstable and possibly accomplish similar returns as or better than a riskier portfolio. Asset allocation exploits the principle of diversification to reduce risk.
For example, on the off chance that you have 30 years until retirement, you can bear to face more challenge in exchange for the higher potential returns accessible in the stock market. So a financial adviser or robo-adviser would generally suggest a higher allocation toward stocks and less in low-return bonds.
In any case, as you close to retirement an adviser could step by step shift you into more secure assets, like more CDs or bonds. CDs offer guaranteed returns, a significant characteristic when you really want low risk.
## What are the important asset classes?
Below are some key asset classes and a few general traits of each:
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<th>Asset class</th><th>Characteristics</th></tr>
</tbody>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Stocks</td><td>High risk, high return. Stocks can return the most over time, but will fluctuate the most along the way. Some stocks are less risky than others, such as dividend stocks. Stocks tend to do well in a growing economy and poorly in a weak one.</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>Bonds</td><td>Bonds pay regular interest income and tend to be relatively stable. Bonds are usually much safer than stocks, though the performance of the bond depends a lot on the quality of the issuer (government, corporation, or others).</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>Real estate</td><td>Real estate comes in many forms, and you can make money on price appreciation as well as income. Physically owning real estate can have a different risk-return profile than buying it through a real estate investment trust on the stock market, and may include a lot more work, too. Real estate tends to appreciate slowly over time while throwing off cash.</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>Cash</td><td>Cash is the most stable asset of all, but it receives very low returns and loses value to inflation over time. However, it’s immensely important in a downturn, because it can float you through an emergency and may be invested in assets that have declined in value. A high-yield account can max its value.</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>Gold</td><td>Gold is a popular investment that often does well when the economy gets into trouble or when other assets are doing poorly. Many investors use gold as a hedge or a store of value, especially when they think inflation may pick up due to the government printing more money.</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>Alternative assets</td><td>Alternative assets include private equity funds, obscure precious metals, farmland, art and whatever else investors think might not be correlated to the broader markets. Non-correlation is  often key to what is categorized as an alternative asset.</td></tr>
