# Portfolio Income

Portfolio income is money received from investments, dividends, interest, and [capital gains](/capitalgain). Sovereignties received from investment property additionally are viewed as portfolio income sources.

It is one of three principal categories of income. The others are active income and passive income.

Most portfolio income seeks great tax treatment. Dividends and capital gains are taxed at a lower rate than earned income. Moreover, portfolio income isn't subject to Social Security or Medicare taxes.

## Grasping Portfolio Income

Of the three categories, active income is the most straightforward to comprehend. It is money earned by finishing a work or playing out a service. The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) calls it wages, salaries, and tips.

Recognizing portfolio income from passive income is somewhat trickier.

Passive income is a revenue stream that might include some initial exertion or expenditure yet keeps on harvesting payments down the line. Music and book eminences and property rent payments are models. The interest on savings accounts is passive income. A limited partnership, where an individual possesses a share of a business yet doesn't take part in its operation, produces passive income.

Portfolio income doesn't come from passive investments and isn't earned through standard business activity. It comes from dividends, interest, and capital gains, or from interest paid on loans.

The categories of income are important for tax purposes. Losses in passive income generally can't be offset against active or portfolio income.

## 3 Ways to Increase Portfolio Income
### Purchase High-Paying Dividend Stocks

Investors can increase their portfolio income by buying stocks that pay better than expected dividends.

Dividends can be paid straightforwardly to the shareholder or used to purchase extra shares in the company, alluded to as a [dividend reinvestment plan](/dividendreinvestmentplan) (DRIP). For instance, a company might pay a cash dividend of $2 per share yearly. On the off chance that the investor has a holding of 200 shares, the cash dividend payment would be $400 ($2 x 200 shares).

### Purchase Dividend Exchange-Traded Funds

Buying ETFs that specifically track high-paying dividend stocks is a practical method for expanding portfolio income. For instance, the Vanguard High Dividend Yield ETF tracks the FTSE High Dividend Yield Index. The index incorporates 396 stocks that have high dividend yields.

The selection criteria for other dividend ETF decisions might zero in on the number of sequential years the company that has paid a dividend or on companies that have a history of expanding their dividend payments every year.

### Compose Options

An investor can increase portfolio income by composing call options against their stock holdings.

For instance, assume an investor claims 100 shares of Microsoft and the stock is trading at $175 per share. The investor could consent to sell the shares if the stock ascents 10% to $192.50. To do this, the investor sells 1 call option with a [strike price](/strikeprice) of $192.50 at $2.

The investor would receive an option premium (portfolio income) of $200 ($2 x 100 shares). On the day the option lapses, it becomes worthless assuming Microsoft is trading below $192.50, permitting the investor to keep the premium with no further obligation. In any case, If Microsoft is trading over the strike price on the day the option terminates, the investor is obliged to sell their shares to the buyer of the call option at $192.50, and that means they receive $19,250 ($192.50 x 100 shares), plus the $200 options premium.
