## What Is the Nova/Ursa Ratio?

The Nova/Ursa ratio is an equity market [sentiment indicator](/sentimentindicator) in view of the bullish Nova and bearish Ursa funds from the Rydex Fund Group (a subsidiary of Guggenheim Investments). The Nova fund tries to give investment returns that match, before fees and expenses, 150% of the daily performance of the S&P 500\u00ae Index. The Ursa fund is a [inverse fund](/bear-fund) that tracks the S&P 500 index in reverse on a 1:1 basis.

The relative amount of assets in each fund to each other can be utilized as a proxy for the heading of market sentiment. All the more explicitly, a high value addresses an overall bullish sentiment and a low value addresses a bearish sentiment.
