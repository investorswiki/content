# Gross Rate of Return
## What Is the Gross Rate of Return?

The gross rate of return is the total [rate of return](/rateofreturn) on an investment before the deduction of any fees, commissions, or [expenses](/expense). The gross rate of return is quoted over a specific period of time, like a month, quarter, or year. This can be stood out from the net rate of return, which deducts fees and costs to give a more realistic measurement of return.

## Figuring out Gross Rate of Return

The gross rate of return on an investment is one measure of a project or investment's [gross profit](/grossprofit). It normally incorporates [capital gains](/capitalgain) and any income received from the investment. By comparison, the net rate of return deducts fees and expenses from the investment's last value. The formula for gross rate of return is:

## Special Considerations

Subtleties on how an investment company computes returns are many times remembered for the fund's [prospectus](/prospectus). The gross rate of return is much of the time quoted as the rate of return on an investment in fund marketing materials. Returns for over a year are frequently annualized, which gives the geometric average return of an investment for every year throughout a given time span.

In investment management, the CFA Institute's Global Investment Performance Standards (GIPS) oversee the calculation and reporting of returns. Investors can depend on the GIPS return standards for contrasting investment-return characteristics across the industry.

## Types of Gross Return

Investors frequently use return calculations while thinking about another investment or evaluating the performance of an investment. Net return is normally not generally so handily distinguished as a gross return. Thus, investors frequently go to the expense ratio to decide what the expenses mean for the return of the fund.

The [expense ratio](/expenseratio) is a mutual fund characteristic that addresses the percentage of fund assets paid for expenses. It is many times utilized related to a fund's total return and benchmark return to give a comparison of the fund's performance.

For instance, a reality sheet given by one of the market's top enormous cap funds, the Quanti\u00adfied STF Fund (MUTF: QSTFX), gives an illustration of how returns and expenses are communicated. The Quantified STF Fund reports a gross rate of return. It likewise gives a breakdown of the fund's expenses and has an expense ratio of 1.71%.

## Gross Rate of Return versus Net Return

For net return, fees and commissions are deducted, as well as the effects of taxes and [inflation](/inflation). A currency loses [purchasing power](/purchasingpower) due to inflation, which likewise influences the return on an investment. Consequently, inflation ought to be remembered for the calculation of real return. If, for instance, annual inflation is 2% and the nominal return on an investment is 1%, the investor will have made a negative real return in the course of one year.

In this manner, the gross rate of return can be substantially unique in relation to the net rate of return, which deducts fees and expenses. For instance, the gross return realized on a mutual fund that charges a 5.75% [sales charge](/salescharge) will be totally different than the net return, which will be realized after the charge has been deducted.

## Features
- The Global Investment Performance Standards permits investors to compare the return characteristics of various funds.
- A net rate of return is the investment's return after costs, like taxes, inflation, and different fees.
- A gross rate of return is intelligent of an investment's return before expenses or any deductions.
- The net rate of return is many times more hard to unequivocally compute than the gross rate of return, so a fund's expense ratio is in many cases considered in gauging the return value of the fund.
