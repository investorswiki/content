# Price Improvement
## What Is Price Improvement?

Price improvement includes achieving a trade at a better price than the price quoted at the time an order was set. It would mean finding a higher [bid](/bid) price on the off chance that you are selling an asset, or a lower [ask](/ask) price in the event that you are buying an asset.

While many brokers promote their ability to get price improvement for their clients' orders, price improvement is generally an opportunity and never a guarantee.

## Figuring out Price Improvement

Price improvement happens when an order is filled at a more favorable price than anticipated. On account of a limit order, for example, with a limit price to buy XYZ shares at $10.00, in the event that a broker can take care of the request for $9.98 all things considered, it would demonstrate a 2-pennies price improvement.

The root sources of price improvements aren't generally totally clear, yet they frequently have to do with simple changes in [supply and demand](/law-of-supply-demand) in the market. Different times, the changes emerge from the pricing differences that exist starting with one market then onto the next and rely upon whether the brokerage firm is buying or selling shares for the benefit of itself.

Albeit numerous brokerages will claim they offer price improvement to clients with lines like "battling for that last $0.01," there is no guarantee this will really occur, regardless of what brokerage is making the claim.

## Price Improvement and National Best Bid and Offer

Understanding the [National Best Bid and Offer (NBBO)](/nbbo) is essential to grasping the idea of price improvement. Under SEC rules, the NBBO comprises of the highest displayed buy and most reduced sell prices among the different exchanges trading a security. Exchanges and liquidity suppliers can route orders to the exchange with the best quote addressed in the NBBO. On the other hand, it can match or work on those prices and execute on their own market setting.

In value markets, different liquidity suppliers might decide not to display their orders to abstain from uncovering their trading strategy. In such a case, all available liquidity may not be displayed in the NBBO. To oblige those traders, exchanges might permit them to post their orders secretly, away from the openly displayed quotes. Getting to this better-priced, non-displayed liquidity sets out open doors for liquidity suppliers to offer better benefit at execution.

Another way that liquidity suppliers might work on a price on an order while trading as a [market maker](/marketmaker) is match the NBBO price for additional shares than the displayed size available at the NBBO. This method is frequently alluded to as liquidity enhancement.

## Illustration of Price Improvement

Price improvement on an individual transaction is calculated in light of the contrast between the execution price and the NBBO at the hour of the order. The amount of price improvement per share might be not exactly the base quotation price increase (normally, one penny). For instance, consider a trader that puts in a request to buy 1,000 shares of XYZ stock as of now quoted at $25.30 per share.

On the off chance that the order is executed at $25.29, the trader gets a $0.01 per share of price improvement, bringing about a total savings of $10.00 (1,000 shares \u00d7 $0.01).
