# Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT)
## What Is the Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT)?

The modern portfolio theory (MPT) is a commonsense method for choosing investments to expand their overall returns inside an acceptable level of risk.

American economist [Harry Markowitz](/harrymarkowitz) spearheaded this theory in his paper "Portfolio Selection," which was distributed in the Journal of Finance in 1952. He was subsequently granted a Nobel Prize for his work on modern portfolio theory.

A key part of the MPT theory is diversification. Most investments are either high risk and high return or low risk and low return. Markowitz contended that investors could accomplish their best outcomes by picking an optimal mix of the two in light of an assessment of their individual tolerance to risk.

## Grasping the Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT)

The modern portfolio theory contends that any given investment's risk and return qualities ought not be seen alone yet ought to be assessed by what it means for the overall portfolio's risk and return. That is, an investor can develop a portfolio of numerous assets that will bring about greater returns without a higher level of risk.

As an alternative, starting with an ideal level of expected return, the investor can develop a portfolio with the lowest conceivable risk that is capable of delivering that return.

In light of statistical measures, for example, [variance](/variance) and [correlation](/correlation), a single investment's performance is less important than what it means for the whole portfolio.

### Acceptable Risk

The MPT assumes that investors are risk-unwilling, meaning they favor a safer portfolio to a riskier one for a given level of return. As a pragmatic matter, risk aversion suggests that a great many people ought to invest in numerous [asset classes](/assetclasses).

The expected return of the portfolio is calculated as a [weighted](/weighted) sum of the returns of the individual assets. In the event that a portfolio contained four similarly weighted assets with expected returns of 4%, 6%, 10%, and 14%, the portfolio's expected return would be:

(4% x 25%) + (6% x 25%) + (10% x 25%) + (14% x 25%) = 8.5%

The portfolio's risk is a function of the variances of every asset and the correlations of each pair of assets. To work out the risk of a four-asset portfolio, an investor needs every one of the four assets' variances and six correlation values, since there are six potential two-asset combinations with four assets. In view of the asset correlations, the total portfolio risk, or [standard deviation](/standarddeviation), is lower than what might be calculated by a weighted sum.

## Benefits of the MPT

The MPT is a valuable device for investors who are attempting to build diversified portfolios. As a matter of fact, the growth of exchange-traded funds (ETFs) made the MPT more significant by giving investors simpler access to a more extensive scope of asset classes.

For instance, stock investors can reduce risk by placing a portion of their portfolios in government bond ETFs. The variance of the portfolio will be essentially lower since government bonds have a negative correlation with stocks. Adding a small investment in Treasuries to a stock portfolio won't generally affect expected returns due to this misfortune decreasing effect.

### Searching for Negative Correlation

Likewise, the MPT can be utilized to reduce the volatility of a U.S. Treasury portfolio by putting 10% in a small-cap value index fund or ETF. Albeit small-cap value stocks are far riskier than Treasuries all alone, they frequently well during periods of high inflation when bonds do ineffectively. Subsequently, the portfolio's overall volatility is lower than it would be in the event that it comprised totally of government bonds. Besides, the expected returns are higher.

The modern portfolio theory allows investors to develop more efficient portfolios. Each conceivable combination of assets can be plotted on a graph, with the portfolio's risk on the X-pivot and the expected return on the Y-hub. This plot uncovers the best combinations for a portfolio.

For instance, assume Portfolio A has an expected return of 8.5% and a standard deviation of 8%. Assume that Portfolio B has an expected return of 8.5% and a standard deviation of 9.5%. Portfolio A would be considered more efficient on the grounds that it has a similar expected return however lower risk.

Drawing a vertical inclining curve to interface the most efficient portfolios is all conceivable. This curve is called the [efficient frontier](/efficientfrontier).

Investing in a portfolio under the curve isn't alluring in light of the fact that it doesn't boost returns for a given level of risk.

## Analysis of the MPT

Maybe the most serious analysis of the MPT is that it assesses portfolios in light of variance as opposed to [downside risk](/downsiderisk).

That is, two portfolios that have similar level of variance and returns are viewed as similarly helpful under modern portfolio theory. One portfolio might have that variance as a result of incessant small losses. Another could have that variance in view of rare yet stupendous declines. Most investors would favor incessant small losses, which would be simpler to persevere.

The [post-modern portfolio theory](/pmpt) (PMPT) attempts to develop modern portfolio theory by limiting downside risk rather than variance.

## Highlights
- The modern portfolio theory can be valuable to investors attempting to develop efficient and diversified portfolios utilizing ETFs.
- Investors who are more worried about downside risk could favor the post-modern portfolio theory (PMPT) to MPT.
- The modern portfolio theory (MPT) is a method that can be utilized by risk-loath investors to develop diversified portfolios that expand their returns without unacceptable levels of risk.
## FAQ
### What Are the Benefits of the Modern Portfolio Theory?
The modern portfolio theory can be utilized to expand a portfolio to get a better return overall without a greater risk.Another benefit of the modern portfolio theory (and of diversification) is that it can reduce volatility. The best method for doing that is to pick assets that have a negative correlation, like U.S. treasuries and small-cap stocks.Ultimately, the goal of the modern portfolio theory is to make the absolute most efficient portfolio.
### What Is the Difference Between the Modern Portfolio Theory and the Post-Modern Portfolio Theory?
The modern portfolio theory (MPT) was a leap forward in personal investing. It recommends that a conservative investor can improve by picking a mix of low-risk and riskier investments than by going completely with low-risk decisions. All the more importantly, it proposes that the seriously remunerating option doesn't add extra overall risk. This is the key attribute of portfolio diversification.The [post-modern portfolio theory](/pmpt) (PMPT) doesn't go against these fundamental assumptions. Nonetheless, it changes the formula for assessing risk in an investment to address what its designers perceived as imperfections in the original.Followers of the two hypotheses use software that depends on either MPT or PMPT to build portfolios that match the level of risk that they look for.
### What Is the Importance of the Efficient Frontier in the MPT?
The efficient frontier is a foundation of the modern portfolio theory. The line demonstrates the combination of investments that will give the highest level of return for the lowest level of risk.When a portfolio tumbles to the right of the efficient frontier, it has greater risk relative to its anticipated return. At the point when it falls underneath the slant of the efficient frontier, it offers a lower level of return relative to risk.
