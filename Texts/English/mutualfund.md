# Mutual Fund
A mutual fund is an investment vehicle that allows individuals to invest their money along with different investors. These funds invest in an assortment of securities, for example, stocks, bonds and money market funds. Most mutual funds invest in a large number of securities, allowing investors to diversify their portfolios for a minimal price.
By and large, personal investment advisors have tended to work for the most part with the people who have large amounts of money to invest. Plus, keeping a diversified portfolio can be unreasonable for most investors to do all alone. Mutual funds hope to tackle these issues and that's just the beginning.
While mutual funds face wild competition for investors' dollars as low-cost index funds and exchange-traded funds (ETFs), they actually remain very famous. Here we'll talk about how mutual funds work, their advantages and disadvantages and answer a few key inquiries to assist you with choosing if these types of investments seem OK for your portfolio.

Consequently, while the fund probably invests in companies, for example, Amazon and Microsoft, you don't possess shares in those companies. All things considered, you basically own shares in the mutual fund.
The share price vacillates in light of the net asset value (NAV) of the mutual fund's all's assets. NAV is calculated by dividing the total value of a mutual fund's assets (less liabilities) by the total number of shares outstanding. In this way, changes in the share price don't reflect variances in that frame of mind of a single company, however rather they mirror the net change in every one of the companies in which the fund invests.
You can buy shares in a mutual fund from whichever brokerage you like. In any case, employer-sponsored retirement plans largely invest in mutual funds, so you might be invested in them without even acknowledging it.
