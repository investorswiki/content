In this manner, the National Bank Act of 1863 forced 25% reserve requirements for banks under its charge. Those requirements and a tax on state banknotes in 1865 guaranteed that national bank notes supplanted different currencies as a medium of exchange.

The creation of the Federal Reserve and its constituent banks in 1913 as a [lender of last resort](/lenderoflastresort) further disposed of risks and costs required in keeping up with reserves and pared-down reserve requirements from their previous high levels. For instance, reserve requirements for three types of banks under the Federal Reserve were set at 13%, 10%, and 7% in 1917.

In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Federal Reserve decreased the reserve requirement ratio to zero across all deposit tiers, effective March 26, 2020. The aim of this reduction was to kick off the economy by permitting banks to utilize extra liquidity to loan to people and businesses.
