# Long Run Incremental Cost (LRIC)
## What Is Long Run Incremental Cost (LRIC)?

A long run [incremental cost](/incrementalcost) (LRIC) is a forward-looking cost that a company needs to remember for its accounting. Long run incremental costs are steady costs a company can foresee and plan for over the long term.

## Seeing Long Run Incremental Cost (LRIC)

A long run incremental cost (LRIC) alludes to the changing costs that a company can to some degree predict. Instances of long-run incremental costs incorporate energy and oil price increases, rent increases, expansion costs, and [maintenance expenses.](/maintenance-expenses)

Long run incremental costs frequently allude to the changes affiliated with making a product, for example, the cost of [raw materials](/rawmaterials). For instance, express production for a certain manufactured great requires a lot of oil. On the off chance that oil prices are expected to decline, the long run incremental cost of delivering the great is likewise prone to decline. There is no guarantee that long run incremental costs will change in the specific amount anticipated, however endeavoring to compute such costs assists a company with making future [investment](/investment) choices.

The impacts of long run incremental costs should be visible on the [income statement](/incomestatement). For instance, assuming that the action taken brought about more revenue, revenues would increase. Also, [cost of goods sold](/pinions) would increase as would [operating expenses](/operating_expense). These are the areas that would increase or diminish relying upon whether a company chose to create more or less goods or services, which long run incremental cost (LRIC) tries to measure.

Long run incremental costs (LRIC) as a rule impact the price of a decent or service too. On the off chance that the [cost per unit](/unitcost) of a decent increases due to an increase in long run incremental costs (LRICs) then, at that point, a company would need to increase the price of its product to keep up with a similar profit margin. On the off chance that the unit cost diminished, a company would reduce the price of its product to keep up with the equivalent [profit margin](/profitmargin) and maybe increase demand or it could operate with a higher profit margin.

## Long Run Incremental Cost (LRIC) Evaluation

Accurate cost prediction and measurement is critical to appropriately pricing goods and services. Companies with the most reliable cost measurement can sufficiently characterize whether they are creating a gain, and expertise to check expected new products and investments. Utilizing an accurate method to determine costs is a primary focal point of [cost accounting](/cost-accounting) and financial control. Incremental and marginal costs are two fundamental apparatuses to assess future production and investment opportunities.

Recently made purchases or investments, like the cost of a plot of land or the cost of building a factory, are alluded to as [sunk costs](/sunkcost) and are excluded from long run incremental cost predictions. Incremental costs can incorporate several different [direct](/directcost) or indirect costs, but just costs that will change are to be incorporated.

For instance, say a factory production line is at full capacity and consequently the company might want to add another production line. Incremental costs could incorporate the cost of new equipment, individuals to staff the line, power to run the line, and extra human resources and benefits. This multitude of costs would be viewed as long-term incremental costs since they would be executed as long-term parts of the business. These are not short-term costs that would be wiped out soon.

## Long Run Incremental Cost (LRIC) versus Marginal Cost

On the other hand, [marginal costs](/marginalcostofproduction) allude to the cost of creating another unit of a service or product. Goods or services with high marginal costs will more often than not be unique and work escalated, though low marginal cost things are normally very [price competitive](/competitive-pricing).

The marginal cost is the change in total cost that comes from making or delivering one extra thing. The purpose of examining marginal cost is to determine when an organization can accomplish [economies of scale](/economiesofscale), which alludes to the reduced costs per unit that emerge from an increased total output of a product.

## Highlights
- Long run incremental costs (LRIC) can incorporate changes to the cost of raw materials, increases in rent, and maintenance costs.
- Assessing long run incremental costs (LRIC) assists a company with settling on future investment and operational choices.
- Marginal costs are comparable yet different to long run incremental costs and allude to the cost of creating another unit of a service or great.
- A long run incremental cost (LRIC) is a cost that a company causes bit by bit over the long term and can foresee.
- Sunk costs are excluded from long run incremental cost predictions.
