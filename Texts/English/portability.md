# Portability
## What is portability?
Portability is the ability to switch insurers flawlessly without pre-existing condition rejections.
## More profound definition
While portability has an important significance in finance terms, there are various different purposes for this genuinely common word. Different definitions include:
- Something that has the quality of being portable.
- A plan where union individuals can shift their pension rights between employers who have negotiated the right with the union.

In technology, portability has yet another significance, alluding to the measure of how basically an application can be transferred starting with one computer then onto the next. An application is viewed as portable if the transfer starting with one unit then onto the next is inside a reasonable limit of difficulty.
All in its definitions, portability generally alludes to a reusability of some sort or another. For small things that can be transferred from one place to another, portability disposes of the need to have various duplicates of a similar thing in one place and another.
For benefits, including medical coverage and pension plans, employees receive protection for their wellbeing plans while switching from one employer to another or resigning. The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPPA) safeguards individuals in certain group plans.
HIPPA can be essential for individuals who have certain pre-existing conditions, as it guarantees that they will keep up with coverage, even when another plan may not offer matching benefits for those individuals. The expectation of this protection is to dispose of discrimination against in any case uninsurable individuals.
## Portability model
In the event that you have a union job, you might have the option to transfer your pension plans and a benefits from one employer to another who have negotiated plans with your union.
This safeguards your investments and offers you the chance to take the action, absent a lot of difficulty in transferring benefits. This is an illustration of how portability assists individuals with effectively moving their benefits to suit a job switch or crosscountry move.
For more established individuals who are resigning and have continuing medical problems, portability means that their wellbeing coverage from their job will proceed when they retire. This wipes out the requirement for them to find another plan that might require higher premiums or deny coverage for their pre-existing condition.

## Features
