## WHAT IS a Graveyard Market

A graveyard market is one in which bearish sentiment persists, making existing investors sell and new investors to remain uninvolved. Existing investors would rather not acknowledge their large [unrealized losses](/unrealizedloss), and, as a result, they may not even gander at their [brokerage](/brokerageaccount) statements. At the same time, new investors remain fearful of future market declines and are reluctant to buy, even at lower prices. For the two groups, the market appears dead, or in a zombie-like state.

## BREAKING DOWN Graveyard Market

A graveyard market reflects huge declines in the market over numerous months, on the off chance that not years. Risk aversion is the prevailing theme, even however valuation multiples might be low by historical standards.

For example, the S&P 500 dropped by 56.8% over the course of 517 days during the bear market of 2007-2009. Current, forward and, surprisingly, 10-year, or [CAPE](/cape-ratio) stock multiples generally fell precipitously, yet buyers actually remained reluctant until March of 2009. Even then, numerous who had money to invest refused to re-enter for quite some time.

Conversely, [Black Monday](/blackmonday), in 1987, isn't a graveyard market even however it positions among the very most terrible declines for a single trading day, in percentage terms. Unlike the graveyard market conditions in 2007-2009, the 1987 crash didn't last very long.

Genuinely brief market declines as measured by points additionally are not graveyard markets. For example, the Dow Jones Industrial Index posted a record decline as measured by index points in February 2018. This led to many negative news headlines, however not a graveyard market.

Some of the most terrible graveyard markets ever include the market crash of 1929 that preceded the Great Depression, the Tech Bubble of 2000 and the aforementioned [Great Recession](/great-recession) of 2007-2009.

## Checking a Graveyard Market

There is no single tool for predicting a graveyard market, or when it might end. One useful gauge, however, is the CAPE ratio, developed by Yale economics professor Robert Shiller. It likewise is known as the Shiller P/E, or [P/E 10 ratio.](/pe10ratio) The CAPE ratio smooths changes in market P/Es that are the result of boom and bust economic cycles.

For example, companies tend to have higher [earnings](/earnings) during a [economic boom](/boom). Thus, this inflates their prices and the market's overall value. The result is a low current price-to-earnings ratio that does not accurately reflect the market's value.

Likewise, earnings tend to fall in the midst of a slowdown in the economy. This causes an extremely high current price-to-earnings ratio, which additionally does not accurately reflect market dynamics.

The CAPE ratio adapts to business cycles and uses [consumer price index](/consumerpriceindex) values to adapt to inflationary pressure on earnings. On the off chance that the CAPE ratio trends high, the market often is in a boom period. Conversely, a CAPE ratio that falls for a considerable time frame tends to indicate a graveyard market. Lastly, a CAPE ratio that diverts higher from an extreme low can help to gauge the end of a graveyard market.
