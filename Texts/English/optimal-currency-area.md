# Optimal Currency Area (OCA)
## What Is an Optimal Currency Area (OCA)?

An optimal currency area (OCA) is the geographic area wherein a single [currency](/currency) would make the greatest economic benefit. While generally every country has kept up with its own separate [national currency](/national-currency), work by Robert Mundell during the 1960s speculated that this probably won't be the most efficient economic arrangement.

Specifically, countries that share strong economic ties might benefit from a [common currency](/currency-union). This considers nearer integration of [capital markets](/capitalmarkets) and works with trade. Nonetheless, a common currency brings about a loss of every country's ability to direct fiscal and monetary policy intercessions to balance out their individual economies.

## Figuring out Optimal Currency Areas (OCAs)

In 1961, Canadian economist Robert Mundell distributed his theory of the OCA with fixed expectations. He framed the criteria essential for a region to qualify as an OCA and benefit from a common currency.

In this model, the primary concern is that asymmetric shocks might subvert the benefit of the OCA. In the event that large asymmetric shocks are common and the criteria for an OCA are not met, then, at that point, a system of separate currencies with [floating exchange rates](/floatingexchangerate) would be more suitable to deal with the negative effects of such shocks inside the single country encountering them.

### Optimal Currency Area (OCA) Criteria

As indicated by Mundell, there are four fundamental criteria for an OCA:

- **High labor mobility all through the area**. Easing labor mobility incorporates bringing down administrative barriers, for example, without visa travel, social barriers like various dialects, and institutional barriers, for example, limitations on remittance of [pensions](/pensionplan) or government benefits.
- **Capital mobility and price and wage flexibility**. This guarantees that capital and labor will flow between countries in the OCA as per the market powers of [supply and demand](/law-of-supply-demand) to convey the impact of economic shocks.
- **A currency risk-sharing or fiscal mechanism to share risk across countries in the OCA**. This requires the transfer of money to regions encountering economic hardships from countries with [surpluses](/excess), which might demonstrate politically disliked in higher-performing regions from which tax revenue will be transferred. The [European sovereign debt crisis](/european-sovereign-debt-crisis) of 2009-2015 is viewed as evidence of the disappointment of the European Economic and Monetary Union (EMU) to fulfill these criteria as original EMU policy founded a no-bailout clause, which before long became clear as impractical.
- **Comparable business cycles**. Cyclical promising and less promising times that are simultaneous, or possibly highly related, across countries in the OCA are fundamental since the OCA's [central bank](/centralbank) will by definition be executing a uniform monetary policy across the OCA to offset economic recessions and contain [inflation](/inflation). Asynchronous cycles would undeniably mean that a uniform monetary policy will turn out to be counter-cyclical for certain countries and supportive of cyclical in others.

Different criteria have been suggested by later economic research:

- A high volume of trade between countries suggests that there will be correspondingly high gains from the adoption of a common currency in an OCA. Nonetheless, a high volume of trade can likewise recommend large [comparative advantages](/comparativeadvantage) and [home market effects](/home-market-impact) between countries, both of which can lead to vigorously specific industries between countries.
- More diversified production inside economies and limited specialization and division of labor across countries reduce the probability of asymmetric economic shocks. Countries that are vigorously accomplished in certain goods that different countries don't deliver will be powerless against asymmetric economic shocks in those industries, and probably won't be suitable for participation in the OCA. Note that this criteria can clash with a portion of the above criteria in light of the fact that the greater the degree of integration among countries' economies (mobility of goods, labor, and capital) the more they will more often than not work in various industries.
- Homogeneous policy inclinations across countries in the OCA are important in light of the fact that [monetary policy](/monetarypolicy), and somewhat fiscal policy as transfers, will be a collective decision and responsibility of the countries in the OCA. Major differences in local inclinations for how to answer either symmetric or asymmetric shocks can subvert cooperation and political will to join or stay in the OCA.

## Europe, Debt Crises, and the OCA

The OCA theory had its primary test with the presentation of the [euro](/euro) as a common currency across European nations. [Eurozone](/eurozone) countries matched a portion of Mundell's criteria for fruitful monetary union, giving the stimulus to the presentation of a common currency. While the eurozone has seen many benefits from the presentation of the euro, it has likewise experienced issues like the Greek debt crisis. In this way, the long-term outcome of a monetary union under the theory of OCAs stays a subject of discussion.

The European sovereign debt crisis in the wake of the [Great Recession](/great-recession) is refered to as evidence that the [EMU](/emu) didn't fit the criteria for a fruitful OCA. Pundits contend that the EMU didn't sufficiently accommodate the greater economic and fiscal integration essential for cross-border risk-sharing.

Technically, the European Stability and Growth Pact incorporated a "no-bailout" clause that explicitly restricted fiscal transfers. In any case, in practice, this was abandoned right off the bat in the sovereign debt crisis. As Greece's sovereign debt crisis kept on declining, there was discussion recommending that the EMU must account for risk-sharing policies undeniably greater than the adopted provisional [bailout](/bailout) system.

Overall, this episode suggests that due to the imbalance of the economic shock to Greece relative to different countries in the EMU and apparent shortfalls in the EMU's qualification as an OCA under Mundell's criteria, Greece (and maybe different countries) might not really fall inside the OCA for the euro.

## Highlights
- The euro is an illustration of an application of an OCA, however occasions, for example, the Greek debt crisis have put this to the test.
- Economist Robert Mundell originally framed criteria for an OCA, which depend on the degree of integration and likeness between economies.
- An optimal currency area (OCA) is the geopolitical area over which a single, unified currency will give the best balance of economies of scale to a currency and viability of macroeconomic policy to advance growth and stability.
