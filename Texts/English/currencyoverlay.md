## What Is a Currency Overlay?

Currency overlay alludes to an investor [outsourcing](/outsourcing) currency risk management to a [specialist firm](/specialistfirm), known as the overlay manager. This is utilized in international investment portfolios, typically by institutional investors, to separate the management of [currency risk](/currencyrisk) from the asset allocation and security selection choices of the investor's money managers. Currency overlay tries to reduce the currency-explicit risks that accompany investing in international equities.

## Understanding a Currency Overlay

A currency overlay is intended to moderate the financial impact on an investment portfolio from [exchange rate](/exchangerate) changes or [volatility](/volatility) while investing in international assets that are designated in a foreign currency. The global currency market is the largest market in the world with $5 trillion trading between different currencies daily. Corporations, banks, central banks, investment firms, brokers, and [institutional investors](/institutionalinvestor) all play a job in the global currency market when they buy and sell assets in a foreign currency, which is a currency other than their nearby currency. Global trade, international loans, and investments are just a couple of the transactions that can include trading one currency for one more at the predominant exchange rate.

Numerous investment firms offer currency overlay services that are intended to reduce or take out exchange rate conversion losses while investing internationally. The currency [hedging](/hedge) being finished by the overlay manager is being "overlaid" on the portfolios made by other money managers.

## Why a Currency Overlay Is Needed

Currency risk management is an essential interaction for most portfolios with direct international holdings. In the event that an investor in the U.S. holds Japanese stocks, and the exchange rate between the [Japanese yen](/jpy-japanese-yen) and the U.S. dollar doesn't shift in relative value, then the profit or loss of the Japanese holdings is unaffected by currency vacillations. This, nonetheless, would be rare, as currencies vacillate in comparison to one another constantly.

### Exchange Risk

Regularly, numerous foreign investments include an exchange of the home currency for the foreign currency of the country where the funds are being transferred to, bringing about a currency conversion. At the point when the funds are brought back to the nation of origin and changed over once more into the nearby currency, another exchange happens at the predominant rate around then. The difference between the two exchange rates can bring about a gain or a loss. Subsequently, investments can increase or diminish in value exclusively based on the exchange rate conversions-all else being equivalent.

For instance, if a U.S. investor wires $100,000 to Europe to be invested and it changes over at an exchange rate of $1.10 for each [euro](/euro), it would rise to 110,000 euros. Suppose the investor earned a 5% return on the investment and wired the money back to the U.S. Be that as it may, the exchange rate tumbled to $1.05, which is a 4.76% decline in the rate (from $1.10) and wipes the majority of the gain on the investment. While considering the billions of dollars that are invested in foreign assets and securities over an extended period, those investments are at risk of critical losses just due to variances in exchange rates.

### Event Risk

Exchange rate moves can be brought about by many factors, including [economic conditions](/economic-conditions, for example, whether an economy is developing or contracting. Countries that are encountering more slow growth or a financial crisis can bring about investment capital or money escaping the country looking for additional stable economies. Subsequently, the releases of [economic indicators](/economic_indicator, for example, [consumer spending](/consumer-spending), unemployment, [gross domestic product (GDP)](/gdp), which is a country's growth rate all affect exchange rates. Additionally, political turns of events and natural calamities can drive an exchange rate.

### Central Banks

The people who perform currency overlay hedges pay close consideration regarding central banks around the world, like the [Federal Reserve](/federalreservesystem) Bank. The Fed sets monetary policy for the U.S. by expanding or bringing down interest rates. A country with higher rates will in general draw in greater investment capital-all else being equivalent. Countries, where their central bank is bringing down rates, is an indicator of financial or economic difficulties, which can lead to a flight of capital to different countries.

These events impact exchange rates and investments in those countries. Currency overlay hedges utilize financial products to assist with relieving the impact that those events could have on an investment portfolio.

To tame these limits, global investors must hedge their portfolios against currency risk â€” that or be judicious about impending currency swings and reposition the global holdings appropriately. In practice, hedging is generally finished through contracts or complementary [forex trading](/forex). With large holdings crossing the world, hedging the portfolio can be all around as tedious as investing it. Enter the currency overlay offered by specialist firms. Institutional investors can zero in on investing, and the currency overlay manager will deal with the currency.

## Passive versus Active Currency Overlay

A currency overlay can be passive or active. The passive currency overlay is a hedge over the foreign holdings, which is positioned to shift the currency exposure back into the domestic currency of the fund. This cycle locks in an exchange rate for the period of the contract and another contract is put in force as a more seasoned one terminates. The product normally utilized is called a [forward contract](/forwardcontract) and a forward smooths out currency risk without trying to capture any benefit from it. A forward simply locks in an exchange today for delivery of the currency by means of wire transfer at a foreordained date from now on.

For instance, investors who send money to Europe to buy securities and convert those funds into euros can lock in the exchange rate for changing over those euros back to dollars at a date from here on out. Numerous passive overlay strategies are automated and hedge the exposure so there is no speculation on the currency exchange rate move.

On the other hand, active currency overlay hedging looks to limit the downside currency exposure while likewise expanding the returns from a great currency swing. Assuming returning to the model, the euro reinforces against the dollar; an active currency overlay will try to capture the excess return from that movement as opposed to just shifting it back to the base currency. To accomplish these excess returns, a portion of the total portfolio is left unhedged, with the overlay manager pursuing choices on currency situating to set out open doors for profit.
