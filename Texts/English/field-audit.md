## What Is an IRS Field Audit?

A field audit is a far reaching tax audit conducted by the [Internal Revenue Service](/irs) (IRS) at either the taxpayer's home, place of business or bookkeeper's office, so they can inspect your individual or business financial records to guarantee you documented your tax return precisely.

## Understanding IRS Field Audits

The IRS regularly performs audits to confirm the precision of a taxpayer's return and specific transactions. At the point when the IRS audits a person or company, it for the most part conveys a negative undertone and is viewed as evidence of a bad behavior by the taxpayer of some sort. In any case, being chosen for an audit isn't really indicative of any bad behavior.

IRS audit selection is typically made by random statistical recipes that break down a taxpayer's return and compare it to comparative returns. A taxpayer may likewise be chosen for an audit in the event that they have any dealings with someone else or company who was found to have tax errors on their audit.

There are three potential IRS audit results accessible: no change to the tax return, a change that is accepted by the taxpayer, or a change that the taxpayer can't help contradicting. Assuming the change is accepted, the taxpayer might owe extra taxes or punishments. Assuming the taxpayer dissents, there is a cycle to follow that might incorporate intervention or an appeal.

## Field Audit versus Correspondence Audit

A field audit varies from a [correspondence audit](/correspondence-audit) in that a field audit is conducted in person as opposed to via mail, by an IRS Revenue Agent who will survey your tax records for a specific year. The length of the audit changes relying upon the type of audit, the complexity of the issues, and the availability of the data requested.

Field audits are commonly scheduled for additional confounded audits and can be very meddling. When auditing businesses, the revenue agent will likewise talk with employees about the key operations of the business, including processes, accounting procedures, management structure and internal controls.

It is truly important to be addressed by a tax lawyer — or potentially the individual who prepared and recorded the tax return — at the hour of the audit, particularly in the event that there have been any misrepresentations of income, exaggerations of deductions or on the other hand in the event that your tax return contained false or deluding data. Most lawyers will encourage you to keep replies as simple as could be expected and never offer extra data, as that could permit the agent to extend the scope of the audit. The punishments following a field audit that turns up errors or fraud incorporate payment of extra taxes, fines, liens on property, wage garnishment, criminal investigations and court hearings.

The IRS has a long time from the due date of the return to audit a taxpayer. There are exemptions. For instance, in the event that the taxpayer precluded over 25% of the legitimate income from their return, the IRS has six years to conduct an audit.

The IRS may likewise request broadening the audit period, which gives the service extra chance to gather data, and furthermore the taxpayer extra opportunity to appeal a determination.
