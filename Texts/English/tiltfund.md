## What Is a Tilt Fund?

A tilt fund is a type of mutual fund or exchange-traded fund that includes a core holding of stocks that impersonate a [benchmark](/benchmark) type index, to which extra securities are added to help tilt the fund toward outperforming the market.

## Understanding Tilt Funds

Tilt funds are additionally sometimes called [enhanced index funds](/enhanced_index_fund) since they are essentially index funds with more options. These funds are typically used by major investors in an effort to improve overall investment returns. Tilt funds can be benchmarked against any index in the world, however American fund managers typically use the [Standard and Poor's 500 Index (S&P 500)](/sp) or another broad-based index as the benchmark against which the performance of a tilt fund is measured, empowering them to keep pace with the general direction of the overall market.

Fund managers use tilt funds to get accelerated returns from their investments while keeping a certain level of safety by staying with large, mainstream stocks and not diverging too distant from an index. Therefore, while tilt funds have the potential to outperform the broader market, the risk they take on to achieve superior returns is considered to be relatively low. Because of their strategy of less-risky investment, tilt funds have historically been popular with pension funds. The right mix, or tilt, of stocks, provides both safety and performance by joining elements of [active](/active_index_fund) and [passive index fund](/passiveinvesting) styles.

A typical index fund may, for example, invest exclusively in companies found on the S&P 500 stock exchange. A fund that utilizes a tilting strategy could have by far most of capital invested in those 500 companies, yet it could likewise allow the manager the flexibility to include other stocks too. Then again, value tilts in a fund may likewise lean towards one type of stock over another, for example, leaning towards small-cap stocks that historically have provided higher-than-average returns.

However, the difference with this ETF is that it flips the script on valuations: it overweights stocks with relatively low valuations and underweight stocks with higher valuations. The index likewise specifically searches for funds based on the P/E ratio, price to cash flow ratio, among other factors, for example, dividends paid. Another popular tilted fund is FlexShares' Morningstar US Market (TILT).

## Weighted Tilting Investments

Another way that a tilt fund can pursue increasing returns and outperforming an index fund is by weighting its investments, thereby giving more weight to certain stocks inside the index that are projected to outperform the others. Certain tilt funds may likewise invest more heavily in stocks with high dividend payments, which generates capital notwithstanding that which is earned from rising stock prices. This type of weighted tilt fund is known as a [yield tilt index fund](/yield_tilt_index_fund).
