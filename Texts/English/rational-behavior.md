# Rational Behavior
## What Is Rational Behavior?

Rational behavior alludes to a dynamic cycle that depends on settling on decisions that outcome in the optimal level of benefit or [utility](/utility) for an individual. The assumption of rational behavior suggests that individuals would prefer to make moves that benefit them versus activities that are neutral or mischief them. Most classical economic hypotheses depend on the assumption that all individuals participating in an activity are acting rationally.

## Figuring out Rational Behavior

Rational behavior is the foundation of rational decision theory, a theory of economics that expects that individuals generally pursue choices that give them the highest amount of personal utility. These choices furnish individuals with the best benefit or satisfaction given the decisions that anyone could hope to find. Rational behavior may not include getting the most monetary or material benefit, in light of the fact that the satisfaction received could be absolutely emotional or non-monetary.

For instance, while it is logical all the more financially beneficial for an executive to remain on at a company as opposed to retire early, it is as yet thought to be rational behavior for her to look for an exit from the workforce on the off chance that she feels the benefits of retired life offset the utility from the paycheck she gets. The optimal benefit for an individual might include non-monetary returns.

Further, a person's eagerness to face risk, challenges on the other hand, their [aversion to risk](/riskaverse), might be viewed as rational relying upon their objectives and conditions. For instance, an investor might decide to face more risk challenges his own retirement account than in an account designated for his youngsters' college education. Both would be viewed as rational decisions for this investor.

## Behavioral Economics

Behavioral economics is a method of economic analysis that considers mental experiences to make sense of human behavior as it connects with economic independent direction. As indicated by rational decision theory, the rational person has discretion and is unaffected by emotional factors. Nonetheless, behavioral economics recognizes that individuals are emotional and quickly flustered, and subsequently, their behavior doesn't necessarily follow the expectations of economic models. Mental factors and feelings influence the activities of individuals and can lead them to settle on choices that may not have all the earmarks of being altogether rational.

Behavioral economics looks to make sense of why individuals come to certain conclusions about the amount to pay for a cup of coffee, the decision about whether to seek after a college education or a solid lifestyle, and the amount to put something aside for retirement, among different choices that a great many people need to make eventually in their life.

Investors may likewise pursue choices essentially founded on feelings, for instance, investing in a company for which the investor has positive sentiments, even on the off chance that financial models recommend the investment isn't savvy.

## Illustration of Rational Behavior

For instance, an individual might decide to invest in the stock of an organic produce operation, as opposed to a conventional produce operation, in the event that they have strong convictions in the value of organic produce. They might decide to do this no matter what the [present value](/presentvalue) of the organic operation compared with that of the conventional operation, and in spite of the way that the conventional operation would earn a higher return.
