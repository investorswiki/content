# Long Run
## What Is the Long Run?

The long run is a period of time wherein all factors of production and costs are variable. Over the long haul, firms are able to change all costs, while in the [short run](/shortrun) firms are simply able to influence prices through changes made to production levels. Furthermore, while a firm might be a [monopoly](/monopoly) in the short term, they might anticipate competition over the long haul.

## How the Long Run Works

A long run is a time span during which a manufacturer or producer is flexible in its production choices. Businesses can either extend or reduce production [capacity](/capacity) or enter or exit an industry in view of expected profits. Firms looking at a long run comprehend that they can't change levels of production to come to a [equilibrium](/equilibrium) among supply and demand.

In [macroeconomics](/macroeconomics), the long run is the period when the general price level, contractual wage rates, and expectations change completely to the state of the economy. This stands as opposed to the short run, when these variables may not completely change. Additionally, long run models might shift away from short-run equilibrium, in which supply and demand respond to price levels with greater flexibility.

In response to expected economic profits, firms can change production levels. For instance, a firm might execute change by expanding (or decreasing) the scale of production in response to profits (or losses), which might involve building another plant or adding a [production line](/product offering). The short-run, then again, is the time horizon over which [factors of production](/factors-production) are fixed, aside from labor, which stays variable.

### Model

For instance, a business with a one-year lease will have its long run defined as any period longer than a year since it's not limited by the lease agreement after that year. Over the long haul, the amount of labor, size of the factory, and production processes can be altered if necessary to suit the necessities of the business or lease issuer.

## Long Run and the Long-Run Average Cost (LRAC)

For a really long time, a firm will look for the production technology that permits it to deliver the ideal level of output at the most reduced cost. In the event that a company isn't creating at its most reduced cost conceivable, it might lose [market share](/marketshare) to contenders that are able to deliver and sell at least cost.

The long run is associated with the [long-run average (total) cost](/lratc) (LRAC or LRATC), the average cost of output doable when all factors of production are variable. The LRAC curve is the curve along which a firm would limit its cost per unit for each individual long run quantity of output.

The LRAC curve is comprised of a group of short-run average cost (SRAC) curves, every one of which addresses one specific level of [fixed costs](/fixedcost). The LRAC curve will, thusly, be the least costly average cost curve for any level of output. However long the LRAC curve is declining, then internal economies of scale are being taken advantage of.

### Economies of Scale

[Economies of scale](/economiesofscale) allude to the situation wherein, as the quantity of output goes up, the cost per unit goes down. In effect, economies of scale are the cost advantages that are accomplished when there is an expansion of the size of production. The cost advantages mean improved [efficiency](/effectiveness) in production, which can give a business a competitive advantage in its industry of operations, which, thus, could mean lower costs and higher profits for the business.

In the event that LRAC is falling when output is expanding, the firm is encountering economies of scale. At the point when LRAC in the end begins to rise then the firm encounters [diseconomies of scale](/diseconomiesofscale), and on the off chance that LRAC is consistent, the firm is encountering steady returns to scale.

## Features
- At the point when the LRAC curve is declining, internal economies of scale are being taken advantage of â€” and vice versa.
- The long run alludes to a period of time where all factors of production and costs are variable.
- Long term, a firm will look for the production technology that permits it to deliver the ideal level of output at the least cost.
- The long run is associated with the LRAC curve along which a firm would limit its cost per unit for each separate long run quantity of output.
