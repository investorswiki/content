# Parcel (Securities Trading)
## What Is a Lot (Securities Trading)?

A ton in the financial markets is the number of units of a financial instrument bought on an exchange. The number of not entirely set in stone by the part size. For instance, in the stock market, a [round lot](/roundlot) is 100 shares. Nonetheless, investors don't need to buy round parcels, where a ton can be quite a few shares.

## How a Lot (Securities Trading) Works

At the point when investors and traders purchase and sell financial instruments in the [capital markets](/capitalmarkets), they do as such with parts. A ton is a fixed quantity of units and relies upon the financial security traded.

For stocks, the average part size was round bunches of 100 shares for a long time, until the coming of online trading. A round parcel can likewise allude to a number of shares that can evenly be partitioned by 100, for example, 300, 1,200, and 15,500 shares.

Be that as it may, presently [odd lots](/oddlot), which is an order for under 100 shares, and [mixed lots](/mixedlot) — a number of shares over 100 yet not distinct by 100 — are more normal. Like stocks, the round parcel for exchange-traded securities, for example, a [exchange-traded fund](/etf) (ETF), is 100 shares.

## Types of Lots (Securities Trading)
### Bonds

The [bond market](/bondmarket) is overwhelmed by institutional investors who buy debt from bond issuers in large totals. A round parcel for U.S. government and corporate bonds in certain circles is considered $1 million. Notwithstanding, it can likewise be $100,000, for example, the case with [municipal bonds](/municipalbond).

That doesn't mean a trader or investor needs to buy bonds in that quantity. Bonds typically have a [face value](/facevalue) of $1,000 to $10,000 (some are even lower). An investor can buy however many bonds as they like, yet it actually might be an odd parcel.

### Options

In terms of [options](/option), a ton addresses the number of contracts contained in one derivative security. One equity option contract addresses 100 [underlying shares](/underlying-asset) of an organization's stock. At the end of the day, the parcel for one [options contract](/optionscontract) is 100 shares.

For instance, an options trader purchased one Bank of America (BAC) [call option](/calloption) last month. The option has a [strike price](/strikeprice) of $24.50 and terminates this month. If the options-holder [exercises](/work out) their call option today when the underlying stock, BAC, is trading at $26.15, they can purchase 100 shares of BAC at the strike price of $24.50. One option contract gives them the right to purchase the part of 100 shares at the agreed strike price.

With such [standardization](/standardization), investors generally know precisely the number of units they that are buying with each contract and can undoubtedly evaluate what price per unit they are paying. Without such standardization, esteeming and trading options would be unnecessarily lumbering and tedious.

Typically, the littlest options trade an investor can make is for one contract, and that addresses 100 shares. Nonetheless, it is feasible to trade options for a more modest amount with mini-stock options which have an underlying share amount of 10.

### Futures

With regards to the [futures market](/futuresmarket), parcels are known as [contract sizes](/contractsize). The underlying asset of one futures contract could be an equity, a bond, interest rates, commodity, [index](/marketindex), currency, and so on. In this way, the contract size changes relying upon the type of contract that is traded.

For instance, one futures contract for corn, soybeans, wheat, or oats has a ton size of 5,000 bushels of the commodity. The parcel unit for one Canadian dollar futures contract is 100,000 CAD, one British pound contract is 62,500 GBP, one Japanese yen contract is 12,500,000 JPY, and one euro futures contract is 125,000 EUR.

In contrast to stocks, bonds, and ETFs in which odd parts can be purchased, the standard contract sizes for options and futures are fixed and non-negotiable. Notwithstanding, [derivatives](/derivative) traders purchasing and selling [forward contracts](/forwardcontract) can modify the contract or parcel size of these contracts, since forwards are non-standardized contracts that are made by the gatherings in question.

Standardized parts are set by the exchange and allow for greater liquidity in the financial markets. With increased liquidity comes diminished [spreads](/spread), making an efficient cycle for all participants included.

### Forex Lots

While trading currencies, there are micro, mini, and [standard lots](/standard-parcel). A micro parcel is 1,000 of the [base currency](/basecurrency), a mini part is 10,000, and a standard parcel is 100,000. While it is feasible to exchange currencies at a bank or currency exchange in amounts under 1,000, while trading through a foreign exchange broker typically the littlest trade size is 1,000 except if communicated stated in any case.

## Part Examples

In the options and futures markets, trading in parts isn't as a very remarkable concern since you can trade quite a few contracts wanted. Each [stock option](/stockoption) will address 100 shares, and every futures contract controls the contract size of the underlying asset.

In forex, a person can trade a minimum of 1,000 of the base currency, in any addition of 1,000. For instance, they could trade 1,451,000. That is 14 standard parts, five mini parcels, and one micro parcel. In a stock trade, a person can trade in odd heaps of under 100 shares.
