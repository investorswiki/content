# Three Stars in the South
## What Is Three Stars in the South?

The three stars in the south is a very rare three-candle bullish [reversal](/reversal) pattern that shows up on candlestick charts. It might show up after a decline, and it signals that the bearishness is blurring.

## Grasping Three Stars in the South

The three stars in the south is a bullish reversal pattern with four qualities:

1. The market is in a downtrend.
1. The primary candle is black with a long [real body](/realbody), long lower [shadow](/shadow), and no upper shadow.
1. The subsequent candle is black with a shorter real body and a higher low than the main candle's low.
1. The third candle is black with a short real body, no shadows, and a close that is inside the high-low scope of the subsequent candle.

These severe requirements make the pattern rare. The theory behind the pattern is that bears are continuously losing momentum as every one of the three candles advances, which eventually drives the bulls to endeavor a rally to reverse the trend.

Most traders search for [confirmation](/confirmation) after the pattern. The confirmation, in this case, would be the price moving higher following the pattern, since that is what the pattern should show. In the event that the price drops following the pattern, it's anything but a bullish reversal, yet rather a bearish [continuation pattern](/continuationpattern).

In practice, finding this pattern on charts is troublesome. The reversals can likewise be somewhat muffled, which means little upside for traders betting on a rally. The three stars in the south, as well as other candlestick patterns, don't have a profit objective. Accordingly, even assuming that they work, and the price rises following the pattern, in this case, there is no indication of how far it will rise.

Traders could utilize the pattern as a [signal](/trade-signal) to exit a [short](/short) position or to start a long position, albeit preferably entering on the confirmation bar — as the price begins to rise — is preferred. Furthermore, traders ought to search for confirmations in other chart patterns or technical indicators to support a reversal thesis.

In the event that, for instance, a stock is trending higher yet has as of late encountered a pullback, a trader could look for a three stars in the south pattern combined with a bullish [stochastic](/stochasticoscillator) crossover in oversold domain. At the point when combined, these bits of evidence make a seriously convincing trade thought, particularly in the event that the three stars in the south is followed by any bullish confirmation candles.

The difference between three stars in the south and [three black crows](/three_black_crows) is that the last option is a bearish reversal pattern coming after a price advance. The pattern is formed by three long black (down) candles, with the second and third candles opening inside the real body of the prior candle and closing lower than they opened and below the prior close.

## Three Stars in the South Trading Psychology

Assume a security is taken part in an active downtrend, with certain bears searching at lower costs. The first candle in quite a while affirms this view with a sizable price drop. The bulls can draw slight positive thinking from this candle, which is that it closed over the low of the day.

On the subsequent candle, the security opens higher than the low of the main candle and fails to post a new low. The close lower than the open additionally diminishes bull confidence.

The security opens higher on the third candle in a demonstration of recharged bull commitment, however they fail to capitalize the price drops once more. Yet again bears fail to drop the security to a new low, demonstrating a reduction in selling power. The three bars form a small [pennant](/pennant) pattern, demonstrating bearish fatigue while offering bulls a chance to begin a rally. The rally can start in the event that the price moves higher following the pattern.
