## What Is an Inverse Saucer?

An inverse saucer is a technical charting pattern that demonstrates that a given stock's price has arrived at its high. As per this technical indicator, this formation demonstrates that a stock's vertical trend has reached a conclusion. An inverse saucer is otherwise called a "adjusted top" or "[rounding top](/roundingtop)".

An inverse saucer happens when there is a consistent smoothing of the uptrend. This happens so much that the market at one moment enters a sideways range, however at that point slowly begins to fall lastly advances descending. An inverse saucer is a rare formation; it gives no reasonable price target except for generally shows that the stock is at risk for a precarious price drop. Retracements of the former uptrend have been noted in inverse saucer patterns.

## How an Inverse Saucer Works

Inverse saucers happen as expectations about a stock continuously shift from [bullish](/bullmarket) to [bearish](/bearmarket). At the end of the day, an inverse saucer happens as investor sentiment about a stock shifts from positive to negative — from the conviction that a stock's value will go higher to the expectation that it will fall lower.

The continuous yet consistent shift forms an adjusted top. Volume — which was high during the previous trend — diminishes as expectations shift and traders become hesitant. The volume then, at that point, increments as another debilitating trend descending is laid out.

An inverse saucer pattern can forecast a more serious breakdown of the price of the security in a short time period. An inverse saucer can likewise be followed briefly by what is known as a handle, which mirrors a partial recovery of price from its decline before the price slips once more.

These two patterns have been more than once noticed, however there is no guarantee, normally, that they **always** happen. Generally talking, however, inverse saucers are bearish indicators, and traders who follow these indicators make a move to safeguard long positions when inverse saucers happen — for instance, by setting stop losses or by shorting these weak securities.

## Saucer versus Inverse Saucer

An inverse saucer is connected with the technical charting pattern called a [saucer](/saucer). Outwardly, a saucer gives off an impression of being the inverse (or the reverse) of an inverse saucer. In like manner, a saucer forms when a security's price has arrived at a low and starts trending vertically. (On the other hand, an inverse saucer forms when a security's price has arrived at a high and is anticipated to trend descending.) A saucer is alluded to as a rounding base.

Volume during inverse saucers frequently reflects the bowl-like state of prices during a saucer.
