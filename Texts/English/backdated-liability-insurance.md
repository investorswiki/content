# Backdated Liability Insurance
## What Is Backdated Liability Insurance

Backdated [liability insurance](/liability_insurance) gives coverage to a [claim](/insurance_claim) that happened before the insurance policy was purchased. Backdated liability insurance isn't an insurance product habitually offered by insurers since the insurer can't be certain how much the loss will amount to.

## Figuring out Backdated Liability Insurance

Companies purchase backdated liability insurance coverage to shield themselves from risks that might emerge from past business activities. It covers potential gaps in coverage that are just discovered after a loss event happens. The company that encounters this loss can either self-insure, implying that it pays for the loss itself, or it can try to purchase a backdated liability insurance policy that will cover the loss.

Backdated liability insurance can be sought after when the claim is very uncertain, in which case possibly long postpones in payment might result. If the [premium](/insurance-premium) charged by the insurer, combined with its investment value, is calculated to the point where it is adequate to cover every one of the claims from the episode, then an insurer will give a backdated liability insurance policy.

Backdated liability insurance is definitely not a commonly accessible type of coverage. Insurance companies regularly don't offer backdated coverage on the grounds that the loss has previously happened. In traditional insurance underwriting, the insurer will conduct [actuarial analysis](/actuarial-science) on a possible policyholder to decide the probability of a claim being made, yet on account of backdated coverage, the insurer is as of now dealing with the loss and on second thought must decide how extreme the loss will eventually be.

Similarly as with most insurance policies, a backdated liability insurance policy will in any case contain a coverage limit. This safeguards the insurer from unlimited losses in the case that a claim turns out to be more costly than estimated. The insurer will in any case look to reduce the claim amount however much as could reasonably be expected, as the less it is forced to pay out the more it keeps in profit. This can be a convoluted endeavor since liability claims, like substantial injury, can be costly.

## Common Backdated Liability Insurance Policies

It tends to be offered as a package policy with different coverages like property, crime, or collision protection.
