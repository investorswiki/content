## What Is a Bracketed Sell Order?

A bracketed sell order is a short sell order that is went with (or "bracketed") by a conditional buy order over the entry price of the sell order and a buy [limit order](/limitorder) below the entry price of the sell order. As the three-part orders depend on set prices, this type of order tries to assist with covering a portion of the provisos of the short sell order while likewise securing in profits.

## Understanding Bracketed Sell Orders

A bracketed sell order is a sort of conditional order. Conditional orders assist investors with starting trades with determined prices. Some [conditional orders](/conditionalorder), like a bracketed order, can have different conditions. Bracketed sell orders are utilized when a trader is hoping to enter a short position with an anticipated profit and loss range.

A run of the mill bracketed sell order will fill in as follows:

1. A trader needs to short stock ABC, which is presently trading around $20 a share, so a trade to enter a short position is set at $20.
1. The profit on this order is capped at $5 with a low-side buy limit order at $15. The buy limit order is for a similar quantity as the sell order, so it finishes off the position once the profit target is reached.
1. On the loss side, a high-side buy stop order is put at $25 so the trade finishes off for a $5 per share loss on the off chance that the price action conflicts with the trader's position.
