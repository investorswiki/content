# Down-and-In Option
## What Is a Down-and-In Option?

A down-and-in option is a type of knock-in barrier option that possibly becomes reasonable when the price of the underlying security tumbles to a specific price level, called the barrier price. In the event that the price doesn't drop to the barrier level, the [option](/option) never becomes active and lapses worthless. In the event that the price arrives at the barrier, the option becomes active and acts like some other option by giving the holder the right however not the obligation to exercise their call or put option at the [strike price](/strikeprice) at the very latest the [expiration date](/expirationdate) determined in the contract.

## How a Down-and-In Option Works

Considered an exotic option, a down-and-in option is one of two types of [knock-in](/knock-inoption) barrier options, the other being an up-and-in option. The two kinds come in the put and call assortments. A [barrier option](/barrieroption) is a type of option where the payoff and the option's very presence rely upon whether the underlying asset arrives at a predetermined price. A barrier option can be a [knock-out](/knock-outoption). A knock-out means it lapses worthless if the underlying arrives at a certain price, limiting profits for the holder and limiting losses for the writer. The barrier option can likewise be a knock-in. As a knock-in, it has no value until the underlying arrives at a certain price.

The critical concept is if the [underlying asset](/underlying-asset) arrives at the barrier whenever during the option's life, the option is knocked in, or brought into active presence, and will remain that way until expiration. It doesn't make any difference assuming it moves back to pre-knock-in levels.

## Illustration of Down-and-In Option

For instance, a down-and-in option has a strike price of 100 and a knock-in price of 80. At the option's inception, the price of the stock was 95, however before the option can become feasible, the price of the stock must dip to 80. On the off chance that it doesn't, then the option automatically terminates worthless even if the underlying hits 100 before the [exercise](/exercise) date.

A down-and-in option can be a [call](/calloption) or [put](/putoption). Both get knocked in assuming the underlying tumbles to the barrier price.

For a [up-and-in option](/up-and-inoption), in the event that the underlying ascents to the barrier price, the option becomes feasible. The two calls and puts won't lapse worthless assuming the underlying ever ascends to its barrier price.

### Using Down-and-In Options

Huge institutions or [market makers](/marketmaker) make these options by direct agreement, for the primary explanation that valuing them is a complex undertaking. For instance, a [portfolio manager](/portfoliomanager) can involve them as a more affordable method to [hedge](/hedge) against losses on a long position. The hedge would be less expensive than buying vanilla put options. In any case, it would be imperfect since the buyer would be unprotected in the event that the security price never arrives at the barrier price.

Pricing relies upon the all standard options metrics with the knock-in feature adding an extra aspect. [European style](/europeanoption) expirations, where the exercise may just occur at the expiration date, are adequately confounded. Notwithstanding, a [American style](/americanoption) option, where the holder might exercise the option out of the blue at the latest expiration, is even more muddled.
