1. That epitomize the distinctive qualities of a type, period, or method of construction, or that address crafted by a master, or that have high imaginative values, or that address a critical and recognizable entity whose parts might lack individual distinction; or
1. That have yielded, or might probably yield, data important in prehistory or history."
