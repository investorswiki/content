# Vault Receipt
## What Is a Vault Receipt?

A vault receipt is a legal document given to the owner of a [futures contract](/futurescontract) whose underlying asset is stored in a vault. They are typically utilized for precious metals, for example, gold and silver, which are sufficiently important to legitimize putting away them in a secured facility.

Vault receipts are an important part of the modern futures markets, since they permit the buyers and dealers of precious metals to try not to make expensive physical conveyances. All things considered, they can transfer ownership just by trading the vault receipt.

## How Vault Receipts Work

Commodities futures markets offer a helpful way for buyers and merchants to access commodities in an efficient way, offering benefits, for example, [liquidity](/liquidity), speed of execution, and diminished [counterparty risk](/counterpartyrisk). Albeit a few buyers wish to take physical delivery of the commodities they buy, others are content to possess the commodities while keeping them stored in a vault or warehouse that is authorized by the commodities exchange.

This approach to claiming commodities can demonstrate more financially savvy, since it permits buyers to keep away from extra transportation and insurance costs. This is particularly common on account of precious metals, where new owners either have the option of keeping the metals stored at their current facility, or, in all likelihood transferring them to a facility of their decision. Assuming they keep utilizing the current facility, they should keep paying the [storage fees](/transportation-and-storage-costs) and different costs. Nonetheless, transferring to another facility is typically more costly on the grounds that it includes extra transportation.

More often than not, precious metals are kept in their original exchange-approved warehouse. Beside the additional expense of relocation, one more important justification for this is that metals which are eliminated from the approved warehouse may as of now not be eligible to be traded on the futures exchange. To then, at that point, once again introduce their bars into the exchange's warehouse and use them for futures trading purposes, they might have to send the bars back to a purifier to guarantee that the bars fulfill the exchange's quality guidelines. When the metal is back in the warehouse, the exchange would then issue another vault receipt. As you can envision, notwithstanding, these additional means can substantially increase the costs of the precious metals investment.

## Real World Example of a Vault Receipt

A standard vault receipt will incorporate important subtleties, for example, the location of the metals, their reference numbers, the name of their owner, any continuous storage fees associated with the metals, and the date of the receipt. By holding this vault receipt, the designated owner is qualified for pull out or move the metals to another facility, in spite of the fact that doing so may keep them from selling those metals on the exchange.

Frequently, the vault receipt will as a matter of fact be held by the broker who was responsible for purchasing the futures contract in the interest of the end buyer. The actual buyer would regularly not receive a physical copy of the receipt except if they explicitly request one from their broker. This system is like the manner by which stock brokers frequently hold shares for the benefit of their clients in street name.
