## What Is Tunneling?

Tunneling is an illegal business practice in which a [majority shareholder](/majorityshareholder) or significant level company insider guides company assets or future business to themselves for personal gain. Actions, for example, unnecessary executive compensation, dilutive share measures, [asset sales](/asset-sales), and personal loan guarantees can be in every way considered tunneling. The common threat is the loss to the minority shareholders, whose ownership is decreased or generally devalued through unseemly actions that hurt the overall value of the business and accordingly the value of the shares owned by the minority shareholders.

## How Tunneling Works

This risk is especially common for investors in emerging markets, where government and regulatory controls may not be adequate to stop the practice from happening. This may frequently occur under legal pretenses. The practice isn't saved for modestly advanced economies; many examples can be found in [advanced economies](/advanced-economies), especially those under systems of "civil law."

The U.S. legal system is established in "common law," which gives broad enforceable laws simple adages like "decency" and "for a long term benefit." Under civil law, the letter of the law is the most regarded measure, so would-be tunnelers can pass an act of tunneling off under certain details, which frequently hold up in court.

## Special Consideraitons

Tunneling initially came to rise in Central Europe following the post-privatization time. During this time, funds were moved from corporations to exclusive companies with a similar management. These transfers were done through large loans made without the expectation for repayment.

Tunneling can incorporate various activities, for example, asset sales at lower valuations or dilutive share measures. Different activities can incorporate personal loan guarantees and inordinate compensation.

## Tunneling versus Theft

Tunneling is unique in relation to outright theft, where there are different legal procedures. Theft generally connects with the outright taking of goods or services. Tunneling is unscrupulous, yet it's a gray area with regards to legality, as the punishments will fluctuate. A few states charge criminal sanctions for tunneling, while others impose civil suits or no sanctions by any stretch of the imagination.

## Instance of Tunneling

For instance, XYZ company has a majority shareholder and executive named Bert. Bert is planning to leave the company in two or three years in light of the fact that the company isn't working out quite as well as he'd suspected it would. Meanwhile, Bert needs to accept in however much money as could be expected.

He utilizes his strategic place of power to vote for critical executive compensation bundles and pays himself improperly large bonuses, emptying financial resources out of the company. This damages the company since it negatively influences its valuation due to the huge loss of cash.
