# Bidding Up Securities
## What Does Bidding Up Securities Mean?

Bidding up is the act of expanding the price an investor will pay for a [security](/security). Bidding up is generally usually associated with investors who use [limit orders](/limitorder) and is probably going to be involved when the price of a security in the market is expanding.

## Grasping Bidding Up Securities

Bidding up holds investors back from being [priced out](/priced-out) of trades. At the point when an investor puts in a buy limit request at a predetermined price, that investor is saying they are not ready to pay anything else than the price limit for a share.

This strategy works in somewhat quiet markets. In the event that the price of a stock is quickly expanding, sellers are less inclined to sell shares at the limit price in the event that they can bring more from different buyers. By expanding the [bidding price](/bidprice), a buyer diminishes the chances that the order will go unexecuted.

While the buyer might go through a bidding strategy to further develop order execution, they may unintentionally be adding to expanding the share price. While it is improbable that a single investor expanding limit order prices will put huge vertical pressure on price, on the off chance that enough investors follow a comparable strategy, they might make a difference.

## Instance of Bidding Up Securities

Investors bid up when they are sure and anticipate that a stock should keep on rising. Prior to the introduction of President Donald Trump in January 2017, investors bid up the stock market in the expectation of good economic, tax and trade policies.

Bidding up can make a negative difference, for instance with the [dotcom bubble](/dotcom-bubble) in mid 2000 and the [housing bubble](/housing_bubble) during the 2000s. Energized by feeling and market momentum, buyers overinvested and bid up prices of technology and real estate stocks. When prices were too high to ever be sustainable, investors definitely terrified and hurried to sell, causing a market crash.

## Highlights
- Bidding up is the act of expanding the price an investor will pay for a security.
- The phenomenon of bidding up securities frequently happens when investors use limit orders in a rising market.
- Since sellers are reluctant to acknowledge limit price and hold out at a better cost, buyers who use limit orders coincidentally put vertical pressure on the price.
