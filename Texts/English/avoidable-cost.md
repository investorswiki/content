Thusly, Boeing (BA) didn't require plane engines, which influenced GE. In 2019, 33% of GE's revenues came from aviation, 20% from healthcare, 18.6% from power, and 15% from renewable energy.

As GE was battling it chose to sell its 130-year-old consumer lighting business to Savant Systems. It recently sold its commercial lighting business in 2018. This permitted GE to zero in on its most profitable divisions while shedding failing to meet expectations ones to free up capital by cutting costs and paying off past commitments. While choosing to sell this business, GE turned every one of the costs associated with the division to avoidable costs.
