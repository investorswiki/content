# Securitize
## What Is Securitize?

The term "securitize" alludes to the most common way of pooling financial assets together to make new [securities](/security) that can be marketed and sold to investors. These pooled financial assets generally comprise of various types of loans, yet any type of asset can be securitized.

Mortgages, credit card debt, vehicle loans, student loans, and different forms of contractual debt are frequently securitized to clear them off the balance sheet of the beginning company and let loose credit for new lenders. The value and cash flows of the new security depend on the underlying value and cash flows of the assets utilized in the securitization cycle. They fluctuate as indicated by how the pool is split up into [tranches](/tranches).

## Grasping Securitize

At the point when a lender securitizes, it makes another security by pooling together existing assets. These new securities are backed by claims against the pooled assets. The originator initially chooses the debt to be pooled like residential mortgages for a [mortgage-backed security](/mbs) (MBS). This pool contains a subset of borrowers. Borrowers with superb [credit ratings](/creditrating) and very little risk of default may be in every way pooled together to sell a high-grade securitized asset, or they can be sprinkled into different pools with borrowers with higher default risk to further develop the overall risk profile of the subsequent securities.

At the point when the selection is complete, these pooled mortgages are sold to an issuer. This might be an outsider that specializes in making securitized assets or it very well may be a [special purpose vehicle](/spv) (SPV) set up by the originator to control its risk exposure to the subsequent asset-backed securities. The issuer or SPV acts basically as a [shell corporation](/shellcorporation). The SPV then, at that point, sells the securities, which are backed by the assets held in the SPV, to investors.

Securitizing is definitely not an inherently positive or negative thing. Basically an interaction assists banks with turning [illiquid](/illiquid) assets into liquid ones and opens up [credit](/credit). All things considered, the integrity of this complex cycle relies upon banks holding moral responsibility for the loans they issue even when they are not legally liable, and on ratings firms to call out originators when they resign this responsibility.

## Advantages and Disadvantages of Securitizing

Securitizing likewise helps banks and different lenders to clear their [balance sheets](/balancesheet). By pooling the assets together and making another security, it turns into a reeling sheet thing. This means there is no effect from these things on the balance sheet.

[Asset-backed securities](/asset-backedsecurity) are alluring for investors. Yet, they're particularly appealing for institutional investors. That is on the grounds that they are highly customizable and can offer a product tailored to address these large investors' issues.
