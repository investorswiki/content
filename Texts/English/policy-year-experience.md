# Policy Year Experience
## What Is Policy Year Experience?

Policy year experience alludes to the combination of all premiums and losses associated with a particular insurance policy, or set of policies, over a predetermined year. It is a widely involved performance metric in the insurance industry.

Critically, the policy year experience just measures the performance of endorsed or recharged policies during the predefined year. Conversely, the [calendar year experience](/calendar-year-experience) measures the performance of all policies held by an insurer, paying little mind to when those policies were initiated.

## Understanding Policy Year Experience

In the insurance industry, there is in many cases a gap between when losses are [incurred](/losses-incurred) by an insurer and when those claims are really paid. For instance, an insurer could receive a claim in November 2019, yet they could pay that claim in May 2020.

Thus, insurers must estimate the performance of their policy-composing activities on a continuous basis, to determine whether the premiums they charge are adequate to cover their expected future losses. Performance estimations —, for example, policy year experience and calendar year experience — are a portion of the tools that insurers use to monitor their own profitability.

In many cases, a customer who purchases insurance might require several months or even a very long time before making a claim on their insurance policy. Meanwhile, they will pay [monthly premiums](/insurance-premium) on their insurance contract, making revenue for the insurer. This means that there is a pivotal timing difference between the date an insurer receives money and the moment they must utilize that money to respect customers' claims.

Along these lines, as well as recording the claims they pay to customers every year, insurers likewise record the losses they hope to cause on a contract from now on — even before those payments are made. This accounting entry, known as the insurer's [loss reserve](/loss-reserve), keeps the insurer from underrating its potential future [liabilities](/absolute liabilities) and consequently misjudging its short-term profitability. The policy year experience measures the premiums paid on those policies against its realized and expected future losses. Given the insurer's loss reserve estimates are accurate, the policy year experience ought to end up being a somewhat accurate check of the profitability of their [underwriting](/underwriting).

In leading this survey, Emma starts by thinking about all of the premiums earned on policies endorsed or recharged during the current year. This part of the analysis is generally direct since the premiums being referred to have previously been paid by the customers. Next, she determines the losses that have previously been all paid on those contracts during the current year.

The last part, nonetheless, is the most complex, since it requires Emma to survey the loss reserves for her portfolio of policies. These loss reserves are basically forecasts of losses that poor person yet happened. On the off chance that those projections are excessively hopeful, they could lead her to overestimate her policy year experience. Similarly, in the event that the projections are too critical, her policy year experience might be downplayed.
