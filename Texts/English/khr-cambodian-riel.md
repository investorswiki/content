# KHR (Cambodian Riel)
## What Is the KHR (Cambodian Riel)?

KHR is the [currency code](/isocurrencycode) for the **riel**, the official currency of Cambodia. Its symbol is \u17db, and its sub-units are the **sen**, 100th 100th of a riel, and the **kak**, one-10th of a riel. The riel flowed in Cambodia during two separate periods, from 1953 to 1975 and from 1980 to the present.

As of December 2020, 1 U.S. dollar is worth around 4,000 KHR.

## Understanding the Cambodian Riel

The Cambodian riel previously happened as an at-standard replacement for the **piastre** de commerce, the currency of French Indochina, after Cambodia acquired independence in 1953. The Khmer Rouge discontinued the riel after holding onto power in 1975, with the 1975 issue of banknotes printed yet never flowed. The socialist Khmer Rouge system nullified money out and out, and the country did without an official currency until 1980.

Cambodia started giving riel again in 1980, soon after the bringing down of Pol Pot's system, setting the value at four riel to $1. From that point forward the relative values of the two currencies have veered. The value of the riel currently holds close to one-24 thousandths of a dollar.

## Different Considerations

However the riel is still being used in Cambodia, it currently rules just in rural areas, where it would be hard to break a $20 bill and explorers won't find anybody who will acknowledge their U.S. money in the event that it's old or torn. Foreign currencies, especially U.S. dollars (USD), are more famous in urban communities and international destinations. Organizations in urban communities are probably going to list prices in USD. Overall, the economy is 90% dollarized. Even Cambodian visas must be paid for in USD. The [Thai baht](/thb-thai-baht) is a common currency in areas close to the border with Thailand, the [Vietnamese dong](/vnd-vietnamese-dong) is common close to the border with Vietnam.

Cambodian [ATMs](/atm) apportion both USD as well as Cambodian riel, yet foreign explorers might have the option to draw from their foreign accounts in USD. Regularly, they secure riel in change from transactions and try not to keep too much money in the Cambodian currency since changing once more into USD or another currency can be awkward.

The Cambodian government puts no restrictions on the import and export of nearby or foreign currency. In any case, in light of the fact that the government fixes the [exchange rate](/exchangerate), just real banks may legally perform exchange services. These financial go-betweens bear sole responsibility for reporting these transactions to the government.

The National Bank of Cambodia is empowered to impose greater control on foreign exchange transfers in the event of a crisis, however it commonly adopts a hands-off strategy.

## Features
- The Cambodian Riel (KHR) is the national currency of Cambodia, and has circled in its current form beginning around 1980.
- The currency float unreservedly against others, however it has lost a large degree of its value against major currencies in the past decades, thus U.S. dollars are commonly accepted in exchange.
- The riel originally supplanted the Indochine piastre after independence was accomplished in 1953, yet Cambodia did without a monetary system during the socialist system of the Khmer Rouge, from 1975-1980.
