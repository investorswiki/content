# Learning Curve
## What Is a Learning Curve?

A learning curve is a concept that graphically portrays the relationship between the cost and output over a defined period of time, regularly to address the dull task of an employee or worker. The learning curve was first depicted by psychologist Hermann Ebbinghaus in 1885 and is utilized as a manner to measure [production efficiency](/production_efficiency) and to [forecast costs](/forecasting).

In the visual representation of a learning curve, a more extreme slant shows initial learning converts into higher cost savings, and subsequent learnings bring about progressively more slow, more troublesome cost savings.

## Grasping Learning Curves

The learning curve likewise is alluded to as the experience curve, the cost curve, the proficiency curve, or the productivity curve. This is on the grounds that the learning curve gives measurement and knowledge into every one of the above parts of a company. The thought behind this is that any employee, paying little heed to position, carves out opportunity to figure out how to carry out a specific task or duty. The amount of time expected to create the associated output is high. Then, at that point, as the task is rehashed, the employee figures out how to [complete it quickly](/productivity), and that decreases the amount of time required for a unit of output.

For that reason the learning curve is descending slanting in the beginning with a flat slant close to the end, with the cost per unit portrayed on the Y-hub and total output on the X-hub. As learning increases, it diminishes the cost per unit of output initially before flattening out, as it becomes more earnestly to increase the efficiencies acquired through learning.

## Benefits of Using the Learning Curve

Organizations know how much an employee procures each hour and can determine the cost of delivering a single unit of output in light of the number of hours required. A very much positioned employee who is set up for progress ought to diminish the company's costs per unit of output after some time. Businesses can utilize the learning curve to conduct production planning, cost forecasting, and [logistics](/logistics) plans.

The slant of the learning curve addresses the rate in which learning converts into cost savings for a company. The more extreme the incline, the higher the cost savings per unit of output. This standard learning curve is known as the 80% learning curve. It shows that for each doubling of a company's output, the cost of the new output is 80% of the prior output. As output increases, it turns out to be increasingly hard to double a company's previous output, portrayed utilizing the slant of the curve, and that means cost savings delayed after some time.

## Highlights
- In business, the slant of the learning curve addresses the rate in which learning new skills converts into cost savings for a company.
- The more extreme the slant of the learning curve, the higher the cost savings per unit of output.
- The learning curve is a visual representation of what amount of time it requires to procure new skills or information.
