## What Is the Icahn Lift?

The Icahn lift is the name given to the rise in the price of a stock that happens when professional investor Carl Icahn starts to purchase shares in the underlying company. The Icahn lift happens due to Mr. Icahn's reputation for making value for the [shareholders](/shareholder) of the companies where he takes a majority or a sizeable stake.

## Understanding the Icahn Lift

One of Wall Street's most compelling figures, Carl Icahn has been in the investment business since the 1960s through different substances, including his [hedge fund](/hedgefund), called Icahn Enterprises L.P. Marks of him range from [corporate raider](/corporate-raider) to vulture capitalist to greenmailer, especially during the 1980s and 1990s. Around the turn of the 21st century, however, he began getting referred to for his work as a [shareholder activist](/shareholderactivist) — one who buys large stakes in a company with an end goal to influence its board of directors and their management straightforwardly.

As a [contrarian](/contrarian) investor, Icahn purchases a huge number of shares in companies that he accepts are [undervalued](/undervalued) by the stock market and different investors. He then publicly frames a plan to fix what he targets as the company's problems — the purposes behind the poor performance of its shares.

Frequently, Icahn's changes have enhanced the company's performance. In any case, these days, he doesn't even need to execute them to obtain considerable outcomes. His reputation is to such an extent that once he targets a company, [institutional investors](/institutionalinvestor) follow his lead and buy into the business he's set his concentration upon. The increased interest makes the share prices rise — the Icahn lift.

## Special Considerations

Icahn sees his job as a manufacturer of shareholder value and the Icahn lift is a testament to that. "I view at companies as businesses, while Wall Street analysts search for [quarterly earnings](/earningsreport) performance. I buy assets and expected productivity. Wall Street buys earnings, so they miss a great deal of things that I find in certain circumstances," he once said.

"That's what my perspective is, thoughtfully, I'm making the best choice in attempting to stir up a portion of these managements," he noted in another frequently cited statement.

It resembles the fall of Rome, when half the population was getting handouts."
