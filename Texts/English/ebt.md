# Earnings Before Tax (EBT)
## What is Earnings Before Tax (EBT)

Earnings before tax (EBT) measures a company's financial performance. It is a calculation of a company's earnings before taxes are taken out. The calculation is revenue minus expenses, excluding taxes. EBT is a detail on a company's income statement. It shows a company's earnings with the [cost of goods sold](/cogs) (COGS), interest, [depreciation](/depreciation), [general and administrative expenses](/general-and-administrative-expenses), and other operating expenses deducted from gross sales.

## Figuring out Earnings Before Tax (EBT)

EBT is the money retained inside by a company before deducting tax expenses. It is an accounting measure of a company's operating and non-operating profits. All companies work out EBT in a similar way, and it is a "unadulterated ratio," meaning it utilizes numbers found solely on the [income statement](/incomestatement). Analysts and accountants determine EBT through that specific financial statement. A company will initially record its revenue as the top line number.

If, for instance, a company sells 30 gadgets for $1,000 a piece during January, its revenue for the period is $30,000. The company then, at that point, surveys its COGs and takes away that number from the $30,000 revenue. In the event that it costs the company $100 to deliver a single gadget, its COGS for January is $3,000. This means that its gross revenue is $27,000 ($30,000 - $3,000 = $27,000).

After a company decides its gross revenue, it counts generally its operating costs together and deducts that figure from the gross. The operating costs of a company might incorporate any expenses connected with its daily activities, like salary and wages, rent, and other[ overhead](/overhead) expenses. In the event that the company is a technology company with substantial investments in human [capital](/capital), it could have salaries of $10,000 every month and month to month rent of $1,000. This greater expense to create means that it would deduct $11,000 in total overhead from its gross revenue. Involving our model above for this tech company, the subsequent [earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA)](/ebitda) is $16,000.

Accepting the company possesses no physical assets and on second thought decides to rent PCs and server space from Amazon, its earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) would likewise approach $16,000. On the off chance that it has $1,000 of month to month interest expenses, its EBT would be $15,000.
