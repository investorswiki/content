# Promotional Certificate of Deposit (CD) Rate
## What Is a Promotional Certificate of Deposit (CD) Rate?

A promotional [certificate of deposit (CD)](/certificateofdeposit) rate, likewise alluded to as a bonus CD rate, is a higher than normal rate of return on a CD offered by banks and [credit unions](/creditunion) to draw in new deposits. Frequently this promotional rate is limited to certain deposit amounts or for certain short periods of time.

## How a Promotional CD Rate Works

Promotional certificate of deposit rates generally are offered exclusively for short-term CDs and require a higher [minimum investment](/minimum_investment). Like all CDs, they guarantee a base rate of return and give the security of insurance from the [Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC)](/fdic) of up to $250,000 per individual at banks. Share certificates, which are the credit union adaptation of CDs, are likewise low risk, as they are insured up to a similar amount through the [National Credit Union Administration (NCUA)](/ncua).

At [maturity](/maturity), promotional CDs recharge into a standard CD of a similar maturity, with the standard posted CD rate rather than a promotional rate. In any case, institutions might offer investors incentive to remain invested by offering a higher rollover rate than another CD would yield. Promotional rates are utilized to draw new customers or tempt existing customers to purchase more CDs.

## Certificates of Deposit (CDs) Explained

A certificate of deposit is a savings certificate with a fixed [maturity date](/maturitydate) and [fixed interest rate](/fixedinterestrate) issued in any denomination thinking about least investment requirements. Term lengths can be basically as short as a couple of days or up to a decade, however the standard reach is three months to five years and the longer the term length, the higher the interest rate. CDs pay higher rates than [savings accounts](/savingsaccount). CDs with higher rates earn higher yields. Online banks will more often than not have the most competitive rates.

CDs may consequently restore upon maturity, or, at maturity, the principal plus interest earned is accessible for withdrawal. A CD is a [time deposit](/timedeposit) that limits holders from pulling out funds on demand. An early [withdrawal penalty](/withdrawal-penalty) is charged relying upon the duration of the CD and the responsible institution. Common early withdrawal penalty fees are equivalent to a laid out amount of interest. FDIC and NCUA insurance doesn't cover punishments incurred by pulling out money early.

Most CDs accompany fixed rates, meaning annual percentage yields are locked in as long as necessary. A five-year CD with a 2.50% [annual percentage yield (APY)](/apy), for instance, would earn around $625 on a $5,000 deposit. In a savings account that earns a rate of 1.50%, a similar deposit amount would earn about $375. In this scenario, a CD would earn more than 1.5 times what a high-yield savings account would earn.
