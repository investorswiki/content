# Lifetime Payout Annuity
## What Is a Lifetime Payout Annuity?

A lifetime payout annuity is a type of retirement investment that pays out a portion of the underlying portfolio of assets for the life of the investor. Such annuities are sold by insurance companies and a few financial institutions.

At the point when an investor purchases a [annuity](/annuity), they can pay a lump sum amount or deposit a series of payments to the insurance company. The insurance company, thus, consents to pay the purchaser — called the [annuitant](/annuitant) — a series of distributions. There are different types of annuities with various payment plans.

## Figuring out the Lifetime Payout Annuity

An investor might pick a lifetime payout annuity to dispense with the risk of outlasting the amount of money set to the side for retirement. The guaranteed payments for life reduce an individual's [longevity risk](/longevityrisk). Longevity risk alludes to the chance that an investor's life expectancy or survival rate surpasses expectations leading to more-than-anticipated cash payments for the insurance company.

A lifetime payout annuity can be structured to give a fixed or a variable payment:

- With a fixed payout, the investor gets a pre-set dollar amount for every payment. A [cost of living adjustment](/cola) (COLA) can be added. COLA is an adjustment to the annuity payments to repay the investor for [inflation](/inflation) or rising prices.
- With a variable payment, the amount of the annuity changes with the value of the investments held in the annuity's portfolio.

Payments can be made to the annuitant in month to month, quarterly, annual portions. A downside to a lifetime payout annuity is that they might leave hardly anything for the investor's heirs. Payouts from a lifetime payout annuity commonly end with the death of the policyholder.

The policyholder can purchase adjustments to the plan, which sort out for payments to proceed to an estate or consider a guaranteed number of payments. These adjustments might bring about a more modest payment for the annuity holder.

## Special Considerations

An annuity is a financial product that pays a fixed stream of payments to an individual. It is essentially utilized by retired folks as a form of guaranteed income.

Annuities are made and sold by financial institutions, which invest funds deposited by individuals over the long run, and afterward when the client is ready, start giving customary payments drawn from the account to the annuity holder.

The period of time when an annuity is being funded and before payouts start is alluded to as the [accumulation phase](/accumulationperiod). When payments start, the contract is in the [annuitization phase](/annuitizationphase).

Annuities are proper for individuals seeking stable, guaranteed retirement income. Since the money invested in the annuity isn't open without a penalty, it isn't suggested for more youthful individuals or the people who don't have an emergency fund that they can tap into if essential.

## Analysis of Annuities

One analysis of annuities is that they are [illiquid](/illiquid), meaning money can't be moved all through annuities without any problem. Deposits into annuities are generally locked up for a while — called the [surrender period](/surrender-period). A penalty would be incurred for early withdrawals.

The surrender periods can last somewhere in the range of two to over 10 years, contingent upon the specific product. [Surrender charges](/surrendercharge) can begin at 10% or more, and the penalty commonly declines annually over the surrender period.
