# Foreign Earned Income Exclusion
## What Is the Foreign Earned Income Exclusion?

The foreign earned income exclusion is planned to forestall double taxation by excluding income taxed in one more country from U.S. taxation. The U.S. Internal Revenue System (IRS) will tax your income earned worldwide. Nonetheless, assuming you are an American ex-pat, this means you are taxed two times on this income. The income you receive overseas, sees the foreign country tax and can be taxed again by the IRS.

## Grasping Foreign Earned Income Exclusion

The foreign earned income exclusion is chosen on IRS tax Form 2555. Moreover, taxpayers who claim this exclusion make domestic retirement arrangement contributions of any sort that are based on this income or claim the foreign tax credit or deduction for any taxes paid to a foreign government on this income.

The income you receive from foreign-source pensions, investments, alimony, or gambling isn't foreign earned income.

## Foreign Housing Amount

There is a statutory maximum exclusion amount plus a [foreign housing amount](/foreign-housing-exclusion-deduction) which limits the exclusion. It is customized on the off chance that the number of qualifying days in a foreign country is under a full tax year.

The foreign housing amount is the housing costs you paid with foreign earned income that surpasses 16% of the maximum exclusion, or base, amount. This amount has a cap amount at 30% of the maximum exclusion amount. The foreign housing amount is taken as exclusion by employees and as a deduction by the self-employed people.

## Illustration of Foreign Earned Income Exclusion

How about we perceive how the foreign earned income exclusion functions. MP is an American working in Vietnam. They resided in Hanoi for 345 days of the tax year and were missing for 10 days on a trip home for Thanksgiving. They earned a salary of $225,000 and paid $30,596 of it to lease a flat for the year. MP paid $75,000 in Vietnamese income tax and owed $81,000 in US income tax on this income. The end result is that their foreign earned income is being taxed two times.

Since MP is a U.S. citizen who paid foreign taxes on income they earned during 335 qualifying days in a foreign country, they might choose to reject the foreign earned income from their U.S. [taxable income](/taxableincome).

MP's 2018 exclusion is $111,000. ($105,900 maximum exclusion amount + $15,040 foreign housing amount x 335/365 ratio of qualifying days to total days). MP's 2018 foreign housing amount is $15,040. ($30,596 in housing costs - $16,944 base amount). Since $13,652 is not exactly the $31,770 cap amount, no further reduction is important. The foreign earned income exclusion permits MP to avoid $111,000 from their taxable income. Be that as it may, $114,000 stays included, and since they have paid foreign taxes of $37,000 yet owe U.S. taxes of $36,000, it stays double taxed.

MP ought to take a $37,000 [nonrefundable](/nonrefundabletaxcredit) foreign tax credit against the $36,000 U.S. taxes they owe. However long they ideal file Form 2555 to choose the foreign earned income exclusion and Form 1116 claiming the [foreign tax credit](/foreign-tax-credit), they won't owe U.S. taxes on the foreign income.
