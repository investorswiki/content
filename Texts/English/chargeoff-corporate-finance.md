# Corporate Charge-Off
## What Is a Charge-Off?

In corporate finance, a charge-off can be one of several distinct things. A charge-off can allude to a thing on a company's [income statement](/incomestatement) that is either an uncollectible accounts receivable (non-payment of a bill owed to the company) or generally connected with a debt owed to the company that is considered uncollectible. In this case, a charge-off thing is written off of the [balance sheet](/balancesheet) in part or in full.

All the more usually, a charge-off is a one-time extraordinary expense incurred by a company that negatively influences earnings and results in a [write-down](/writedown) of a portion of the firm's assets. The write-down emerges due to [impairments](/weakness) of assets.

## How a Charge-Off Works

Assuming a company will take a [one-time charge](/one-time-charge) against a particular accounting period, alluded to as a charge-off, this probably means that an extraordinary event has happened and, in spite of the fact that it influences present earnings, happening again in the foreseeable future is improbable. A charge, for example, this may likewise be alluded to as a one-off, implying that it is probably going to happen in this occasion as it were.

A charge-off of this nature can incorporate the purchase of a large asset, for example, another facility or large part of equipment, that is probably not going to be traded for quite a while. Charge-offs can likewise incorporate charges connected with a phenomenal event, for example, repairs required after a fire that the company has been considered responsible for paying or the payment of [insurance deductibles](/deductible) for covered damages brought about by a natural disaster.

## Special Considerations
### Downsizing Expenses

A company that is currently downsizing to [restructure its business](/rebuilding) will likely need to lay off a ton of employees. The severance payments and exiting the workforce costs that would come about because of downsizing are charge-offs that are probably not going to repeat sooner rather than later. The cost to settle a claim can likewise be discounted as a [extraordinary expense](/extraordinaryitem), which could incredibly influence earnings.

Charge-offs likewise happen when a business changes accounting methods or finds errors from previous financial reports. The change or mistake correction could be costly to the company as figures could really be adjusted downwards, influencing earnings negatively.

### Accounting Standards For Charge-Offs

The proper recognition of extraordinary things was killed by [Generally Accepted Accounting Principles](/gaap) (GAAP) standards in 2015. At the point when it was utilized, GAAP required businesses to report charge-offs separately in the income statement. A company without a charge-off will typically have the normal primary concern or net income. A company with a charge-off will have an extra section before the reality called "Extraordinary and Unusual Items" in the event that the expense is of an unusual nature or rare occurrence. This line will list any extraordinary expenses incurred by the firm before computing the last net income figure. The company was likewise expected to reveal the tax effect of the thing and the effect of the charge-off on [earnings per share](/eps) (EPS).

Starting around 2020, while companies are not generally required to separately show extraordinary things on the income statement, they are as yet required to uncover unusual or rare expenses without labeling these expenses as "extraordinary." These expenses can either be reported on the income statement or unveiled in the [financial statement footnotes](/commentary).
