# Itayose
## What Is Itayose?

Itayose is a [clearing](/clearing) method utilized by Japanese commodity exchanges to set prices. It is a form of auction market in which the hour of order entry isn't recognized, and an opening price is derived on the principle of price priority.

## Grasping Itayose

Itayose is a modified form of the [Walrasian market](/walrasian). Staff at exchanges that carry out the Itayose method will post a provisional price to floor individuals. These individuals then submit buy and sell orders to the staff, who consequently dissect the orders to change the provisional price. This interaction is rehashed until a price matches all the buy and sell orders set by the floor individuals, clearing all trades.

## The Itayose Clearing Method

A not entirely settled by the Itayose method is the price that boosts the traded volume and limits the untraded volume as per the price and time priority rule. The conditions of that rule are that all market orders are executed first; next, all limit orders are executed to sell/buy at prices lower/higher than the execution price and, at last, the accompanying measures of limit orders to sell or buy are at the execution price.

As per the Japan Exchange Group, market orders have a priority in view of the order acceptance time and are matched by price and time priority rule. All the market orders that are not executed by the Itayose method are invalid. Consequently, market orders are not really executed. Likewise, whether or not a transaction by the Itayose method is made, a trading session moves to the [Zaraba method](/zar-south-african-rand) after an opportunity to lead Itayose passes with the exception of when the session closes.

An order acceptance period is laid out similarly as the beginning of trading, and a transaction happens by the Itayose method simultaneously as the closing of the order acceptance period. In the event that still up in the air by closing auction surpasses the defined price range (Executable Price Range in Closing Auction) from the last contract price, a transaction isn't made. The Executable Price Range in Closing Auction is equivalent to the Immediately Executable Price Range.

## The Rules that Determine Contract Price by the Itayose Method

The Japan Exchange Group spreads out the accompanying rules for the Itayose method. Coming up next is excerpted from their website:

- **Condition 1**: The price where offers and offers match inside the reach between one tick over the highest order price and one tick below the least order price*1.
- **Condition 2:** In the case where there are several prices that meet Condition 1, the price that expands the traded volume.
- **Condition 3:** In the case where there are several prices that meet Condition 2, the price that limits the difference between the cumulative volume of sell orders and the cumulative volume of buy orders ("surplus volume").
- **Condition 4:** In the case where there are several prices that meet Condition 1, the price will be both of the accompanying: If the cumulative sell volume is bigger than the cumulative buy volume by any means such prices, the most minimal price. In the event that the cumulative buy volume is bigger than the cumulative sell volume by any stretch of the imagination such prices, the highest price; or, the price in Condition 5.
- **Condition 5:** Either of the accompanying prices: If the highest price of those that limits the surplus volume (limited to the most reduced price among those where the surplus volume becomes selling on balance and the highest price among those where the surplus volume becomes buying on balance when the prices of selling on balance and buying on balance are remembered for the prices where the surplus volume is least), the highest price.

Assuming there is a Reference Price*2 between the least price and the highest price of those prices that limits the surplus volume, the Reference Price.

On the off chance that the most reduced price of those that limits the surplus volume is higher than a Reference Price, the least price.
