# Funded Status
## What Is Funded Status?

Funded status compares the assets to the liabilities in a [pension plan](/pensionplan). All this data point is helpful in understanding the number of employees that are really covered in a most dire outcome imaginable assuming the company or other organization is forced to pay its retirement benefits immediately.

## Grasping Funded Status

The equation to decide a plan's funded status is:

>
> Funded status = plan assets - projected benefit obligation (PBO)
>

Future liabilities, or benefit obligations, are what the plan owes employees for service. Plan assets, which are normally managed by an investment team, are utilized to pay for retired person benefits. Funded situations with range from [fully funded](/completely funded) to [unfunded](/unfunded-pension-plan). Numerous industry specialists consider a fund that is something like 80% funded to be solid, however pension plans are regulated and might be required to add to the plan if funding falls below a certain level as calculated by the plan's outside actuaries every year.

Companies normally decide not to have a pension fund be 100% funded. This is on the grounds that a rise in interest rates will push the funded status more than 100%. It is truly challenging to remove money from a pension fund legally, so money that could be utilized for different intentions is basically caught, a situation that makes analysts and shareholders troubled.

An analyst can work out a company's funded status involving figures in the pension reference. This is in the company's financial statements. Some have suggested that companies move their pension deficits or overflows onto the [balance sheet](/assetperformance) as opposed to just show them in the footnotes. Moving the funded status of pension plans, as well as other retirement benefit obligations like healthcare plans, onto the balance sheet could force many companies to perceive this possibly large liability.

## Defined-Benefit Plan versus Defined-Contribution Plan

There are two principal types of pension plans: a [defined-benefit plan](/definedbenefitpensionplan) (DB) and a [defined-commitment plan](/definedcontributionplan) (DC). As of March 31, 2019, U.S. corporate DB assets added up to $3.2 trillion, as indicated by Investment Company Institute data. Simultaneously, U.S. corporate DC plan assets added up to $8.2 trillion. Corporations are progressively closing pension plans to new employees, or closing them down, and moving employees to DC plans.

In a DB plan, the employer guarantees that the employee gets an unmistakable amount of benefit upon retirement, no matter what the performance of the underlying investment pool. The employer is responsible for a specific flow of pension payments to the retired person (the dollar not set in stone by a formula, generally founded on earnings and long stretches of service).

In a DC plan, the employer makes specific arrangement contributions for the worker, typically matching to fluctuating degrees the contributions that employees make. The last benefit that the employee gets relies upon the plan's investment performance. A DC plan is more affordable for a company than a traditional pension in light of the fact that the company is on the hook for anything the fund can't produce.

The most popular defined-commitment plans are the [401(k)](/401kplan) and its equivalent for non-benefit workers, the [403(b)](/403bplan).
