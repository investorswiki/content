# Extraordinary Item
## What Is an Extraordinary Item?

Extraordinary things comprised of gains or losses from events that were unusual and rare in nature that were separately classified, introduced and revealed on companies' [financial statements](/financial-statements). Extraordinary things were normally cleared up additional in the notes for the financial statements. Companies showed an extraordinary thing separately from their operating earnings since it was normally a one-time gain or loss and was not expected to repeat from now on.

In January 2015, the [Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB)](/fasb), which issues the accounting standards that U.S. companies must agree with, disposed of the concept of extraordinary things. In any case, companies must in any case report [nonrecurring items](/nonrecurring-gain-or-loss, for example, income received from the sale of land.

## Grasping Extraordinary Item

The accounting standards laid out and refreshed by FASB are called the [generally acknowledged accounting principles (GAAP)](/gaap). FASB discontinued the accounting treatment for extraordinary things and eliminated the reporting requirement from U.S. GAAP to reduce the cost and complexity of planning financial statements.

Before 2015, companies put a ton of exertion into deciding whether a specific event ought to be considered extraordinary. Gains and losses net of taxes from extraordinary things must be shown separately on the [income statement](/incomestatement) after income from continuing operations.

The update by FASB to eliminate extraordinary things just dispensed with the requirement for companies and their auditors to recognize whether an event was so rare as to qualify as an extraordinary thing starting in fiscal year 2015. Companies must in any case reveal rare and unusual events yet presently without assigning them as extraordinary. Likewise, companies are not generally required to assess the income tax effect of extraordinary things and present the effect on [earnings per share (EPS)](/eps), which is a company's profit as an extent of its outstanding [equity](/equity) shares.

This accounting update left reporting and disclosure requirements for unusual and inconsistent events or transactions flawless. While companies at this point not must depict events and their effects as extraordinary, they actually need to uncover rare and unusual events on the income statement and their effect before income taxes. Likewise, GAAP permits companies to give these events more specific names, for example, "Effects From Fire at Production Facility." The [International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS)](/ifrs) do exclude extraordinary things in their accounting standards.

## Requirements for an Extraordinary Item

An event or transaction was considered extraordinary assuming that it was both unusual and rare. An unusual event must be profoundly abnormal and unrelated to the run of the mill operating activities of a company, and it ought to be sensibly expected not to repeat going ahead. It was common for certain organizations to not have this detail introduced for quite a long time.

Other than isolating the effect of extraordinary things on the income statement, companies were required to estimate income taxes from these things and uncover their earnings-per-share (EPS) impact. Instances of extraordinary things are losses from different catastrophic events, like quakes, waves, and wildfires. While assigning and assessing the effect from certain extraordinary events (e.g., fires) was simple, different events with an indirect effect on companies' operations were substantially more challenging to survey.
