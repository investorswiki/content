# Functional Regulation
## What is Functional Regulation?

Functional regulation is a concept expressing that a company with a specific business ought to be managed and inspected by the legitimate controlling body.

## Grasping Functional Regulation

Functional regulation is there to guarantee that the top and learned individuals are managing the daily elements of a particular field. For instance, in a perfect world an insurance company would be managed by state insurance commissioners, while dealers or underwriters of securities would be directed and regulated by the [Securities and Exchange Commission](/sec) (SEC).

Functional regulation is put together not with respect to the type of entity or organization being regulated, yet on the commodities, transactions, or products it offers. Hence, a bank or financial institution that offers different types of financial products and handles various types of transactions might go under the domain of numerous regulatory bodies, every one directing the transactions, products or commodities in its jurisdiction.

In the United States, functional regulation of the financial system means that different regulatory bodies might supervise the operations of banks and other financial institutions, contingent upon the types of products and services they offer. A portion of the regulatory bodies engaged with functional regulation in the U.S. incorporate the SEC, the [Financial Industry Regulatory Authority](/finra) (FINRA), the [Commodities Futures Trading Commission](/cftc) (CFTC) and state securities regulators and insurance commissioners.

## Flaws in Functional Regulation

Functional regulation is ordinarily linked to an economy's financial architecture, and that means that it requires steady monitoring and customary updates to keep side by side of changes in that architecture. Some have pinned the 2007-08 Financial Crisis in part on an inability to monitor and properly update the functional regulatory system in the U.S., which depended on a system of funding overwhelmed by banks. This basis, it is contended, encouraged the collapse of the banking system when the source of most funding moved to non-bank sources.

It has been contended that a second flaw in functional regulation is its weakness to political impulses and its extreme reactivity to the financial emergencies of the past. Regulations and regulatory bodies are regularly refreshed in response to financial emergencies that have proactively occurred, in the soul of keeping them from reoccurring. In the U.S., the foundation of financial regulatory bodies and the creation of new regulations is vigorously founded on the predominant political climate, which has driven some to contend that functional regulation in the U.S. is less stable than it very well may be.
