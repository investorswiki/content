# Warning Bulletin
## What Is the Warning Bulletin?

The warning bulletin is a rundown of canceled, past due, or taken credit cards. Made by the two greatest credit card sellers, [MasterCard](/mastercard-card) and [Visa](/visa-card), and issued week after week in paper design, the rundown is presently online and refreshed in real time. The sellers train merchants to acquire authorization before accepting the cards listed and connect with certain conventions while gathering cards that have been hailed for inappropriate use.

## Grasping the Warning Bulletin

The warning bulletin is otherwise called the cancellation bulletin, the hot card list, or the restricted card list. It is intended to discourage [credit fraud](/fraud), which costs organizations and people billions of dollars each year. The sheer number of credit cards in the market and the huge number of [transactions](/transaction) that happen consistently means credit card processors need a method for conveying arrangements of lost, taken, or compromised card numbers rapidly and productively. The warning bulletin is one such method.

Visa and MasterCard require [merchants](/merchant-record) and member banks to follow specific procedures and conventions while recuperating and returning fake cards, or cards that are not utilized by the authorized cardholder. Commonly, the processor should follow several means while returning a recuperated card to the issuer. On the off chance that the merchant has not currently done in this way, the processor cuts the card in half through the [magnetic stripe](/magnetic-stripe-card). Subsequent to getting the card alongside any required documentation, the processor then advances the recuperated card to the issuer. Cards ought to be recuperated, if that can happen through safe and reasonable means.

## Forestalling Credit Card Fraud

As warning bulletins have developed after some time, moving from a paper rundown to an online database equipped for immediate updates, so have credit cards. Specifically, embedded computer chips, known as EMVs, are supplanting the once omnipresent magnetic stripes. The [EMV](/emv) design has turned into the global standard for card use at the two ATMs and for [point-of-sale purchases](/point-of-sale).

The principal purpose of [chip cards](/chip-card) is to reduce credit card fraud and ensure [data breaches](/information break) don't happen. One of its major benefits is that it won't be quickly replicated. Cards with magnetic stripes can be copied through a simple swipe of the card in light of the fact that the data contained on the strip is permanent, making it more straightforward to copy and reuse. Alternately, chip cards make one-time codes unique to the specific transaction. All subtleties of that transaction are stored in the one-time code. Consequently, the data assembled wouldn't be usable for subsequent purchases.
