# G7 Bond
## What Is a G7 Bond?

A G7 Bond is a government bond issued by a member nation of the [Group of Seven (G7)](/g7). The G-7 countries are completely developed economies with highly-appraised sovereign debt thus these bonds are viewed as among the world's most secure investments. G-7 countries incorporate the U.S., U.K. Canada, Japan, Italy, France, and Germany.

## Understanding G7 Bonds

G7 Bonds are issued by the governments of Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United States or the United Kingdom, the nations which involve the G7. Such bonds can be purchased separately or packaged together as a [bond fund](/bondfund). At times, G7 Bonds are accessible to retail investors as [mutual funds](/mutualfund). Since the member nations of the G7 are industrialized, developed nations which all in all address a large portion of the global economy, bonds issued by G7 nations are viewed as stable, okay investments.

Following the economic emergencies of the late 2000s, G7 bonds rose in prominence among investors as a result of their overall economic stability. Bonds issued by the G7 are government-backed bonds. Bonds issued by the U.S., for example, are backed by the [U.S. Treasury.](/ustreasury) Investors regularly look to add G7 bonds to their investment portfolios as stabilizing investments, providing a certain degree of security, high liquidity and slow however consistent growth over the long haul.

## G7 Bonds and the Development of the G7 and G20

The G7 was laid out during the 1970s as a forum for the world's chief industrialized economies.

The G7 meets annually in a highest point held in an alternating member country. The 44th annual G7 Summit, for example, was held in June 2018 in Quebec, Canada. The 45th annual G7 Summit was facilitated by France in 2019. The 46th G7 Summit was canceled in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Pioneers from every one of the G7 nations gather at every year's highest point to examine and determine global economic issues, including looming financial emergencies, commodity shortages and global economic growth.

Initially formed in 1975 as the Group of Six, comprising France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the U.S. furthermore, the U.K., Canada was welcome to join a year later to lay out the Group of Seven. Starting around 1981, the European Union has been addressed at the annual G7 Summit, although as a non-counted member.

In 1998, Russia was added to the membership, establishing the forum as the [Group of Eight](/g8). Russia stayed a member nation until 2014, when the nation's membership was suspended after Russia's extension of Crimea.

Following on analysis that the G7 doesn't adequately address enough of the global economy, especially regarding emerging markets, a larger forum known as the [G20](/g-20) was laid out in 1999 to give a forum to different nations, including Argentina, Australia, Brazil, China, India, Indonesia, Mexico, Russia, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, South Korea, Turkey and the European Union to join the G7 nations in an official capacity to advance global financial stability. Beginning around 2011, the G20 has met annually.

- As large, developed economies, bonds issued by these governments are viewed as extremely okay and place of refuge investments.
- A G-7 bond is sovereign debt issued by a Group of Seven country, including the United States, United Kingdom, Italy, France, Canada, Japan, and Germany.
