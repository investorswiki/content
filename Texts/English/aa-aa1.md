# AA+ versus Aa1
## AA+ versus Aa1: An Overview

[Credit rating](/creditrating) agencies score people, companies, and governments in view of their ability to pay their debts. Agencies like Standard and Poor's (S&P) Global Ratings and Moody's Investors Services assign these [ratings](/rating) to elements (corporations and governments) that issue debt, for example, a bond, through a letter-based scale. A bond's rating is the key indicator of the creditworthiness of the bond issuer, and hence the degree of risk to the investor that the issuer could [default](/default2) on the debt.

AA+ and Aa1 are assigned by [S&P](/sp) and [Moody's](/moodys) separately. These scores are given to investment-grade products as they are high-quality. They imply that the issuer is financially solid and has adequate [revenues](/income) and cash reserves to pay its debts. The risk of default for investors or policyholders is low.

## AA+

S&P ratings are issued to long-term issuers of credit and insurance companies on a letter-based scale. The primary rating is an AAA while the second highest is AA. This is followed by A-rating. Anything that falls in the A-class is viewed as high quality, and that means the debt issuer has an exceptionally strong probability of meeting its financial [obligations](/commitment).

According to S&P Global Ratings, a [corporation](/corporation) with an AA rating is defined as having a "extremely strong capacity to meet its financial commitments." It strays just marginally from the highest-rated companies. S&P might add a "+" or a "- " to these letter grades too to "show relative standing inside the rating categories." This means that an AA+ rating is marginally higher than an AA grade.

One important point to note is that S&P involves an alternate scale for a really long time and short-term debt. The short-term [bond](/bond) it is relatively simple to rate system. Short-term bonds that are viewed as investment quality are rated A-1, A-2, or A-3. B-or C-rated short-term bonds are considered speculative or more terrible.

According to material from the [Environmental Protection Agency](/environmental-protection-agency) (EPA), S&P rated senior debt by Ameritech Corporation with an AA+ rating — perhaps of the highest rating corporate debt can have. The United States has an AA+ rating from S&P. This means that the U.S. has a strong standing and that it can meet its obligations. In that capacity, debt issues from the U.S. government are viewed as high-grade and investment-commendable.

## Aa1

Moody's has a system that is marginally like that utilized by S&P. Debt issuers with the highest grades fall into the A-range beginning with Aaa. Aa is the next category followed by A-grade [investments](/investment). According to Moody's, an Aa-grade investment is "decided to be of high quality and are subject to exceptionally low [credit risk](/creditrisk)."

Moody's assigns mathematical modifiers to these letter-based ratings. Adding a 1 puts it into the highest position of that reach while a 2 demonstrates a mid-range and a 3 denotes a low-range positioning.

An Aa1 rating is higher than an Aa2 rating. Additionally the second-highest score Moody's can assign to investments and [corporations](/corporation) after the Aaa rating. Investments with an Aa1 score are designated with a P-1 classification, which shows a "better ability than repay short-term debt obligations.

The senior debt issued by Emerson Electric was given an Aa1 rating by Moody's, according to EPA records. Moody's positions Austria with an Aa1 rating, and that means the federal government is probably going to repay back its debts assuming it chooses to issue bonds.

## Special Considerations

S&P and Moody's assign ratings in light of certain inherent qualities (of a debt issue and the responsible company or of a specific country) along with other certain outside factors. These incorporate financial strength, which can be determined by dissecting [financial statements](/financial-statements) and the financial ratios that are associated with them. A portion of the outside contemplations incorporate monetary and fiscal policy, interest rates, and a substance's relationship with other key players, like a parent corporation. International worries likewise factor in while considering a country's ability to repay its debts.

### Ratings Below AA+ and Aa1

Scores that fall below S&P's A grades fall in the following categories:

- **BBB:** This rating implies debts are genuinely strong. Yet, when economic conditions or some other conditions change, the debt issuer might experience difficulty satisfying its financial obligations.
- **BB:** These debts are more vulnerable to nonpayment on account of issues inside the business, the financial scene, or the economy.
- **B:** S&P assigns this rating to debt issues that are fundamentally more vulnerable than a BB rating.
- **CCC:** If the debt issuer has any issues coming from business, economic, or financial issues, reimbursing its obligations will not be able.
- **CC:** Anything that is rated with a CC grade has a great risk of default.
- **C:** Those with this rating are more averse to be repaid.
- **D:** A D rating is given to any company or debt issue that is in default or some other type of breach.

Ratings that fall below Moody's A rating fall in these categories:

- **Baa:** These ratings denote a moderate level of credit risk. Albeit speculative, they are normally alluded to as mid-range grade investments.
- **Ba:** The credit risk with these speculative vehicles is altogether higher.
- **B:** Moody's assigns this rating to debt issues that accompany high credit risk and are considered speculative.
- **Caa:** Along with high credit risk, this rating is assigned to obligations that are viewed as highly speculative.
- **Ca:** These issues are probably going to be extremely close to default — while possibly not as of now. However, they might get an opportunity of recovery.
- **C:** This grade is assigned to low-class bonds that are in default. The fact that creditors will be repaid makes in this manner, there tiny chance.

## How Bond Ratings Work

Bond ratings are the equivalent of a buyer's credit rating for companies and governments that need to borrow money. The rating that a company's bond gets determines the [rate of return](/rateofreturn) (RoR) it will pay on its bonds. Each successive step lower in the ratings listed above means a step up in the rate of return and in the degree of [risk](/risk).

High-quality bonds have lower rates of [interest](/interest). They are viewed as [safe-haven](/place of refuge) investments and are frequently bought by retired people seeking a consistent income stream and by investors seeking to balance riskier investments like stocks with high-quality, low-risk bonds.

Low-quality bonds are frequently alluded to as [high-yield bonds](/high_yield_bond). They pay better since they accompany a greater risk that the issuer will [default](/default2) on their bond payments. The bond ratings call them non-investment-grade bonds. They're frequently alluded to as junk bonds.
