# Distribution
## What is a distribution?
Distribution is the withdrawal of money that the holder makes from a retirement account. Taxpayers must report the distribution amount to the IRS whether it is taxable or not. The term likewise refers to money paid out to shareholders as a dividend.
## Deeper definition
Taxpayers ought to know the difference between the three types of distributions: normal, early and required least. A normal distribution is money removed from the account after you are no less than 59 and one-half years old, while early distribution is money taken out before that time.
Six months after you turn 70, you must start withdrawing the required least distribution.
This doesn't mean you must withdraw all your money simultaneously. Certain individuals pick a lump sum distribution which totally discharges the account. Others opt for periodic distributions and receive a month to month or quarterly payment. Another option is to roll over the money in the account into an individual retirement account, or IRA.
Some retirement accounts are tax-deferred, meaning taxpayers truly do pay tax on the distributions they receive from the accounts. Notwithstanding the tax, individuals who choose an early distribution likewise pay a penalty to the IRS.
Taxpayers report the distribution on Form 1099-R, for Distributions from Pensions, Annuities, Retirement, Profit-Sharing Plans, IRAs, or Insurance Contracts.
## Distribution model
One of the choices you must make when you retire is how to manage your retirement plans. Assuming you spread your retirement funds across several types of accounts, you can decide to take distributions at different times.
For instance, in the event that you have your money in savings and in an organization sponsored pension plan, you might choose to utilize the savings to cover everyday costs and hold on until you must start taking the required least distribution from the pension and Social Security.
