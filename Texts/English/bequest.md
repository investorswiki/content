## What is a bequest?
A bequest is depicted as the "act of giving or leaving something by will." There are two general types of bequests: specific and general. A specific bequest is something explicitly recognized, like a piece of art or a vehicle. An overall bequest addresses a gift from the overall assets of an estate. For instance, assuming your dad's will stated that he wanted every one of his assets sold and the assets separated uniformly between his four children, that would be an overall bequest.
## More profound definition
While individuals some of the time think of bequests in terms of cash just, a bequest likewise can incorporate stocks, bonds, jewelry, a coin assortment or whatever other thing the person who passed on found important. The point of composing a will is to ensure individuals you care about receive assets that can enhance their lives.
Bequests are broken down into no less than two additional categories:
- Charitable bequests leave assets to a group that serves an instructive, political, strict or other social purpose. A substantial advantage of charitable bequests is that they might reduce taxes owed by the estate.

- An illustrative bequest is a gift of money that is paid from a particular source. For instance, a will might state that the proceeds from the sale of stock from a designated corporation be passed on to a specific individual.

## Illustration of bequest
While most bequests are obvious, there are conditions under which a bequest becomes conditional. For instance, assuming a grandfather leaves every one of his grandchildren $20,000 under the condition that they graduate from a four-year university, the bequest would be conditional.
As unfair as the conditional bequest might appear to heirs, courts endeavor to respect the will-essayist's intent. However long the condition doesn't need a beneficiary to break the law, it ordinarily will stand up in court.
