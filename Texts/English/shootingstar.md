For a candlestick to be viewed as a shooting star, the formation must show up during a price advance. Likewise, the distance between the highest price of the day and the opening price must be over two times as large as the shooting star's body. There ought to be practically zero shadow below the real body.

## What Does the Shooting Star Tell You?

Shooting stars demonstrate a potential price top and reversal. The shooting star candle is best when it forms after a series of at least three successive rising candles with higher highs. It might likewise happen during a period of overall rising prices, even on the off chance that a couple of recent candles were bearish.

Following the advance, a shooting star opens and afterward rises unequivocally during the day. This shows a similar buying pressure seen over the last several periods. As the day advances, however, the sellers step in and push the price down to approach the open, eradicating the gains for the afternoon. This shows that purchasers lost control by the [close](/closingprice) of the day, and the sellers might dominate.

The long upper shadow addresses the purchasers who bought during the day yet are presently in a losing position in light of the fact that the price dropped back to the open.

The candle that forms after the shooting star is what [confirms](/confirmation) the shooting star candle. The next candle's high must remain below the high of the shooting star and afterward continue to close below the close of the shooting star. In a perfect world, the candle after the shooting star [gaps](/hole) lower or opens close to the prior close and afterward moves lower on heavy volume.
