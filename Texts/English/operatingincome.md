## What Is Operating Income?
Operating income is the amount of money that remaining parts in the wake of [operating expenses](/operating_expense) and [cost of goods sold](/cogs) have been deducted from [revenue](/revenue). It's a measure of how a company's executive management is taking care of its expenses and achieving profitability.
A few companies list their operating income as operating profit or operating earnings. It is ordinarily found as a detail subsequent to "Operating Expenses" and before "Other Income (Expenses)" on a company's income statement. For publicly traded companies, the income statement is part of the financial statement documented on a quarterly and annual basis with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
Before diving further into operating income, understanding operating expenses is essential. In a company's [income statement](/incomestatement), revenue addresses the top line figure for the amount of money generated from the sale of goods and services. From that point, the majority of the things listed on the income statement connect with expenses, for example, the cost of goods sold — in particular expenses for materials — tied to the production and sale of goods and services. By deducting cost of sales from revenue, gross profit, or [gross margin](/grossmargin), is calculated.
Operating expenses are separate from cost of goods sold in that they address expenses associated with the normal operations of a company's business. These incorporate administrative expenses, salaries for executives and other white-collar positions, and costs for marketing and research and development. One more thing listed as operating expense is depreciation and [amortization](/amortization), which are packaged together and those estimate the costs connected with the devaluation of the company's assets, like machinery, office equipment, furniture, structures, copyrights, trademarks, and licenses.
## How Is Operating Income Calculated?
Working from the top details in the income statement, cost of goods sold is deducted from revenue, and the difference is gross profit. All operating costs deducted from gross profit lead to [operating income](/operatingincome), however before extra costs, for example, tax payments and interest expenses are incorporated.

## How Does Operating Income Relate to EBIT or EBITDA?
[EBIT](/ebit) is the abbreviation for earnings before interest and tax, and it's utilized interchangeably with operating income. [EBITDA](/ebitda) takes it a step further — and is generally applicable to companies with large fixed assets — by excluding depreciation and amortization costs, which records the declining value of machinery and elusive assets like brands and trademarks.
At the point when a company's primary concern, or net income — which is earnings after all costs have been deducted — is low or turns into a net loss, executive management frequently goes to EBIT or EBITDA to contend that the company is profitable before tax payments and interest expenses as well as costs for depreciation and amortization are tacked on.
Executive management at startups or companies that just opened up to the world would utilize profit on an EBIT or EBITDA basis to avoid net losses posted on their quarterly or annual income statements since they can contend that the company is profitable before tax and interest expenses — the two of which can be critical — are added.
Starting around 2022, the U.S. corporate tax rate was 21 percent, and excluding tax payments can be put to executives' advantage in alleviating investors' interests about profitability in ongoing quarters. Debt is tied to the company's borrowings, and contingent upon the interest rates for its loans, capital costs can likewise be a big factor. An intensely leveraged company (i.e., one that has more debt than equity) would contend profitability on an EBIT basis. Incapable to arrange lower rates on large debts, interest expenses can be a burden.
An alternative method for computing EBIT is to add interest and tax payments, working upwards on the income statements starting with net income. For EBITDA, go on up to incorporate depreciation and amortization.

In this way, contingent upon one's point of view, operating income looks at expenses tied to a company's normal operations. From the EBIT perspective, it's net income plus interest expenses and tax payments. Yet, both will emerge at a similar amount of profit in the income statement.
## How Is Operating Income Used?
Operating income can be utilized in metrics like profitability ratios, where operating income is measured against another benchmark like sales.

It's valuable in looking at companies inside a similar industry operating in the U.S. also, abroad on the grounds that the corporate tax structures contrast by country.
## What Are the Limitations of Operating Income?
In measuring profitability and checking executive management performance, operating income is limited since it does exclude all costs. Tax payments and interest expenses are excluded.
