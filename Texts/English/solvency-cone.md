# Solvency Cone
## What Is a Solvency Cone?

A solvency cone is a mathematical model that considers the estimated impact of [transaction costs](/transactioncosts) while trading financial assets. The solvency cone, in particular, addresses a scope of potential trades or portfolios that can be traded at a specific time period in the wake of taking the [bid-ask spread](/bid-askspread) into account.

## Understanding Solvency Cones

The spread between the bid and ask prices basically measures the difference between the highest price that a buyer will pay for an asset and the least price that a seller will acknowledge. This spread addresses an important part of overall transaction costs. Of note, the spread will in general be more extensive during periods of market volatility. Besides, it will in general enlarge among assets and asset classes that trade less oftentimes. At the point when spreads are wide, the costs of entering and leaving a trade, or making a [round trip transaction](/rttc), are higher.

Financial transaction costs will quite often descend after some time. Maybe you've seen that online brokerage accounts will generally out-duel each other on fees at regular intervals. Thus, the under $10 a trade these brokerages offered over a decade prior is presently commonly under $5 a trade.

In any case, transaction costs actually must be accounted for, particularly in particular parts of trading. Short-term and [high-frequency trading](/high-frequency-trading) (HFT) strategies that swap positions on an intraday or intraweek basis now and again bring about transaction costs that overpower the profit potential. Even longer-term, or thereabouts called position trading strategies cause massive costs that can't be overlooked. The solvency cone assists with assessing these costs.

## Different Uses For the Solvency Cone

Part of the problem with classic financial models is that many don't consider transaction costs. This makes these models hard to reproduce in reality, since costs are a particularly significant factor while settling on trading choices.

The solvency fixes this problem. It allows mathematicians to apply an estimate of real-world transaction costs while using mathematical and financial theory. Thus, the solvency cone has applications in the foreign exchange, currency, and options markets, notwithstanding just bonds and stocks.

Another area where the solvency cone becomes an integral factor is purported portfolio replication, or trying to match the trading style, or specific market moves, of an expert trader.

It appears to be advantageous to try and match what proven experts do in the markets. Nonetheless, even with perfect data in close real-time, matching their exact performance is remarkably difficult. The explanation is trading costs; the initial trades put on by the expert probably were made at better bid-ask spreads. So even trading them in close real-time won't bring about a similar performance. The solvency cone assists with improving performance suppositions for these reproduced portfolios.

## Highlights
- Traders who buy and sell oftentimes must consider both direct and indirect transaction costs as these can reduce profits and may even create net losses over the long run.
- Solvency cones are likewise utilized while trying to recreate the holdings and after-cost performance of an expertly overseen portfolio.
- The solvency cone utilizes the spread between the bid and ask price, notwithstanding direct transaction costs like commissions, to narrow the universe of potential investments.
- A solvency cone is a device utilized in financial science to comprehend the realm of potential trades that could be made given transaction costs in a market.
