The intent of this practice in accordance with the securities industry is to test industries or practices about which the SEC has concerns, even assuming that there is no obvious sign of bad behavior. Under this initiative, the SEC has led investigations on numerous industries, including the oil, cable TV and video game industries. This policy arose after the [Sarbanes-Oxley Act ](/sarbanesoxleyact)of 2002, which gave greater transparency to investors.
