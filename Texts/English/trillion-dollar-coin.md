# Trillion-Dollar Coin
## What Is a Trillion-Dollar Coin?

The term "trillion-dollar coin" alludes to a hypothetical concept by which a government could mint a physical coin out of [platinum](/platinum) with a face value of $1 trillion, which could then be utilized to reduce the national debt.

This conceptual strategy was first proposed in 2011 as a possible alternative to raising the [debt ceiling](/debt-ceiling). Despite the fact that there were several high-profile defenders of the thought, it was at last dismissed in 2013 by Treasury Department and Federal Reserve authorities.

## Understanding the Trillion-Dollar Coin

The legal basis for the concept of a trillion-dollar coin emerges from the way that the United States Mint is authorized to create platinum coinage with next to no limitations regarding the number of coins delivered or their [face value](/facevalue). All in all, the Mint could hypothetically deliver an unlimited amount of platinum coins, each with a randomly large value. Paradoxically, there are statutory limits with respect to the amount of paper currency that can be in circulation at any one time as well as limits to coins made of different materials.

In spite of the fact that distributing such a high-value coin would probably deliver [inflation](/inflation) assuming it were traded all through the more extensive economy, defenders of the trillion-dollar coin contended that this wouldn't be the case if the Mint just distributed this coin to the [Federal Reserve](/federalreservebank). The Federal Reserve could then deposit the coin in the [Treasury](/ustreasury), accordingly paying off the national debt and delaying or taking out the need to raise the U.S. debt ceiling.

The possibility of a trillion-dollar coin acquired boundless media consideration in 2011 as Washington battled with whether or not and how to raise the U.S. debt ceiling. Albeit the 2011 debt ceiling was ultimately raised, this issue resurfaced again the next year as the national debt by and by arrived at the debt ceiling.

## Special Considerations

There were numerous pundits of the trillion-dollar coin thought, some of whom put forth attempts to take out the [loophole](/loophole) that makes the coin conceivable. Different reporters, like the economist [Paul Krugman](/paul-krugman), protected the possibility of a trillion-dollar coin.

At last, it was the U.S. Treasury and Federal Reserve themselves who put a finish to the trillion-dollar coin banter. In January 2013, authorities from these institutions precluded the possibility of handling the national debt by utilizing the trillion-dollar coin loophole.

## At the point when We Almost Had a Trillion-Dollar Coin

This remembered makes reference to for unmistakable distributions like **The Economist** and **The Washington Post**, alongside several others.

In January 2013, the resurgent debt-ceiling crisis caused the possibility of the trillion-dollar coin to resurface by and by. One unmistakable observer was Paul Krugman, who distributed a series of articles supporting the thought in his well known New York Times column. In one of them, named "Be Ready To Mint That Coin," Krugman contended that utilizing the trillion-dollar coin would be a financially harmless method for settling the debt-ceiling banter â€” one far desirable over the alternative risk of [defaulting](/default2) on the national debt.
