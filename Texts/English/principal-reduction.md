# Principal Reduction
## What Is a Principal Reduction?

A principal reduction is a decline in the amount owed on a loan, commonly a mortgage. A lender might grant a principal reduction to give financial relief to a borrower as an alternative to foreclosure on the property.

Principal reductions were moderately common in the years quickly following the 2008 financial crisis when numerous homeowners across the nation found themselves owing more on their homes than they were worth in a depressed market.

## Figuring out Principal Reduction

The foreclosure interaction is crushing for a homeowner, yet it is likewise costly for a bank. Many homes stood void for quite a long time after the housing market collapse in 2008-2009.

The government-sponsored Home Affordable Modification Program (HAMP) was put in place to reduce the problem, keep more individuals in their homes, and prop up the mortgage industry. The program financed loan modifications that diminished the principal of loans, decreased the interest rates paid on them, or extended the terms of the loans to align them with the homeowners' ability to pay.

The program expired in 2016.

## The Subprime Crisis

HAMP was pointed toward mitigating a broad problem brought about by loose lending standards in the years previous to the financial crisis. Homebuyers were permitted and, surprisingly, urged to take out mortgages far bigger than their incomes could support on the questionable grounds that they could continuously sell them as home prices kept on rising. The [mortgages were "subprime,](/subprime_mortgage)" meaning the borrowers didn't have awesome credit histories.

The lenders then, at that point, sold those mortgages on to financial institutions which packaged them and resold them as investments in debt. Then the defaults began rolling in. As home prices fell, borrowers found themselves "submerged," meaning they owed more on their mortgages than the homes were worth.

## The HAMP Solution

HAMP gave a system that lenders could use for offering principal reductions to those homeowners and to others near the precarious edge of foreclosure.

The Hardest Hit Program was likewise settled during this opportunity to give aid to homeowners at risk of [foreclosure](/foreclosure).

## Qualifying for a Principal Reduction

One of HAMP's accomplishments was to give rules to principal reductions that were probably going to find success. That is, they would permit homeowners to remain in their homes while demonstrating less costly to the banks over the long haul than removing their customers.

The rules incorporated a net present value test, which assisted lenders with investigating the cost benefits of furnishing a borrower with a principal reduction endorsement. It likewise definite qualification requirements, among which were unpaid principal balances of up to $729,750, and specific debt-to-income ratios.

Principal reduction offers turned out to be more uncommon following the expiration of the federal program in 2016. Standards for mortgages likewise have been significantly stricter.

While HAMP has expired, the Making Home Affordable Program keeps on being an initiative of the U.S. Department of the Treasury and the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, with a mission of offering help for borrowers with distressed mortgage loans. The program's site is a resource for finding a housing counselor, staying away from scams, and giving data to borrowers out of luck.
