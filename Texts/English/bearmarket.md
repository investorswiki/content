## What Is a Bear Market?

## What Happens in a Bear Market? What Causes Bear Markets?

For instance, when it increases its[ Fed Funds Rate](/federalfundsrate), the Fed needs to tighten[ liquidity](/liquidity) and subsequently curb[ inflation](/inflation) before it gains out of influence.
One negative outcome of a bear market is that the economy could enter a[ recession](/recession), albeit that is not unavoidable all the time. As a matter of fact, while a[ bull market](/bullmarket) might **feel** better to investors, there are numerous opportunities for profitable investing in bear markets, too.
## How Long Do Bear Markets Typically Last?
