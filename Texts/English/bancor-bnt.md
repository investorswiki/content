## What Is Bancor?

Bancor is a [blockchain](/blockchain) protocol that permits users to convert different virtual currency tokens directly and in a flash as opposed to trading them on cryptocurrency exchanges like Coinbase.

BNT is the Bancor Network Token, which is the primary token utilized inside the Bancor network. As of September 2021, BNT is the 98th most significant cryptocurrency by market cap, with an aggregate value of around $1.06 billion, with one BNT trading at $4.54.

## Grasping Bancor

As per the Bancor website, "Bancor is an on-chain liquidity protocol that empowers automated, decentralized exchange on Ethereum and across blockchains." The protocol was initially developed in Israel in 2017 by Eyal Hertzog, Galia Benartzi, and Guy Benartzi. Their whitepaper (dated March 18, 2018) states Bancor, "empowers automatic price determination and an autonomous liquidity mechanism for tokens on smart contract blockchains."

The name Bancor was picked as a respect to [John Maynard Keynes](/john_maynard_keynes) who coined "Bancor" as the name for a supra-national reserve currency he proposed at the [Bretton Woods](/brettonwoodsagreement) conference in 1944.

## Bancor's Crypto Liquidity Pools

Numerous small crypto coins are illiquid given their market cap and whether or not they are listed on an exchange. The transaction costs can likewise be higher than the costs of the most liquid cryptocurrencies, as BTC and ETH.

For traders who need to deal in small-or miniature cap coins, Bancor's smart token and smart contract technology, which are self-executing contracts with deal terms between executing parties written into lines of code, permits these sorts of coins to be bought and sold with negligible friction and fees.

A standard cryptocurrency transaction happening on a cryptocurrency exchange, whether a centralized exchange or a decentralized exchange includes the transfer of tokens between two gatherings: a buyer and a seller with the exchange going about as a [market maker](/marketmaker).

## Bancor Network Token (BNT)

Bancor's purpose is to eliminate the middleman by making a virtual reserve currency, which they call Bancor Network Token (BNT), and an automatic exchange mechanism where prices and trading volumes are controlled automatically through the protocol.

Bancor's native reserve currency token, BNT, is the default reserve currency for all smart tokens made on the Bancor network. One of the commitments of BNT's ICO was that investors in the coin would gain interest on the transaction fees as other crypto coins are converted into and out of BNT.

Bancor's protocol converts between various ERC-20 viable tokens. Each smart token is linked to smart contracts that hold reserves of other ERC-20 tokens. The tokens are converted inside in light of these reserves and contingent on the volume of client demands.

Basically, smart tokens can be considered coins that hold the monetary value of other viable virtual coins. It is the very in principle to a central bank that holds foreign currency reserves and converts between them as required.

The Bancor protocol upholds all virtual currency tokens that are viable with the ERC-20 configuration. Any smart token made on the Bancor network is likewise ERC-20 viable, and consequently viable with different tokens on the network.

## Bancor's ETHBNT Airdrop

Starting on Jan. 1, 2020, Bancor airdropped $60,000 worth of ETHBNT into wallets holding a base BNT. ETHBNT is a Bancor pool token addressing shares in the ETH:BNT liquidity pool. ETHBNT gathers fees from ETH-put together conversions with respect to Bancor.

The move was intended to increase liquidity by expanding providers, however it is indistinct the way that extra liquidity was added to the Bancor liquidity pools outside of Bancor investing its fiat currency reserves into their platform.

## Reactions of Bancor

Inside, the Bancor network utilizes the concept of Constant Reserve Ratio (CRR) in all smart token contracts, which implies to dispense with the chance of the reserve value of smart tokens being drained. The rate of conversion between different crypto coins is genuinely kept up with by different equations and calculations inside carried out by the Bancor network.

The claim that Bancor guarantees liquidity is contested, nonetheless. A pseudonymous blogger "bitcoinchaser" That's what points out "The level of cryptocurrency liquidity that Bancor has, is relative. Assuming there is a monstrous run on the token or some other token under it, its price will dive, and that 20% reserve will be cleared out in minutes. The point is that in the cryptocurrency market, some other comparable token or any new token, would be cleared out quicker under comparative conditions."

Bancor's foundational claim that its unrivaled technology can prevent a run on any individual coin — even its own tokens — is questionable. As its airdrop of ETHBNT shows, the liquidity on its platform is funded, to some degree initially, by utilizing [fiat currency](/fiatmoney) reserves. As "bitcoinchaser" contends, Bancor gives liquidity to less liquid coins, however in the event of a market panic, BNT itself might become illiquid.

Bancor isn't the only player in the liquidity pool, decentralized exchange space by the same token. Contender Uniswap likewise gives liquidity pools to small coin projects that need liquidity to develop, and an analysis of Uniswap pools contends that any negative change in the price of the underlying asset in the pool can make negative returns for the liquidity provider, offsetting the profit from fees.

Agents of Bancor overlook these losses and how they could subvert the exchange by alluding enigmatically to "arbitrageurs" who will step in to perform the magic of markets function to reestablish harmony.

**Traders Magazine** puts it like this:

>
> The most serious issue looked by liquidity providers to pools like Uniswap is the risk of major relative price developments between the paired assets. It is consequently ideal to supply liquidity in terms of a stable asset, rather than an unstable one like ETH. This problem is exacerbated by Bancor's reliance on its native token, BNT, which is even less stable than ETH. Besides, transactions on Bancor are structured so that they can cause high gas fees, and they are not as of now planning to use layer 2 scaling innovations to reduce those agonies.

However Bancor is attempting to address these issues starting around 2021, its native currency is down altogether from its post-ICO high of $9.70.

## Highlights
- Bancor and its rival Uniswap are the leaders in another wave of decentralized financial systems.
- Bancor uses two token layers that work with its liquidity pools and functionality: BNT and ETHBNT.
- Bancor is a decentralized financial network that looks to give liquidity to small-and miniature cap coins and returns for liquidity providers.
