Longer-dated loans and debts are innately more risky, as there is additional time during which the borrower can default. Simultaneously, the opportunity cost is larger throughout longer time spans, during which time that principal is tied up and can't be utilized for some other purpose.

In the event that a bond is priced at par = $1,000 and has an interest rate (coupon) of 5%, it will pay $50 per year to bondholders.
