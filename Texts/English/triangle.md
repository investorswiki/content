## What Is a Triangle?

A triangle is a chart pattern, portrayed by drawing [trendlines](/trendline) along a combining price range, that implies a respite in the predominant trend. [Technical analysts](/technical-examiner) order triangles as continuation patterns.

## Understanding Triangle Patterns

Triangle patterns are suitably named in light of the fact that the upper and lower trendlines at last meet at the pinnacle on the right side, forming a corner. Interfacing the beginning of the upper trendline to the beginning of the lower trendline finishes the other two corners to make the triangle. The upper trendline is formed by interfacing the highs, while the lower trendline is formed by associating the lows.

Triangles are like [wedges](/wedge) and [pennants](/flag) and can be either a continuation pattern, whenever approved, or a strong [reversal](/reversal) pattern, in the event of disappointment. There are three potential triangle varieties that can create as price action cuts out a holding pattern, to be specific ascending, descending, and symmetrical triangles. Experts see a [breakout](/breakout), or a disappointment, of a three-sided pattern, particularly on heavy volume, as being powerful [bullish](/bull)/[bearish](/bear) signs of a resumption, or reversal, of the prior trend.

## Type of Triangles
- **Ascending Triangle:** A [ascending triangle](/ascendingtriangle) is a breakout pattern that forms when the price breaches the upper horizontal trendline with rising volume. It is a bullish formation. The upper trendline must be horizontal, showing almost indistinguishable highs, which form a resistance level. The lower trendline is rising diagonally, demonstrating higher lows as purchasers persistently step up their offers. Eventually, the purchasers become annoyed and race into the security over the resistance price, which sets off more buying as the [uptrend](/uptrend) resumes. The upper trendline, which was formerly a resistance level, presently becomes support.
- **Descending Triangle:** A [descending triangle](/descendingtriangle) is an inverted rendition of the ascending triangle and considered a breakdown pattern. The lower trendline ought to be horizontal, associating close to indistinguishable lows. The upper trendline declines diagonally toward the pinnacle. The [breakdown](/breakdown) happens when the price implodes through the lower horizontal trendline support as a downtrend resumes. The lower trendline, which was support, presently becomes resistance.
- **Symmetrical Triangle:** A [symmetrical triangle](/symmetricaltriangle) is made out of a diagonal falling upper trendline and a diagonally rising lower trendline. As the price pushes toward the peak, it will unavoidably breach the upper trendline for a breakout and uptrend on rising prices or breach the lower trendline forming a breakdown and downtrend with falling prices.

Traders ought to look for a volume spike and something like two closes past the trendline to affirm the break is legitimate and not a [head fake](/headfake-exchange). Symmetrical triangles will generally be continuation break patterns, implying that they will more often than not break in that frame of mind of the initial move before the triangle formed. For instance, if an uptrend goes before a symmetrical triangle, traders would anticipate that the price should break to the upside.
