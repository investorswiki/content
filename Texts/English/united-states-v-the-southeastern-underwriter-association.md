The case was settled on June 5, 1944. The Supreme Court decided that the industry is subject to regulation by the United States Congress, under the Commerce Clause. This means that the court determined insurance to be a business that crosses state lines and is, consequently, subject to antitrust laws. Congress passed a law a year after the fact excluding the insurance industry from federal investigation.

## Figuring out the U.S. v. The South-Eastern Underwriter Association

The [insurance](/insurance) industry is an important part of the [financial sector](/financial_sector). In any case, there have been inquiries concerning the way in which insurers ought to be regulated, generally on the grounds that these companies carry on with work in different states. The discussion of whether insurers ought to be regulated on a state or federal level became key for lawmakers in the mid twentieth century.

The case of U.S. versus The South-Eastern Underwriter Association preceded the Supreme Court on appeal from a Northern District of Georgia court. The South-Eastern Underwriters Association had control of 90% of fire and other insurance [markets](/market) in six southern states. This was accepted to have given the company an unfair monopoly, brought on through [price fixing](/fixing).

The case zeroed in on whether insurance was a type of interstate commerce that ought to fall under the United States Commerce Clause and the [Sherman Antitrust Act](/sherman-antiturst-act), which was passed into law in 1890 and outlawed syndications of any sort. The Supreme Court held that insurers that directed critical bits of their business across state lines actually participated in interstate [commerce](/commerce). The ruling held that the industry could be regulated by federal law.

The next year, Congress took action to upset the Supreme Court ruling when it passed the McCarran-Ferguson Act. The Act endorsed that insurance [regulation](/regulation-I) was a matter for individual states to choose â€” not the federal government. The McCarran-Ferguson Act, subsequently, excluded the insurance industry from most federal regulations, including antitrust laws.

Rather, it offers an "Act of Congress," which doesn't obviously aim to control the "business of insurance" by not appropriating state laws or regulations that truly do direct insurance transactions.

Peter DeFazio (D-OR), puts limitations on the insurance industry, permitting federal specialists to make a move against companies that take part in any behavior that might smother competition, for example, price-fixing.
