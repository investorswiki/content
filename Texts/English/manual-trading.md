# Manual Trading
## What Is Manual Trading?

Manual trading is a trading interaction that includes human decision-making for entering and exiting trades.

This is rather than [automated trading](/autotrading) which utilizes computer programs that begin trades based on algorithmic or human-educated criteria.

## Grasping Manual Trading

[Manual traders](/manual-trader) frequently utilize computer programs to consolidate information. Now and again, they may likewise set automated indicators to alert them of potential trading opportunities. Notwithstanding, in all cases, human information is required to approve trades while manual trading.

There is a continuous discussion with respect to regardless of whether automated trading is prudent. A few traders accept that manual trading is better since human judgment is required than check market trends and [control risk](/riskmanagement). They feel that the appropriate place for automation is in monitoring data and merging it for human interpretation.

Defenders of automated trading contend that this method is prevalent since it removes irrational human behavior from the equation. Automated trading is additionally based on rules and statistics, while manual trading may be based more on feeling. This doesn't necessarily need to be the case however, as a manual trader can base their strategy on solid logic, statistics, and discipline.

## Manual versus Automated Trading

Automated trading systems — likewise alluded to as mechanical trading systems, [algorithmic trading](/algorithmictrading), automated trading, or system trading — permit traders to lay out specific rules for both trade passages and exits that, once programmed, can be automatically executed through a computer.

Automated systems actually should be worked by a human, and that means they are as yet inclined to human mistake, with the exception of the errors happen in the programming code and not in that frame of mind of the code. Automated trading regularly lessens the number of errors, for example, [fat finger](/fat-finger-blunder) botches which are more pervasive in manual trading, yet errors actually happen in programming or executing an automated system.

The reality of the situation will surface at some point in the event that computers are better than humans in distributing capital. In the interim, many investors are more OK with a human executing buy and sell orders manually. [Flash crashes](/flash-crash) are an excruciating update that surrendering investment choices to computers isn't without risks. The clearest model is the flash crash of May 2010. In no time flat, well known indexes including S&P 500, Dow Jones Industrial Average, and [Nasdaq Composite](/nasdaqcompositeindex) fell 5-6% and bounced back rapidly. During the flash crash, trades for certain individual stocks executed for a penny or less, while others traded as high as $100,000, before prices returned to normal.

In the wake of this episode, traders and regulators the same accused computer-automated trading systems set up to execute quick fire buy and sell orders. From that point forward, investors and money managers have not failed to remember the undermining market capability of computer-driven investment strategies.

## Manual Trading Strategies

Any strategy that includes a human putting in buy and sell requests is a manual trading strategy. A few well known styles of trading include [buy-and-hold](/buyandhold). This is the point at which an investor purchases investments they accept will see the value in value over the long-term. Since trades are rare, they are frequently done manually whenever an opportunity arises. The investor may sell at a predetermined price, or when a [technical indicator](/technicalindicator) or fundamental indicator movements to show the time has come to exit.

[Swing trading](/swingtrading) can be manual or automated and includes putting trades that last a couple of days to a couple of months. The overall thought is to capture the bulk of an expected price move, during a trend or [price range](/rangeboundtrading), and afterward get out and continue on toward the next opportunity.

Day trading can be manual or automated and includes making numerous transactions each day, exploiting intraday price developments.

## Manual Trading Example

Jim is a trend trader. He searches for opportunities to enter emphatically [trending](/trendanalysis) stocks around the 100-day [moving average](/movingaverage) (MA), and afterward likewise involves the 100-day MA as his exit. This requires manual trading since there is some subjectivity included when he enters a trade. Subjectivity doesn't convert into an automated system well indeed.

For instance, Jim frequently prefers to see a rising stock drop below the 100-day MA, however just somewhat, and afterward rise back above triggering his long trade. When he is in the trade, he exits when the price crosses back below the 100-day. The price likewise can't move sideways. It should be in an uptrend. This keeps away from the [whipsaw](/whipsaw) situations which happen when the price gets to and fro across the MA as it moves sideways.

In 2017, Netflix (NFLX) was rising. It dropped momentarily below the 100-day, making a bit of room below the line, and afterward moved back above. Jim bought. Close to the furthest limit of that year, Jim sold when the price crossed back below the 100-day.

Not long after he sold, the price found support at the 100-day and afterward began to rise off of it. Once more, jim bought. This trade lasted the majority of the year until the price dropped below the 100-day once more. Jim sold his position.

Not long later, the price, still in an uptrend, crossed back over the MA and Jim went [long](/long). He needed to sell a couple of days after the fact as Netflix stock dropped. By this point, the uptrend was being referred to, and the price was whipsawing the MA.

This is a situation Jim likes to keep away from and thusly picked not to trade any of the hybrids that happened in the remainder of 2018 and 2019. This type of subjective independent direction is extremely difficult to program into a computer. Accordingly, Jim likes to manually place every one of his trades.
