## What Is a Shadow?

A shadow, or a wick, is a line found on a candle in a [candlestick](/candlestick) chart that is utilized to show where the price of a stock has varied relative to the opening and closing prices. Basically, these shadows outline the highest and lowest prices at which a security has traded throughout a specific time span.

The shadow (line part) of the candlestick can measure up to its wide part, which is called the "[real body](/realbody)."

## Grasping Shadows

A shadow can be found either above the[ opening price](/openingprice) or below the[ closing price](/closingprice). At the point when there is a long shadow on the lower part of the candle (like that of a hammer), there is an idea of an increased level of buying and, contingent upon the pattern, possibly a base.

There are two primary forms of analysis in trading: fundamental and technical analysis. Fundamental analysis depends on the performance of the company to give signs and bits of knowledge about the future course of the stock. Fundamental analysts track earnings and revenue metrics.

By comparison, [technical analysts](/technical-examiner) focus on developments in price. They try to recognize patterns in [price action](/price-action) and afterward utilize these patterns to foresee the bearing of price from here on out. Fundamental analysis assists analysts with choosing which stocks to trade, while technical analysis lets them know when to trade them. The candlestick chart is one of many apparatuses for technical analysis.

## Distinguishing and Using Shadows

Each candlestick formation has an open, high, low, and close. The open, high, low, and close allude to stock prices. These are the values that make the candlestick pattern. The crate portion of the candlestick, which is either hollow or filled, is alluded to as the body.

The lines on one or the flip side of the body are alluded to as the wick or shadow, and they address the high or low reach for the time or [tick](/tick) period.

Candlesticks are utilized across different measures, like time and ticks, and different approaches like one moment, two minutes, 1,000 ticks, or 2,000 ticks. Regardless of what the measure or edge, the formation and rules work something very similar.

A few technical analysts accept a tall or long shadow means the stock will turn or reverse. Some accept a short or lower shadow means a price rise is coming. At the end of the day, a tall upper shadow means a downturn is coming, while a tall lower shadow means a rise is coming. A tall upper shadow happens when the price moves during the period, yet returns down, which is a bearish signal. A tall lower shadow forms when bears push the price down, yet bulls pull it back up, which leaves a long queue or shadow. This is viewed as a bullish signal.

> A candlestick with no shadow is viewed as a strong signal of conviction by either purchasers or dealers, contingent upon whether the bearing of the candle is up or down. This type of candlestick is made when a security's price action doesn't trade outside the scope of the opening and closing prices.
