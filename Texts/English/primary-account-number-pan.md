## Understanding Primary Account Numbers

Primary account numbers are unique identifiers for various payment cards like credit and [debit cards](/debitcard), giving data about the cardholder, for example, the name, balance, credit limit. PANs may likewise be utilized to recognize different types of cards that store value like a gift or prepaid card.

Since they might be the main number associated with a specific account — as on account of a [credit card](/creditcard) — primary account numbers are likewise called account numbers. In different cases, they may not distinguish the exact account data about the associated account. For example, a debit card number doesn't reflect or distinguish the account numbers of any linked checking, savings, or different accounts.

The primary account number is regularly created when an account is opened. Hence, it is typically the primary account in a series that might be opened by a customer at a financial institution. The primary account number is likewise normally the number related to a tradeline on a person's [credit report](/creditreport). PANs are able to support account record keeping and resolution assuming that issues ought to emerge with the account.

## Special Considerations

The absolute first digit of a primary account number is called the major industry identifier, which recognizes the type of credit card by giving company

- American Express cards start with a 3

### Primary Account Number Security

Visa says traders are not required to store full account numbers. Doing so presents a security risk in the event that there is a data breach. In the United States, a federal law called the [Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act of 2003](/facta) (FACTA) restricts traders from printing more than the last 5 digits of a cardholder's account number on a receipt. Dealers are likewise restricted from printing the card's [expiration date](/expiration-date).

## Primary Account Numbers versus Secondary Account Numbers

Financial institutions and lenders might issue debit and credit cards may to a secondary client authorized by the primary account holder. On the off chance that an account has a [secondary account holder](/extra cardholder), cards may both utilize the primary account number. A few institutions, however, have a card-giving policy that permits the secondary client to have a secondary account number.

[Business credit card](/business-credit-card) accounts operate somewhat better. The primary account number for corporate credit cards shows up on no employee's credit card. In this case, the credit card company issues every employee a card with separate, secondary account numbers. This makes it simpler for companies to recognize and follow charges in light of every employee's card utilization.
