# Consistent Yield Method
## What Is the Constant Yield Method?

The consistent yield method is a method for computing the accrued discount of a bond that trades in the secondary market.

It is an alternative to the [ratable accrual method](/ratable-accrual-method), and in spite of the fact that it typically brings about a lesser accrual of a discount than the last method, it requires a more complex calculation.

## Grasping the Constant Yield Method

For tax purposes, either the ratable accrual method or the steady yield method can be utilized to compute the yield on a discount bond or [zero-coupon bond](/zero-couponbond).

The ratable accrual method ascertains the amount of income or expenses accrued instead of the amount paid. It brings about a greater accrual of a discount than the steady yield method.

The ratable accrual method is calculated by separating the market discount of the bond by the number of days from the bond's maturity date less the purchase date, increased by the number of days the investor really held the bond.

The consistent yield calculation is more complex. The consistent yield amount is calculated by duplicating the [adjusted basis](/adjustedbasis) by the yield at issuance and afterward deducting the [coupon interest](/coupon).

This method is otherwise called the effective or logical method of amortization.

### How Zero-Coupon Bonds Work

A zero-coupon bond pays no interest or coupon over the life of the bond. All things being equal, the bonds are issued at a discount to their face values, and bond investors are repaid the [face values](/facevalue) at maturity. The difference between the price paid and the amount repaid is the investor's profit.

For instance, a zero-coupon bond with a face value of $100 may be purchased for $75. On the maturity date, the bondholder is repaid the full $100 face value of the bond.

Even however these bonds don't pay coupons, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) expects that zero-coupon bondholders actually report the [imputed interest](/imputedinterest) earned on the bond as income for tax purposes. Utilizing the steady yield method, the bond owner can decide how much can be deducted every year.

### The most effective method to Calculate Constant Yield

The consistent yield method is a method of [accretion of bond discounts](/accretion-of-discount), which means a steady increase after some time, given that the value of a discount bond increases over the long run until it equals the face value.

The first step in the steady yield method is deciding the [yield to maturity](/yieldtomaturity) (YTM). This is the yield that will be earned on a bond on the off chance that it is held until maturity. For instance, a zero-coupon bond is issued for $75 with a 10-year maturity date. The yield to maturity relies heavily on how often the yield is [compounded](/compounding).

The IRS permits the taxpayer some flexibility in figuring out which accrual period to use for computing yield. For the wellbeing of effortlessness, how about we accept it is compounded every year. For this model, the YTM can be calculated as:

$100 par value = $75 x (1 + r)^10^

$100/$75 = (1 + r)^10^

1.3333 = (1 + r)^10^

r = 2.92%

We should accept the coupon rate on this bond is 2% (expecting that comparable interest-paying bonds pay 2%). Following one year (recall that we're compounding every year), the accrual on the bond will be:

Accrual~period1~ = ($75 x 2.92%) - Coupon interest

**Since coupon interest = 2% x $100 = $2**

Accrual ~period1~ = $2.19 - $2

Accrual ~period1~ = $0.19

The purchase price of $75 addresses the bond's basis at issuance. Be that as it may, in subsequent periods, the basis turns into the purchase price plus [accrued interest](/accruedinterest). For instance, after year 2, the accrual can be calculated as:

Accrual ~period2~ = [($75 + $0.19) x 2.92%] - $2

Accrual ~period2~ = $0.20

Periods 3 to 10 can be calculated likewise, utilizing the former period's accrual to compute the current period's basis.

Naturally, a discount bond has a positive accrual. As such, the basis accumulates.

### Computing Interest in a Premium Bond

Essentially, interest in a [premium bond](/premiumbond) can likewise be resolved utilizing the steady yield method. A premium bond is issued at a price higher than the par value of the bond. The value of the bond diminishes after some time until it arrives at par at maturity.

The imputable interest on a premium bond is negative and the consistent yield method amortizes (instead of accumulates) the bond premiums.

A premium bond will, in this way, have a negative accrual.

The decision to utilize either the steady yield method or ratable accrual method must be made at the time the bond is purchased. This decision is irreversible and is like the method the IRS endorses to PC taxable original issue discount (OID) as illustrated in IRS Publication 1212.

## Features
- Zero-coupon bonds don't pay coupons however the IRS expects that their owners report the imputed interest as income.
- The consistent yield method computes the value of a zero-coupon bond at a given point of time before its maturity.
- Either the consistent yield method or the ratable accrual method can be utilized.
