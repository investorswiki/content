# Tiered-Rate Account
## What Is a Tiered-Rate Account?

A tiered-rate account is a bank account that pays various rates of [interest](/interest), contingent upon the amount of the funds held in it. It tends to be any type of account yet for the most part is either a money market or a [savings account](/savingsaccount).

Generally, tiered-rate bank accounts will offer higher rates of interest for larger balances, to urge customers to save and stay faithful to the [bank](/bank) being referred to.

## How Tiered-Rate Accounts Work

Tiered-rate accounts work by offering unique, or "tiered," rates of interest for various levels of account savings, heightening the rates with the balance.

For example, a bank could offer five fixed-interest-rate tiers on its money-market account, all linked to the amount you deposit init. The lowest tier, or interest rate, is for balances $0 and $2,500. Then, at that point, when you get into additional critical four figures, the interest rate bounces .05 percentage points. It builds another .05% for five-figure balances, and one more for balances that crack the six-figure barrier. Furthermore, assuming you keep $500,000-plus, you score the highest interest rate of all.

Different banks could tether their interest rates to a reference rate or [benchmark](/benchmark), offering larger spreads for the higher account balances.

A tiered-rate account frequently requires a [minimum balance](/least balance) to be opened as well as a base daily amount to be kept up with, or a base month to month volume of transactions. For example, a bank could offer an especially exorbitant interest rate for accounts with continuous month to month transactions. In this situation, the bank is betting that it will generate sufficient fee revenues — assuming your daily balance falls below the base, or you surpass the number of allowable transactions — to offset the higher interest paid on the account.

## Special Considerations

Tiered-rate accounts are intended to draw in larger [depositors](/deposit) and to urge existing account-holders to deposit larger aggregates. With regards to five-and six-figure aggregates, banks realize they are rivaling financial services firms and investment management companies, and with low-risk investment options like [money market funds](/money-marketfund) or government bond funds. So they bring to the table for returns at a comparable level.

Eventually, in any case, the principal source of business for commercial banks is the practice of lending out the money deposited by account holders. In the event that [default rates](/defaultrate) are low and the bank can earn a higher rate of interest on their loans than they pay to their account-holders, then the bank will be profitable.

In this unique circumstance, banks need to balance the requirement for drawing in customers from one perspective while keeping up with their own profitability on the other. Hence, it is improbable that the interest rates offered by a bank will be close to matching the interest rates charged on their loans — except if the [fee schedule](/fee-structure) associated with that account is especially costly.

> ### Banking Profitability
> The difference in interest between what a bank pays to its depositors and what it charges to its borrowers is known as its [net interest margin](/netinterestmargin). This is a key measurement for surveying a bank's profitability. Thusly, it is closely watched by financial analysts.

## Illustration of a Tiered-Rate Account

Emma is a longstanding customer at XYZ Financial, a national bank with several [branches](/branch-banking) in her home city. At some point, she gets a notice from XYZ showing that the bank is offering another savings account with a tiered interest rate structure.

Under the terms of this tiered-rate account, depositors are qualified for raise interest rates on their deposits relying upon the amount of money held in their account. Instead of giving fixed interest rates, nonetheless, XYZ offers variable rates calculated in view of a spread against the [prime interest rate](/primerate).

For example, for deposits somewhere in the range of $10,000 and $50,000, XYZ offers a rate of prime plus 0.25%; for deposits somewhere in the range of $50,000 and $100,000, the rate is prime plus 0.50%; for deposits somewhere in the range of $100,000 and $500,000, the rate is prime plus .75%; and ultimately, for deposits above $500,000, the rate is prime plus 1%.

Emma reasons accurately that this new incentive program is logical a work by XYZ to draw in and hold customers, especially those with somewhat large account balances. Besides, she perceives that the bank is probable able to loan out these deposits at higher rates of interest to keep a positive net interest margin. Extra transaction fees and month to month charges add an extra source of revenue for the bank.
