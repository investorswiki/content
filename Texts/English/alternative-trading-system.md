These infringement might be more normal in ATS than national exchanges since ATS face less regulations.

### Dark Pools

A [hedge fund](/hedgefund) interested in building a large position in an equity might utilize an ATS to keep different investors from buying in advance. ATS utilized for these reasons might be alluded to as [dark pools](/dark_pool_liquidity).

The bulk of dark pool liquidity is made by [block trades](/blocktrade) worked with away from the central stock market exchanges and conducted by institutional investors (fundamentally [investment banks](/investmentbank)).

In spite of the fact that they are legal, dark pools operate with little transparency. Accordingly, dark pools, alongside [high-frequency trading](/high-frequency-trading) (HFT), are frequently scrutinized by those in the finance business; a few traders accept that these components pass an unfair advantage on to certain players in the stock market.
