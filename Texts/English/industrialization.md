# Industrialization
## What Is Industrialization?

Industrialization is the cycle by which an economy is changed from a principally agricultural coordinated based on the manufacturing of goods. Individual manual labor is frequently replaced by automated [mass production](/mass-production), and experts are replaced by assembly lines. Attributes of industrialization include[ economic growth](/economicgrowth), the more efficient division of labor, and the utilization of mechanical innovation to take care of issues rather than dependency on conditions outside of human control.

## Grasping Industrialization

Industrialization is generally normally associated with the European [Industrial Revolution](/industrial-revolution) of the late eighteenth and mid nineteenth hundreds of years. Industrialization additionally happened in the United States between the 1880s and the Great Depression. The beginning of the Second World War likewise prompted a great deal of industrialization, which brought about the growth and development of large urban centers and rural areas. Industrialization is an outgrowth of capitalism, and its effects on society are as yet unsure somewhat; be that as it may, it has brought about a lower rate of birth and a higher average income.

## Industrial Revolution

The Industrial Revolution follows its foundations to the late eighteenth century in Britain. Prior to the multiplication of industrial manufacturing facilities, creation and processing were generally carried out by hand in individuals' homes. The steam engine was a key development, as it considered a wide range of types of machinery. The growth of the metals and materials industries took into account the mass production of fundamental personal and commercial goods. As manufacturing activities developed, transportation, finance, and communications industries expanded to support the new production limits.

The Industrial Revolution prompted uncommon expansion in wealth and financial prosperity for some. It likewise prompted increased labor specialization and permitted urban communities to support larger populations, spurring a fast demographic shift. Individuals left rural areas on a huge scale, seeking expected fortunes in growing industries. The revolution immediately spread past Britain, with manufacturing centers being laid out in mainland Europe and the United States.

## Later Periods of Industrialization

World War II encouraged a remarkable interest for certain manufactured goods, leading to a buildup of useful capacity. After the war, reconstruction in Europe happened alongside a massive population expansion in North America. This gave further impetuses that kept capacity utilization high and stimulated further growth of industrial activity. Innovation, specialization, and wealth creation were the circumstances and end results of industrialization in this period.

The late twentieth century was imperative for fast industrialization in different parts of the world, prominently East Asia. The Asian Tigers (Hong Kong, South Korea, Taiwan, and Singapore) are notable for the economic growth that altered their countries/locale. China broadly encountered its own industrial revolution in the wake of moving toward a more mixed economy and away from heavy [central planning](/centrally-arranged economy).

## Methods of Industrialization

Various strategies and methods of industrialization have been followed at various times and places with shifting degrees of progress.

The Industrial Revolution in Europe and the United States initially occurred under generally [mercantilist](/mercantilism) and [protectionist](/protectionism) government policies that cultivated the early growth of industry however were later associated with a more [laissez-faire](/laissezfaire) or [free-market](/freemarket) approach that opened markets to foreign trade as a source for industrial output.

In the post-Second World War time, non-industrial countries across Latin America and Africa adopted a strategy of [import-subbing industrialization](/importsubstitutionindustrialization), which included protectionist barriers to trade combined with direct endowment or nationalization of domestic industries.

Almost simultaneously, parts of Europe and several East Asian economies sought after an alternative strategy of product drove growth. This strategy underscored the deliberate quest for foreign trade to build exporting industries, and somewhat relied upon keeping a weak currency to make exports more appealing to foreign purchasers. As a general rule, send out drove growth has beated import-subbing industrialization.

Finally, communist nations of the twentieth century over and over left on different deliberate, centrally arranged programs of industrialization essentially independent of one or the other domestic or foreign trade markets. These incorporate the first and second five-year plans in the Soviet Union and the [Great Leap Forward](/great-leap-forward) in China.

While these efforts did re-situate the particular economies toward a more industrial base and an increase in output of industrial commodities, they were likewise joined by cruel government repression, disintegrating living and working conditions for workers, and, surprisingly, widespread starvation.
