# Delayed Draw Term Loan
## What Is a Delayed Draw Term Loan?

A delayed draw term loan (DDTL) is a special feature in a [term loan](/termloan) that allows a borrower to withdraw predefined amounts of a total pre-endorsed loan amount. The withdrawal periods — like each three, six, or nine months — are additionally determined in advance. A DDTL is incorporated as a provision of the borrower's agreement, which lenders might offer to businesses with high credit standings. A DDTL is many times remembered for contractual loan deals for businesses who utilize the loan proceeds as financing for future acquisitions or expansion.

## Understanding Delayed Draw Term Loans

A delayed draw term loan expects that special provisions be added to the borrowing terms of a lending agreement. For instance, at the origination of the loan, the lender and borrower might consent to the terms that the borrower might take out $1 million each quarter out of a loan valued at a total of $10 million. Such provisions permit a lender to deal with its cash requirements better.

Sometimes, the terms of the delayed installment payouts depend on milestones accomplished by the company, like sales growth requirement or meeting a predefined number of unit sales by a specific time. [Earnings growth](/growthrates) and other financial milestones could likewise be thought of. For instance, a company is required to meet or surpass a certain level of earnings in each quarter of its fiscal year to receive the payouts from a delayed term loan.
