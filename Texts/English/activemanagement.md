# Active Management
Active management (or active investing) alludes to a strategy sent by fund managers or brokers where they trade financial assets expecting to profit from both [bull](/bullmarket) and [bear](/bearmarket) markets. Normally, active managers look for market failures, trusting that their positions arrive at a target return or outperform a specific [index](/index), like the S&P500.
On an individual level, active management is basically the act of buying and selling assets much of the time, in view of apparently great market opportunities that emerge. On a more extensive setting, in any case, active management connects with a group of managers or brokers that try to create gains by trading a select group of assets.
Ordinarily, active management depends on scientific research and investment choices. In that capacity, active managers accept they can some way or another outperform the market. This thought conflicts with the effective market hypothesis (EMH), which suggests that the current price of an asset as of now mirrors all data accessible, importance there aren't numerous failures to be taken advantage of.
Subsequently, the achievement rate of an active investing strategy is vigorously dependent on the subjective interpretation of its managers and, consequently, on their ability to foresee the market effectively. Active managers need to follow the market trends closely, so they can increase their possibilities making profitable trades.
Rather than active management, there is the passive investing strategy (otherwise called indexing). In short, it comprises of building a long-term investment portfolio that will not be actively traded. All things considered, the managers or brokers will build a portfolio that is generally founded on the performance of an index. This means that [passive management](/passivemanagement) is somewhat free from human blunder with respect to the selection of assets. Indexing strategies are frequently associated with mutual and exchange-traded funds (ETF).
Since active management implies additional trading costs and risks, it ordinarily has a lot higher management fees than passive management strategies. By and large, indexing strategies performed better than active investing, which could make sense of the recent increase in interest in passive management.
