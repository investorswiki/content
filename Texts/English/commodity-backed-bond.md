## What Is a Commodity-Backed Bond?

A commodity-backed bond is a type of debt security where the [coupon](/coupon) payments or potentially [principal](/principal) is straightforwardly linked to the price of the underlying [commodity](/commodity).

## Understanding Commodity-Backed Bonds

Most bonds have a fixed value determined at the hour of purchase. This value is a combination of the bond's [face value](/facevalue) and its [interest rate](/interestrate) (coupon), the two of which are set at the hour of issue. Commodity-backed bonds are issued where either the interest payments or the face value can shift with the price of the underlying commodity.

Consequently, a commodity-backed bond will experience vacillations in value when the price of the underlying commodity rises or falls. The bond's [issuer](/issuer) determines how the bond's value will change with the price of the commodity. For instance, the issuer could tie a gold-backed bond's principal to $1,000 or the market price of one ounce of gold, whichever is higher at maturity.

Beside giving the [bondholder](/bondholder) with a consistent source of income, commodity-backed bonds have the additional fascination of being a [speculative](/hypothesis) vehicle for investors who accept that the price of the underlying commodity will rise. Moreover, commodity-backed bonds are habitually used to [hedge](/hedge) against [inflation](/inflation).

Commodity-backed bonds will generally have maturities longer than five years. Classified as long-term liabilities, these bonds act as important sources of financing to the companies that issue them. Commodity-backed bonds normally pay a lower coupon rate than customary bonds, since the investor can possibly earn more if, or when, the commodity gains value.

Commodity-backed bonds are generally issued by the companies that produce the associated commodity. Models incorporate bonds linked to oil, gold, and coal. Besides, commodity-backed bonds typically have a [call option](/calloption) associated, which permits the issuer to reclaim the issue prior to maturity. This feature safeguards the issuer from excessively large payments to investors if the commodity's price goes up fundamentally.

Subsequently, a commodity-backed bond generally conveys a higher degree of risk for the investor than do normal bonds. Customary bonds generally appeal to investors who need a predetermined [yield](/yield) with practically zero risk. Commodity-backed bonds don't offer this safety. All things considered, they appeal to investors interested in [speculating](/theory), who will carry a degree of risk. If the commodity loses value, the bondholder might see their bond's coupon rate or face value fall, reducing their overall yield.
