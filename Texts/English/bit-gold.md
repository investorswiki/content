## What Is Bit Gold?

Bit gold was one of the earliest efforts to make a decentralized virtual currency, proposed by blockchain pioneer Nick Szabo in 1998. Albeit the bit gold project was never carried out, Szabo's endeavor is widely viewed as the forerunner to Satoshi Nakamoto's bitcoin protocol. In fact, the bit gold and bitcoin protocols draw such close equals that individuals have guessed that Szabo is the anonymous bitcoin creator, Satoshi Nakamoto (in spite of the fact that Szabo has denied this claim).

Bit gold joins various components of cryptography and [mining](/bitcoin-mining) to achieve decentralization. These components incorporate time-stepped blocks that are stored in a title vault and are produced utilizing [proof-of-work](/proof-work) (PoW) strings. Szabo proposed a decentralized PoW capability that could be "securely stored, moved, and examined with insignificant trust."

## Grasping Bit Gold

There are numerous likenesses among bitcoin and bit gold, explicitly the systems used to handle transactions and to secure the decentralized network.

In the bit gold structure, a client must settle a cryptographic riddle utilizing computing power. All settled riddles are sent through a Byzantine Fault Tolerant (BFT) peer-to-peer network and afterward assigned to the public key of the riddle solver. Subtleties connecting with the transaction are stored in a title library (closely resembling a [blockchain](/blockchain) in the consensus system since it offers an immutable record of and order for transactions that have occurred).

Each solution then turns into a part of the next puzzle, making a chain that interfaces the latest riddle's solution to the outcome of the accompanying one, consequently approving blocks of transactions. This is like the block creation process in bitcoin, where [hash](/hash) addresses are utilized as headers highlighting the next set of blocks.

The bit gold system proposed by Szabo is [non-fungible](/fungibility). This means that various amounts of bit gold ought to be combined to make a single transaction. Rather than a centralized authority controlling its switches, the bit gold capabilities on a decentralized and distributed system of trust between the individual hubs — or participating PCs — that make up its network.

In 2008, a strange figure composing under the name Satoshi Nakamoto delivered a proposal for bitcoin. Nakamoto's true identity is as yet a secret, however many individuals have guessed that Nakamoto is Szabo. Also, despite the fact that there is some incidental evidence, there is no proof that Nakamoto is Szabo. In 2008, before the bitcoin whitepaper was distributed, Szabo wrote a comment on his blog that said he was making a live form of his speculative currency. In 2015, in The New York Times, that's what nathaniel Popper composed "the most persuading evidence highlighted an isolated American man of Hungarian drop named Nick Szabo."

## How Is Bit Gold Different From Bitcoin?

Despite the fact that bit gold and bitcoin are comparable, there are a few extremely clear differences between the two projects.

Szabo imagined that the difficulty of mining bit gold would fluctuate after some time. It wouldn't be guaranteed to get simpler or harder, however there would be vacillations in the amount of bit gold that had the option to be made at different various points in time. Then again, bitcoin is planned with the goal that it gets more enthusiastically to mine bitcoin after some time. (There is likewise a finite supply of bitcoins.)

All the more significantly, bit gold was never planned to be electronic money itself, as bitcoin. Bit gold was made as a reserve currency to back one more form of electronic currency. Along these lines, bit gold was expected to act like physical reserves in the time before fiat currency.

## Objectives of Bit Gold

Szabo said he made bit gold to address a portion of the shortcomings in the traditional financial system. As per Szabo, parties must invest a great deal of trust for transactions to happen in the traditional financial system. For instance, when a consumer needs to apply for a new line of credit, they initially must find a broker. Then, at that point, whenever they've accepted the loan from a financial institution, the institution must trust that that individual will repay the loan as agreed. On the other hand, customers of a bank must trust that their money is very much secured and not being stolen by the bank.

Tragically, transacting through trust-based systems leaves consumers and financial institutions vulnerable to fraud or theft. In fact, the financial system's legacy of predictable losses (and the immense cost of this fraudulent activity and siloed architecture propelled Szabo to present bit gold, a more trustless model for transacting. At the 2015 Bitcoin Investor Conference, Szabo's show focused on the underlying purpose of bit gold: "software to limit weaknesses, everything being equal, to one another."

## Features
- Albeit the bit gold project was never carried out, Szabo's endeavor is widely viewed as the antecedent to Satoshi Nakamoto's bitcoin protocol.
- Bit gold was one of the earliest efforts to make a decentralized virtual currency, proposed by blockchain pioneer Nick Szabo in 1998.
- Bit gold consolidates various components of cryptography and mining to achieve decentralization, including time-stepped blocks that are stored in a title library and are created utilizing proof-of-work (PoW) strings.
