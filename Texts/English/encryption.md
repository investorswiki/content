# Encryption
## What is encryption?
Encryption is a method of data security that encodes information stored or sent starting with one computer or gadget then onto the next in a manner that must be encoded by the person or computer with the encryption key. The most well known procedures utilized by leading financial institutions to secure sensitive personal information depend on data-encryption technology.
Due to the volume of sensitive information that is traded through the internet consistently, more websites and online commerce services likewise are taking on sophisticated encryption systems.
## More profound definition
There is more than one method for encoding data.
- Private key encryption means every computer on a network has a secret code or key that is utilized to encode information before it sends it to another computer. For private key encryption to work, you really want to know the computers that will "talk" to one another and have the key introduced on them. Having a private key is like a secret code shared between two computers that is known exclusively to them to decode messages sent between them. Assuming the message is seen by any other person, it seems to be futile information.
- Public key encryption utilizes both a public and a private key. Just your computer knows its private key, yet it gives out its public key to any computer that requires secure communication with it. The computer that gets the message utilizes its own private key and the public key received from the beginning computer to decode encoded messages.

For companies that depend on transmission of sensitive data, particularly those in the financial industry, experiencing a data breach due to lack of encryption means disaster. Other than managing a damaged reputation, there might be critical financial and labor costs expected to repair any damage that has been finished.
At the point when sensitive financial information is stored on a gadget like a PC or smartphone, frequently ignored by users expect the data is safe. Notwithstanding, these systems can in any case be hacked, and confidential information can be accessed. Encryption of data stored on gadgets is important to keep it away from programmers or hoodlums.
## Encryption model
Each time you login to an electronic email service or other consent based website, you enter a username and secret phrase that are then scrambled by the browser. The server facilitating the website and your computer or mobile gadget then settle on the protocol they will use to transfer encoded information to and fro online.
The utilization of scrambled online communications offers several benefits to you, including:
- Decreasing the number of individuals who understand what you are doing.
- Making it more challenging for programmers to gain access to your login subtleties.
- Clouding your perusing data.
- Diminishing the chance of being misdirected into visiting a malicious website.

A great deal of the time individuals spend on the internet includes sending their information to other people. At the point when you buy something online or fill in an information exchange form to open an online account, you enter a great deal of personal information.Thus, encryption is essential.You can figure out whether your online communications are securely scrambled inside your browser on the off chance that a latch icon is shown in the URL bar and the website address contains "https://."

## Features
- Encryption is a means of getting data by encoding it numerically to such an extent that it must be perused, or decoded, by those with the right key or cipher.
- Digital encryption processes interpret data utilizing an algorithm that makes the original information ambiguous aside from authorized users.
- Encryption is pivotal in a digitally-associated world to keep private information, messages, and financial transactions private and secure.
