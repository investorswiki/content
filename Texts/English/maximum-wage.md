# Maximum Wage
## What Is a Maximum Wage?

A maximum wage is a price ceiling imposed on how much compensation a worker can receive in a given period of time. It very well may be imposed as an absolute level or as a ratio among high and low wage earners. In the event that it is a binding requirement (below the market wage), it will more often than not bring about the typical issues associated with price ceilings and similar[ price controls](/price-controls), however other policy considerations might offset these known social costs.

A maximum wage can be stood out from a [minimum wage](/minimum_wage) or the price floor imposed on what employers can pay their workers.

## Figuring out the Maximum Wage

As a price ceiling, a maximum wage might tie (below the market wage) or not (over the market wage). In the last option case, the maximum wage will meaningfully affect wages paid or other market results. On account of a binding maximum wage, the predictable outcome will be a [shortage](/shortage) of high-skilled, high earning workers, who can't be compensated for the full value they make for their employers and normally reduce the amount of labor time and exertion they will actually want to offer on the market in response.

These workers may separately reduce the amount of marginal exertion they put into their jobs and some might exit the market for labor altogether to seek after [self-employment](/self-utilized individual), [retirement](/retirement), relaxation, or to enter other labor markets where the maximum wage doesn't matter. The maximum wage can be incorporated country-, industry-, or extensive, and the more extensive the scope, the greater these fundamental effects will be.

This shortage of high-skilled labor, similar to any shortage, reduces both [consumer](/consumer_surplus) and [producer surplus](/producer_surplus) in labor markets and imposes a [deadweight loss](/deadweightloss) on society. At the maximum wage, the quantity of labor demanded by employers is greater than the quantity of labor high skilled workers will supply. Employment of high-skilled workers will fall as they pull out from the market, and employers can not fill job opening for high-skilled work. Firms influenced by the maximum wage will be less useful and less profitable to the degree that they rely upon the availability of high-skilled labor, and the a greater amount of the economy the maximum wage applies to, the more society as a whole will experience the ill effects of this reduced [productivity](/productivity).

From a dynamic perspective, investment and [capital will tend to flow](/capital-flows) out of the impacted firms and high-skilled workers will flow out of the economy except if employers can track down ways of evading the maximum wage through different incentives or forms of compensation. These may appear as non-wage benefits, hiring bonuses, or [illicit under-the-table payments](/dark economy). High-skilled workers who are unable to find suitable employment might flow into self-employment and begin organizations, which they would somehow not like and might be unacceptable for, diminishing the overall quality of entrepreneurial judgment and decision-production in the society.

Given the welfare costs imposed on workers, employers, and society overall by a maximum wage, substantial offsetting gains would be expected to legitimize such a policy. Regular policy avocations include moral contentions against wealth and [income inequality](/income-inequality). Since the shortage of high-skilled workers that results might comprise a major [barrier to entry](/barrierstoentry) to certain industries, r[ent-seeking](/rentseeking) activity can play a large job. Lease looking for with respect to employers who enjoy a relative benefit in drawing in high-skilled workers (due to legal exemptions or the ability to pay non-wage benefits, for example, access to elite social [networking](/networking) opportunities) may give the primary reasonable motivation to policy producers to impose and keep a maximum wage.

## Instances of Maximum Wages

U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt, in 1942, proposed a [marginal tax rate](/marginaltaxrate) of 100% for income more than $25,000 to deter war exploitative and urge the rich to make penances in monetary earnings.

Today, the maximum wage is progressively turning into a subject of discussion in the 21st century as additional CEOs and top executives bring back home great many dollars in earnings compared to the lowest pay permitted by law earned by a portion of the employees in similar companies.

The [communist](/socialism) country of Cuba long had a maximum wage capped at $20 each month for pretty much every job across the nation, along with a double money system. Nonetheless, that changed in 2021, with wages rising to mirror a leap in overall prices because of the unification of the two currencies. The new least salary of $87 each month and maximum salary of $396 each month bookend a scope of 32 wage levels that differ contingent upon the job.

Egypt's banking industry was hit hard when north of 200 executives surrendered after the country's [central bank](/centralbank) applied a maximum wage law of roughly $5,800 month to month. Switzerland initiated a mandate in 2013, which failed to pass, that would have limited a company's executive pay to twelve times the lowest-paid worker's wage.

In 2017, British lawmaker Jeremy Corbyn, following Britain's decision to exit the [European Union (EU)](/europeanunion), called for a CEO-to-worker pay ratio of 20:1. Whenever passed into law, this would have meant that top executives of companies competing for government contracts wouldn't have the option to earn in excess of 20 times the annual income of the companies' lowest-paid workers.

## Upsides and downsides of a Maximum Wage

Defenders claim that a maximum wage makes certain to support the economy. In their view on the off chance that high wage earners earn less, the extra funds left over can be utilized to raise wages for other people and hire more employees. Note that this view expects that firm revenues are essentially given and don't rely largely upon the efforts and decisions of top-earning employees.

With additional individuals working, they claim, more taxes will be paid, which thus would mean that the government and society benefit from a reduction in the wages of top executives. It is hazy what the basis is for their conviction that shifting additional wages from high earners in top income tax brackets toward workers in lower tax brackets will bring about greater tax revenue.

Likewise, assuming that the wages of top earners of a company are tied straightforwardly to those of the lowest pay permitted by law employees in a similar company as a ratio, it is accepted that the top managers will be boosted to increase the lowest pay permitted by law to get an increase in pay themselves. Defenders hope that this will increase the rate at which revenues and profits [trickle down](/stream down-effect) to the lower wage workers in a company, government, and economy.

Pundits and [capitalists](/capitalism) contend that when a government engages in the [price controls](/price-controls) of an economy, the economic state of a [free market](/freemarket) is compromised. By setting maximum wages, companies would have less skilled leaders and employees, as the more valuable gifts would be reluctant to work for a capped fee.

Maximum wage legislation could set the stage for a human [capital flight](/capitalflight) where the most skilled people emigrate to freer nations that could pay them their worth. In effect, setting such a policy wouldn't lead to a more useful and profitable economy as the supporters accept.

## Highlights
- Financial specialists accept that such a misleadingly imposed ceiling on wages causes market failures and is undesirable in a capitalist free market.
- Maximum wages might be imposed as a signal of social prudence to go against income inequality or to lean toward the interests of certain politically compelling organizations and industries over others.
- The maximum wage is the most compensation that a firm can pay a worker over a given period of time.
