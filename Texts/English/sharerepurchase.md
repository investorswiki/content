# Share Repurchase
## What Is a Share Repurchase?

A share repurchase is a transaction whereby a company buys back its own shares from the marketplace. A company could buy back its shares because management considers them [undervalued](/undervalued). The company buys shares directly from the market or offers its shareholders the option of tendering their shares directly to the company at a fixed price.

Otherwise called a [share buyback](/buyback), this action reduces the number of outstanding shares. Because this action decreases the supply of shares, investors often consider that buybacks will drive an increase in the share price. This assumes demand for the shares won't be diminished by the action.

## Understanding a Share Repurchase

Because a share repurchase reduces the number of shares outstanding, it increases [earnings per share](/eps) (EPS). A higher EPS elevates the market value of the remaining shares. After repurchase, the shares are canceled or held as treasury shares, so they are not generally held publicly and are not outstanding.

A share repurchase impacts a company's financial statements in different ways. A share repurchase reduces a company's available cash, which is then reflected on the balance sheet as a reduction by the amount the company spent on the buyback.

At the same time, the share repurchase reduces [shareholders' equity](/stockholdersequity) by the same amount on the liabilities side of the balance sheet. Investors interested in finding out how much a company has spent on share repurchases can find the information in their quarterly earnings reports.

## Reasons for a Share Repurchase

A share repurchase reduces the total assets of the business so that its return on assets, return on equity, and other metrics improve when compared to not repurchasing shares. Reducing the number of shares means earnings per share (EPS) can develop more rapidly as revenue and cash flow increase.

On the off chance that the business pays out the same amount of total money to shareholders annually in [dividends](/dividend) and the total number of shares decreases, each shareholder receives a larger annual dividend. In the event that the corporation develops its earnings and its total dividend payout, decreasing the total number of shares further increases the dividend growth. Shareholders expect a corporation paying regular dividends will continue doing as such.

> Buybacks can raise the share price and make the financial statements appear stronger.

In some cases, a buyback can hide a marginally declining net income. In the event that the share repurchase reduces the shares outstanding to a greater extent than the fall in net income, the EPS will rise irrespective of the financial state of the business.

Share repurchases fill the gap between excess capital and dividends so the business returns more to shareholders without getting into a pattern. For example, assume the corporation needs to return 75% of its earnings to shareholders and keep its [dividend payout ratio](/dividendpayoutratio) at half. The company returns the other 25% as share repurchases to complement the dividend.

## Advantages and Disadvantages of a Share Repurchase
### Advantages

A share repurchase shows the corporation believes its shares are undervalued and is an efficient method of putting money back in shareholders' pockets. The share repurchase reduces the number of existing shares, making each worth a greater percentage of the corporation. The stock's EPS increases which means the [price-to-earnings ratio](/price-earningsratio) (P/E) will decrease, accepting the stock price remains the same. Mathematically, the value of the shares hasn't changed, however the lower P/E ratio could make it appear that the share price represents a better value, in this way making the stock more attractive to potential investors.

### Disadvantages

An analysis of buybacks is that they are often not well timed. A company will buy back shares when it has plenty of cash or during a period of [financial health](/financial-health) for the company and the stock market. The stock price of a company is likely to be high at such times, and the price could drop after a buyback. A drop in the stock price can imply that the company isn't really healthy after all.

Likewise, a share repurchase can give investors the impression that the corporation does not have other profitable opportunities for growth, which is an issue for growth investors searching for revenue and profit increases. A corporation isn't obligated to repurchase shares due to changes in the marketplace or economy. Repurchasing shares puts a business in a precarious situation on the off chance that the economy takes a downturn or the corporation faces financial obligations that it can't meet.
