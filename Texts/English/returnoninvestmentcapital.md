# Return on Invested Capital (ROIC)
Return on Investment Capital (abbreviated as ROIC), and here and there known as return on capital, is a means of surveying how productively a company utilizes its debt and equity after its dividends (if any) are paid. It is communicated as a percentage and calculated as net income minus dividends and separated by total capital.

## Features
- Return on invested capital (ROIC) is the amount of money a company makes that is over the average cost it pays for its debt and equity capital.
- The return on invested capital can be utilized as a benchmark to work out the value of different companies.
- A company is believed to make value on the off chance that its ROIC surpasses its weighted average cost of capital (WACC).
## FAQ
### What Is Invested Capital?
Invested capital is the total amount of money raised by a company by giving protections â€” which is the sum of the company's equity, debt, and capital lease obligations. Invested capital isn't a detail in the company's financial statement since debt, capital leases, and investor's equity are each listed separately on the balance sheet.
### How Do You Compute ROIC?
The ROIC formula is net operating profit after tax (NOPAT) partitioned by invested capital. Companies with a consistent or further developing return on capital are probably not going to put critical amounts of new capital to work.
### What Does Return on Invested Capital Tell You?
Return on invested capital (ROIC) decides how productively a company puts the capital under its influence toward profitable investments or ventures. The ROIC ratio gives a feeling of how well a company is utilizing the money it has raised remotely to create returns. Contrasting a company's return on invested capital with its weighted average cost of capital (WACC) uncovers whether invested capital is being utilized really.
