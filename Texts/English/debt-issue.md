## The Process of Debt Issuance
### Corporate Debt Issuance

Giving debt is a corporate action which a company's board of directors must endorse. In the event that debt issuance is the best course of action for raising capital and the firm has adequate cash flows to make normal interest payments on the issue, the board drafts a proposal that is shipped off investment bankers and underwriters. Corporate debt issues are normally issued through the [underwriting](/underwriting) process in which at least one securities firms or banks purchase the issue completely from the issuer and form a syndicate entrusted with marketing and reselling the issue to interested investors. The interest rate set on the bonds depends on the [credit rating](/creditrating) of the company and the demand from investors. The underwriters impose a fee on the issuer in return for their services.

### Government Debt Issuance

The cycle for government debt issues is different since these are ordinarily issued in a [auction](/dutchauction) format. In the United States, for instance, investors can purchase bonds directly from the government through its dedicated website, TreasuryDirect. A [broker](/broker) isn't required, and all transactions, including interest payments, are taken care of electronically. Debt issued by the government is viewed as a safe investment since it is backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. government. Since investors are guaranteed they will receive a certain interest rate and face value on the bond, interest rates on government issues will more often than not be lower than rates on corporate bonds.

## The Cost of Debt

The interest rate paid on a debt instrument addresses a cost to the issuer and a return to the investor. The cost of debt addresses the [default risk](/defaultrisk) of an issuer, and furthermore mirrors the level of interest rates in the market. Likewise, it is basic in computing the [weighted-normal cost of capital](/wacc) (WACC) of a company, which is a measure of the cost of equity and the after-tax cost of debt.

One method for assessing the cost of debt is to measure the current [yield-to-maturity](/yieldtomaturity) (YTM) of the debt issue. Another way is to survey the credit rating of the issuer from the rating agencies like Moody's, Fitch, and Standard and Poor's. A yield spread over U.S. Depositories — determined from the credit rating — can then be added to the [risk-free rate](/risk-freerate) to determine the cost of debt.

There are likewise fees associated with giving debt that the borrower brings about by selling assets. A portion of these fees incorporate legal fees, underwriting fees, and registration fees. These charges are generally paid to legal delegates, financial institutions and investment firms, auditors, and regulators. These parties are associated with the underwriting system.
