# ASIC-resistant
**Local area Submission** - Author: **John Ma**
ASIC-resistant is the property of a cryptocurrency that is "insusceptible" to [ASIC](/asic) mining.
ASICs are [integrated circuits](/integrated-circuit) that are made to serve a specific use case, performing a specific computing task. In the world of digital currencies, ASIC gadgets are designed to partake during the time spent [mining](/mining) Bitcoin (or other cryptographic forms of money). Thusly, Bitcoin is an illustration of a cryptocurrency that can't be viewed as ASIC-resistant.
An ASIC-resistant cryptocurrency has its protocol and mining algorithm designed so that utilizing ASIC machines to mine the coin is either incomprehensible or brings no critical benefit when compared to traditional GPU mining. Now and again, utilizing ASICs on ASIC-resistant digital forms of money might be even more terrible than utilizing the more conventional hardware.
Since mining includes different endeavors of finding a solution for a kind of mathematical problem, the job of an ASIC is to perform whatever number endeavors as could be expected under the circumstances (i.e., however many hashing capabilities each second as would be prudent). This means that utilizing ASICs to mine Bitcoin or other Proof of Work digital currencies is obviously superior to utilizing a universally useful piece of hardware, for example, a GPU card.
Nonetheless, the most common way of making a cryptocurrency ASIC-resistant is a defensive game, which requires proceeded with development and changes. This is due to the explanation that ASIC designers and manufacturers are continually delivering new models of ASIC diggers, and at times, the fresher models are able to sidestep the ASIC-opposition of certain digital currencies.
It is worth noticing that blockchain networks that depend on different methods of accomplishing consensus (like PoS, dPoS, and PoA) are ASIC-resistant by design. Concerning Proof of Work (PoW) digital forms of money, some of them are resistant, and others are not (it relies upon the mining algorithm carried out).
