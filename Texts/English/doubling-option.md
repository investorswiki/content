## What Is Doubling Option?

A doubling option is a provision in a [sinking fund](/sinkingfund) that gives a bond issuer the right to recover two times the amount of debt while repurchasing callable bonds. A doubling option permits the issuer to retire extra bonds at the sinking fund's call price.

A sinking fund provision is an expectation remembered for some bond agreements that requires the bond issuer to set to the side a certain proportion of money every year into a fund or account to repay bondholders at [maturity](/maturitydate).

Bonds with sinking funds typically give downside protection as well as a lower risk of default. Therefore, they frequently offer lower yields than bonds without sinking funds.

Thus, practicing the doubling option lessens the return that investors will receive.
