# All-In-One Mortgage
## What Is an All-In-One Mortgage?

An all-in-one mortgage is a [mortgage](/mortgage) that allows a homeowner to pay down more interest in the short-term while giving them access to the [equity](/equity) developed in the property. It combines the components of a checking and savings account with a mortgage and home equity line of credit (HELOC) into one product. Great for individuals who have great credit, an all-in-one mortgage allows homeowners to pay off their loans sooner without the need to refinance.

## All-In-One versus Traditional Mortgage

With a traditional mortgage, a homeowner makes payments so they can bring down the principal and interest. An all-in-one mortgage, then again, accompanies a few extra advantages, allowing the mortgagor to combine a savings account with their mortgage, similar as a [offset mortgage](/offset_mortgage) or home equity line of credit (HELOC).

Payments are applied toward the principal and interest segments, just like a normal mortgage, with one key distinction — payments are stored into a [savings account](/savingsaccount), so they're accessible for withdrawal. An all-in-one mortgage diminishes the amount of interest paid over the life of the loan. It likewise cuts down on any fees that might be incurred when a homeowner chooses to [refinance](/refinance), which can amount to a huge number of dollars over the regular 30-year life span of a mortgage.

A homeowner can involve the equity from an all-in-one mortgage anyway they pick, including for regular expenses like food and for crises like home repairs and medical expenses. Equity can be accessed by making withdrawals with a debit card, writing [checks](/check) straightforwardly from the account, or by transferring the funds from the mortgage to a traditional [checking](/checkingaccount) or savings account, etc.

All lenders generally permit boundless draws as long as the accounts are paid as agreed, there are funds accessible, and any [withdrawals](/withdrawal) are eventually refunded. Methods for accessing equity, notwithstanding, can differ between institutions.

## Limitations of All-In-One Mortgages

Albeit this kind of mortgage gives the homeowner access to [liquidity](/liquidity), a seemingly perpetual amount of equity can be a colossal disadvantage — especially for individuals who aren't financially disciplined.

There is a risk that a homeowner with an all-in-one mortgage may continuously draw on their equity as it fabricates and never completely pay off their mortgage. Another caveat is that all-in-one-mortgages frequently command a somewhat higher [interest rate](/interestrate) than other mortgage products.

## All-In-One Mortgage versus Refinancing

At the point when a homeowner wishes to change the existing terms of their note, they can refinance their mortgage. The purposes behind refinancing can fluctuate from wanting to exploit lower [interest rates](/interestrate) to removing a spouse after a divorce.

To refinance their mortgage, a homeowner must make a portion of similar strides they did when they initially purchased their property. They should contact a licensed [mortgage broker](/mortgagebroker) or loan agent to survey their income and [credit](/credit) and confirm that they will fit the bill for any changes they wish to make. The home will in any case have to fulfill required guidelines and, depending on the loan program, there might be document checks also.

When a refinance application is completed and approved, the homeowners must go through a [closing](/closing) methodology. This generally involves less desk work than the original purchase, yet requires another mortgage note and deed to be executed, containing the new terms of the loan.

As with a [cash-out refinance](/cashout_refinance), an all-in-one mortgage allows a homeowner to draw on the equity of the home. In any case, as mentioned above, homeowners can save a ton of time and money with an all-in-one mortgage, to be specific by avoiding all the associated desk work and [fees](/expense).
