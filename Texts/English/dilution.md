Stock dilution can likewise happen when holders of [stock options](/stockoption), like company employees, or holders of other optionable securities [exercise](/exercise) their options. At the point when the number of shares outstanding expands, each existing stockholder claims a more modest, or diluted, percentage of the company, making each share less important.

A share of stock addresses [equity](/equity) ownership in that company. At the point when a firm's board of directors chooses to take their company public, ordinarily through an initial public offering ([IPO](/ipo)), they approve the number of shares that will be initially offered. This amount of outstanding stock is commonly alluded to as the "float." If that company later issues extra stock (frequently called [secondary offerings](/secondaryoffering)) they have increased the float and consequently diluted their stock: the shareholders who bought the original IPO currently have a more modest ownership stake in the company than they did prior to the new shares being issued.

## Grasping Dilution

Dilution is basically a case of cutting the equity "cake" into additional pieces. There will be more pieces however each will be more modest. Thus, you will in any case get your piece of the cake just that it will be a more modest extent of the total than you had been expecting, which is frequently not wanted.

While it basically influences equity ownership positions, dilution additionally decreases the company's earnings per share ([EPS](/eps), or net income partitioned by the float), which frequently pushes down stock prices in the market. Consequently, numerous public companies distribute evaluations of both non-endlessly diluted EPS, which is basically a "consider the possibility that situation" for investors in the case new shares are issued. Diluted EPS expects that possibly dilutive securities have previously been switched over completely to outstanding shares.

Share dilution might happen any time a company raises extra equity capital, as recently made shares are issued to new investors. The expected upside of bringing capital up in this manner is that the funds the company receives from selling extra shares can work on the company's profitability and growth possibilities, and by extension the value of its stock.

Justifiably, share dilution isn't in many cases seen well by existing shareholders, and companies sometimes start [share repurchase](/sharerepurchase) programs to assist with curbing the effects of dilution. Note that [stock splits](/stocksplit) don't make dilution. In circumstances where a company splits its stock, current investors receive extra shares while the price of the shares is adjusted likewise, keeping their percentage ownership in the company static.

## General Example of Dilution

Assume a company has issued 100 shares to 100 individual shareholders. Each [shareholder](/shareholder) possesses 1% of the company. In the event that the company, has a secondary offering and issues 100 new shares to 100 additional shareholders, every shareholder just claims 0.5% of the company. The more modest ownership percentage likewise decreases every investor's voting power.

This permits investors, both new and old, to likewise plan. For instance, MGT Capital recorded a proxy statement on July 8, 2016, that framed a stock option plan for the recently designated CEO, John McAfee. Moreover, the statement scattered the structure of recent company acquisitions, purchased with a combination of cash and stock.

Both the executive stock option plan as well as the acquisitions are expected to weaken the current pool of outstanding shares. Further, the proxy statement had a proposal for the issuance of recently authorized shares, which recommends the company anticipates more dilution in the close term.

## Dilution Protection

[Dilution protection](/dilution-protection) alludes to contractual provisions that limit or outright forestall an investor's stake in a company from being decreased in later [funding rounds](/downround). The dilution protection feature kicks in on the off chance that the activities of the company will diminish the investor's percentage claim on assets of the company.

For instance, in the event that an investor's stake is 20%, and the company will hold an extra funding round, the company must offer discounted shares to the investor to undoubtedly somewhat compensate for the dilution of the overall ownership stake. Dilution protection provisions are generally found in [venture capital](/venturecapital) funding agreements. Dilution protection is sometimes alluded to as "anti-dilution protection."

Essentially, an anti-dilution provision is a provision in an option or [convertible security](/convertible-security), and it is otherwise called an "anti-dilution clause." It shields an investor from equity dilution coming about because of later issues of stock at a lower price than the investor originally paid. These are common with [convertible preferred stock](/convertiblepreferredstock), which is an inclined toward form of venture capital investment.
