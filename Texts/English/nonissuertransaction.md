# Non-Issuer Transaction
## What Is a Non-Issuer Transaction?

A non-issuer transaction is a transaction including a security that isn't straightforwardly or in a roundabout way executed for the benefit of the [issuing](/issuer) company. Most arrangements that happen on the [secondary market](/secondarymarket), like stock exchanges, include non-issuer transactions; secondary contributions; or share buybacks that will include the issuer.

## Figuring out Non-Issuer Transactions

Isolated non-issuer transactions are exempt from the registration requirements of the [Securities and Exchange Commission](/sec) (SEC). For example, on the off chance that Joe sells 100 shares of XYZ stock to his brother, this transaction would be exempt from registration requirements.

Be that as it may, when Joe sells those 100 shares to his brother, he formally turns into what's known as a non-issuer [broker-dealer](/broker-dealer). Non-issuers can be portrayed as a person or company that doesn't issue securities or have plans to do so and a broker-dealer is a person or firm that trades [securities](/security) for its own account or in the interest of its customers.

Regulations are a lot lighter on non-issuer broker-dealers, albeit these figures are likewise exceptionally limited in what they can do while legally keeping up with this status.

## Auditors and Non-Issuer Broker-Dealers

[Auditors](/auditor) of a non-issuer broker-dealer must be registered with the [Public Company Accounting Oversight Board](/pcaob) (PCAOB) as of the date of the auditor's report. Auditors are urged to start the registration interaction with the PCAOB when practicable. Non-public broker-dealers are likewise educated to contact the Commission's Division concerning Trading and Markets to talk about individual conditions if important.

Auditors of non-issuer broker-dealers must keep on following Exchange Act Rule 17a-5(f)(3), which states that the auditor "will be independent as per the provisions of \u00a7210.2-01(b) and (c) of this chapter." However, auditors of non-issuer broker-dealers are not subject to the partner rotation requirements or compensation requirements of \u00a7210.201(c).

## Types of Exempted Non-Issuer Transactions
- **Isolated Non-Issuer Transactions:** States characterize what "isolated" means on a neighborhood basis yet it is explicitly non-repeating. For instance, an individual brought stock certificates for PDQ stock to Idaho when he moved from Tennessee. The stock isn't registered in Idaho, yet he might sell it to his neighbor and the transaction is exempt in light of the fact that the individual isn't the issuer and the transaction is "isolated".
- **Non-Issuer Transactions in Outstanding Securities:** This is frequently called the "manual exemption". Assuming the security being traded is from an issuer that is as of now modern on all financial reporting with the SEC, isn't encountering financial hardships, and is certainly not a "visually impaired pool", or "[shell corporation](/shellcorporation)", the transaction is exempt from registration. The securities associated with the transaction must have been in the hands of the public for something like 90 days.

## Features
