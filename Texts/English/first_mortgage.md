# First Mortgage
## What is a first mortgage?
A first mortgage is the primary or initial loan got for a property. At the point when you get a first mortgage to buy a home, the mortgage lender who funded it puts a primary lien on the property. This lien gives the lender the principal right or claim to the home if you somehow managed to default on the loan. Different lenders who have a lien on your house are secondary to the lender of the principal mortgage.

Contingent upon the type of first mortgage you get, you'll probably have to pay a percentage of this cost upfront as a down payment. Then, you'll be responsible for making regularly scheduled payments — comprising of a portion of the amount you borrowed plus interest, homeowners insurance and property taxes — until the loan is repaid.
The main mortgage, once in a while alluded to as having the "senior" lien position, takes priority over any subsequent mortgage, or junior lien, connected to the property. Suppose you purchased a home with a mortgage, and later took out a home equity loan (a subsequent mortgage). If you somehow happened to default, your most memorable mortgage lender would have the primary claim to the proceeds from a foreclosure sale. The second mortgage lender would then have a claim to the excess proceeds, if any. This chain of priority proceeds assuming you have various liens.
There are a few exemptions, notwithstanding. On the off chance that you owe property taxes, they'll ordinarily be repaid first before different claims, and assuming you're filing for bankruptcy, a court can conclude which claims outweigh everything else.
