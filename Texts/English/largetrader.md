## What Is a Large Trader?

A large trader is an investor or organization with trades that are equivalent to or surpass certain amounts as determined by the [Securities and Exchange Commission](/sec) (SEC). A large trader is defined by the SEC as "a person whose transactions in [National Market System](/nms) (NMS) securities equivalent or surpass 2,000,000 shares or $20 million during any calendar day, or 20 million shares or $200 million during any calendar month."
