# Semi-Secured Credit Card
## What Is a Semi-Secured Credit Card?

A semi-secured, or to some extent secured, credit card requires the account holder to initially back the card with a deposit before the bank issues credit. Yet, as opposed to a [secured credit card](/securedcard), the credit limit conceded may surpass the required deposit. So the deposit assists with limiting the card issuer's risk yet doesn't kill it out and out.

This type of card now and again assists people with higher credit risk, or individuals attempting to revamp their credit history.

## How a Semi-Secured Credit Card Works

Banks won't offer credit cards to individuals who, because of multiple factors, have extremely poor credit scores (below 500): those just starting out or from one more country with almost no credit history; the people who have defaulted on advances; the people who have gone through bankruptcy. A secured card capabilities like a standard credit card with the exception of that the credit line is limited to the amount of the cardholder's cash deposit. The deposit fills in as collateral should the cardholder default on payments. A secured credit card can be an initial step for people who can't access any credit whatsoever, or who have a low credit score.

The semi-secured card is one step up. While it actually requests a deposit, it ordinarily broadens a small amount of credit over the amount of the deposit you put up. So the credit limit on the card is higher â€” about double the deposit. For example, for a deposit of $200, you might receive a credit line as high as $500. The ordinary cardholder is somebody whose credit is too great for a standard secured card, yet whose score isn't high enough for a conventional card.

Banks will quite often charge higher interest rates on secured and semi-secured cards, to make up for the default risk they take on. The annual percentage rates (APR) on secured cards are in many cases north of 20%, versus a cross country credit card average nearer to 15%, as of October 2021. Likewise, some semi-secured cards have severe requirements, like an annual fee notwithstanding the deposit.

## Finding a Semi-Secured Credit Card

Normally, a semi-secured card is a progress stage from a secured card: After several months to a year, the secured cardholder graduates to semi-secured status, as a reward for good financial behavior. Nothing changes, then again, actually the credit limit ascends, without the request for extra collateral.

At times a card will be offered as to some degree secured right all along. The cardholder would presumably must have a credit score in essentially the fair reach (600-660), alongside a recorded ability to make payments. Semi-secured cards aren't advertised intensely; frequently, it's an issue of picking out a secured card and arranging semi-secured status with the card issuer.

## Illustration of a Semi-Secured Credit Card

Let's assume somebody who used to claim their own business needed to shade it, and presently works a retail job. After a rough period, this person has returned to paying bills on time and applies for a secured card, considering it to be a bridge to getting a customary credit card over the long run, and a simpler method for paying for expenses while heading out to see family or buy household things online. This person sets aside $300 and involves that for the required deposit. The bank expands $300 of credit on this card, with an interest rate of 22%.

Over the long run, the bank tracks the singular's credit report and account history. After around six months of the cardholder paying the outstanding balance on time, the bank raises the credit limit to $700, without requiring any extra deposit. In the long run, the bank might choose to offer the account holder a customary credit card with a fairly small limit, and with a lower interest rate. By then, it will refund the initial deposit.
