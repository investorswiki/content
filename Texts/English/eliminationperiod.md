# Elimination Period
## What Is an Elimination Period?

An elimination period is a term utilized in the insurance industry to allude to the timeframe between when an injury or illness starts and getting benefit payments from an insurer. Elimination periods are normally associated with long-term care (LTC) insurance and disability insurance.

Otherwise called the waiting or qualifying period, policyholders must, in the interim, pay for these services. The subsequent effect can be considered a [deductible](/deductible).

## Figuring out Elimination Periods

The most common elimination period is 90-days, however they might be somewhere in the range of 30 to 365 days. As a general rule, the shorter the elimination period, the more costly the policy (and vice versa). Regularly, most insurance policies have the best premium rates for 90-day elimination periods.

A policy with anything longer than 90 days, while more affordable, may not save you much when compared to the extra risk you'll take on. While you might be saving money by paying a lower premium, you could end up in a precarious financial situation in the event that you want coverage.

The elimination period begins the date that your injury or finding renders you incapable to work. For example, assuming you were in a fender bender that left you unfit to work, and you recorded a claim 30 days after the accident, the elimination period would start the day of the accident. It's likewise conceivable that your most memorable disability check will not show up until 30 days after the elimination period closes, meaning on the off chance that you pick a 90-day elimination period, it very well may be four months before you receive your most memorable benefit.

## Special Considerations
### Elimination Periods and Long-Term Care Insurance

Before buying LTC insurance, ensure you know the terms of the elimination period. Most policies expect policyholders to require continuous days of services or disability.

For instance, on the off chance that your elimination period was 90 days, you would should be in a hospital or disabled for 90 back to back days before any coverage starts. Accumulating 90 days altogether over a predetermined period of time (like six months) wouldn't qualify you for coverage.

### Picking an Elimination Period

The right elimination period for you relies upon your financial situation and how long you can stand to live without benefit payments.

With a short-term disability plan through your employer, for example, the priority ought to be to pick a plan that lines up with the benefit period of that short-term disability plan. Long-term disability insurance ought to get where the short-term insurance plan leaves off.

A few plans might forgo the waiting period when you present a subsequent claim. In this way, assuming you have a constant illness that kept you from working for north of 90 days, and you recovered in no less than a year, however the illness returned, you might not need to meet the elimination period once more. Notwithstanding, in the event that your disability is brought about by an alternate illness, you should meet the waiting period once more.

On the off chance that you have an adequate number of savings to cover six months or longer with practically no income, you should seriously mull over a 180-day elimination period. It very well may be essentially less expensive than a shorter elimination period. In the event that you don't have a short-term plan or an emergency fund, you ought to pick an elimination period with a month to month premium you can manage. Then, at that point, begin saving however much you can, so you can have that emergency fund to cover the gap.

On the off chance that you are married and your spouse is working, a longer elimination period could work for you.
