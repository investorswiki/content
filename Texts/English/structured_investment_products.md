# Structured Investment Products (SIPs)
## What Is a Structured Investment Products (SIPs)?

Structured investment products, or SIPs, are types of investments that meet specific investor needs with a tweaked product mix. SIPs typically incorporate the utilization of [derivatives](/subordinate). They are frequently made by investment banks for hedge funds, organizations, or the retail client mass market.

SIPs are distinct from a [systematic investment plan](/systematicinvestmentplan) (SIP), in which investors make standard and equivalent payments into a [mutual fund](/mutualfund), trading account, or retirement account to benefit from the long-term benefits of [dollar-cost averaging](/dollarcostaveraging).

> On December 9, 2020, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) adopted new rules expected to modernize the infrastructure for the assortment, consolidation, and scattering of market data for exchange-recorded [national market system](/nms) stocks. Among other adopted rules, the SEC has laid out a decentralized consolidation model in which contending consolidators, as opposed to the exclusive SIPs, will be responsible for gathering, solidifying, and scattering consolidated market data to the public.

## Figuring out Structured Investment Products (SIPs)

A structured investment can shift in its scope and complexity, frequently relying upon the [risk tolerance](/risktolerance) of the investor. SIPs typically include exposure to [fixed income](/fixedincome) markets and derivatives. A structured investment frequently begins with a traditional security, for example, a conventional investment grade bond or a [certificate of deposit](/certificateofdeposit) (CD), and replaces the typical payment features, (for example, periodic [coupons](/coupon) and last principal) with modern payoffs, derived not from the backer's own [cash flow](/cashflow), but rather from the performance of at least one underlying assets.

A simple example of a structured product is a $1000 CD that expires in three years. It doesn't offer traditional interest payments, however all things being equal, the yearly interest payment depends on the performance of the [Nasdaq 100](/nasdaq100) stock index. In the event that the index rises the investor procures a portion of the gain. On the off chance that the index falls, the investor actually receives their $1000 back following three years. This type of product is a combination of a fixed income CD a long-term [call option](/calloption) on the Nasdaq 100 index.

The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) started examining structured notes in 2018, due to widespread analysis over their excessive fees and lack of transparency. As an example, in 2018, Wells Fargo Advisors LLC agreed to pay $4 million and return badly gotten-gains to settle SEC charges after it was found that company agents actively urged individuals to buy and sell one of their structured products which should be bought and held till maturity. This churning of trades made big commissions for the bank and decreased investor returns.

## SIPs and the Rainbow Note

Structured products draw in an investors with their ability to tweak exposure to various markets. For example, a rainbow note offers exposure to more than one underlying asset. A rainbow note could get performance value from three generally low-corresponded assets, similar to the [Russell 3000 Index](/russell_3000) of U.S. stocks, the [MSCI](/msci) Pacific Ex-Japan Index, and the [Dow-AIG commodity futures index](/dj-aigci). Likewise, connecting a lookback feature to this structured product could additionally lower volatility by "smoothing" returns after some time.

In a [lookback instrument](/lookbackoption), the value of the underlying asset did not depend on its last value at expiration, however on an optimal value assumed control over the note's term (like month to month or quarterly). In the options world, this additionally harmonizes with a [Asian option](/asianoption) (to recognize the instrument from European or [American options](/americanoption)). Consolidating these types of features can give even more alluring [diversification](/diversification) properties.

This demonstrates the way that structured products can go from the moderately simple CD example referenced prior, to the more exotic rendition talked about here.

## Advantages and disadvantages

Benefits of SIPs incorporate diversification past normal assets. Different benefits rely upon the type of structured product, as every one is unique. Those benefits might incorporate, principal protection, low volatility, tax proficiency, bigger returns than the underlying asset gives ([leverage](/leverage)), or positive yields in low yield conditions.

The impediments incorporate complexity which can lead to obscure risks. Fees can be very steep, however are frequently hidden inside the payout structure or in the [spread](/spread) the bank charges to enter and exit positions. There is [credit risk](/creditrisk) with the investment bank backing the SIPs. There is generally practically no liquidity for the SIPs, so investors must take the price the investment bank is citing or will most likely be unable to exit before maturity by any means. And keeping in mind that these products might offer some diversification benefits, it isn't generally clear why they are required or under what conditions they are required other than to create sales fees for the investment bank making them.

## Real World Example of Structured Investment Products (SIPs)

Via example, expect that an investor consents to put $100 into a structured product in view of the performance of the [S&P 500 stock index](/sp500). The more the S&P 500 goes up, the more the structured product is worth. In any case, on the off chance that the S&P 500 goes down, the investor actually gets their $100 back at maturity.

For this service, the bank takes several fees or produces revenue in at least a couple ways. It might cap how much the investor can make, and hence anything the S&P 500 maneuvers over that cap is the profit of the bank, not the investor. The bank may likewise charge a fee. This may not be apparent, yet rather figured into the payouts. For example, the S&P 500 might have to rise 5% in year one for the client to receive a 2% payout. In the event that the S&P 500 rises not exactly that, the payout diminishes proportionality. The investor might not receive anything if the S&P 500 rises 3% or less, which is the bank's profit.

This product consolidates a CD or bond with a call option on the S&P 500 index. The bank can take the interest it would have paid and buy call options. This safeguards the initial capital while as yet giving upside profit potential in the event that the stock index rises. The bank can likewise [hedge](/hedge) any exposure it might create on additional complex structured products, and that means they are typically not worried about what direction the market moves.

## Features
- Structured products differ in complexity from simple to profoundly complex.
- Structured products are made by investment banks and frequently consolidate at least two assets, and in some cases numerous asset classes, to make a product that pays out in light of the performance of those underlying assets.
- Fees are now and again hidden in the payouts and fine print, and that means an investor doesn't necessarily know exactly the amount they are paying for the product, and whether they could make it less expensive all alone.
