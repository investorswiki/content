Unaffiliated investments can incorporate stocks, bonds, property, and different assets and are frequently uncovered in the [financial statements](/financial-statements) of insurers.

## Grasping Unaffiliated Investments

[Insurance companies](/common insurance-company) utilize the proceeds from their [underwriting](/underwriting) activities in a number of various ways.

They set to the side funds as [loss reserves](/loss-hold) to cover liabilities that they might cause from policyholders making a claim. They pay commissions to brokers who acquire new business, and operational expenses like salaries, benefits, and overhead. They likewise distribute capital to invest in securities of different liquidities in a bid to increase the return on the [premiums](/insurance-premium) they receive.

## History of Unaffiliated Investments

By and large, insurers would generally invest in traditional [asset classes](/assetclasses) that offer consistent yields, for example, government bonds. This approach has been confounded since the financial crisis. Now that super low [interest rates](/interestrate) are a customary installation, insurers have been forced to broaden their nets to secure good returns.

As a rule, this has brought about a shift to alternative investments, including [private equity](/privateequity) and structured finance, for example, [residential mortgage-backed securities](/rmbs) (RMBS).

Unaffiliated investments are remembered for the [overall liquidity ratio](/overall-liquidity-ratio), however this ratio doesn't consider affiliated investments. They don't, be that as it may, show up in the calculation of an insurer's [combined ratio](/combinedratio). This is on the grounds that the combined ratio takes a gander at cash surges — cost ratio, loss and loss-adjustment ratio, and dividend ratio — to perceive how much money it costs to keep up with the book of business.
