## Primary Types of Forex Options Trading

There are two types of options essentially accessible to retail forex traders for currency options trading. The two sorts of trades include short-term trades of a currency pair with an emphasis on the future interest rates of the pair.

1. **The traditional ("vanilla")** **call or put option**. With a traditional, or [vanilla](/vanillaoption), options contract the trader has the right — however isn't committed — to buy or sell a specific currency at the settled upon price and execution date. The trade will in any case include being long one currency and short another currency pair. Generally, the buyer will state the amount they might want to buy, the price they need to buy at, and the date for expiration. A seller will then answer with a quoted premium for the trade. Traditional options might have American-or European-style expirations. Both the put and call options give traders a right, yet there is no obligation. Assuming that the current exchange rate puts the options [out of the money (OTM)](/outofthemoney), they will terminate uselessly.
1. **A single payment option trading (SPOT)** **product**. A SPOT option has a more flexible contract structure than a traditional option. This strategy is a go big or go home type of trade, and they are otherwise called [binary or digital options](/binary-option). The buyer will offer a scenario, for example, "EUR/USD will break 1.3000 in 12 days." They will receive premium statements addressing a payout in light of the probability of the event occurring. On the off chance that this event happens, the buyer gets a profit. On the off chance that it doesn't happen, the buyer will lose the premium they paid. SPOT contracts require a higher premium than traditional options contracts do. Likewise, SPOT contracts might be written to pay out in the event that they arrive at a specific point, several specific points, or on the other hand on the off chance that they don't arrive at a specific point by any stretch of the imagination. Of course, premium requirements will be higher with particular options structures.

Due to the risk of loss associated with composing options, most retail forex brokers don't permit traders to sell options contracts without high levels of capital for protection.

The investor purchases a currency call option on the euro with a strike price of $115, since currency prices are quoted as 100 times the exchange rate. At the point when the investor purchases the contract, the spot rate of the euro is equivalent to $110.

Expect the euro's spot price at the expiration date is $118. Thusly, the currency option is said to have expired in the money. Therefore, the investor's profit is $300, or (100 * ($118 - $115)), less the premium paid for the currency call option.
