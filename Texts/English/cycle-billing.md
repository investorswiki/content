# Cycle Billing
## What Is Cycle Billing?

Cycle billing is the practice of [invoicing](/receipt) different customers in view of a schedule as opposed to billing all accounts immediately on a single date. Statements are prepared and conveyed at different spans, spreading out the company's responsibility and making it more straightforward for it to keep track of who has been billed.

## How Cycle Billing Works

Cycle billing is an invoicing strategy that includes billing a designated percentage of [customers](/customer) every day, rather than billing them generally together, maybe toward the month's end.

Companies that apply this technique might do as such in a number of different ways. Methods incorporate conveying solicitations for the largest amounts outstanding on the first of every month, trailed by the more modest billing amount on the second of each and every month or later. Customers may likewise be billed in light of sequential order, the day of the month the account was opened, or the date the customer decided to be billed while laying out an account.

The date at which the cycle starts might rely upon the type of service being offered and the customer's requirements. For instance, a cable TV provider could opt to set a customer's [billing cycle](/billing-cycle) to line up with when that customer started service.

Cycle billing fluctuates from the common practice of giving all solicitations on a similar date. Single-date billing is normally utilized by organizations that have a common due date for services or rent. For instance, an apartment building might send a bill for rent on the first of each and every month, paying little heed to when tenants marked their individual [leases](/rent).

## Benefits and Disadvantages of Cycle Billing

Cycle billing empowers the provider to smooth the volume of billing work to be completed on some random day, foster a redid schedule, and all the more effectively track which customers endlessly have not yet been billed. Adopting this specific model might bring about diminished [selling, general, and administrative expense](/sga) (SG&A) costs since tracking the number of active solicitations becomes simplified and less inclined to mistake.

On the flip side, the cycle billing technique might adversely affect [cash flows](/cashflow) as certain solicitations may be delayed several days from when they would typically be issued. What's more, a more modest vendor that battles to keep track of solicitations and money owed may end up wrecked by staying aware of different statements relating to different days.

## Special Considerations

Organizations utilizing cycle billing might lay out different lengths of billing cycles. [Vendors](/vendor) could abbreviate or extend the period of time between billings to oversee cash flows or to conform to a change in the [creditworthiness](/credit-value) of a customer.

For instance, a [wholesaler](/wholesaling) to a supermarket chain might have to speed up receipt of cash flows on the grounds that the company it leases delivery trucks from has fixed its billing cycle. Another model is a situation where a consumer electronic goods distributer has a late-paying retail chain customer. Since this account is more dangerous, the distributer could choose to reduce the billing cycle from four weeks to three weeks.

A billing cycle can likewise stretch out past a month, for example, with a large corporate customer mentioning a 45-day billing cycle for certain services. On the off chance that the creditworthiness of this customer is sound, the vendor might consent to the more drawn out cycle.
