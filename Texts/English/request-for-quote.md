# Request for Quote (RFQ)
## What Is a Request for Quote (RFQ)?

A request for quote (RFQ), otherwise called an invitation for bid (IFB), is a cycle where a company solicits select providers and contractors to submit price quotes and bids for the chance to satisfy certain tasks or projects. The RFQ cycle is especially important to businesses that need a steady supply of a specific number of standard products. Companies might send RFQs alone or before a request for proposal (RFP).

## How Requests for a Quote Work

A RFQ is typically the most important phase in presenting a [request for proposal (RFP)](/request-for-proposal). These two records are comparative as they give subtleties of the project or services required, however RFQs generally ask at a more complete cost quote. Likewise, businesses ordinarily design RFQs for generic products in which the quantity required is known, and RFPs are for unique, niche projects where amounts and specifications are obscure.

As well as pricing, RFQs might incorporate subtleties, for example, payment terms, factors that could influence a company's bid selection, submission cutoff time, and such. A [government agency](/bureaucratic offices) that needs to buy 500 PCs with a specific hard drive size and processing speed, for instance, would send a RFQ to several vendors as prospective bidders.

Since the RFQ design is uniform inside a given company, when the RFQs return with price quotes, the requesting company might compare them without any problem. Normally, a RFQ interaction comprises of four segments: the readiness phase, the processing phase, the awarding phase, and the closing phase. The company generally will award the contract to the vendor that meets the base qualifying criteria and presents the least bid.

## Special Considerations

RFQs are not public declarations. Since the requesting company sends RFQs just to businesses that it trusts, it doesn't have to prepare extended [procurement](/procurement) documentation. Likewise, dissimilar to a public solicitation, a company can get back just the number of bids that it requested, which likewise saves time.

Utilizing a RFQ reduces the amount of time expected to get goods or services. It likewise offers a degree of security as a company will receive bids just from vendors it likes. Then again, on the grounds that RFQs reduce the amount of competition, a company might miss getting the most minimal accessible price or learning about new excellent vendors.

At the point when a company receives a quote in response to a RFQ, it's anything but an offer nor a binding contract. The specialist will offer the job to its picked vendor by sending it a purchase order, which, in effect, is a contract determining the terms and conditions of the work. At the point when a vendor acknowledges and signs the purchase order, the contract starts.
