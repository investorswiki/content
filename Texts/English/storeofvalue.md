# Store Of Value

The term store of value is utilized to depict the property of an asset that can keep away from depreciation over a long period of time. So to be viewed as a store of value, an asset ought to have its value either stable or increase over the long haul - yet never decreasing.
A decent store of value will enable its owner to sell or exchange it on a future date for a comparative or higher value than it was initially bought. Typically, this value is connected with the asset's market price or purchasing power (monetary value). Yet, at times, it might likewise be connected with the asset's [liquidity](/liquidity) (i.e., that it is so natural to buy and sell it).
Most [fiat currencies](/fiatmoney) have a long story of declining purchasing power brought about by inflation (for the most part due to a fast increase in the [circulating supply](/circulating-supply) of that currency). Be that as it may, in spite of the effects of inflation, money is viewed as by numerous financial specialists as a primary illustration of a store of value. The justification behind that is potentially due to its purchasing power, which changes at an extremely sluggish pace. Additionally, money is probable the most liquid financial instrument we presently have. In any case, expressing that money is a decent store of value is very dubious. Generally in light of the fact that inflation and hyperinflation are consistently causing depreciation.
Gold, silver, and other precious metals are likewise viewed as great as a store of value, predominantly due to their scarcity (limited supply). Additionally due to their ability to be stored for extremely long periods, without getting genuinely disintegrated.
[Bitcoin](/bitcoin) is likewise viewed as by some as a decent store of value and is frequently portrayed as a "digital gold." Bitcoin is scant and indestructible. A digital form of money can't be replicated or spent two times (double spending). These are a portion of the primary justifications for why Bitcoin will in general get more valuable over the long run. But since of its high volatility and unstable market price, some contend that Bitcoin isn't a store of value by definition.
