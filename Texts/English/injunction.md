# Injunction
## What Is an Injunction?

An injunction is a court order requiring a person or entity to either cease doing or, in all likelihood begin doing some specific action.

There are three primary types of injunction: transitory limiting orders, preliminary injunctions, and permanent injunctions.

## Figuring out Injunctions

Controlling orders and preliminary injunctions are normally issued from the get-go in a legal action when the court concurs that doing so may forestall unsafe actions committed by a respondent later on. Controlling orders, for example, are frequently used to keep a respondent from having contact with an offended party. Preliminary and permanent injunctions are issued in view of evidence that is introduced by an offended party in a civil case.

An illustration of a preliminary injunction may be the point at which a married couple possesses a business and is going through a divorce. Maybe there is a dispute regarding who claims or controls the business and its assets. In the event that the spouse attempted to pursue unilateral business choices, the wife could file for a brief injunction to keep certain business activities from occurring until the court has concluded the ownership issue.

Injunctions are likewise utilized by a court when monetary restitution isn't adequate to cure the mischief. For instance, as well as making a financial [judgment](/judgment) against a litigant, a court could issue a permanent injunction ordering that the respondent doesn't partake in a certain activity or business.

## Getting an Injunction

To be conceded a transitory injunction, an offended party normally needs to show the court that they have a probability of swaying the merits of their case, that potential injury might be incurred on the off chance that the injunction isn't allowed, that the potential injury offsets anything damage the injunction might cause the contradicting party, and that the benefit or mischief to the gatherings is equitable.

To be conceded a permanent injunction, the offended party should exhibit that they have experienced a hopeless injury, that monetary damages alone are not adequate, that the order is justified thinking about that balance of difficulties between the gatherings, and that the order wouldn't hurt the public interest.

## Model: Cease and Desist

A [cease and desist order](/cease-and-desist) places an injunction on a company or person denying the activities that are considered suspect. A cease-and-desist order might appear as a transitory injunction until a trial can be held to decide the outcome or a permanent injunction after the trial finishes up.

Whether transitory or permanent, a cease and desist order is legally binding. Such an order is issued by a government agency or court when it has been persuaded that there is motivation to accept an illegal or destructive activity is occurring requiring the wrongdoer to stop the activity. Further action, like a trial, might be required, or the order might be permanent, contingent upon the situation.
