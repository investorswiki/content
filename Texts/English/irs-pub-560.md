## Understanding IRS Publication 560: Retirement Plans for Small Business (SEP, SIMPLE, and Qualified Plans)

IRS Publication 560: Retirement Plans for Small Business (SEP, SIMPLE, and Qualified Plans) is a document distributed every year by the [Internal Revenue Service](/irs) specifying data for business owners who wish to set up retirement plans for them as well as their employees.

Publication 560 outlines four primary employer retirement plans, including SEP plans, SIMPLE plans, and two types of qualified plans: defined-contribution and defined-benefit.

- [SEP plans](/sep) give a simplified method to employers to make contributions to a retirement plan for themselves as well as employees. As opposed to setting up a profit-sharing or money purchase plan with a trust, an employer might embrace a SEP agreement and make contributions straightforwardly to a traditional IRA or a traditional individual retirement annuity (SEP-IRA) set up for them and each eligible employee.
- [SIMPLE plans](/simple) are available to companies with 100 or less employees who received no less than $5,000 in compensation in a given year. In such cases, an employer might set up a SIMPLE IRA plan under which employees can make salary reduction contributions straightforwardly from their checks. Employers are then able to contribute matching or nonelective contributions. The two types of SIMPLE plans are the SIMPLE IRA plan and the SIMPLE 401(k) plan.
- Qualified plans, which are more complex than SEP and SIMPLE plans, carry several benefits, remembering increased flexibility for planning plans and, at times, increased contribution and deduction limits. [Qualified defined-contribution plans](/definedcontributionplan) are defined as plans in which the amount the employee contributes every period is fixed and foreordained, and the return will be dependent on many factors, including the performance of the investments. [Qualified defined-benefit plans](/definedbenefitpensionplan), then again, guarantee a specific payout to beneficiaries toward the finish of the policy.
