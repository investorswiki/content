# Maturity Date
## What is a maturity date?
The maturity date alludes to the date when an investment, like a certificate of deposit (CD) or bond, becomes due and is repaid to the investor. By then, the investment stops paying interest and investors can recover accumulated interest and their capital without penalty.
## More profound definition
A certificate of deposit (CD) is a debt instrument utilized by banks to fund-raise. Key qualities of a CD are:
- **Maturity date** — A CD has a fixed maturity date that can shift from one month through to five years.
- **Interest rate** — Interest gathers at an annual rate of interest that is fixed at the date of purchase.
- **Interest payments** — Depending on the CD, interest might collect and be paid out on the maturity date, or it tends to be paid out periodically on a month to month, quarterly or annual basis.
- **Early withdrawal** — It's feasible to withdraw capital before the maturity date, however as a rule an early withdrawal penalty is applied.

A CD is viewed as a safe investment and is an optimal method for putting away money for a while earning interest. The interest earned on a CD is higher than the interest you can earn on savings accounts. The longer the term of the CD, the higher the interest you will earn on it.
At the point when a CD is going to mature, your bank will tell you and furnish you with the option to recover your money or to roll it over into another CD.
The term maturity date is likewise applied to corporate and Treasury bonds. These operate likewise to CDs, with one important exception. You can't draw your money out ahead of schedule. You need to trust that the bond will mature.
