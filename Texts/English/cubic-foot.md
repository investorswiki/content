# Cubic Foot
A common measure of gas volume, this alludes to the amount of gas expected to fill a volume of one cubic foot at a pressure of 14.73 pounds per square inch at 60 degrees Fahrenheit. Producers will frequently declare views as in "McF," thousand cubic feet, "BcF," or "TcF." If a producer reports finds or reserves of "trillion" cubic feet, it's a ton!
