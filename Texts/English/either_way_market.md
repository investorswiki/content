# Either-Way Market
## What Is an Either-Way Market?

An either-way market alludes to situations where there has all the earmarks of being a generally equivalent chance for a market to go up as there is for the market to drop down. Either-way markets are transitory situations and can allude to the market as a whole or individual investments like stocks.

During these types of market conditions, traders will search for apparatuses or [trading strategies](/trading-strategy) that will assist them with knowing what direction the either-way market will ultimately head. These devices can assist traders with positioning themselves in advance of the move with the ultimate goal of making a beneficial trade. Quite, technical patterns frequently can assist traders and investors with impairing what direction the market might move next.

## Understanding an Either-Way Market

An either-way market generally depicts [sideways price action](/sidewaystrend) or consolidation. Express shares of a publicly traded company, which had been moving generally vertically for quite some time, presently move sideways for around eight months. This sideways movement makes what has all the earmarks of being an either-way market, in what shares can break out either to the upside or downside.

Generally, the more extended the period of [consolidation](/consolidation), the greater movement potential technical analysts see once the stock in the end breaks out from the sideways pattern. Some allude to this sideways movement as a "coiled spring." When a similar type of pattern shows up for the whole market, rather than an individual stock, it's known as a [coiled market](/coiledmarket).

### Elliott Wave Analysis

Numerous traders use Elliott Wave Theory analysis and other technical indicators to assist with measuring the probability an either-way market breaks to the upside or downside. Developed by Ralph Nelson Elliott in the late 1930s, the Elliott Wave Theory separates tedious patterns in the market into more modest patterns called waves. By breaking down the wave count, Elliott closed a trader could accurately foresee the movement of the stock market.

> In the Elliott Wave Theory, the "5-3 move" alludes to a pattern of five waves that move toward the principal trend followed by three corrective waves.

## Triangles Help Handicap an Either-Way Market

Likewise, technical analysts frequently search for supposed [triangle consolidation patterns](/triangle), in which a stock's trading range becomes narrower and narrower after some time as the stock's pattern generally moves sideways. The triangle's trading range in the end turns out to be limited to such an extent that the stock must either break out or break down.

Triangles generally are viewed as continuation patterns since they normally bring about a return to the overarching trend. For instance, a stock that previously was in an uptrend will in general break out from a triangle pattern.

Most outstandingly, a [symmetrical triangle](/symmetricaltriangle) is the point at which the series of market lows narrows at generally similar rate as market highs. Drawing upper and lower trendlines brings about a symmetrical shape, with the meeting point of those trendlines setting a schedule for a possible [breakout](/breakout) or breakdown. Traders basically "flip" the triangle from its most extensive point to decide a price target to the upside or downside, contingent upon the heading of the market's previous winning trend.

For instance, say a [stock in an uptrend](/uptrend) started to form a triangle pattern north of several months, with the high of the triangle at $12 a share, and the low of the pattern at $8 a share. The trading range keeps on narrowing toward $10 a share before it at last breaks to the upside. The price target using this pattern would be $14, or the width of the most stretched out point in the triangle from the breakout point.
