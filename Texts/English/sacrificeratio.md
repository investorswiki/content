# Sacrifice Ratio in Economics
## What Is the Sacrifice Ratio?

The sacrifice ratio is an economic ratio that measures the effect of rising and falling [inflation](/inflation) on a country's total [production ](/productivity)and output. Costs are associated with the easing back of economic output in response to a drop in [inflation](/inflation). At the point when prices fall, companies are less boosted to create goods and may cut back on production. The ratio measures the loss in output per each 1% change in inflation. By looking at a country's historic sacrifice ratios through time, an overseeing body can foresee what effect their fiscal policies will have on the country's output.

## Figuring out the Sacrifice Ratio

A country's historic sacrifice ratios can be utilized to direct policymaking. An analysis of the ratio would show how the country could answer assuming the level of inflation changes by 1%. A higher level of inflation is many times brought about by strong economic growth. For instance, in the event that aggregate demand extends quicker than aggregate supply in an economy, the outcome is higher inflation. In the event that an economy is facing inflation, central banks have tools they can use to slow [economic growth](/economicgrowth) in a bid to reduce inflationary tensions.

Raising interest rates to curb spending and increase the savings rate is one of these tools. Notwithstanding, the possible reduction in output in response to falling prices might help the economy in the [short term](/shortterm) to reduce inflation likewise, and the sacrifice ratio measures that cost. The sacrifice ratio is calculated by taking the cost of lost production and partitioning it by the percentage change in inflation.

**Sacrifice Ratio = Dollar Cost of Production Losses/Percentage Change in Inflation**

## Illustration of Sacrifice Ratio

The inflation rate in an economy has diminished from 10 to 5% more than three years at the cost of output 11%, 9%, and 5% for every year, giving a total loss of 25%.

Total loss of GDP = 25% (11 + 9 + 5)%

Decline in Inflation Rate = 5% (10 - 5)%

Sacrifice Ratio = 25/5 = 5

That gives a ratio of 5:1.

## The Sacrifice Ratio and Fiscal Policy

Disinflations, or an impermanent easing back of prices, are major reasons for recessions in modern economies. In the United States, for instance, recessions happened in the mid 1970s, mid-1970s, and mid 1980s. Every one of these downturns happened simultaneously as falling inflation because of tight monetary policy. In this manner, to stay away from a recession, the government needs to track down the least costly method for diminishing inflation.

The sacrifice ratio shows how much output is lost when inflation goes down by 1%. This helps [central banks](/centralbank) to set their monetary policies, contingent upon whether they need to support or dial back the economy. For instance, if [inflation](/inflation) is getting too high, the central bank can utilize the sacrifice ratio to determine what moves to make and at what level to influence output in the economy basically cost.

## Highlights
- The sacrifice ratio can be viewed as the cost of fighting inflation.
- The sacrifice ratio is an economic measure of the effect of inflation on a country's total production and output.
- Analysis of historic sacrifice ratios over the long run for an economy can show what effect a specific policy will have on a country's output.
