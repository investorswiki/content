## What Is Bank Capital?

Bank capital is the difference between a bank's assets and its liabilities, and it addresses the net worth of the bank or its equity value to investors. The asset portion of a bank's capital includes cash, [government securities](/governmentsecurity), and interest-earning loans (e.g., mortgages, letters of credit, and inter-bank loans). The liabilities section of a bank's capital includes credit misfortune reserves and any debt it owes. A bank's capital can be considered the margin to which [creditors](/creditor) are covered in the event that the bank would [liquidate](/liquidate) its assets.

## How Bank Capital Works

Bank capital addresses the value of a bank's equity instruments that can retain losses and have the most minimal priority in payments assuming the bank liquidates. While bank capital can be defined as the difference between a bank's assets and liabilities, national specialists have their own definition of [regulatory capital](/capitalrequirement).

The main banking regulatory system comprises of international standards authorized by the [Basel Committee on Banking Supervision](/baselcommittee) through international accords of Basel I, Basel II, and Basel III. These standards give a definition of the regulatory bank capital that market and banking regulators closely monitor.

Since banks serve an important job in the economy by collecting savings and channeling them to useful purposes through loans, the banking industry and the definition of bank capital are vigorously regulated. While every country can have its own requirements, the latest international banking regulatory accord of Basel III gives a system to defining regulatory bank capital.

## Regulatory Capital Classifications

According to Basel III, regulatory bank capital is separated into tiers. These are based on subordination and a bank's ability to ingest losses with a sharp distinction of capital instruments when it is as yet dissolvable versus after it fails. [Common equity tier 1](/common-equity-tier-1-cet1) (CET1) includes the [book value](/bookvalue) of common shares, paid-in capital, and [retained earnings](/retainedearnings) less [goodwill](/goodwill) and some other intangibles. Instruments within CET1 must have the highest subordination and no maturity.

### Tier 1 Capital

[Tier 1 capital](/tier1capital) includes CET1 plus different instruments that are subordinated to [subordinated debt](/subordinateddebt), and have no fixed maturity, no embedded incentive for redemption, and for which a bank can cancel dividends or coupons whenever. Tier 1 capital comprises of shareholders' equity and retained earnings. Tier 1 capital is intended to measure a bank's [financial health](/financial-wellbeing) and is utilized when a bank must ingest losses consistently business operations.

> According to a controller's point of view, bank capital (and Tier 1 capital specifically) is the core measure of the financial strength of a bank.

Tier 1 capital is the primary funding source of the bank. Ordinarily, it holds essentially the bank's all's accumulated funds. These funds are created explicitly to support banks when losses are absorbed with the goal that customary business capabilities don't need to be closed down.

Under Basel III, the minimum tier 1 capital ratio is 8.5%, which is calculated by dividing the bank's tier 1 capital by its total risk-based assets. For instance, assume there is a bank with tier 1 capital of $176.263 billion and risk-weighted assets worth $1.243 trillion. The bank's tier 1 capital ratio for the period was $176.263 billion/$1.243 trillion = 14.18%, which meets the minimum Basel III requirement of tier 1 capital of 8.5% and the total capital ratio of 10.5%.

### Tier 2 Capital

[Tier 2 capital](/tier2capital) comprises of [unsecured](/unsecureddebt) subordinated debt and its stock surplus with an original maturity of less than five years minus investments in non-united financial institution auxiliaries under particular conditions. The total regulatory capital is equivalent to the sum of Tier 1 and Tier 2 capital.

Tier 2 capital includes revaluation reserves, hybrid capital instruments, subordinated term debt, general [loan-misfortune reserves](/loanlossprovision), and undisclosed reserves. Tier 2 capital is advantageous capital since it is less dependable than tier 1 capital. Tier 2 capital is viewed as less solid than Tier 1 capital since it is more hard to precisely compute and is made out of assets that are more challenging to [liquidate](/liquidate).

Under Basel III, the minimum total capital ratio is 10.5%, there is definitely not a predetermined requirement for tier 2 capital.

## Book Value of Shareholders' Equity

The bank capital can be considered the book value of [shareholders' equity](/shareholdersequity) on a bank's balance sheet. Since many banks revalue their financial assets more frequently than companies in different industries that hold fixed assets at a historical cost, shareholders' equity can act as a reasonable proxy for the bank capital.

Ordinary things highlighted in the book value of shareholders' equity include preferred equity, [common stock](/commonstock), [paid-in capital](/paidincapital), retained earnings, and accumulated exhaustive income. The book value of shareholders' equity is likewise calculated as the difference between a bank's assets and liabilities.
