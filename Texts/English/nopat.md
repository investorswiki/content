# Net Operating Profit After Tax (NOPAT)
## What Is Net Operating Profit After Tax?

Net operating profit after tax (NOPAT) is a company's potential cash earnings in the event that its capitalization were unleveraged — that is, in the event that it had no debt. The figure does exclude one-time losses or charges; these don't give a true representation of a company's true profitability. A portion of these charges might incorporate charges connecting with a merger or acquisition, which, whenever considered, don't be guaranteed to show an accurate image of the company's operations even however they might influence the company's primary concern that year.

Analysts take a gander at a wide range of measures of performance while evaluating a company as an investment. The most generally utilized measures of performance are sales and net income growth. Sales give a top-line measure of performance, yet they don't address operating proficiency. Net income incorporates operating expenses yet additionally incorporates tax savings from debt.

## NOPAT Example

For instance, assuming that EBIT is $10,000 and the tax rate is 30%, the net operating profit after tax is 0.7, which equals $7,000 (calculation: $10,000 x (1 - 0.3)). This is an estimation of after-tax cash flows without the tax advantage of debt. Note that on the off chance that a company doesn't have debt, net operating profit after tax is equivalent to net income after tax. While computing net operating profit after tax, analysts like to compare against comparative companies in a similar industry, since certain industries have higher or lower costs than others.

## Special Considerations

As well as furnishing analysts with a measure of core operating productivity without the influence of debt, mergers, and acquisitions analysts utilize net operating profit after tax. They utilize this to [calculate free cash flow to firm (FCFF)](/freecashflowfirm), which equals net operating profit after tax, minus changes in working capital. They additionally use it in the calculation of economic free cash flow to firm (FCFF), which equals net operating profit after tax minus capital. Both are principally utilized by analysts searching for acquisition targets since the acquirer's financing will supplant the current financing arrangement. One more method for ascertaining net operating profit after tax is net income plus net after-tax interest expense (or net income plus net interest expense) duplicated by 1, minus the tax rate.
