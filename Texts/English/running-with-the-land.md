# Running With the Land
## What Is Running With the Land?

"Running with the land" alludes to the rights and [covenants](/covenant) in a real estate [deed](/deed) that stay with the land paying little heed to ownership. At the point when rights and covenants run with the land when the property changes hands. The rights are tied to the property (land) and not to the owner and move from one deed to another as the land is transferred starting with one owner then onto the next.

## Grasping Running With the Land

There are two types of covenants that are said to run with the land: affirmative and restrictive. An affirmative covenant sets out something that the property owners are committed to do while a restrictive covenant frames something that the property owners must forgo doing. Owners are depicted as "burdened" by affirmative covenants and they must "authorize" restrictive covenants.

An illustration of an affirmative covenant that would run with the land is one that requires all homes on the land to be essentially a predetermined square film. An illustration of a restrictive covenant that would run with the land may be that no domesticated animals is permitted on the property. Covenants that run with the land are planned to direct orderly land development.

The granting of rights under easements, where an owner permits a party to involve a piece of their property here and there, regularly doesn't transfer. A [appurtenant](/appurtenance) easement can be granted in certain conditions permitting those rights to run with the land.

For instance, assuming the owner of a real estate parcel found an oil deposit on their property, they could grant drilling rights to an oil company that owned an adjoining real estate parcel. Assuming the property owner later sells their land, the drilling rights granted to the oil company would run with the land.

Appurtenant easements are normally just legal when granted by a property owner to the owner of a contiguous property.

## Running With the Land Rights With Easements and Privity

The enforcement or burden of covenants that run with the land can be administered by terms of privity and can become possibly the most important factor with certain [easements](/easement).

There are cases wherein adjoining lands held by various owners lay out covenants that run with the land. This generally is the case when an owner with two contiguous bits of property offers one bundle to another owner. The original owner might come to an agreement with the new owner of the second package regarding how the land can be utilized from here on out. Such a relationship is called horizontal [privity](/privity), and the agreed-upon covenants would likewise run with the land for future owners of the subsequent package.

In a comparable model, on the off chance that the owner of two neighboring properties leased one package to a tenant and they agreed upon rights and covenants in regards to its use, this would likewise comprise horizontal privity. The covenants they lay out would again run with the land for the subsequent bundle.

For estates and property that is inherited or passed down straightforwardly to new owners, this is known as vertical privity. Covenants laid out by the prior owner could run with the land upon transfer to future owners.
