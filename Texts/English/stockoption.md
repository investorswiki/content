## What Is a Stock Option?

A stock option gives an investor the right, yet not the obligation, to buy or sell a stock at a settled upon price and date. There are two types of options: [puts](/putoption), which is a wagered that a stock will fall, or [calls](/calloption), which is a wagered that a stock will rise. Since it has shares of stock (or a stock index) as its underlying asset, stock options are a form of [equity derivative](/equity_derivative) and might be called equity options.

[Employee stock options](/eso) (ESOs) are a type of equity compensation given by companies to certain employees or executives that successfully amount to call options.

## Figuring out Stock Options

Options are a type of [financial instrument](/financialinstrument) known as a [derivative](/derivative) â€” their worth depends on or derived from, the value of an underlying security or asset. On account of stock options, that asset is shares of a company's stock. Basically, the option is a contract, an agreement between two gatherings to sell/buy the stock; the option contract marks the calendar of the transaction (normally a couple of months into the future) and the price.

At the point when a contract is written, it decides the price that the underlying stock must arrive at to be "[in the money](/inthemoney)", known as the strike price. An option's not entirely set in stone by the difference between the underlying stock price and the[ strike price](/strikeprice) (exercise price).

Stock options come in two fundamental categories:

- Call options permit the holder to **buy** the asset at a stated price inside a specific time span.
- Put options permit the holder to **sell** the asset at a stated price inside a specific time span.

### Styles

There are two distinct styles of options: [American](/americanoption) and [European](/europeanoption). American options can be exercised whenever between the purchase and expiration date. European options, which are more uncommon, must be exercised on the expiration date.

### Expiration Date

Options don't just permit a trader to wager on a stock rising or falling yet in addition empower the trader to pick a specific date when they anticipate that the stock should rise or fall. This is known as the [expiration date](/expiration-date). The expiration date is important in light of the fact that it assists traders with pricing the value of the put and the call, which is known as the [time value](/timevalue), and is utilized in different option pricing models.

### Strike Price

The strike price decides if an option ought to be exercised. It is the price that a trader anticipates that the stock should be above or below by the expiration date. In the event that a trader is betting that International Business Machine Corp. (IBM) will rise from here on out, they could buy a call for a specific month and a specific strike price. For instance, a trader is betting that IBM's stock will rise above $150 by the middle of January. They may then buy a January $150 call.

### Contract Size

Contracts address a specific number of underlying shares that a trader might be hoping to buy. One contract is equivalent to 100 shares of the underlying stock. Utilizing the previous model, a trader chooses to buy five call contracts. Presently the trader would possess five January $150 calls.

On the off chance that the stock rises above $150 by the expiration date, the trader would have the option to exercise or buy 500 shares of IBM's stock at $150, no matter what the current stock price. In the event that the stock is worth under $150, the options will lapse worthless, and the trader would lose the whole amount spent to buy the options, otherwise called the premium.

### Premium

The [premium](/option-premium) is the price paid for an option, not entirely settled by taking the price of the call and increasing it by the number of contracts bought, then, at that point, duplicating it by 100. In the model, on the off chance that a trader buys five January IBM $150 Calls for $1 per contract, the trader would spend $500. Notwithstanding, if a trader wanted to risk everything would fall they would buy the puts.

## Trading Stock Options

Options can likewise be sold relying upon the strategy a trader is utilizing. Continuing with the model above, in the event that a trader thinks IBM shares are ready to rise, they can buy the call, or they can likewise decide to sell or compose the put. In this case, the seller of the put wouldn't pay a premium yet would receive the premium. A seller of five IBM January $150 puts would receive $500.

Should the stock trade above $150, the option would lapse worthless permitting the seller of the put to keep the entirety of the premium. Be that as it may, should the stock close below the strike price, the seller would need to buy the underlying stock at the strike price of $150. Assuming that occurs, it would make a loss of the premium and extra capital, since the trader presently possesses the stock at $150 per share, regardless of it trading at lower levels.

## Illustration of Stock Options

In the model below, a trader trusts Nvidia Corp's (NVDA) stock will rise in the future to more than $170. They choose to buy 10 January $170 calls which trade at a price of $16.10 per contract. It would bring about the trader spending $16,100 to purchase the calls. Be that as it may, for the trader to earn a profit, the stock would have to rise over the strike price and the cost of the calls, or $186.10. Should the stock not rise above $170, the options would terminate worthless, and the trader would lose the whole premium.

Also, if the trader needs to wager that Nvidia will fall from now on, they could buy 10 January $120 Puts for $11.70 per contract. It would cost the trader a total of $11,700. For the trader to earn a profit the stock would have to fall below $108.30. Should the stock close above $120 the options would terminate worthless, bringing about loss of the premium.
