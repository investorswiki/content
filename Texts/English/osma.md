# Oscillator of a Moving Average (OsMA)
## What Is the Oscillator of a Moving Average (OsMA)?

OsMA is a truncation for the term oscillator of a [moving average](/movingaverage) (MA). The OsMA is a technical indicator that shows the difference between an oscillator and its moving average over a given period of time.

The [MACD](/macd) is the most common oscillator utilized in the OsMA indicator, albeit any oscillator can be utilized. The MACD has an implicit moving average, which is the [signal line](/signal_line). The signal line is an average of the MACD line. The OsMA is the difference or space between these two lines, normally drawn as a histogram. It can give trend confirmation as well as could be expected trade signals.

### Step by step instructions to Calculate the Oscillator of a Moving Average
1. Select an oscillator and the time span it will be founded on.
1. Select a moving average type and the number of periods in the MA.
1. Ascertain the oscillator value and afterward compute the MA of the oscillator. Since moving averages are an average of different values, compute however many oscillator values depending on the situation before ascertaining the MA. For instance, on the off chance that you select a nine-period [simple moving average](/sma) (SMA) of the oscillator, then you will require something like nine oscillator values before the SMA can be calculated.
1. Take the difference between the oscillator and the MA to get the OsMA perusing. This can be a positive or negative number.
1. Repeat steps and three and four as each time span closes.

## What Does the Oscillator of a Moving Average (OsMA) Tell You?

The OsMA is a valuable [indicator](/indicator) of trends and trend strength. Values over zero, particularly a number of periods over zero, assist with affirming rising prices. Values below zero, particularly a number of periods straight below zero, assist with affirming falling prices.

[Crossovers ](/crossover)of the zero line can likewise be important. A zero-line crossover happens when the oscillator crosses above or below its MA. On the off chance that the oscillator value dips under the MA value, the OsMA will record a negative value and shows the price is dropping. In the event that the oscillator transcends the MA the OsMA will be positive and signals the price is rising.

Crossovers may give a periodic decent trade that gets a major price move, however crossovers can likewise create heaps of terrible trades when the price is choppy and the OsMA shudders to and fro among positive and negative values. In the case of utilizing crossovers, it is better to be particular, for example, just taking crossovers that line up with a more extended term uptrend in view of price action or another indicator. As the price is rising, consider buying when the OsMA falls below the zero line and afterward moves back above it. During a downtrend, consider [short trades](/short) when the OsMA transcends the zero line and afterward dips under it. This will not thoroughly take out the poor signals yet it will dispose of some and will aid in trading toward the trend.

High values (relative to prior readings) on the OsMA show an exceptionally strong uptrend since the quicker moving oscillator line is moving endlessly further away from the slower moving MA. Low values mean the price is falling quickly since the quicker moving oscillator is dropping rapidly relative to the slower-moving MA.

Such high and low readings are subjective however, as a perusing that is too high or low could show that the market is close to an extreme and is due for basically a short-term correction in the other heading. Taking a gander at the past can uncover extreme on the OsMA. Mark prior high and low points on the OsMA where the price switched. These levels may be applicable in the future once more, albeit not dependably.

## The Difference Between the Oscillator of a Moving Average (OsMA) and the Stochastic Oscillator

The[ stochastic oscillator](/stochasticoscillator) indicator is a type of oscillator. Thusly, working out an OsMA could be utilized. Like the MACD, the stochastic generally has a moving average applied to it. In this case, it is called %D, and it's a three-period SMA of the stochastic (%K). To ascertain the OsMA of the stochastic oscillator, take the difference among %K and %D.

## The Limitations of Using an Oscillator of a Moving Average (OsMA)

The OsMA is a [lagging indicator](/laggingindicator). That means that it will at times give information that is obsolete. For instance, a positive crossover over zero may happen yet the price has proactively climbed substantially and hence may at this point not be a decent candidate. Likewise, the OsMA may show a strong price uptrend with positive values, however the price might in any case pointedly fall. The indicator may be slow to decline or cross below zero, even however the price has fallen substantially as of now.

[False crossovers](/false-signal) are likewise a common problem, particularly when the price is choppily moving. The OsMA will move rapidly above and below zero, giving little understanding past affirming that price action is choppy and trendless.

## Highlights
- Any oscillator and any moving average (MA) of making an OsMA can be utilized.
- At the point when the OsMA goes from negative to positive that may show an uptrend is starting.; When the OsMA goes from positive to negative that may demonstrate a downtrend is starting.
- Generally, when the OsMA is positive it affirms a price uptrend, and when negative affirms a downtrend in price.
- MAs (of an oscillator) move slower than the oscillator. Along these lines, a rising OsMA is bullish as prices are rising as well as the other way around.
- The OsMA is a combination of an oscillator and a moving average of that oscillator. It measures the distance between these two values.
