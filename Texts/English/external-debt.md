## Figuring out External Debt

A [debt crisis](/european-sovereign-debt-crisis) can happen in the event that a country with a weak economy can't repay the outside debt due to a powerlessness to create and sell goods and make a profitable return. The [International Monetary Fund](/imf) (IMF) is one of the agencies that monitors countries' outer debt. [The World Bank](/worldbank) distributes a quarterly report on outside debt statistics.

On the off chance that a nation is unable or won't repay its outer debt, it is said to be in [sovereign default](/sovereign-default). This can lead to the lenders withholding future releases of assets that may be required by the borrowing nation. Such occurrences can make a rolling difference. The borrower's currency might collapse, and the nation's overall economic growth will slow down.

The conditions of [default ](/default2)can make it trying for a country to repay what it owes plus any punishments the lender has brought against the delinquent nation.

Outer debt, particularly tied loans, may be set for specific purposes that are defined by the borrower and lender. Such financial aid could be utilized to address philanthropic or disaster needs.

On the off chance that a country needs to build up its energy infrastructure, it could leverage outer debt as part of an agreement to buy resources, for example, the materials to develop power plants in underserved areas.
