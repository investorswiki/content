# Sharding
## What Is Sharding?

Sharding is a database parceling technique utilized by [blockchain](/blockchain) companies with the purpose of scalability, empowering them to handle more transactions each second. Sharding splits a blockchain organization's whole network into more modest parcels, known as "shards." Each shard is included its own data, making it particular and independent when compared to different shards.

Sharding can assist with lessening the latency or gradualness of a network since it splits a blockchain network into separate shards. Be that as it may, there are some security concerns encompassing sharding in which shards can be attacked.

## Figuring out Sharding

Blockchain networks and their separate [cryptocurrencies](/cryptographic money) are acquiring in prevalence due to the widespread application of the technology, which incorporates [supply chain management](/scm) and financial transactions. As the ubiquity of blockchain develops, so too does the responsibility and transactional volume that is handled by the network. Assuming we think of a blockchain as a shared database, as an ever increasing number of data is added, the network needs to view new ways as able to deal with each of that data proficiently and rapidly, which is where sharding can help.

### Distributed Ledger

The [distributed ledger](/distributed-ledgers) of blockchain technology makes it appealing since it permits the transactions to be consensually shared across different locales and geologies. As transactions are recorded, duplicates are shipped off the shared network inside the space of seconds making public "witnesses." If one portion of the network succumbs to fraud or a malicious attack, the shared network's participants can recognize what was changed by the fraudsters since they all keep a copy of the ledger's transactions. Thus, blockchain technology and its distributed ledger system can assist with lessening fraud and limit the damage from [cyberattacks](/cybersecurity), like a hack.

### Scalability

In any case, one of the major difficulties with blockchain technology is that as extra PCs are added to the network and more transactions are handled, the network can become hindered, easing back the cycle — called latency. Latency is a hurdle to blockchain being adopted for widespread use, especially when compared to the current electronic payment systems that work rapidly and effectively. At the end of the day, [scalability](/scalability) is a test for blockchain since the networks will most likely be unable to handle the increased measures of data and transaction flow as an ever increasing number of industries take on the technology.

One of the solutions being considered for making without latency scalability is the most common way of sharding. Sharding is intended to spread out the responsibility of a network into parts, which might assist with decreasing latency and permit more transactions to be handled by the blockchain.

## How Sharding Is Accomplished

Prior to investigating how sharding is achieved inside a blockchain network, it's important to survey how data is currently stored and handled.

### Blockchain Nodes

Currently, in blockchain, every node in a network must process or handle all of the transaction volumes inside the network. Nodes in a blockchain are independent and are responsible for keeping up with and putting away every one of the data inside a decentralized network. At the end of the day, every node must store critical data, for example, account balances and transaction history. Blockchain networks were laid out so every node must handle the entirety of the operations, data, and transactions on the network.

While it guarantees a blockchain's security by putting away every transaction in the nodes as a whole, this model eases back transaction processing extensively. Slow rates for processing transactions don't look good for a future in which blockchain becomes responsible for great many transactions.

Sharding can help since it segments or spreads out the transactional responsibility from a blockchain network with the goal that each node doesn't have to handle or handle the blockchain's all's responsibility. As it were, sharding compartmentalizes the responsibility into segments or shards.

### Horizontal Partitioning

Sharding can be achieved through the horizontal apportioning of databases through division into columns. Shards, as the lines are called, are conceptualized in view of attributes. For instance, one shard may be responsible for putting away the state and transaction history for a specific type of address. Likewise, it very well may be feasible to partition shards in light of the type of digital asset stored in them. Transactions including that digital asset may be made conceivable through a combination of shards.

For instance, consider a rental [real estate](/realestate) transaction in which various shards are involved. These shards relate to different substances engaged with the transaction, from customer names to [digital keys](/private-key) designed into a smart lock that is made available to the renter upon rent payment.

### Shard Sharing

Every shard is as yet able to be shared among different shards, which keeps a key part of blockchain technology — the decentralized ledger. All in all, the ledger is as yet available to each client permitting them to see all of the ledger transactions.

## Sharding and Security

One of the central concerns in the practice that has emerged is security. However every shard is separate and just processes its own data, there is a security concern with respect to the corruption of the shards, where one shard assumes control over another shard, bringing about a loss of data or data.

In the event that we think of every shard just like own blockchain network with its verified users and data, a hacker or through a cyber attack could assume control over a shard. The attacker could then present false transactions or a malicious program.

[Ethereum](/ethereum), one of the most conspicuous blockchain companies, is on the front line of testing sharding as a potential solution to latency and scalability issues. Ethereum plans to roll out 64 new shard chains after what it calls "The Merge," happens, where the Ethereum Mainnet will "converge" with the Beacon Chain proof-of-stake system. Ethereum has battled the capability of a shard attack by randomly doling out nodes to certain shards and continually reassigning them at random stretches. This random sampling would make it hard for hackers to know when and where to corrupt a shard.

Likewise, it's important to note that sharding is still in the early testing phase of being utilized for blockchain networks. Thus, the possible issues in general and difficulties presently can't seem to be worked out.

## Features
- Security concerns encompassing sharding incorporate a hack or shard takeover, where one shard attacks another, subsequent in a loss of data.
- Sharding can further develop network latency by splitting a blockchain network into separate shards — each with its own data, separate from different shards.
- Sharding is a database dividing technique being considered by blockchain networks and being tried by Ethereum.
- The more users that blockchain networks take on, the more slow the network becomes, leading to critical latency.
