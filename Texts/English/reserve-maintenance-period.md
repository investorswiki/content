## Figuring out the Reserve Maintenance Period

The Federal Reserve has stated that it has no plans to restore reserve requirements.

The agency announced it was dispensing with the reserve requirement In a statement delivered on March 15, 2020, just as the COVID-19 pandemic was grabbing hold in the U.S. The Fed made sense of that the country's banking institutions had "developed substantial levels of capital and liquidity" in excess of the public authority's reserve numbers since the 2007-2008 financial crisis.

The action was one of several taken by the Fed to urge lenders to keep the money flowing to consumers and businesses through the COVID-19 crisis.

The agency additionally noticed that it had previously chosen to start executing an "adequate reserves system" to free up liquidity in the banking system.

### How the Reserve Maintenance Period Worked

The [Federal Reserve](/federalreservebank) set the base reserve balance requirement for each bank, basing the reserve number on the amount of business that the bank typically embraces.

The amount of the required reserve fund changed consistently. Most banks keep a portion of their reserve cash nearby in their vaults for everyday use and the rest in a regional Federal Reserve vault or at another depository institution.

To compute whether a bank was meeting its reserve requirement, the Fed utilized the average of all the finish of-day balances of that institution's master account all through the reserve maintenance period. That offered the bank the slack to fall below the required reserve on a given day without causing a penalty.

Banks keep a lot of their cash reserves offsite in accounts at regional Federal Reserve facilities or in one more bank with which it has an arrangement. Eligible correspondent banks incorporate National Credit Union Administration Central Liquidity Facilities, [Federal Home Loan Banks](/fhlb), depository institutions, or banking [Edge Act and Agreement](/edgeactcorporation) corporations with a master account at a Federal Reserve Bank.

### Monitoring the Reserve Requirements

The Federal Reserve kept a penalty-free band that permitted banks some flexibility in taking care of their cash.

Banks that kept up with their reserve balances straightforwardly at Federal Reserve banks were required to keep an average balance that is essentially equivalent to the base threshold of the band. That base is $50,000 or 10 percent of the institution's reserve balance requirement, whichever amount is greater.
