# Guaranteed Cost Premium
## What Is a Guaranteed Cost Premium?

A guaranteed cost premium is a flat fee for [insurance coverage](/insurance-coverage) that is not subject to changes based on loss experience, or the amount of loss an insured party experiences. The price is fixed and continues as before all through the policy term, paying little heed to the number of [claims](/insurance_claim) were documented and paid out inside this time span.

## How a Guaranteed Cost Premium Works

The magnificence of a guaranteed cost premium is you know precisely the amount you're required to spend for protection against financial loss and need to worry about no sudden shocks.

An individual or business purchases an insurance plan to cover a predetermined peril for a predefined period of time and is charged a flat rate as long as necessary. While pricing its policy, the insurance company considers the type of peril, the possible seriousness and frequency of claims, and the [riskiness](/risk) of the insured. There's no way other than straight ahead on this: when the [premium](/insurance-premium) has been determined, distributed, and agreed on with the policyholder, it can as of now not be adjusted or modified.

The predictable idea of guaranteed cost premiums make them especially well known among small and moderate sized businesses. These premiums are not dependent on claims made against the policy, implying that a sudden flood in demands for compensation won't lead to the insured facing rate increases during the policy period.

Fixed pricing is helpful, and small businesses benefit from this convenience while limiting their risk. In a guaranteed-cost program, all [liabilities](/obligation) and [administration costs](/managerial costs) are moved to the carrier, with the insured paying an up-front premium to cover these costs.

## Guaranteed Cost Premiums versus Loss-Sensitive Premiums

At the point when a business develops, it might need to investigate different options for financing and overseeing risk and secure greater flexibility. Loss-delicate premiums, which, not at all like guaranteed cost premiums, are subject to change based on the loss experience of the individual business, could tick this container.

This approach commonly conveys a lower up-front fee, yet in addition higher deductibles — personal costs that must be paid before insurance coverage kicks in — and variable rates. On the off chance that a company determines that it's doubtful to see high frequency or high seriousness claims, it will actually want to acknowledge greater cost savings than if it had accepted a guaranteed cost premium. Bigger businesses frequently really like to follow this path, and are additionally able to ingest higher deductibles better than smaller ones.

Guaranteed cost premiums as a rule cost more than loss-delicate premiums. Lower deductibles increase the portion of liabilities covered exclusively by the insurer, so companies that issue guaranteed cost premiums must decide in favor mindfulness and price them as needs be.

With loss-delicate premiums, then again, you generally pay for what you get, with the total cost contingent substantially on every policyholder's losses in the given time span. The insured is responsible for costs incurred up to a retention amount, and the carrier then, at that point, pays for any excess charges.
