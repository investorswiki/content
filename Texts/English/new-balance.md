## What Is a New Balance?

In consumer finance, the term "new balance" alludes to the amount owed by a [credit card](/creditcard) holder toward the finish of their billing cycle. The new balance is the sum of the previous balance and the payments made during the billing cycle, as well as any credit, purchases, balance transfers, fees, cash advances, or [interest charges](/interestrate).

The new balance is highlighted conspicuously on the month to month credit card statement, along with the cardholder's base regularly scheduled payment.

## How New Balances Work

The new balance mirrors all of the activity that occurred on a credit card during the previous month. In the event that a cardholder wishes to try not to cause any interest on their card, they ought to guarantee they pay off the new balance in full before the beginning of the next payment cycle. Any other way, interest will start accumulating in view of the unpaid amount, in light of the card's [annual percentage rate](/apr) (APR).

With APRs frequently floating around 20%, credit card debts can develop [alarmingly quickly](/compoundinterest) whenever left unpaid for a really long time. Cardholders ought to hence carefully audit their month to month statements to guarantee they are aware of their new balance. Assuming any obscure or fraudulent charges are identified, they ought to quickly illuminate their credit card issuer to guarantee that those charges are eliminated. To reduce the risk of additional damage, the credit card provider will regularly answer by dropping the existing card and giving another credit card through and through.

Staying aware of our credit cards' new balances is particularly important thinking about how common identity theft has become in recent years. Culprits of identity theft frequently utilize their casualties' credit cards to make large purchases. Assuming the casualties fail to realize that this has happened, they might end up burdened with credit card debts that they can't successfully challenge or make due.
