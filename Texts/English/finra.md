## Analysis of FINRA

FINRA faces a large part of the very type of analysis that is frequently applied to any self-regulatory organization. Pundits, for example, Senator Warren of Massachusetts and Senator Cotton of Arkansas, claim that FINRA doesn't do what's needed to safeguard investors.

Specifically, a scholarly study by Egan, Matvos, and Seru showed that there were issues with repeat wrongdoers. It found that financial advisors with past accounts of misconduct were several times bound to commit offenses later on. FINRA might have been too controlled in practicing its powers.

While members are interested in keeping the public's trust, that interest just goes up to this point. Members need to remove the most awful wrongdoers, however they don't need the focus on themselves.

For instance, positioning all members for integrity may be conceivable. Yet, that would essentially bring about half of all members being ranked as sub optimal. Obviously, self-regulatory agencies rarely rank their members.
