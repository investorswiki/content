# Option Pricing Theory
## What Is Option Pricing Theory?

Option pricing theory gauges a value of a [options contract](/optionscontract) by assigning a price, known as a premium, in light of the calculated likelihood that the contract will complete [in the money](/inthemoney) (ITM) at expiration. Basically, option pricing theory gives an evaluation of an option's fair value, which traders incorporate into their strategies.

Models used to price options account for factors, for example, current market price, [strike price](/strikeprice), volatility, interest rate, and time to expiration to value an option hypothetically. A few regularly utilized models to value options are [Black-Scholes](/blackscholes), binomial option pricing, and Monte-Carlo simulation.

## Understanding Option Pricing Theory

The primary goal of option pricing theory is to compute the likelihood that an option will be [exercised](/exercise), or be ITM, at expiration and assign a dollar value to it. The [underlying asset](/underlying-asset) price (e.g., a stock price), exercise price, volatility, interest rate, and time to expiration, which is the number of days between the calculation date and the option's exercise date, are normally utilized factors that contribution to mathematical models to infer an option's hypothetical fair value.

Options pricing theory likewise infers different risk factors or awarenesses in light of those data sources, which are known as an option's "[Greeks](/greeks)". Since market conditions are continually changing, the Greeks furnish traders with a means of deciding how sensitive a specific trade is to price variances, [volatility](/volatility) vacillations, and the progression of time.

The more extended that an investor needs to exercise the option, the greater the probability that it will be ITM and productive at [expiration](/expirationdate). This means, all else equivalent, longer-dated options are more important. Essentially, the more unpredictable the underlying asset, the greater the chances that it will lapse ITM. Higher [interest rates](/interestrate), too, ought to convert into higher option prices.

## Special Considerations

Marketable options require different valuation methods than [non-marketable](/non-marketable_securities) options. Real traded options not set in stone in the [open market](/open-market) and, similarly as with all assets, the value can contrast from a hypothetical value. In any case, having the hypothetical value permits traders to survey the probability of benefitting from trading those options.

The development of the cutting edge options market is credited to the 1973 pricing model distributed by Fischer Black and Myron Scholes. The Black-Scholes formula is utilized to determine a hypothetical price for financial instruments with a realized expiration date. Nonetheless, this isn't the main model. The Cox, Ross, and Rubinstein binomial option pricing model and [Monte-Carlo simulation](/montecarlosimulation) are likewise widely utilized.

## Utilizing the Black-Scholes Option Pricing Theory

The original Black-Scholes model required five info factors â€” the strike price of an option, the current price of the stock, time to expiration, the [risk-free rate](/risk-freerate) of return, and volatility. Direct perception of future volatility is unimaginable, so it must be estimated or implied. Accordingly, [implied volatility](/iv) isn't equivalent to historical or realized volatility.

The Black-Scholes model, one of the most profoundly respected pricing models, expects stock prices follow a [log-normal distribution](/log-normal-distribution) since asset prices can't be negative. Different suspicions made by the model are that there are no transaction costs or taxes, that the risk-free interest rate is steady for all [maturities](/maturity), that short selling of securities with the utilization of proceeds is permitted, and that there are no arbitrage opportunities without risk.

Obviously, a portion of these suspicions don't hold true all or even more often than not. For instance, the model likewise expects volatility stays consistent over the option's lifespan. This is unrealistic, and normally not the situation, since volatility vacillates with the level of [supply and demand](/law-of-supply-demand).

Alterations to options pricing models will in this manner incorporate [volatility skew](/volatility-skew), which alludes to the state of implied volatilities for options charted across the scope of strike prices for options with a similar expiration date. The subsequent shape frequently shows a skew or "grin" where the implied volatility values for options further [out of the money](/outofthemoney) (OTM) are higher than for those at the strike price nearer to the price of the underlying instrument.

Furthermore, Black-Scholes expects that the options being priced are [European style](/europeanoption), executable just at maturity. The model doesn't consider the execution of [American style](/americanoption) options, which can be exercised whenever before, and including the day of, expiration. Then again, the binomial or [trinomial models](/trinomialoptionpricingmodel) can handle the two styles of options since they can check for the option's value at each point in time during its life.

## Features
- The primary goal of option pricing theory is to work out the likelihood that an option will be exercised, or be in-the-money (ITM), at expiration.
- Expanding an option's maturity or implied volatility will increase the price of the option, holding all else steady.
- A few generally utilized models to price options incorporate the Black-Scholes model, binomial tree, and Monte-Carlo simulation method.
- Option pricing theory is a probabilistic approach to assigning a value to an options contract.
