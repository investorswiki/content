# Passive Management
As the name infers, passive management (regularly alluded to as indexing) is an investing strategy that doesn't depend on active exposure. All things being equal, it attempts to duplicate a market [index](/index), like the S&P 500 or the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA).
Basically, the thought behind passive management is that it's improbable that humans can reliably outperform the market, so they ought to fairly "oblige it," passively. This thought resounds with the efficient-market hypothesis (EMH), that suggests that current market prices as of now mirror all data accessible and that humans can't beat the market in the long-term.
So not at all like active portfolio management, passive investing doesn't rely upon subjective human choices since there are no endeavors to profit from market shortcomings. Thus, passive management doesn't depend on a select group of assets. All things being equal, the fund manager attempts to follow a market index.
The primary benefits of passive portfolio management are connected with its lower fees and operational costs, as well as decreased risks. Regularly, a passive investment strategy will build a long-term portfolio that tracks the performance of a stock market index. Investment funds that apply such a strategy are generally associated with mutual and exchange-traded funds (ETF).
Subsequently, the achievement rate of such an approach is dependent on a lot more extensive market performance, which is addressed by a specific index. Basically, this means that passive management is free from human blunder with respect to the selection of assets.
By and large, passive portfolio management strategies performed far superior to [active investing](/activemanagement), essentially in view of their lower fees. There was a developing interest in passive investing in the last many years, particularly after the 2008 financial crisis.
