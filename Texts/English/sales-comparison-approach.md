# Sales Comparison Approach (SCA)
## What Is a Sales Comparison Approach (SCA)?

The term sales comparison approach alludes to a real estate [appraisal](/appraisal) method that compares one property to comparables or other recently sold properties in the area with comparative qualities. [Real estate agents](/realestateagent) and appraisers might utilize the sales comparison approach while assessing properties to sell. This method accounts for the effect that individual elements have on the overall property value. All at the end of the day, the total value of a property is the sum of the values of its highlights.

## Understanding the Sales Comparison Approach (SCA)

The sales comparison approach helps [real estate](/realestate) professionals and purchasers determine in the event that the price of a house is fair and comparable to the current market. Professionals utilize comparative properties that were recently sold inside a short distance of the subject property — ordinarily in a similar area — that share comparative qualities as a comparison.

The SCA is utilized as the spine for the [comparative market analysis](/comparative-market-analysis) (CMA). This is an analysis of the prices of recently sold properties that are comparable and inside a similar geographic area. At the end of the day, the approach frequently involves taking a gander at nearby [properties](/property) to see what they share for all intents and purpose. From that point, appraisers can determine a value for a property in light of its highlights.

Despite the fact that there are many advances that a real estate [appraiser](/appraiser) can take in assessing a property's value, coming up next are probably the most common qualities utilized in a SCA:

- **Location and neighborhood:** Geography may straightforwardly impact the value of real estate. It's important to compare homes in a similar neighborhood as opposed to those found in one more part of town. Factors considered incorporate vicinity to schools, close by bodies of water, parks, and that they are so close to expressways and bridges, as well as pollution levels.
- **Recently sold listings:** These properties can give a starting point to the value of homes in the area. In spite of the fact that highlights and the [market](/market) factor into the sale price, evaluating property values and recent sales are great baseline numbers.
- **Features:** A home ought to be compared with properties with similar number of rooms, garages, and restrooms. The comparison ought to remember homes of about the very square footage for bundles of land that are about a similar size.
- **Age and condition:** It's important to compare homes of comparative age as well as sufficiency. A home's condition essentially impacts an appraisal. For instance, there might be two comparable homes in a similar area. In any case, assuming one is needing repair, it can truly influence its value.
- **Average price per square foot:** Once comparative homes are assembled, take every one of their sale prices and gap them by their square footage. The outcome yields the cost per square foot in light of the homes in the sales comparison analysis. Take the average cost per square foot for every single comparable home and increase that number by the square footage of the house being appraised.

## Special Considerations

There are numerous different elements that might increase the value of a home. Be that as it may, a sales comparison analysis is definitely not a precise science since the value of a house is fairly subjective, meaning one family might track down more value in it than another, in this manner expanding their offer. As stated before, outside factors, for example, the overall state of the [economy](/economy), the [job market](/job-market), and the state of the real estate market everything play intensely into how much a house is sold for or how long it sits on the market.

Yet, recall, the sales comparison approach utilized in real estate valuation is certainly not an official appraisal. In situations where a unique property is to be valued or one whose value is hard to determine, a conventional appraisal might be required. This means hiring an appraiser — an independent and unprejudiced professional who determines the property's fair value by utilizing certain realities, figures, and different contemplations.
