A chameleon option gives an investor greater flexibility in that they can trade a chameleon option as opposed to trading different [vanilla options](/vanillaoption) to achieve a similar outcome.

## Figuring out the Chameleon Option

Chameleon options are traded [over the counter](/otc) (OTC) and are in this way adaptable in light of what the buyer and seller settle on. In easiest terms, a chameleon option could be both a [call](/calloption) or [put](/put) option, contingent upon which side of the [strike price](/strikeprice) the underlying asset is on. In the event that the underlying asset is priced over the strike price it very well may be a call option, and in the event that the underlying asset's price is below the strike price, it very well may be a put option. In the event that a trader expected a large move in a stock, yet was uncertain of the course, rather than buying both a call and put they could purchase a chameleon option structured this way.

The chameleon option has given the trader basically two options in one. They have a call option if the price of the underlying ascents, and they have a put option if the underlying falls below $40.

Expecting a $45 strike vanilla option that lapses in a single month is trading for $1, and the $40 put is trading at $0.08, then, at that point, the price of the chameleon will probably be around $1.08, and perhaps somewhat less since the two players save money on transaction fees and the seller might wish to prompt the buyer to trade the chameleon rather than essentially buying a call and put assuming it is less expensive to do as such.
