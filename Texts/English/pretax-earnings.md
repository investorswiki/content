Pretax earnings is calculated by deducting a company's [operating expenses](/operating_expense) from its gross margin or revenue. Operating expenses incorporate things, for example, [depreciation](/depreciation), insurance, interest, and regulatory fines. For instance, a manufacturer with revenues of $100 million in a fiscal year might have $90 million altogether operating expenses (counting depreciation and interest expenses), excluding taxes.

For the given fiscal year (FY), the pretax earnings margin is $40,000/$500,000 = 8%.
