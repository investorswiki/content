# Rule 147
## What Is Rule 147?

Rule 147 is a rule that can be utilized by a company to raise funds without actually enrolling with the [Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)](/sec). Otherwise called the "protected harbor" rule, it normally just applies to small companies that need to fund-raise locally without causing the costly fees associated with enlisting with the SEC.

## Understanding Rule 147

This rule applies to Section 3(a)11 of the[ Securities Act of 1933](/securitiesact1933), or the[ intrastate offering](/intrastateoffering) exemption. Accordingly, the rule is likewise called the intrastate offers and sales rule. This section is expected to permit issuers with restricted operations to sell securities as part of a plan of neighborhood financing.

To meet all requirements for exemption under Section 3(a)11, the company would need to show that:

- The issuer is a resident of the state where the offering happens and, in the event that the company is a corporation, it is in that state.
- The issuer does a substantial amount of its business in that state.
- The proceeds of the offering will be utilized inside that state.
- All the offerees and purchasers of the securities are residents of that state.
- The securities offered stop in the hands of people dwelling in that state.
- The whole issue of the securities falls under section 3(a)(11).

The rule was adopted in 1974 with the intent to give greater certainty to companies on a normal set of conditions, under which the SEC would believe issuance of securities to be exempt under Section 3(a)11. In any case, at that point, the SEC stressed that its rule was not selective; not consenting to the rule wouldn't make an assumption against a claim for exemption under Section 3(a)11. Under Rule 147, the SEC deciphered that the requirements of Section 3(a)11 had been met if:

- The company is incorporated in the state in which it is offering the securities.
- The company does a huge portion of its business in that state (which is defined as no less than 80% of its operations).
- The company must just sell the securities to people living in the state of incorporation.

## Recent Changes Made to Rule 147

In 2016, the SEC amended Rule 147 to modernize it and lay out an intrastate offering exemption known as Rule 147A. The amended rule considers offers of securities to be made accessible to out-of-state residents, as well with respect to the exemptions to apply to issuers of securities that incorporated out-of-state. In particular, the new rules permit companies to promote or offer the securities online, (for example, through [crowdfunding](/crowdfunding)) or through different media where they may be noticeable to out-of-state investors and loosen up the previous requirement that companies be incorporated in that state.

With changes to the rule came adjustments to the requirements. To meet all requirements for Rule 147 and Rule 147A, the company's officers, partners, or managers must basically direct, control, and direction the business' activities in-state. Sales of securities by the company must be limited to in-state residents or people who the company sensibly accepts are in-state residents. The company likewise must meet no less than one of the accompanying "carrying on with work" requirements:

- The company derived something like 80% of its consolidated gross incomes from the operation of a business or of real property situated in-state, or from the delivering of services in-state.
- The company had something like 80% of its consolidated assets situated in-state.
- The company plans to utilize and utilizes something like 80% of the net proceeds from the offering towards the operation of a business or of real property in-state, the purchase of real property situated in-state, or the delivering of services in-state.
- A majority of the company's employees are situated in-state.
