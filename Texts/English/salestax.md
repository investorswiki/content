## What Is a Sales Tax?

A sales tax is a consumption tax forced by the government on the sale of goods and services. A conventional sales tax is imposed at the [point of sale](/point-of-sale), collected by the retailer, and gave to the government. A business is responsible for sales taxes in a given jurisdiction on the off chance that it has a nexus there, which can be a brick-and-mortar location, an employee, an affiliate, or another presence, contingent upon the laws in that jurisdiction.

## Understanding Sales Tax

Conventional or retail sales taxes are simply charged to the [end user](/end-client) of a decent or service. Since the majority of goods in modern economies go through a number of stages of manufacturing, frequently handled by various elements, a lot of documentation is important to demonstrate who is eventually obligated for sales tax. For instance, say a sheep rancher offers fleece to a company that fabricates yarn. To try not to pay the sales tax, the yarn maker must get a resale certificate from the government saying that it isn't the end client. The yarn maker then, at that point, sells its product on to a piece of clothing maker, which must likewise get a resale certificate. At long last, the piece of clothing maker offers fuzzy socks to a retail store, which will charge the customer sales tax alongside the price of said socks.

Various jurisdictions charge various sales taxes, which frequently overlap, as when states, counties, and regions each levy their own sales taxes. Sales taxes are closely connected with [use taxes](/use-tax), which applies to residents who have purchased things from outside their jurisdiction. These are generally set at similar rate as sales taxes however are challenging to authorize, meaning they are in practice simply applied to large purchases of substantial goods. A model would be a Georgia resident who purchases a vehicle in Florida; she would be required to pay the neighborhood sales tax, like she had bought it at home.

## Nexus

Whether a business owes sales taxes to a specific government relies upon the way that government characterizes nexus. A nexus is generally defined as a physical presence, however this "presence" isn't limited to having an office or a warehouse; having an employee in a state can comprise a nexus, as can having a [affiliate](/affiliate, for example, a partner website that guides traffic to your business' page in exchange for a share of profits. This scenario is an illustration of the strains between [ecommerce](/ecommerce) and sales taxes. For instance, New York has passed "Amazon laws" requiring internet retailers like Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN) to pay sales taxes notwithstanding their lack of physical presence in the state.

## Excise Taxes

By and large, sales taxes take a percentage of the price of goods sold. For instance, a state could have a 4% sales tax, a district 2%, and a city 1.5%, so residents of that city pay 7.5% total. Frequently, in any case, certain things are exempt, like food, or exempt below a certain threshold, for example, clothing purchases of under $200. Simultaneously, a few products carry special taxes, known as [excise taxes](/excisetax). "[Sin taxes](/sin_tax)" are a form of excise tax, for example, the nearby excise tax of $1.50 New York City charges per pack of 20 cigarettes on top of the State excise tax of $4.35 per pack of 20 cigarettes.

## Value-Added Tax

The U.S. is one of a handful of the developed countries where conventional sales taxes are as yet utilized (note that, with limited special cases, not the federal government charges sales taxes, yet the states). In the vast majority of the developed world, [value-added tax (VAT)](/valueaddedtax) schemes have been adopted. These charge a percentage of the value added at each level of production of a decent. In the fuzzy sock model over, the yarn maker would pay a percentage of the difference between what they charge for yarn and what they pay for fleece; comparably, the piece of clothing maker would pay similar percentage on the difference between what they charge for socks and what they pay for yarn. Put in an unexpected way; this is a tax on the company's [gross margins](/grossmargin), as opposed to just the end client.

The fundamental objective of consolidating the VAT is to kill tax on tax (i.e., double taxation) which overflows from the manufacturing level to the consumption level. For instance, a manufacturer that makes notebooks gets the raw materials for, say $10 which incorporates a 10% tax. This means that he pays $1 in tax for $9 worth of materials. During the time spent manufacturing the notebook, he enhances the original materials of $5, for a total value of $10 + $5 = $15. The 10% tax due on the completed great will be $1.50. Under a VAT system, this extra tax can be applied against the previous tax he paid to bring his [effective tax rate](/effectivetaxrate) to $1.50 - $1.00 = $0.50.

The wholesaler purchases the notebook for $15 and offers it to the retailer at a $2.50 [markup](/markup) value for $17.50. The 10% tax on the gross value of the kindness be $1.75 which he can apply against the tax on the original cost price from the manufacturer for example $15. The wholesaler's effective tax rate will, accordingly, be $1.75 - $1.50 = $0.25. Assuming the retailer's margin is $1.50, his effective tax rate will be (10% x $19) - $1.75 = $0.15. Total tax that fountains from manufacturer to retailer will be $1 + $0.50 + $0.25 + $0.15 = $1.90.

The U.S. system with no VAT suggests that tax is paid on the value of goods and margin at each stage of the production cycle. This would mean a higher amount of total taxes paid, which is carried down to the end consumer as higher costs for goods and services.
