# Section 12D-1
## What Is Section 12D-1?

Section 12D-1, under the [Investment Company Act of 1940](/investmentcompanyact), limits investment companies from investing in each other. The rule was enacted to forestall [fund of funds](/fundsoffunds) arrangements from one fund gaining control of one more fund to benefit its investors to the detriment of the shareholders of the acquired fund. This utilization of control could come through practicing controlling power of voting shares or under the threat of enormous scope redemptions out of the acquired fund.

Congress likewise made exemptions to this rule through investing limits, which takes into consideration fund of funds arrangements as long as the limits are met. In 2018, Congress refreshed the rules with new terms under Section 12D-1, considering greater flexibility in investing. Congress has likewise proposed to execute new rules that would cancel Section 12D-1-2 and carry out another standard set of rules.

## Grasping Section 12D-1

Section 12D-1 was made with sub-rules that consider specific exemptions to the restriction of investment funds investing in one another. Section 12D-1A specifies the exemption limits in which a registered fund can invest into another fund. Section 12D-1B specifies the exemption limits in which a [open-finished fund](/open-endfund) can sell its securities to another fund.

In 2018, Congress chose to change the manner by which funds can invest in one another. They made Section 12D-1E-G, permitting different fund of funds arrangements under specific conditions, which really revoked Section 12D-1A-B. In doing as such, Congress realized it had made a system that was conflicting and inefficient. To streamline the rules, Congress has proposed to nullify 12D-1-2 and the exemption orders and to supplant them with another Section 12D-1-4.

### How the Section 12D-1 Limit Is Applied

Section 12D-1A's restrictions limits state that a fund can't:

- Secure over 3% of a registered investment company's [voting shares](/votingshares).
- Invest over 5% of its assets in a single registered company.
- Invest over 10% of its assets in registered investment companies

Section 12D-1B applies to the selling of securities by a fund and prohibits the sale in the event that it brings about the getting company possessing over 3% of the acquired fund's voting securities.

## Refreshing Section 12D-1

In 2018, Congress returned to its approach to fund of funds arrangements. During the 1960s, when the initial limits were laid out under the Investment Company Act, Congress accepted that fund of funds arrangements filled no real financial need. In the time since, they accept that the fund of funds structures have incorporated dynamics to safeguard investors as well as giving a financial purpose. Accordingly, Congress drafted new rules to permit certain designs that met certain conditions.

All section 12D-1E permits an investment fund to invest its assets into one fund. This would create the fund a vessel by which investors can access the acquired fund. Section 12D-1F permits a registered fund to take positions, up to 3% of one more fund's assets, in quite a few funds unbounded. Section 12D-1G permits a registered unconditional fund to invest in other unassuming funds that are in something similar "gathering of investment companies." Furthermore, Congress enacted section 12D-1J, which permits the [Securities and Exchange Commission](/sec) (SEC) to exempt any person, transaction, or asset from Section 12D-1-A-B.

## Revoking 12D-1-2

Related to its updates to Section 12D-1, Congress realized that the many rules and exemptions exist as an interwoven that is inefficient and just covers specific funds while excluding others with comparable characteristics. To determine the situation, Congress has proposed to revoke 12D-1-2 and supplant it with 12D-1-4, which would give a reliable structure, reduce operational costs, and open up new investment opportunities.

## Investments Allowed Under 12D-1-4

Under the proposed new standards, the rules would permit:

- A registered investment fund to gain the securities of one more registered investment fund over the limits stated in 12D-1
- An acquired fund to sell its securities to a getting fund
- An acquired fund to recover its securities in the procuring fund

At present, the type of fund of funds arrangements permitted relies totally upon the type of obtaining fund. The new rule would expand the scope of permitted funds permitted in a fund of funds arrangement and thusly increase investment opportunities for investors. The new arrangements would possibly be permitted assuming certain conditions are met in the areas of citizen control, redemption limits, fees, and avoidance of complex designs.
