# Holding Company Depository Receipt (HOLDR)
## What Was a Holding Company Depository Receipt (HOLDR)?

A holding company depository receipt (HOLDR) was a security that allowed investors to buy and sell a basket of [stocks](/stock) in a single transaction. Like [exchange-traded funds](/etf) (ETFs), HOLDRs allowed investors to trade stocks in a specific [industry](/industry), sector, or group. ETFs, be that as it may, give a more efficient and flexible structure for investors and issuers.

Subsequently, HOLDR securities were discontinued and some changed over into ETFs before the year's over 2011.

## Understanding Holding Company Depository Receipts (HOLDRs)

A holding company depository receipt (HOLDR) alluded to a fixed assortment of public stocks bundled together as one security. HOLDRs were made by [Merrill Lynch](/merrilllynch) and traded exclusively on the [New York Stock Exchange (NYSE)](/nyse). HOLDRs empowered an investor to gain exposure to a market sector for a moderately minimal price and differentiate inside that sector. To gain a similar level of diversification physically, the investor would have expected to purchase each company individually, in this manner expanding the amount paid in commissions.

HOLDRs covered a large number of sectors and industries, for example, [biotech](/biotechnology), drug, and retail, yet Merrill Lynch decided the piece of each HOLDR, and HOLDRs can fluctuate widely from one another. A key difference among HOLDRs and ETFs was that investors in HOLDRs had direct ownership in the underlying stocks, which isn't the case for ETFs, and thus investors in HOLDRs had voting and [dividend](/dividend) rights.

## ETFs and the Demise of HOLDRs

HOLDRs are frequently generalized with the likes of exchange-traded funds (ETFs), and keeping in mind that the two products share low-cost, low-turnover, and tax-efficient attributes, they are different investment vehicles. ETFs are frequently desirable over investors and meet a similar purpose as HOLDRs.

ETFs invest in indexes that contain a large number and routinely change. Conversely, a HOLDR was a static group of stocks chose from a specific industry and their parts rarely change. ETFs likewise track some form of an underlying [index](/index), though HOLDRs didn't. ETF holdings are in addition managed and occasionally adjusted to give the best return conceivable inside that index. In the event that a company was acquired and taken out from a HOLDR, its stock was not supplanted, which could bring about additional concentration and added risk.

HOLDRs were commonly bought in [round lots](/roundlot) of 100, and could be very capital-concentrated for more modest investors, in this way excluding some from participating in them. HOLDRs, be that as it may, assisted give with ascending to the prominence of ETFs, whose dominance ultimately polished off a few HOLDRs and made others be closed down and [liquidated](/sell). In December of 2011, six of the 17 excess HOLDRs were changed over into ETF structures and the leftover 11 were liquidated.

## Features
- Dissimilar to an ETF, each HOLDR addressed individual ownership in the stocks underlying the HOLDR, with the value of the HOLDR fluctuating alongside the changes in the value of the underlying stocks.
