## Bureaucracy versus Governance versus Administration

Bureaucracy isn't equivalent to [governance](/corporategovernance) or administration. A few administrative structures are not regulatory, and numerous organizations are not part of administrative structures. So what's the difference? The differentiation lies in the objectives of every system.
