# Process Value Analysis (PVA)
## What Is Process Value Analysis?

Process Value Analysis (PVA) is the examination of an internal interaction that businesses attempt to decide whether it very well may be streamlined. PVA takes a gander at what the [customer](/customer) needs and afterward inquires as to whether a step in a cycle is important to accomplish that outcome. The goal of PVA is to take out superfluous steps and expenses incurred in the [value chain](/valuechain) required to make a decent or service without forfeiting customer satisfaction. The outcome is that a decent or service might be delivered to the customer all the more quickly and at a lower cost.

## Understanding Process Value Analysis (PVA)

In conducting PVA, managers will consider whether any new advancements could be productively executed, whether errors are being made that could be stayed away from, whether there are extra steps in the process that are pointless, etc. Any steps in the process that are recognized as not adding [economic value](/economic-value) might be changed or tossed out. An interaction may over and over be inspected as new innovations arise that could make the cycle more efficient.

> A PVA expects managers to impartially investigate all areas of their operations, pinpointing those activities that don't add value and are not cost-viable.

Management can conduct PVAs to survey and assess processes in a full scope of business areas all through the company. For instance, a company could survey the processes and working of inbound [logistics](/logistics), operations, outbound logistics, marketing, sales, and customer service.

## Analysis of Process Value Analysis (PVA)

One risk of PVA is that a few critical steps in a cycle might be disposed of. Processes once in a while incorporate control points to guarantee that rules are observed. These rules might be intended to lay out [cost controls](/cost-control), shield appropriate accounting procedures, and other internal controls. Disposing of a required control point can bring about potentially negative results for the company.

For instance, in the event that a PVA zeros in too much on cutting costs, the company runs the risk of eliminating or changing a cycle that keeps the business running without a hitch. An illustration of this would be a company that chooses to [outsource](/re-appropriating) its customer service department to a third-party vendor just to find that the vendor doesn't have the labor force or skill in place to give great customer service. To forestall circumstances like this from happening, a company might hire a controls analyst to assist with supervising the PVA and to talk with the internal accounting staff and management.

## Instances of Process Value Analysis (PVA)

A few companies have embraced PVA to streamline their purchasing processes. For small purchases, they have selected to issue managers [procurement](/procurement) cards from major credit card companies. This has proved more affordable than expecting that small purchases go through the multi-step process ordinarily required for large purchases.

Companies will here and there conduct PVAs when they have made a [acquisition](/acquisition). A PVA might uncover whether the acquired company has processes that are less efficient than those of the gaining company or vice versa. A PVA can likewise assist management with boosting the [synergy](/synergy) or potential financial benefit it desires to accomplish through the consolidating of companies.

- Companies that conduct a PVA need to give goods or services to customers at a lower cost and all the more quickly.
- A Process Value Analysis (PVA) looks at each step in a specific business cycle to decide whether it very well may be improved or streamlined while as yet keeping up with customer satisfaction.
