## Special Considerations

At the point when a corporation reports its intent to get another corporation, the procuring company's stock price typically diminishes, and the target company's stock price increments. To secure the shares of the [target company](/targetfirm), the procuring firm must offer more than the current value of the shares. The securing firm's stock price declines in light of market speculation about the target firm or the price offered for the target firm.

Be that as it may, the target company's stock price typically stays below the announced acquisition price, which is intelligent of the deal's vulnerability. In an all-cash merger, [investors](/investor) generally take a [long position](/long) in the target firm.

On the off chance that a merger arbitrageur expects a merger deal to break, the arbitrageur might short shares of the target company's stock. In the event that a merger deal breaks, the target company's share price typically falls to its share price prior to the deal announcement. Mergers might break due to a large number of reasons, like regulations, financial precariousness, or unfavorable tax suggestions.

On the other hand, a [stock-for-stock](/stockforstock) merger includes the exchange of the securing company's stock for the target company's stock.

In a stock-for-stock merger, a merger arbitrageur typically purchases shares of the target company's stock while [shorting](/short) shares of the getting company's stock. Assuming the deal is in this manner completed and the target company's stock is changed over into the obtaining company's stock, the merger arbitrageur could utilize the switched stock over completely to cover the short position.

A merger arbitrageur could likewise repeat this strategy utilizing [options](/choice, for example, purchasing shares of the target company's stock while purchasing put options on the getting company's stock.
