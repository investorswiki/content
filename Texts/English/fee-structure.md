## What Is a Fee Structure?

A fee structure is a chart or rundown featuring the rates on different business services or activities. A fee structure tells customers or clients what's in store while working with a specific business. Potential customers ought to constantly inspect an organization's fee structure to ensure they track down it good before choosing to work with them.

## How Fee Structures Work

The fee structure for an online [auction](/auction) website, for instance, would list the cost to place a thing available to be purchased, the website's commission assuming that the thing is sold, the cost to display the thing all the more noticeably in the webpage's query items, etc. Fee structures with an incentive or outperformance part could energize a "swing for the walls" mentality.

## Types of Fee Structures
### Classic Fee Structure

As another model, [hedge](/hedge) fund's fee structure would show what the [fund manager](/fundmanager) charges to run the fund, how much the fund manager will receive in the event that the fund meets or surpasses predefined performance targets, and how much an investor must pay assuming that they pull out their funds rashly.

The classic fee structure for hedge funds is "2 and 20." Meaning, a fund manager charges 2% on assets under management and another 20% for profits or outperformance over some threshold. This structure would be utilized to give a base level of fees for the management of the fund (2%), plus an extra "incentive" fee that adjusts the manager and investor interest. As the hedge fund fee structure shows, incentives frequently play a central job in choosing a proper fee structure.
