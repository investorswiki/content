# Off-The-Run Treasuries
## What Are Off-The-Run Treasuries?

Off-the-run treasuries are all Treasury bonds and notes issued before the most as of late issued bond or note of a specific maturity.

Off-the-run treasuries can be contrasted with [on-the-run treasuries](/on-the-runtreasuries), which allude to the most current issues only.

## Off-The-Run Treasuries Explained

At the point when the [U.S. Treasury](/ustreasury) issues securities - Treasury notes, and bonds - it does as such through a [auction process](/dutchauction) to decide the price at which these debt instruments will be offered. In view of the offers received and the level of interest displayed for the security, the U.S. Treasury can set a price for its debt securities. The new issues introduced after the auction is closed are alluded to as on-the-run Treasuries. Once another Treasury security of any maturity is issued, the recently issued security with a similar maturity turns into the off-the-run bond or note.

For instance, if the U.S. Treasury recently issued 5-year notes in February, these notes are on-the-run and supplant the recently issued 5-year notes, which become off-the-run. In March, assuming that another batch of 5-year bonds is issued, these March notes are on-the-run Treasuries and the February notes are currently off-the-run. Etc.

## Where to Trade Off-The-Run Treasuries

While on-the-run Treasuries are available to be purchased from [Treasury Direct](/treasurydirect), off-the-run securities must be acquired from other investors through the [secondary market](/secondarymarket). At the point when Treasuries move to the secondary over-the-counter market, they become less regularly traded as investors like to go for additional liquid securities (which are a characteristic of on-the-run Treasuries). To urge investors to purchase these debt securities promptly in the market, off-the-run Treasuries are regularly more affordable and carry a somewhat greater yield.

Since off-the-run Treasuries have a higher yield and lower price than on-the-run Treasuries, there is a notable [yield spread](/yieldspread) between the two offerings. One reason for the yield spread is the concept of supply. On-the-run Treasuries are commonly issued with a fixed supply. The high demand for the limited securities pushes up their prices and, thus, brings down the yield, making a difference follow between the yields for on-the-run and off-the-run securities. In addition, off-the-run securities are generally held to maturity in an asset director's portfolio as there's very little reason to trade them. On the other hand, when portfolio managers need to shift their exposure to [interest rate risk](/interestraterisk) and find [arbitrage](/arbitrage) opportunities, they trade on-the-run Treasuries, making liquidity for these securities.

## Off-The-Run Yield Curves

Albeit on-the-run treasury yield can be utilized to construct a [interpolated yield curve](/interpolated_yield_curve), which is utilized to decide the price of debt securities, a few analysts like to utilize the yield of off-the-run Treasuries to draw the [yield curve](/yieldcurve). Off-the-run yields are utilized in situations where the demand for on-the-run Treasuries are inconsistent, thereby, causing price distortions brought about by the fluctuating current demand. By getting yield curve figures from the [off-the-run Treasury rates](/off_the_run_curve), financial analysts can guarantee that transitory fluctuations in demand don't skew the yield curve calculations or the pricing of fixed income investments.

## Highlights
- Off-the-run treasuries will quite often be fairly less liquid than on-the-run securities, despite the fact that they are still actively traded on the secondary market.
- Off-the-run treasuries allude to any Treasury security that has been issued, aside from the most up to date issue, which are called on-the-run.
- The price difference between on-the-run and off-the-run Treasuries is frequently alluded to as the liquidity premium, as the more liquid Treasuries are gotten at a higher cost.
