# Grandfathered Bond
## What Is a Grandfathered Bond?

A grandfathered bond is a classification of [bonds](/bond) issued in Europe prior to March 1, 2001, that bars payments made on these bonds from EU retention taxes. A retention tax is one that is automatically kept or paid straightforwardly to the government.

The term [grandfathered](/grandfatherclause) alludes to the way that tax laws presented after their issuance don't retroactively apply to them.

## Figuring out Grandfathered Bonds

For a bond to be classified as a grandfathered bond, it needed to have been issued before March 1, 2001, or had its prospectus certified before this date. Also, the bond must not have had any re-issues anytime after Feb. 28, 2002. The temporary period during which these bonds were not treated as debt claims ended on July 2012.

The [retention tax](/retentiontax), which became effective on July 1, 2005, when the European Union Savings Tax Directive was executed, is a withholding tax on interest payments. Basically, this tax automatically keeps probably the interest on a bond, and the ultimate amount taxed on the interest will rely upon several factors, including the singular's overall income.

This retention tax just applies to the inhabitants of a [European Union](/europeanunion) (EU) member state and furthermore covers savings accounts, fiduciary deposits, and investment funds. It doesn't influence the interest payments made to non-EU occupants and on these bonds.

These bonds were [negotiable debt](/negotiable-instrument) securities. The interest, premiums, and discounts derived from these bonds were not viewed as debt claims or savings income. Subsequently, investment in these bonds didn't count while choosing if the edges, which determine whether income from certain collective investment funds is savings income, had been passed.

## Special Considerations

Since they didn't automatically keep taxes, these bonds have been among the preferred securities utilized by [tax evaders](/taxevasion). Without a trace of additional taxation in the country of residence, tax-staying away from investors would favor bonds that are exempt from the withholding rates over bonds that are taxed or from bonds that are saved at banks in countries that give data exchange between tax specialists.

The implementation of automatic withholding by means of the retention tax was a work by the EU to stay away from tax evasion. When every one of the existing variants of these bonds come to maturity, the tax loophole that they present will never again exist.
