# Quick Ratio
## What Is the Quick (Acid Test) Ratio?
The quick ratio is a metric that offers investors and analysts a simple glance at how liquid a company is in the short term by contrasting the value of its most liquid [assets](/assets) (like cash and securities) to its short-term [liabilities](/liabilities) (like any bills or loan payments that are due in the close to term).
A ratio of at least 1 demonstrates that a company has an adequate number of liquid assets to cover its short-term debt obligations. A ratio of under 1 demonstrates that a company doesn't be guaranteed to have adequate [liquidity](/liquidity) to handle its short-term liabilities.
## What Does "Basic analysis" Mean?
The quick ratio is additionally ordinarily alluded to as the "analysis" ratio. This moniker alludes to a quick and simple test gold excavators used to use to determine regardless of whether samples of metal were true gold. Corrosive would be added to a sample; in the event that the sample started to disintegrate, it wasn't gold. Assuming that it stood up to the corrosive, it probably was.
Of course, in the world of mining, solvency means the ability to break up, which is something terrible in gold mining since metals that disintegrate in corrosive aren't gold. In finance, nonetheless, the inverse is true. Here, dissolvable means "ready to pay one's debts," so with regards to the basic analysis ratio, solvency is something worth being thankful for, and consequences of 1 or higher demonstrate solvency.
## How Is the Quick Ratio Calculated?
To compute a company's quick ratio, partition the value of its most liquid assets (i.e., those that can be changed over completely to cash in less than 90 days) by the value of its current liabilities (i.e., money that must be paid out inside the next year).
**Note:** What qualifies as "liquid assets" may differ by company and industry. When in doubt, be that as it may, these incorporate cash, cash equivalents, accounts receivable, and marketable securities. These ought to be in every way listed on a company's balance sheet, as should its current liabilities (those approaching due in one year or less).
### Quick Ratio Formula
> QR = Liquid Assets/Current Liabilities

## Quick Ratio Example: Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL)
The following figures are as of March 27th, 2021, and come from Apple's balance sheet. Numbers are in great many dollars.
> **Endlessly cash equivalents:** $38,466
>
> **Accounts receivable:** $18,503
>
> **Marketable securities:** $31,368
>
> **Current liabilities:** $106,385

> QR = Liquid Assets/Current Liabilities
>
> QR = ($38,466 + $18,503 +$31,368)/$106,385
>
> QR = $88,337/$106,385
>
> QR = 0.83

In light of this calculation, Apple's quick ratio was 0.83 as of the finish of March 2021. This number could be higher assuming that more assets were remembered for its calculations (see the section about the current ratio below).
## What Is a Good Quick Ratio?
A quick ratio of 1 or above demonstrates short-term solvency, or the ability of a company to meet its financial obligations until further notice. The higher a company's QR, the better position it's in — in terms of current liquidity.
That being said, too high a quick ratio (suppose over 2.5) could show that a business is excessively liquid in the short term since it isn't giving its money something to do in an efficient way by hiring, extending, creating, or in any case reinvesting in its operations.
Since the quick ratio doesn't consider all assets, a ratio of somewhat below 1 (e.g., 0.92) isn't be guaranteed to reason to worry, as less-liquid assets can be sold, or extra financing can be gotten in the event a company needs more cash to cover forthcoming liability payments.
## What Does a High Quick Ratio Mean?
A high quick ratio (any quick ratio north of 1) means that a company has a lot of endlessly cash equivalents to cover any debt payments that might come due inside the next year or somewhere in the vicinity. A higher quick ratio (like a 3) means that a company may not be completely utilizing its most liquid assets by utilizing them to grow operations by hiring, getting new plants or equipment, or exploring and growing new products or services.
## What Does a Low Quick Ratio Mean?
A low quick ratio (anything below 1) may demonstrate that a company is fairly low on endlessly cash equivalents and may have to liquidate certain assets or get extra financing by giving bonds or shares to meet forthcoming liability payments. An incredibly low QR might really demonstrate that a company is made a beeline for insolvency.
## Quick Ratio versus Current Ratio: What's the Difference?
The quick and current ratios are both liquidity ratios. That is, they are the two metrics that investors can use to assess a company's ability to pay its debts in the short term. All the two ratios are calculated by isolating a portion of a company's assets by its current liabilities, yet they vary in terms of the number of asset types are incorporated.
The [current ratio](/currentratio) incorporates more asset categories than the quick ratio does in its calculation, so a company's current ratio ought to constantly be **higher** than its quick ratio.
While the numerator for the quick ratio incorporates just the most liquid assets (cash, cash equivalents, accounts receivable, and marketable securities), the numerator for the current ratio incorporates **all** current assets (cash, cash equivalents, accounts receivable, marketable securities, inventory, and prepaid expenses).
### Current Ratio Example: Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL)
Getting back to the model over, we should investigate how Apple's current ratio (as of March 27th, 2021) compared to its quick ratio of 0.83. To ascertain the current ratio, we'll remember all current assets for the numerator — not just endlessly cash equivalents, accounts receivable, and marketable securities. The figures below are in large number of dollars.
> **Current assets:** $121,465
>
> **Current liabilities:** $106,385

> CR = Liquid Assets/Current Liabilities
>
> CR = $121,465/$106,385
>
> CR = 1.14

Apple's current ratio was higher than its quick ratio as of the finish of March 2021. As indicated by Apple's current ratio, it had a very sizable amount of liquid assets to cover its liabilities for the next year. As indicated by Apple's quick ratio — the more conservative measure — it didn't have sufficient liquidity to cover its forthcoming liabilities.
