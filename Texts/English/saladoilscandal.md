# Salad Oil Scandal
## What Is the Salad Oil Scandal?

The Salad Oil Scandal of the mid 1960s was one of the most terrible [corporate scandals](/corporate-fraud) of its time. It happened when executives at New Jersey-based Allied Crude Vegetable Oil Company discovered that banks would make loans [secured](/secureddebt) by the company's soybean oil or salad-oil inventory.

At the point when examiners would test Allied's holding tanks to confirm they were full, the company consistently finished the assessment. Notwithstanding, management didn't remind anybody that oil floats on water. The containers, filled with water, had just a couple of feet of oil on top, tricking everybody. In 1963, the scam became exposed, and more than $175 million-worth of salad oil was missing, causing several outstanding market resonations.

## Understanding the Salad Oil Scandal

The Salad Oil Scandal's genius was Anthony De Angelis, a commodities trader, and Allied founder. He served seven years in jail for fraud and conspiracy.

In the good 'ol days, Allied benefitted mostly by exporting U.S. soybean oil, shortening, and other related products. Seeking to increase Allied's profits, De Angelis devised a plan in the mid '60s to [collateralize](/collateralization) the company's substantial soybean products inventory and utilize the loan proceeds to purchase oil [futures](/futures).

He wanted to for all intents and purposes [corner](/corneramarket) the soybean oil market, driving up the price, in this manner raising the value for the two his futures and underlying commodity positions. At that point, American Express was among the biggest providers of such loans to Allied.

Sooner or later, Allied started to misrepresent records to accomplish more loans, claiming undeniably more soybean oil than it kept up with in storage. American Express had sent reviewers to check the inventory levels, yet none had detected water at the lower part of the company's tanks.

The fraud was uncovered when an anonymous [whistleblower](/whistleblower) contacted American Express and recommended its overseers take a gander at one of Allied's most gigantic soybean oil tanks. After giving it a more intensive look, the overseers discovered the deception.

## Market Implications of the Salad Oil Scandal

On Nov. 19, 1963, Allied Crude Vegetable Oil Refining Corporation petitioned for [bankruptcy](/bankruptcy), setting off several events in fast succession, remembering an over 20% decline for soybean oil futures.

De Angelis petitioned for personal bankruptcy also, passing on American Express to foot the bill on the awful loans. This brought about a critical decrease in its market value. Notwithstanding American Express, the scandal debilitated other Wall Street firms, which contributed to the financial chaos that followed the Kennedy death a couple of days after the fact.

These events included the liquidation of Ira Haupt and Co., a consequence of customer [margin calls](/margincall) in the wake of the Allied scandal, as well as the forced merger of brokerage J. R. Williston and Beane with a rival firm.

Likewise of note, investor Warren Buffett purchased a 5% stake in American Express in the midst of the scandal fallout, bringing about one of his initial investment triumphs.

## Antecedent to the Salad Oil Scandal

The salad oil scandal was not De Angelis' most memorable financial con. Prior to the salad oil scandal, De Angelis was associated with a financial scheme with the National School Lunch Act and Adolph Gobel Co. In this con, he cheated the government by cheating them for food deliveries. He additionally provided 2,000,000 pounds of uninspected meat. Whenever he was gotten he ended up bankrupt.

This scheme made him understand that he could exploit government schemes, which is the reason he made Allied Crude Vegetable Oil Company, to exploit the government's Food for Peace Program. Even after De Angelis was let out of jail for the Salad Oil Scandal, he took part in other fraudulent schemes.
