## What Is the Book-to-Bill Ratio?

A book-to-bill ratio is the ratio of orders received to units sent and billed for a predefined period, generally a month or quarter. It is a widely involved measurement in the [technology industry](/technology_sector), explicitly in the semiconductor equipment sector.

Investors and analysts closely watch this ratio for an indication of the performance and outlook for individual companies and the technology sector as a whole. A ratio over one suggests a bigger number of orders were received than filled, showing strong demand, while a ratio below one infers more fragile demand.

## Understanding the Book-to-Bill Ratio

A book-to-bill ratio is regularly utilized for measuring [supply and demand](/law-of-supply-demand) in unpredictable enterprises like the technology sector. The ratio measures the number of orders coming in compared to the number of orders going out. A company satisfying orders surprisingly has a book-to-bill ratio of 1. For instance, Company A books 500 orders for parts and afterward ships and bills every one of the 500 orders. The booked and billed orders have a ratio of one, or 500/500.

The book-to-bill ratio uncovers how rapidly a business satisfies the demand for its products. The ratio likewise shows the strength of a sector, for example, aviation or defense manufacturing. It might likewise be utilized while deciding if to purchase stock in a company.

On the off chance that a business has a ratio of short of what one, there might be more supply than demand. For instance, Company B books 500 orders for parts, and afterward ships and bills 610 orders, including a few orders from the previous month. The booked and billed orders have a ratio of 0.82. For each dollar of orders, the company billed, just $0.82 of orders were booked that month.

Be that as it may, assuming that the ratio is greater than one, there might be even more a demand rather than can be productively supplied. For instance, Company C books 500 orders for parts, and afterward ships and bills 375 orders. The book-to-bill ratio is 1.3, or 500/375. Conversely, a business with a ratio of one is meeting supply and demand sufficiently by transportation and billing orders as they are received.

## An Example of the Book-to-Bill Ratio

As a historical model, in June of 2016, companies making semiconductor pieces in the United States and Canada received orders averaging $1.71 billion north of three successive months. The book-to-bill ratio was 1. In this way, for each $100 in orders received for the month, $100 of the product was billed. The companies booked $1.75 billion in orders during May 2016, making that month 2.1% more productive than the average bookings from April through June of that year.
