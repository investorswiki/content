# Odd Lot Theory
## What Is the Odd Lot Theory?

The odd parcel theory is a technical analysis hypothesis in view of the assumption that the small individual investor is generally off-base and that individual investors are bound to create odd-part sales. Thusly, in the event that odd parcel sales are up and small investors are selling a [stock](/stock), it is most likely a great opportunity to buy, and when odd-part purchases are up, it might demonstrate a great chance to sell.

## Grasping the Odd Lot Theory

The odd parcel theory centers around following activities of individual investors trading in odd parts. This hypothesis likewise accepts that professional investors and traders will generally trade in round part measures (multiples of 100 shares), to further develop pricing proficiency in their orders. Albeit this believing was common legend from around 1950 for the rest of the century, it has since become less well known.

## Odd Lot Trades

Odd parcel trades are trade orders made by investors that incorporate under 100 shares in the transaction or are not a numerous of 100. These trade orders generally envelop individual investors that the theory accepts are less taught and compelling in the market overall.

[Round lots](/roundlot) are something contrary to odd parcels. They start at 100 shares and are separable by 100. These trade orders are believed to be more convincing as an indicator as they are normally made by professional traders or institutional investors.

Albeit technical analysts can follow the volume of [odd-lot](/oddlot) trades through technical analysis charting software programs, testing since the 1990s shows that these sorts of trades never again appear to mean market turns. Given the data efficiencies of the data age, even individual investors might be just as prone to make an educated trade as an institutional trade. While the odd parcel theory infers that these investors might be more important to follow for trade flags, this concept has become less important to analysts over the long haul.

There are numerous explanations behind this. The principal reason is that individual investors started investing all the more vigorously in mutual funds, which pool money into the hands of institutional investors. Furthermore, fund managers and individuals the same started utilizing exchange-traded funds (ETFs), with large volume being normal for the most well known ETF offerings.

A third explanation is the increased automation and computerization of market-production firms and the increased technology of high-frequency traders. Together, these factors have established an environment where order processing has become undeniably more efficient. The greater productivity of the markets has implied that odd parts are not handled any less really than round-parcel orders.

## Testing the Odd Lot Theory

Analysis of the odd parcel theory, coming full circle during the 1990s, appears to refute its overall viability. Whether since individual investors are not generally inclined to pursuing awful investment choices, or on the grounds that institutional traders never again fear making trades in odd parts not entirely set in stone.

Overall, the theory is presently not quite so substantial as numerous analysts and scholastics once thought. Creator Burton Malkiel, credited for advocating [Random Walk Theory](/randomwalktheory) has stated that the individual investor, otherwise called the odd lotter, is generally not as clueless or as mistaken as had been recently suspected.
