# Net Interest Rate Spread
## What Is the Net Interest Rate Spread?

The net interest rate spread is the difference between the average yield that a financial institution receives from loans — alongside other interest-building activities — and the average rate it pays on deposits and borrowings. The net interest rate spread is a key determinant of a financial institution's profitability (or lack thereof).

## Understanding the Net Interest Rate Spread

Credit giving institutions, for example, [commercial banks](/commercialbank), receive interest income from a number of sources. Deposits (frequently called [core deposits](/core-deposits)) are a primary source, generally in the forms of checking and savings accounts or certificates of deposit (CDs). These are frequently gotten at low rates. Banks additionally get funds through shareholder equity, wholesale deposits, and debt issuance. Banks issue various loans —, for example, mortgages on property, home equity lending, student loans, vehicle loans, and credit card lending — that are offered at higher interest rates.

The primary business of a bank is dealing with the spread between the interest rate on deposits that it pays consumers and the rate it receives from their loans. At the end of the day, when the interest that a bank procures from loans is greater than the interest it pays on deposits, it generates income from the interest rate spread. In simple terms, net interest rates spreads are like [profit margins](/profitmargin).

The greater the spread, the more profitable the financial institution is probably going to be. In any case, this is just the essential view, and financial institutions work on creative customer acquisition, customer retention and loyalty and principal investing strategies. Their individual strategies help them contend and separate themselves from other financial institutions.

## Calculation of the Net Interest Rate Spread

Most commercial banks (like [savings and loans](/federal-savings-and-advance)) generate their primary source of profits through net interest rates spreads. For example, they might credit depositors 1.25% on their money while giving a mortgage to a home buyer charging 4.75%. In this case the net interest rate spread would be 3.5%, minus any fees or costs incurred by the bank in affecting the two transactions.

## Net Interest Rate Spread and the Federal Funds Rate

In spite of the fact that we will not dive into how not entirely set in stone in the market, several factors drive rates, including monetary policy set by the Federal Reserve Bank and the yields on U.S. Treasuries. While [open-market activities](/open-market) at last shape the net interest rate spread, the [federal ("fed") funds rate](/federalfundsrate) assumes a large part in deciding the rate at which an institution loans immediate funds. To be sure, as indicated by the U.S. Federal Reserve, the federal funds rate is "the interest rate at which depository institutions loan reserve balances to other depository institutions overnight."

This applies to the greatest, most creditworthy institutions as they keep up with the commanded amount of [reserve required](/requiredreserves). Subsequently, the fed funds rate is a base interest rate, one by which any remaining interest rates in the U.S. not entirely settled. The fed funds rate is a key indicator of the strength of the U.S. economy.
