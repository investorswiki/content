The VXN is quoted in percentage terms, just like its better-known partner the [Cboe Volatility Index (VIX)](/vix), which measures 30-day implied volatility for the S&P 500 index.

The Cboe Nasdaq Volatility Index was presented in 2001 as the [dot-com bubble](/web bubble) in technology stocks was emptying. Cboe developed the VXN in view of the enormous divergence between the volatility found in the Nasdaq market compared to the more extensive U.S. equity market from mid 1999 forward.

For sure, the Nasdaq soared 157% in a 15-month period from January 1999 to its pinnacle level of 5,048 on March 10, 2000, before plunging 52% to below 2,500 by December 20, 2000.

The chose options are out-of-the-cash Nasdaq-100 puts and calls focused on an at-the-cash strike price.
