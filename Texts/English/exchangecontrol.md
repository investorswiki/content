On the other hand, they can impose fixed exchange rates to put speculation down, confine any or all foreign exchange to a government-endorsed exchanger, or limit the amount of currency that can be imported to or traded from the country.

## Measures to Thwart Controls

One strategy companies use to work around currency controls, and to [hedge](/hedge) currency openings, is to utilize what are known as [forward contracts](/forwardcontract).

Notwithstanding, when the crisis hit, investors requiring cash hauled their money out of Iceland, influencing the nearby currency, the krona, to dive. The banks likewise collapsed, and the economy received a salvage package from the IMF.

### Lifting the Exchange Controls and Imposing New Ones

Under the exchange controls, investors who held high-yield offshore krona accounts couldn't bring the money back into the country. Yet again in March 2017, the Central Bank lifted the vast majority of the exchange controls on the krona, permitting the cross-border movement of Icelandic and foreign currency. Nonetheless, the Central Bank likewise imposed new reserve requirements and refreshed its foreign exchange rules to control the flow of hot money into the nation's economy.

With an end goal to resolve disputes with foreign investors who had been unable to liquidate their Icelandic holdings while the exchange controls were in place, the Central Bank offered to buy their currency holdings at an exchange rate discounted around 20 percent from the normal exchange rate at that point. Icelandic legislators likewise required foreign holders of krona-designated government bonds to sell them back to Iceland at a discounted rate, or have their profits seized in low-premium accounts endlessly upon the bonds' maturity.
