# Fibonacci Time Zones
## What Are Fibonacci Time Zones?

Fibonacci time zones are a technical indicator based on time. The indicator is commonly begun at a major [swing high](/swinghigh) or swing low on the chart. Vertical lines then reach out to the right, demonstrating areas of time that could bring about another critical swing high, low, or [reversal](/reversal). These vertical lines, which compare to time on the x-pivot of a price chart, are based on [Fibonacci numbers](/fibonaccilines).

## How Fibonacci Time Zones Work

Fibonacci time zones don't need a formula, however it assists with understanding Fibonacci numbers. In the Fibonacci number sequence, each successive number is the sum of the last two numbers. The sequence begins like this: 0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144, etc.

Fibonacci times zones are these numbers when added to the initial time chose. Consequently, in the event that we pick a beginning date of April 1, this would be time (0). The main Fibonacci time zone vertical line will then, at that point, show up on the next trading session (1), the subsequent will seem two sessions later (2), and afterward three (3), five (5), and eight after 8 days, etc.

If adding Fibonacci time zones the hard way, the initial five numbers can be stayed away from, as the indicator isn't especially dependable when every one of the vertical lines are pressed together. Subsequently, a few traders begin drawing their vertical lines 13 or 21 periods after their starting point.

Some charting platforms allow you to pick your starting point (0) and your primary point (1). This means you can pick how long (1) addresses. The next numbers in the sequence will compare to the amount of time picked.

## What Do Fibonacci Time Zones Tell You?

Distinguishing a starting point is an important however subjective element of utilizing Fibonacci time zones. The date or period chose ought to be a generally important one, marking a high or low point. At the point when the indicator is applied to this date or period, vertical lines will appear to the right of the starting point. The principal line will seem one period after the starting point, the next will seem two periods later, etc.

As indicated above, ordinarily the initial not many zones are overlooked, as they cluster around the starting point. The vertical lines that are at least 13 periods from the starting point will generally be more dependable.

Fibonacci time zones are basically letting us know that after a high or low, another high or low could happen 13, 21, 55, 89, 144, 233... periods after the initial point.

Time zones aren't worried about price, just time. In this way, the time zones might mark small high or lows, or they might mark huge ones. The price may likewise totally disregard the time zones. On the off chance that this happens on numerous occasions, the price isn't sticking to the Fibonacci time zones so an alternate starting point might give better outcomes. It is likewise conceivable Fibonacci time zones aren't especially applicable to a certain [security](/security) or asset.

Fibonacci time zones can be utilized for [confirmation](/confirmation) of trades or analysis. For instance, on the off chance that the price is drawing nearer a [support](/support) area and furthermore a Fibonacci time zone, and the price then rises off support, the two methods affirm one another. A low point is possibly in and the price could keep rising. One more form of analysis is required for surveying how high the price might rise, as Fibonacci time zones don't demonstrate the extent of moves. The price might make a low and afterward rise essentially, or it might just briefly rise before falling to a new low.

## Fibonacci Time Zones versus Fibonacci Retracements

Fibonacci time zones are vertical lines that address future time periods where the price could make a high, low, or reverse course.

[Fibonacci retracements](/fibonacciretracement) rather show areas the price could [pull back](/pullback) off of a high or low. Retracements are price-based and offer help or resistance areas based on Fibonacci numbers.

## Limitation of Using Fibonacci Time Zones

Fibonacci time zones are a subjective indicator in that the starting point chosen will shift by trader. Likewise, since some charting platforms allow the trader to pick how long (1) addresses, this further adds to the subjectivity and may take out the handiness of the indicator out and out.

The indicator, if appropriately set, may show areas of time where the price could put in a high or low, yet these might be minor highs or lows, or major ones. Time zones give no information on the size of price moves. They additionally rarely pinpoint the specific defining moment date. This makes it hard to decide whether the indicator is really predictive or just haphazardly ends up showing up close to some reversal points.

The indicator ought not be utilized all alone. Join it with trend and [price action](/price-action) analysis, as well as other technical indicators or potentially [fundamental analysis](/fundamentalanalysis).

## Highlights
- Fibonacci time zones are based on the Fibonacci number sequence, which gives us the Golden Ratio.
- Fibonacci time zones may not show careful reversal points. They are time-based areas to know about.
- Fibonacci time zones just show expected areas of significance connected with time. No respect is given to price. The zone could mark a minor high or low, or a huge high or low.
- Fibonacci time zones are vertical lines that address potential areas where a swing high, low, or reversal could happen.
