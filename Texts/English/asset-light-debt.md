For instance, Holding Company ABC has a $200,000 loan yet $10,000 in assets. The parent company's guaranteed cash flows, or [dividends](/profit), to the holding company are utilized rather to secure the loan. The utilization of this asset-light debt structure protects the parent company should the loan become unserviceable. [Special purpose vehicles](/spv) (SPVs) can be asset-light, going about as a method for financing assets with minimal collateral or equity.
