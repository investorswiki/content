# Cash Account
## What Is a Cash Account?

A cash account with a brokerage firm expects that any securities transactions be payable in full from funds in the account at the time of the settlement. Short selling and [buying on margin](/buying-on-margin) are thus prohibited in this type of account. The Federal Reserve's [Regulation T](/regulationt) administers cash accounts and the purchase of securities on margin. This regulation gives investors two business days to pay for security. It's known as T+2.

In accounting, a cash account, or [cash book](/cash-book), may allude to a ledger where all cash transactions are recorded. The cash account incorporates both the cash receipts journal and the cash payment journal.

## Understanding Cash Accounts

Investors who actively trade must be careful not to violate certain regulations pertaining to cash accounts. For instance, they must make certain to have sufficient cash in their account and not try to pay for the purchase of securities by selling other [securities](/security) after the purchase date.

For instance, an investor who has no cash in an account might settle on Monday to make a stock purchase worth $10,000. To pay for this, the investor sells other stock shares on Tuesday worth $10,000. This would be a violation in light of the fact that the purchase will settle two days later, on Wednesday, before the sale settled on Thursday. There would be no cash accessible in the account to cover the trade. This is known as a "cash liquidation violation."

An active investor with a cash account and zero cash accessible must likewise not buy security and afterward rapidly sell it before a previous sale has settled to give the essential cash. This is known as a "completely honest intentions violation."

Cash account investors with zero or close to zero cash accessible must likewise try not to try to pay for the purchase of a security with the sale of a similar security. For instance, an investor might purchase $1,000 worth of a stock on a Monday but fail to have sufficient cash to pay for it within two days. To pay for it, the investor might then sell a similar stock on Thursday, the day after the purchase was to be settled. This is known as a "free-riding violation."

## Cash Account versus Margin Account

Not at all like a cash account, a [margin account](/marginaccount) permits an investor to borrow against the value of the [assets](/asset) in an account to purchase new positions or [sell short](/shortselling). Investors can utilize margin to leverage their positions and profit from both bullish and bearish moves in the market. Margin can likewise be utilized to make cash withdrawals against the value of the account as a short-term loan.

For investors seeking to [leverage](/leverage) their positions, a margin account can be valuable and cost-effective. But keep as a top priority that when a margin balance (debit) is created, the outstanding balance is subject to a daily interest rate charged by the firm. These rates depend on the current prime rate plus an additional amount that is charged by the lending firm. This rate can be quite high.

> Margin accounts must maintain a certain margin ratio at all times. On the off chance that the account value falls below this limit, the client is issued a [margin call](/margincall). This is a demand to bring the account value back within. The client can add new cash to the account or sell a few holdings to raise the cash.

For instance, an investor with a margin account might take a short position in XYZ stock, accepting the price is probably going to fall. In the event that the price truly does for sure fall, the investor can cover the short position by taking a long position in XYZ stock. The investor thus procures a profit on the difference between the amount received with the initial short sale transaction and the amount paid to buy the shares at the lower price, minus the margin interest charges.

With a cash account, a similar investor would need to track down other strategies to [hedge](/hedge) or produce income on the account. For instance, the investor might enter a stop order to sell XYZ stock in the event that it dips under a certain price. That limits the downside risk.
