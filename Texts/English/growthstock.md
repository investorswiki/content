## What Is a Growth Stock?

A growth stock is any share in a company that is anticipated to develop at a rate essentially above the average growth for the market. These stocks generally don't pay dividends. This is because the issuers of growth stocks are normally companies that need to reinvest any earnings they accrue to accelerate growth in the short term. When investors invest in growth stocks, they anticipate that they will earn money through [capital gains](/capitalgain) when they eventually sell their shares from here on out.

## Understanding Growth Stocks

Growth stocks might appear in any sector or industry and typically trade at a high [price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio](/price-earningsratio). They might not have earnings right now but rather are expected to from now on.

Investment in growth stocks can be risky. Because they typically don't offer [dividends](/stockdividend), the main opportunity an investor needs to earn money on their investment is when they eventually sell their shares. On the off chance that the company does not get along admirably, investors take a loss on the stock when now is the right time to sell.

Growth stocks tend to share a few common traits. For example, growth companies tend to have unique product lines. They might hold patents or have access to technologies that put them ahead of others in their industry. To remain ahead of competitors, they reinvest profits to develop even newer technologies and patents as a method for ensuring longer-term growth.

Because of their patterns of innovation, they often have an unwavering customer base or a lot of [market share](/marketshare) in their industry. For example, a company that develops computer applications and is quick to provide a new service might become a growth stock by approach to gaining market share for being the main company providing a new service. In the event that other app companies enter the market with their own versions of the service, the company that manages to draw in and hold the largest number of users has a greater potential for becoming a growth stock.

## Growth Stocks versus Value Stocks

Growth stocks differ from [value stocks](/valuestock). Investors expect growth stocks to earn substantial capital gains as a result of strong growth in the underlying company. This expectation can result in these stocks appearing overvalued because of their generally high price-to-earnings (P/E) ratios.

In actuality, value stocks are often underrated or ignored by the market, but they may eventually gain value. Investors additionally attempt to profit from the dividends they typically pay. Value stocks tend to trade at a low price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio.

Some investors might try to include both growth and value stocks in their portfolios for [diversification](/diversification). Others might prefer to specialize by zeroing in more on value or growth.

Some value stocks are underpriced simply due to poor earnings reports or negative media attention. However, one characteristic that they often have is strong dividend-payout histories. A value stock with a strong dividend history can provide reliable income to an investor. Many value stocks are older companies that can be counted on to remain in business, even on the off chance that they aren't particularly innovative or poised to develop.

## Example of a Growth Stock

Amazon Inc. (AMZN) has long been considered a growth stock. In 2021, it is one of the largest companies in the world and has been for quite a while. As of Sept. 24, 2021, Amazon positions fourth among U.S. stocks in terms of its [market capitalization](/marketcapitalization).

Amazon's stock has historically traded at a high price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio. Between June 2020 and September 2021, the stock's P/E has ranged from around 58 to 106. Despite the company's size, [earnings per share](/eps) (EPS) growth estimates for 2022 is over 67.

When a company is expected to develop, investors remain able to invest (even at a high P/E ratio). This is because several years down the road the current stock price might look cheap in hindsight. The risk is that growth doesn't continue true to form. Investors have paid a high price expecting one thing, and not getting it. In such cases, a growth stock's price can fall emphatically.
