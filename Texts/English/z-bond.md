# Z-Bond
## What is Z-Bond?

A Z-bond, otherwise called a [accrual bond](/accrual_bond), is in many cases the last bond to mature. It gets payment, which is the accrual of interest added to the principal, after any remaining bond classes.

## Understanding Z-Bond

A Z-bond is the last tranche of a [collateralized mortgage obligation](/cmo) (CMO). As the last portion of the debt security, it gets payment last. Dissimilar to different tranches of a CMO, a Z-bond doesn't disseminate payments to its holder until every one of the separate tranches are paid. Be that as it may, the interest will keep on building over the lifetime of the mortgage. Consequently, when the Z-bond really does at last pay off, its holder can anticipate a powerful sum. The bond will pay both principal and interest.

Z-bonds are categorized as speculative investments and can be risky for investors. A Z-bond is a type of [mortgage-backed security](/mbs) (MBS). A MBS is comprised of a pool of underlying securities that are normally home mortgages. A MBS is secured exclusively by the loan specialist's confidence in the borrower's ability to make their mortgage payments.

If a pool of borrowers all [default](/default2) on their mortgage payments, and those mortgages are packaged together into a single CMO, the investor holding a Z-bond for that CMO might lose money. Without the approaching mortgage payments, the bonds can't be paid off. Individuals who invested in different tranches of the CMO might in any case make back their initial investment. Be that as it may, on the grounds that Z-bonds pay out after any remaining portions, the Z-bond holder stands to lose the most. Alternately, the inclusion of Z-bonds builds the confidence in different tranches of the CMO, given that the Z-bonds payments can be applied to fulfill the payment obligations of different tranches before the Z-bonds obligations.

## Minimizing Z-Bond Risk

Most mortgage-backed securities are issued by either a federal agency or by a [government-sponsored entity](/gse) (GSE) like Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. Those that are issued by a federal agency are backed by the [full faith and credit](/full-faith-credit) of the U.S. government. Along these lines, they can be very low risk since they are guaranteed by the U.S. Treasury.

Be that as it may, a government-sponsored entity (GSE) doesn't have U.S. Treasury backing. These elements might borrow money straightforwardly from the Treasury, yet the government isn't committed to give funds to bail out these agencies would it be a good idea for them they find themselves unfit to pay their debts. However these securities carry some risk, that risk is generally viewed as low. For instance, during the 2007-08 Financial Crisis, Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae were considered [too big to fail](/too-big-to-fail), and the U.S. Treasury stepped in to support their debt.

A more modest portion of mortgage-backed securities (MBS) comes from private firms, for example, investment banks and other financial institutions. These securities ought to be viewed as essentially higher in risk, as the U.S. government doesn't back them. The issuers can't borrow straightforwardly from the U.S. Treasury, should the mortgages default.
