# Reverse Takeover (RTO)
## What Is a Reverse Takeover (RTO)?

A reverse takeover (RTO) is an interaction by which private companies can turn out to be publicly traded companies without going through a [initial public offering (IPO)](/ipo).

To start, a private company purchases an adequate number of shares to control a publicly-traded company. The private company's shareholder then exchanges its shares in the private company for shares in the public company. As of now, the private company has successfully turned into a publicly-traded company.

A RTO is likewise some of the time alluded to as a reverse merger or a reverse IPO.

## How a Reverse Takeover (RTO) Works

By participating in a RTO, a private company can stay away from the costly fees associated with setting up an IPO. Be that as it may, the company obtains no extra funds through a RTO, and it must have an adequate number of funds to complete the transaction all alone.

While not a requirement of a RTO, the name of the publicly-traded company included is frequently different as part of the interaction. For instance, the computer company Dell (DELL) completed a reverse takeover of VMware tracking stock (DVMT) in December 2018 and returned to being a publicly traded company. It likewise changed its name to Dell Technologies.

Also, the corporate restructuring of one — or both — of the blending companies is adjusted to oblige the new business design. Prior to the RTO, it is entirely expected for the publicly-traded company to have had practically zero recent activity, existing as to a greater degree a [shell corporation](/shellcorporation). This permits the private company to shift its operations into the shell of the public entity no sweat, all while keeping away from the costs, regulatory requirements, and time imperatives associated with an IPO. While a traditional IPO might require months or years to complete, a RTO might be completed in just weeks.

Some of the time RTOs are alluded to as the "unfortunate man's IPO." This is on the grounds that studies have shown that companies that open up to the world through a RTO generally have lower survival rates and performance over the long haul, compared to companies that go through a traditional IPO to turn into a publicly traded company.

## Special Considerations

In contrast to conventional IPOs — which can be canceled on the off chance that the equity markets are performing ineffectively — reverse mergers aren't generally put on hold. Numerous private companies hoping to complete a reverse merger have frequently taken a series of losses, and a percentage of the losses can be applied to future income as a tax loss carryforward.

On the flip side, reverse mergers can uncover shortcomings in the private company's management experience and record keeping. Too, many reverse mergers come up short; they end up not satisfying the guaranteed expectations when they ultimately start trading.

A foreign company may a RTO as a mechanism to gain entry into the U.S. marketplace. For instance, in the event that a business with operations based outside of the U.S. purchases an adequate number of shares to have a controlling interest in a U.S. company, it can move to consolidate the foreign-based business with the U.S.- based business.
