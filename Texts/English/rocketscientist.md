# Rocket Scientist
## What is a Rocket Scientist?

Rocket scientist is a term begat by traditional traders for a person with a math and statistical research foundation accomplishing quantitative work in investing and finance. The term dates to the 1970's and was involved offhanded when Wall Street firms started utilizing researchers without finance or trading foundations to utilize computers to conduct extensive[ quantitative research](/quantitativeanalysis) alongside traditional[ securities analysts](/analyst).

## Grasping Rocket Scientists

Wall Street expanded its dependence on these subject matter experts — normally alluded to as "quants" — as finance and trading turned out to be intensely automated and access to[ big data](/big-data) increased. While quantitative research can be applied to any way of investing, i.e., growth or value, its application in the securities industry has expanded along with the rise of[ factor investing](/factor-investing). Initially considered a separate approach to investing that would assist with diminishing human feeling in decision making, quantitative methods are currently utilized across the industry and included inside, rather than separately from, most investment strategies.

## Quantitative Analysis is Now the Norm

An early illustration of the utilization of rocket scientists in asset management would be the point at which a fruitful trader wanted to quantify her investment thoughts and test the expected viability of a strategy going ahead. Having traditionally chosen value stocks, for instance, in view of a[ fundamental](/fundamentalanalysis) strategy, a manager could hire an analyst with a Ph.D. what's more, a foundation in hypothetical physical science ( A.K.A., "rocket science") to make a model that tests the contribution to returns of hundreds or thousands of factors and connections over long periods of time in various market situations. As the quant constructs complex models for the[ backtesting](/backtesting) of the manager's strategy, she additionally learns the investment business, possibly developing from rocket scientist to securities analyst and portfolio manager.

In recent many years quants have been fundamental to the development of synthetic products and derivatives including swaps. The models utilized by[ robo advisors](/roboadvisor-roboadviser) to make investment portfolios and give counsel are likewise founded on quantitative financial research. [High frequency trading](/high-frequency-trading) and other automated, algorithmic trading programs are direct outgrowths of the application of quantitative methods and computer models to investing and trading.

The degree to which quantitative and factor investing might add to potential market volatility while bypassing the checks and balances of human decision making stays a subject of extraordinary discussion. Quantitative, program trading was widely faulted for the Black Monday [1987 market crash](/financial exchange crash-1987) and for having contributed to other later incidents of extreme market volatility, for example, the [flash crash of 2010](/flash-crash). The job of the modern, complex, and frequently opaque derivatives, swaps, and synthetic debt instruments, made conceivable by quantitative methods, to the causes, transmission, and uncertainty of the global financial crisis and [Great Recession](/great-recession) has likewise prompted analysis of quantitative investing.

Defenders point out that market crashes likewise happened before the presentation of modern quantitative methods, that their utilization may really assist with beating a portion of the impact of human psychology, feeling, and cognitive bias in the financial sector, and that the fast, certain reaction of model-based trading programs can speed up market changes and improve effectiveness. In any case, quantitative trading is setting down deep roots as the laid out standard in modern financial markets.

## Highlights
- The trend toward dependence on quantitative modeling rist took off with the rise of the computer age in the 1980's.
- "Rocket scientist" is a joking reference to the application of novel mathematical instruments developed in physical science, engineering, and other quantitative hard sciences to finance, investment, and trading.
- Quantitative finance is currently the laid out standard in the world of finance, however still it has a few pundits.
