# Flappening
Flappening is a conversational term begat by Charlie Lee in mid 2018 to portray the moment when Litecoin (LTC) outperformed Bitcoin Cash (BCH) in terms of [market capitalization](/market-capitalization). It is a silly play on words on the term Flippening, which is defined as the moment Ethereum (ETH) will possibly surpass [Bitcoin](/bitcoin) (BTC) in terms of market cap. The market capitalization of a [cryptocurrency](/cryptocurrency) is defined freely by its circulating supply duplicated by its current market price (albeit a few measures don't consider coins or tokens that were lost).
Not at all like Flippening that has not happened as of April 2019, the Flappening really occurred as the market cap of Litecoin outperformed the one of Bitcoin Cash on the fourteenth of December 2018. Since this date, the utilization of the term has been expanded to incorporate the overwhelming of other important altcoins. The Flappening progress can be followed at the Flappening Watch.
