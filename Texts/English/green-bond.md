## What Is a Green Bond?

A green bond is a type of fixed-income instrument that is specifically reserved to raise money for climate and environmental projects. These bonds are normally asset-connected and backed by the responsible substance's balance sheet, so they for the most part carry the equivalent [credit rating](/bondrating) as their issuers' other debt obligations.

Tracing all the way back to the primary decade of the 21st century, green bonds are once in a while alluded to as climate bonds, however the two terms are not equivalent all the time.

## Grasping Green Bonds

Green bonds are designated bonds planned to urge sustainability and to support climate-related or different types of special environmental projects. All the more specifically, green bonds finance projects focused on energy proficiency, pollution prevention, sustainable agriculture, fishery and ranger service, the protection of oceanic and earthly ecosystems, clean transportation, clean water, and sustainable water management. They additionally finance the development of environmentally friendly advancements and the relief of climate change.

Green bonds might accompany tax incentives, for example, tax exemption and tax credits, making them a more alluring investment compared to a comparable [taxable bond](/taxablebond). These tax benefits give a monetary incentive to handle noticeable social issues, for example, climate change and a movement toward renewable wellsprings of energy. To meet all requirements for green bond status, they are much of the time confirmed by an outsider, for example, the Climate Bond Standard Board, which ensures that the bond will fund projects that incorporate benefits to the environment.
