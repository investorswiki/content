# Asynchronous

Asynchronous means not simultaneous, or not occurring simultaneously or speed. In computer science, asynchrony alludes to the occurrence of events that are independent of the primary program.
In an asynchronous system, operations are not composed by a global clock signal, yet rather events (changes in the system). Asynchronous systems don't rely upon outer signals or directives for their solid operation.
Asynchronous systems are frequently planned with a secluded structure. In such systems, every module can operate independently and can speak with different modules. These interconnected modules then together form a working system.
Asynchronous communication is when data can be sent sporadically, rather than in a constant flow. Common models incorporate email or online discussions, where participants send messages at various times.
Blockchains can be asynchronous or semi-simultaneous networks.
Asynchronous networks don't supply the hubs with any feedback about the situation with the information being sent, which can lead to hubs having various perspectives on the overall state of the network. Basically, hubs don't need to trust that different hubs will receive their messages, which can increase the transaction throughput.
Semi-simultaneous networks aim to guarantee that there will never be a split in the network's global state. Assuming the network is parceled, consensus between the hubs will dial back until it is reestablished in the future.
Asynchronous or semi-simultaneous blockchain networks can be planned whether to focus on consistency or availability. To focus on availability, all transactions are added with next to no downtime. If the network has any desire to focus on consistency, a few transactions probably won't be handled or stopped until every one of the previous transactions are confirmed.
Some blockchain plans utilize an implementation of Byzantine Fault Tolerance (BFT) called Asynchronous Byzantine Fault Tolerance (aBFT). It numerically guarantees that consensus is eventually accomplished even assuming an assailant controls close to 33% of the network. Asynchronous in this setting means that no suppositions are made about timing.
