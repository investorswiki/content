# Owner Earnings Run Rate
## What Is Owner Earnings Run Rate?

Owner earnings run rate is an extrapolated estimate of an owner's earnings ([free cash flow](/freecashflow)) over a defined period of time — ordinarily a year.

## Understanding Owner Earnings Run Rate

Owner earnings run rate is a term comprised of two separate components: owner earnings and [run rate](/runrate). To comprehend how it functions, it is first important to make quick work of what every one of them mean.

### Run Rate

The run rate is a method for forecasting the future [financial performance](/financialperformance) of a company in view of past data. Suppose a company records [revenue](/revenue) of $100 million in its last quarter. Involving this data as a predictor of future performance, we could say that it is expected to register sales of $400 million for the year — or is operating at a $400 million run rate.

### Owner Earnings

Then, at that point, there's owner earnings: a valuation method inclined toward by investment master Warren Buffett. [Net income](/netincome) (NI) stands out from investors, yet doesn't necessarily completely mirror the actual dollar amount that a business has in its cash safes to disperse to owners and lift [shareholder value](/shareholder-value).

That is the very thing that owner earnings decides to accomplish. Buffett stated that the value of a company is essentially the total of the net cash flows (owner earnings) expected to happen over the life of the business, minus any reinvestment of [earnings](/earnings). In a 1986 Berkshire Hathaway Annual Shareholder Letter, Buffett gave a few understanding into owner earnings and how it ought to be calculated:

>
> "In the event that we think through these inquiries, we can gain a few experiences about what might be called 'owner earnings.' These address (a) reported earnings plus (b) depreciation, depletion, amortization, and certain other non-cash charges, for example, Company N's things (1) and (4) less the average annual amount of capitalized expenditures for plant and equipment, and so on that the business expects to keep up with its long-term competitive position and its unit volume completely. (Assuming the business requires extra working capital to keep up with its competitive position and unit volume, the addition likewise ought to be remembered for (c). Be that as it may, businesses following the LIFO inventory method as a rule don't need extra working capital in the event that unit volume doesn't change.)"
>

As such, owner earnings = reported earnings + depreciation, amortization +/ - other non-cash charges - average annual support capex +/ - changes in [working capital](/workingcapital). Everything the subsequent figure means to say to us is the amount of value the company is making and how much is flowing back to shareholders. Frequently, it winds up like free cash flow (FCF): the cash a company generates in the wake of accounting for cash outflows to support operations and keep up with its capital assets.

## Benefits and Disadvantages of Owner Earnings Run Rate

Owner earnings is an important metric that investors can use to measure a company's [financial health](/financial-wellbeing). Increased owner earnings will generally act as a signal that a company's subsequent earnings will be great. Accordingly, surveying an accurate owner earnings run rate could be vital in foreseeing the company's longer-term performance.

The problem is that the owner earnings run rate isn't generally dependable, in particular since it underestimates that the company's financial performance stays steady all through the period. For instance, suppose that after three [quarters](/quarter) a company posts owner earnings of $9 million. Accepting that performance stays predictable, the company's owner earnings run rate for the [fiscal year](/fiscalyear) (FY) would be $12 million ($3 million for each quarter).

This estimate can be hard to evaluate assuming the company is operating in an industry that encounters [seasonality](/seasonality). In such cases, owner earnings from one period may not be applicable across the whole time period.

> ### Important
> The owner earnings run rate is imperfect when applied to companies whose financial performance changes from one quarter to another.

Run rates don't account for higher sales linked to another product release, a common occurrence among numerous technology firms, or large, one-time sales, all things considered.
