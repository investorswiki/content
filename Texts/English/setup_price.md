# Setup Price
## What Is a Setup Price?

A setup price is an investor's foreordained price of entry that, once penetrated, starts a position in that specific security, be it a [stock](/stock), [bond](/bond), [currency](/currency), or some other type of financial instrument. It is otherwise called a [entry point](/entry-point).

## Understanding a Setup Price

A setup price can be resolved in light of [technical](/technicalanalysis) or [fundamental](/fundamentals) factors, as well as personal assessment with respect to the trader, and can be placed at any price that the trader picks. Normally, the setup price is dependent on the trader's analysis of whether the market is [range-bound](/rangeboundtrading) or trending.

In a range-bound market, the setup price will be placed just below a key [resistance](/resistance) or over a key [support](/support) level, however this isn't set in stone. On the other hand, in a trending market, the setup price is placed over the key resistance and below the key support level. This is done as such as to give confirmation that the price has, for sure, made a critical break, which builds the likelihood of the common market [trend](/trending-market) continuing.

When the setup price is set off, the trader will have a [open position](/vacant position) in that asset. This might involve shorting a security in the event that they think the price will drop, or going long assuming they anticipate a vertical movement.

For instance, assuming your analysis directs that you ought to search at the cost of a stock, as of now trading at $24, to go above $25 before buying, then it very well may be better to place the setup price at $25.25 as opposed to purchasing it now or as $25 is reached. While the price is important, one ought to likewise be mindful of volume, [volatility](/volatility), and numerous different factors influencing price movements.

## Setup Price and Limit Orders

Utilizing a [limit order](/limitorder) to make a move on a setup price is a simple method for achieving an investor's planned goal. Limit orders are utilized when an investor needs to confine, or "limit," the price paid (or received) for a security. This is finished by indicating the maximum price at which a stock will be bought (or the base price at which it will be bought or sold).

When the price comes to the "limit," the order is regularly filled costing that much (or better) assuming there is adequate trading volume at that level. On thinly traded issues, you might receive a "partial fill," meaning just part of your order was filled at the limit price. The greatest risk to limit orders is that they are partially filled or not filled by any means.

## Illustration of a Setup Price

To act as an illustration of how set prices and limit orders cooperate, consider Tech Company An is trading at $31 and an investor wishes to buy shares at $29. They might regret this decision in the event that Tech Company A trades down to $29.25 however, zooms up, leaving the order unfilled.

Or then again it could trade down to $29 however just for a small number of [shares](/shares); assuming your limit order is behind other limit orders at similar price, those orders must be filled before yours, and at that point the price might have headed back up.

While utilizing limit orders, it very well might be smart to trust that the price will approach the limit you wish to pay before submitting the request. One stunt worth considering is utilizing "crackpot" limits. Most investors place limits ending in the digits zero or five â€” for example, buying at $25.10 or selling at $30.25. Subsequently, limit orders will more often than not cluster around certain price points, making fills harder since limit orders at a similar price are filled by time priority.
