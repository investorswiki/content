# Retail Note
## What Is a Retail Note?

A retail note is a debt obligation issued by a corporation. They can be purchased straightforwardly from the issuer at [par](/parvalue) in $1,000 increases, similar to bonds, however with no accrued interest or added markups. They are [subordinated](/subordinateddebt) and [unsecured](/unsecured) debt and are in many cases an alluring option compared with bonds.

## Understanding a Retail Note

Retail notes are issued by corporations and pay the investor fixed payments for the note's duration. Like [bonds](/bond), retail notes can be either [callable](/callable-security) or non-callable. The majority of retail notes, in any case, are callable.

Callable securities are those that can be called away by the issuer before maturity. In light of this conceivable loss of income for the investor, a callable retail note will pay a premium. This additional [yield](/yield) premium makes retail notes more appealing than normal bonds, particularly for investors who are not worried about a loss of income when a retail note is called. Numerous callable securities likewise accompany call protection for a certain period of time.

One more appealing feature of retail notes is the survivor option that they accompany. At the point when the original owner of the retail note dies, the survivor option permits the beneficiaries of the retail note to sell the note back to the issuer at par.

Retail notes are issued week after week, making them promptly accessible investments. In a retail note offering, the standard debt obligation data is given, for example, [maturities](/maturity), interest-payment periods, and credit ratings.

Retail notes might be purchased either straightforwardly from the issuer or through a financial intermediary, like a broker. In the wake of buying the notes, the purchaser receives standard fixed-interest payments until maturity. Assuming the notes are callable, the payments will go on until they are [called away](/calledaway).

## Retail Notes as an Investment

Due to the subordinate idea of retail notes, they may not work for each investor. Subordinated debt is a loan or security that ranks below different loans or securities as to claims on assets or earnings. On account of borrower default, [creditors](/creditor) who own subordinated debt will not be paid out until after [senior debt](/seniordebt) holders are paid in full.

This ranking of retail notes, thusly, makes it a riskier investment than senior debt. Be that as it may, the [creditworthiness](/credit-value) of the issuer of the retail note is a large factor in a note's riskiness.

For instance, a financially sound company like Apple (AAPL) would have an incredibly low chance of [defaulting](/default2) on its debt. Hence, the subordinated retail notes wouldn't carry many risks. On the other hand, a company with poor financial wellbeing would have essentially unique risk profiles for its senior debt and subordinated debt.

Rating agencies like [Standard and Poor's](/sp) and [Moody's](/moodys) investigate companies and their ability to pay their debt, doling out them with [ratings](/creditrating) that mirror their risk profile. Bonds, as a general rule, consistently rank below senior debt.

## Retail Notes versus Bonds

[Stocks](/stock) and bonds are the most common investments. Bonds can be a confounded investment as they have many moving parts, for example, the price, the interest rate, the yield, markup costs, accrued interest, and lack of control in regards to taxes and capital gains. Thusly, retail notes are in many cases considered a decent alternative to bonds.

Retail notes are offered on a more regular basis: week after week, as noted previously. They likewise don't have the associated costs of markups and accrued interest and have beneficial tax profiles, for example, the ability to remember them for your [individual retirement account](/ira) (IRA). Once in your traditional IRA, the income received from interest payments will develop tax-deferred.
