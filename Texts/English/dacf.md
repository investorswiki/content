# Debt-Adjusted Cash Flow (DACF)
## What Is Debt-Adjusted Cash Flow (DACF)?

Debt-adjusted cash flow (DACF) is a financial metric that represents pre-tax [operating cash flow](/operatingcashflow) (OCF) adjusted for financing expenses after taxes. It is most regularly used to examine oil companies. Changes for exploration costs may likewise be incorporated, as these differ from one company to another depending on the accounting method utilized.

Debt-adjusted cash flow (DACF) is frequently utilized in [valuation](/valuation) since it adapts to the effects of a company's capital structure. In the event that a company utilizes a ton of debt, the generally utilized Price/Cash Flow (P/CF) ratio might demonstrate the company is moderately cheaper than if its debt were considered.

P/CF is the ratio of the company's stock price to its cash flow. In the event that a company employs debt, its cash flow might be helped while its share price is unaffected, bringing about a lower P/CF ratio and making the company look moderately cheap.

The EV/DACF ratio eliminates this problem. EV, or [enterprise value](/enterprisevalue), mirrors the amount of debt a company has, and DACF mirrors the after-tax cost of that debt. The valuation ratio EV/[EBITDA](/ebitda) is involved normally to examine companies in different industries, including oil and gas. Be that as it may, in oil and gas, EV/DACF is likewise utilized as it adapts to after-tax financing costs and exploration expenses, considering an apples-to-apples comparison.
