1. Add cash inflows from the giving of debt or equity.
1. Add all cash outflows from stock repurchases, dividend payments, and repayment of debt.
1. Take away the cash outflows from the inflows to show up at the cash flow from financing activities for the period.

For instance, suppose a company has the accompanying data in the financing activities section of its cash flow statement:

- Repurchase stock: $1,000,000 (cash outflow)
- Proceeds from long-term debt: $3,000,000 (cash inflow)
- Payments to long-term debt: $500,000 (cash outflow)
- Payments of dividends: $400,000 (cash outflow)

Hence, CFF would be as per the following:

- $3,000,000 - ($1,000,000 + $500,000 + $400,000), or $1,100,000

## Cash Flow in the Financial Statement

The cash flow statement is one of the three primary financial statements that show the state of a company's financial wellbeing. The other two important statements are the [balance sheet](/balancesheet) and income statement. The balance sheet shows the assets and liabilities as well as shareholder equity at a specific date. Otherwise called the profit and loss statement, the [income statement](/incomestatement) centers around business income and expenses. The cash flow statement measures the cash produced or utilized by a company during a given period. The cash flow statement has three sections:

1. [Cash flow from operating (CFO)](/cash-flow-from-operating-activities) demonstrates the amount of cash that a company gets from its customary business activities or operations. This section incorporates accounts receivable, accounts payable, amortization, depreciation, and different things.
1. [Cash flow from investing (CFI)](/cashflowfinvestingactivities) mirrors a company's purchases and sales of capital assets. CFI reports the aggregate change in the business cash position because of profits and losses from investments in things like plant and equipment. These things are viewed as long-term investments in the business.
1. Cash flow from financing activities (CFF) measures the movement of cash between a firm and its owners, investors, and creditors. This report shows the net flow of funds used to run the company including debt, equity, and dividends.

Investors can likewise get data about CFF activities from the balance sheet's equity and long-term debt sections and perhaps the footnotes.

## Capital From Debt or Equity

CFF demonstrates the means through which a company raises cash to keep up with or develop its operations. A company's source of capital can be from one or the other debt or equity. At the point when a company takes on debt, it commonly does as such by giving bonds or taking a loan from the bank. One way or the other, it must make interest payments to its bondholders and creditors to repay them for loaning their money.

At the point when a company goes through the equity route, it issues stock to investors who purchase the stock for a share in the company. A few companies make dividend payments to shareholders, which addresses a [cost of equity](/costofequity) for the firm.

## Positive and Negative CFF

Debt and equity financing are reflected in the cash flow from financing section, which fluctuates with the different [capital structures](/capitalstructure), dividend policies, or debt terms that companies might have.

### Transactions That Cause Positive Cash Flow From Financing Activities
- Giving equity or stock, which is sold to investors
- Borrowing debt from a creditor or bank
- Giving bonds, which is debt that investors purchase

A positive number for cash flow from financing activities means more money is flowing into the company than flowing out, which expands the company's assets.

### Transactions That Cause Negative Cash Flow From Financing Activities
- Stock repurchases
- Dividends
- Paying down debt

Negative CFF numbers can mean the company is servicing debt, yet can likewise mean the company is resigning debt or making dividend payments and stock repurchases, which investors may absolutely love to see.

## Investor Warnings From CFF

A company that much of the time goes to new debt or equity for cash could show positive cash flow from financing activities. Nonetheless, it very well may be an indication that the company isn't generating sufficient earnings. Additionally, as interest rates rise, debt servicing costs rise also. Investors really must dig further into the numbers in light of the fact that a positive cash flow probably won't be something beneficial for a company previously burdened with a large amount of debt.

On the other hand, in the event that a company is repurchasing stock and giving dividends while the company's earnings are failing to meet expectations, it very well might be a warning sign. The company's management may be endeavoring to prop up its stock price, keeping investors blissful, yet their activities may not be in the long-term best interest of the company.

Any huge changes in cash flow from financing activities ought to provoke investors to investigate the transactions. While breaking down a company's cash flow statement, it is important to think about every one of the different sections that add to the overall change in its cash position.
