## WHAT IS Unchanged

Unchanged alludes to a situation wherein the price or rate of a security is similar between two periods. This can be throughout any time period including a trading day, week or even as much as a year. Unchanged is a term utilized generally among equity, fixed-income, futures and options markets. The term likewise applies to indexes, exchange-traded funds and the [net asset value](/nav) of mutual funds.

While it is feasible to note an unchanged price between two random times, say 3 p.m on a Thursday and afterward at 10:15 a.m. the next Tuesday, most investors and traders center around either unchanged intra-day prices, or unchanged [closing prices ](/closingprice)over numerous trading days.

## BREAKING DOWN Unchanged

Unchanged intraday prices are more normal for securities that are reasonably [illiquid](/illiquid) and generally less well known, for example, [closed-end funds](/closed-endinvestment), microcap stocks, and interests in private companies that don't trade on major exchanges. Certain exchange-traded funds are additionally [thinly traded](/thinly-traded) and could be bound to have unchanged prices.

On the other hand, not many stocks on the S&P 500 end a regular day unchanged, or where the meeting's opening price and closing price are indistinguishable, even during periods of relative market quiet.

While picking two random points on a price chart, it is many times conceivable to hand-select two price points at which prices are indistinguishable. In this case, the holding period return between these points will be unchanged. In any case, this won't consider the scope of top to-box price developments. In other words, an investor's return, excluding fees and expenses, is unchanged, yet the security price probably moved around decisively between those two points.

## Instances of Unchanged

For instance, say [West Texas Intermediate](/wti) crude, known as WTI, traded at definitively $70.32 at two specific market shut in both October 2008 and May 2018. The holding period return between these two points in time is unchanged. This might be helpful to be aware for a long-investor term futures contract during this exact time period.

The top to-box price of oil moved emphatically between these two points in time, in any case, as did underlying organic market conditions. WTI prices before long collided with under $40 in January 2009 in the midst of the [Great Recession](/great-recession), moved back above $100 a barrel in May 2011, then, at that point, generally moved sideways until July 2014. Then, prices plunged below $30 in February 2016 as [shale-oil](/shaleoil) extraction lifted inventories, before at last returning to $70 in May 2018 as those inventories ebbed and inflation started to creep higher.

Through this large number of gyrations, the holding period return, excluding fees and expenses, is as yet unchanged.
