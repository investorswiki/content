# Junk Fees
## What Are Junk Fees?

Junk fees are a series of charges that a lender forces at the closing of a [mortgage](/mortgage). These charges are many times unforeseen by the borrower and not obviously made sense of by the lender. This surprise factor can lead to the impression that these fees are unnecessary and attached to other authentic [closing costs](/closingcosts) without valid justification.

## Understanding Junk Fees

Junk fees are a subset of the costs that show up on each [HUD-1 settlement statement](/hud-1). Generally, that statement was an independent form that federal law required a lender to give a borrower at closing. It contained a nitty gritty organization of all costs associated with the loan.

Prior to closing, exactly when the parties consent to the terms of the loan and start arrangements for closing, the lender was required to give a [good faith estimate](/good_faith_estimate) (GFE) of those costs. In 2015, the [Consumer Financial Protection Bureau](/consumer-financial-protection-bureau-cfpb) (CFPB) consolidated these documents into one form, the closing disclosure.

The costs listed on the HUD-1 territory from boilerplate things like home inspection and [title search](/titlesearch) fees to additional problematic costs that some think about junk. The last option group can contain things, for example, a document planning fee, an application fee, a funding fee, a verification of employment fee, a sign-up fee, a translation fee, or an automated [underwriting fee](/underwriting-fees).

The borrower has consistently reserved the option to challenge these fees and arrange them with the lender, however numerous lenders have found it productive to expect that borrowers will fail to challenge these fees. Pundits of the mortgage industry have likewise contended that lenders don't stick to the honest intentions requirement of the GFE and generously add fees to the last HUD-1 statement that were never remembered for the GFE.

Junk fees wind up expanding the price of buying a home and may not be planned into the cost plan of a homebuyer. Much of the time, this may financially stretch out a buyer to a last cost that they are not happy with. It likewise leaves a terrible taste with respect to the home buying process that ought to generally be a cheerful moment for a great many people.

## Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) Reforms on the Closing Process

The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau's (Cfpb's) 2015 reforms to the closing system not just streamlined the administrative work associated with the closing system, however they likewise settled limitations on fees and changes that could be made after the GFE was given to the borrower.

Part of the aim of these changes was to limit lenders' ability to add junk fees that borrowers could disregard. The major change that the CFPB established in this new set of rules is a limitation on the permissible inflation of charges listed on the lending estimate (LE), the document formerly known as the GFE.

By and large, no fee can be increased by over 10% from the LE to the last closing statement. If a major change in the conditions of the [loan](/loan) has happened, the lender should permit the borrower to survey another LE as the limitations stated by the CFPB may never again apply.

Junk fees are not generally unlawful. Even with the efforts of the CFPB to safeguard borrowers against misleading lending rehearses, the borrower bears the burden of carefully analyzing and addressing fees that seem superfluous. It is consistently the lender's goal to close a mortgage so they can earn revenue, thusly they are normally open to negotiation to guarantee that the mortgage closes.
