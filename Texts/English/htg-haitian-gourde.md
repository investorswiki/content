## History of the Haitian Gourde
<!--3233B175247114C567937EC9A15C5AEB-->
       The Haitian gourde originally coursed as a currency well defined for Haiti in 1813. Before its presentation, the country utilized the pioneer **livre**. The livre was [pegged](/currency-peg) to the French livre [at par](/at-par), or one provincial livre to one French livre. The livre separated into 20 **sous**, and 15 sous rose to one Spanish provincial **real**. Along these lines, the frontier livre was basically pegged to both French and Spanish currencies.

Introducing the primary Haitian gourde in 1813 was a step in recognizing the greater independence of Haiti. The gourde supplanted the livre at a rate of eight livres and five sous for each one gourde. This exchange rate muddled currency transformations. During the first and second issues of the gourde, it vacillated with the pegged currencies. As the franc rose to turn into the primary currency in France in 1881, the gourde pegged to the franc at a rate of five French francs to one gourde.

The second issue of the gourde was due to [revaluing](/revaluation) the currency in 1870. The government issued [banknotes](/banknote) for this new gourde in categories of 10 and 25 gourdes, yet coins were not delivered.

The issuance of the third gourde occurred in 1872 and is still being used today. Yet again revaluation of the gourde caused the new currency giving. The third gourde exchanged at a rate of 300 second-issue notes to 33% issue note. Pegging for the third gourde was to the French franc and later to the USD.

In 1912, the gourde was pegged to the USD at a rate of five gourdes to one dollar. This rate of exchange caused the utilization of calling five gourdes a Haitian dollar, and five centimes a Haitian penny. The gourde hence un-pegged from the USD in 1989 and presently [floats freely](/floatingexchangerate) against world currencies.

## Brief History and Economic Background of Haiti

Haiti sits on the island of Hispaniola. The country shares the island with the Dominican Republic. It was a Spanish state somewhere in the range of 1492 and 1625, then, at that point, fell under French rule until 1804. Haiti began to fight for independence in 1791 through a revolt of self-liberated slaves. They would understand their dream in 1804; in any case, the U.S. furthermore, the majority of Europe didn't perceive the country. At first the island was isolated, yet it would form a unified republic by 1859.

Distribution of wealth in Haiti is a continuous issue. Haiti is quite possibly of the poorest country in the Americas, and the island needs sufficient healthcare, education, and has poor infrastructure. Corruption in the government has prompted the restricting of aid to the country.

[Gross domestic product](/gdp) (GDP) swayed somewhere in the range of 1.2% and 1.5% somewhere in the range of 2015 and 2018, with - 9.87% in 2019 and - 4.11% in 2020.[ Inflation](/inflation) was 6.7% in 2015, 12% in 2016, 11% in 2017, 12.4% in 2018, and 18.7% in 2019 as per World Bank data, and rose to 22.4% in 2020.

## Illustration of HTG on the Forex Market

Expect that the exchange rate for the USD/HTG [currency pair](/currencypair) is 113.4. This means it costs 113.4 gourdes to buy one USD.

The exchange rate had floated almost 40 from 2004 to 2014. In those days, the HTG was more grounded since it took less gourdes to buy one USD. Starting in 2014, the HTG started to diminish, moving close to 100 of every 2019. In the event that the rate keeps on moving over 113, it would mean the HTG is continuing to debilitate, as it costs more gourdes to buy one USD.

To figure out the number of U.S. dollars it takes to buy one gourde, partition one by the USD/HTG exchange rate. For instance, partition one by 113.4. This delivers the HTG/USD rate (notice the codes have flipped) of 0.0088. That means that one gourde will buy somewhat less than US $0.01.
