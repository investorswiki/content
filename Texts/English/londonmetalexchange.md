The London Metal Exchange can be followed back similarly as the opening of the Royal Exchange in London in 1571, where traders in metal and a scope of different commodities started to meet. As Britain turned into a major exporter of metals, European merchants started to show up to participate in these activities.

As per the LME's website, the beginning of the "ring" custom started in the mid eighteenth century in the Jerusalem Coffee House.

All those wishing to trade would collect around the circle and make their offers and offers.

In 2012, the LME was acquired by the [Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing](/hkex). Consolidation has turned into a common trend among the world's exchanges as they fight to reduce costs and lift their survival possibilities in an exceptionally competitive sector. For instance, the [CME Group](/cme) acquired the New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX) in 2008. NYMEX, thus, had merged with the Comex commodities exchange in 1994, creating the largest physical commodity exchange at that point.
