# Forex Hedge
## What is a Forex Hedge?

A forex hedge is a transaction executed to safeguard an existing or anticipated position from an undesirable move in exchange rates. Forex hedges are utilized by a broad scope of market participants, including investors, traders and organizations. By utilizing a forex hedge appropriately, an individual who is long a foreign [currency pair](/currencypair) or hoping to be in the future by means of a transaction can be protected from [downside risk](/downsiderisk). On the other hand, a trader or investor who is short a foreign currency pair can safeguard against upside risk utilizing a forex hedge.

## Understanding a Forex Hedge

It is important to recall that a [hedge](/hedge) isn't a money making strategy. A forex hedge is intended to shield from losses, not to create a gain. Besides, most hedges are expected to eliminate a portion of the exposure risk as opposed to every last bit of it, as there are costs to hedging that can offset the benefits after a certain point.

In this way, in the event that a Japanese company is hoping to sell equipment in U.S. dollars, for instance, it might safeguard a portion of the transaction by taking out a [currency option](/currencyoption) that will profit assuming that the Japanese yen expansions in value against the dollar. In the event that the transaction happens unprotected and the dollar reinforces or remains stable against the yen, then the company is just out the cost of the option. In the event that the dollar debilitates, the profit from the currency option can offset a portion of the losses realized while localizing the funds received from the sale.

## Utilizing a Forex Hedge

The primary methods of hedging currency trades are [spot contracts](/spottrade), foreign currency options and [currency futures](/currencyfuture). Spot contracts are the all around average trades made by retail forex traders. Since spot contracts have an extremely short-term [delivery date](/deliverydate) (two days), they are not the best currency hedging vehicle. As a matter of fact, normal spot contracts are much of the time why a hedge is required.

Foreign currency options are one of the most well known methods of currency hedging. Similarly as with options on different types of securities, foreign currency options give the purchaser the right, however not the obligation, to buy or sell the currency pair at a specific [exchange rate](/exchangerate) sooner or later. Normal options strategies can be employed, for example, long [straddles](/ride), long [strangles](/choke), and bull or [bear spreads](/bearspread), to limit the loss capability of a given trade.

## Illustration of a Forex Hedge

For instance, if a U.S. investment bank was scheduled to localize a few profits earned in Europe it could hedge a portion of the expected profits through an option. Since the scheduled transaction is sell euro and buy U.S. dollars, the investment bank would buy a [put option](/putoption) to sell euro. By buying the put option the company would secure an 'even from a pessimistic standpoint' rate for its impending transaction, which would be the strike price. As in the Japanese company model, on the off chance that the currency is over the strike price at expiry, the company wouldn't exercise the option and essentially do the transaction in the open market. The cost of the hedge is the cost of the put option.

Not all retail [forex brokers](/currency-exchanging forex-brokers) take into account hedging inside their platforms. Make certain to research the broker you use before beginning to trade.
