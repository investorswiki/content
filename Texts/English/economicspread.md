# Economic Spread
## What Is an Economic Spread?

An economic spread is a performance metric that is equivalent to the difference between a company's [weighted average cost of capital](/wacc) (WACC) and its [return on invested capital](/returnoninvestmentcapital) (ROIC).

The term can be utilized to measure the difference between the [real rate of return](/realrateofreturn) on an investment and the rate of [inflation](/inflation) in the economy.

## Grasping Economic Spreads

Assuming the cost of capital surpasses the return on invested capital, the company is losing money; how the capital is doing its assets isn't adequately giving to cover the cost of borrowing or utilizing it. This could be down to shortcomings or only a poor investment.

A company with a high economic spread is an indication of proficiency and great overall performance. Going against the norm, a company can have a negative economic spread, which can be an indication of stress on its assets and can frequently mean the assets are obsolete or the company is over-utilized.

A few financial pundits allude to economic spread as [market value added](/mva) in light of the fact that the spread is a representation of a company's value from an operations outlook.

This nominal loss results from the way that the invested capital can not buy as much for the investor in the future as possible right now.
