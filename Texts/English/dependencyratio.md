## What Does the Dependency Ratio Tell You?

A high dependency ratio means those of working age, and the overall economy, face a greater burden in supporting the aging population. The young dependency ratio incorporates those main under 15, and the elderly dependency ratio centers around those more than 64.

The dependency ratio centers around isolating those of [working age](/working-age-population), considered between the ages of 15 and 64 years old, from those of non-working age.

This is due to the reality those north of 64 frequently require more government assistance than dependents younger than 15. As the overall age of the population rises, the ratio can be moved to mirror the increased necessities associated with an aging population.
