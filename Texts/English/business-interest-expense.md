# Business Interest Expense
## What Is a Business Interest Expense?

A business interest expense is the cost of interest that is charged on business loans used to keep up with operations. Business interest expenses might be [deductible](/interest-deduction) as an ordinary business expense for certain businesses.

## Understanding a Business Interest Expense

A business interest expense is any interest associated with a loan that is utilized to pay for business operations or associated expenses. The primary focal point of a business interest expense, and subsequently the significance put on its classification, is the ability for the expenses to be deductible.

Generally, for loan [interest](/interest) to be deductible, the loan must be utilized to either purchase assets for the business or to pay for [business expenses](/businessexpenses). In the event that any amount of the loan is utilized for nonbusiness purposes, the amount of deductible interest from the loan must be reduced proportionately. For instance, any investment interest wouldn't count as a business interest expense and thusly not be deductible under the tax laws for interest expense deductions.

## Business Interest Expense Deduction

In the United States, the 2017 entry of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act accommodated several provisions that reduce the tax burden for businesses. Among the main changes is a reduction in the [corporate tax rate](/corporatetax) to 21% from 35%, as well as another 20% deduction on qualified business income. To offset those cuts, Congress put new limitations on the amount of interest that would be deductible for certain types of businesses.

Before 2018, taxpayers had the option to deduct business interest for certain rare special cases. With the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act changes, the deduction for net business interest is presently limited to 30% of a taxpayer's adjusted taxable income.

The deduction limitation for taxable income doesn't consider business interest expenses and income, [net operating losses](/netoperatingloss), non-business income (like gains from assets that were held as investments), and [depreciation](/depreciation), [amortization](/amortization), or [depletion](/depletion). The limitation doesn't matter to interest earned from investments. The deduction for depreciation, amortization, or depletion is just applicable through 2021, so businesses that are capital intensive can expect higher tax bills in 2022.

Business expenses must be deducted on the legitimate tax form that connects to the business for which the expenditure was made. Taxpayers who bring about corporate business expenses can't deduct this expense on their returns. The business must repay the taxpayer and afterward deduct the reimbursement on the corporate return.

The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) has spread out guidance on business interest expense limitations in Notice 2018-28.

## Special Considerations

The previously mentioned deductibility limitation doesn't make a difference to a couple of types of substances, for example, small businesses, ranches, real estate investment companies, and certain utilities. In this case, a "small business" is depicted as a company with average annual gross receipts of $25 million or less over a trailing three-year period. The three-year lookback guarantees that companies can't be broken up to come in under the $25 million threshold.
