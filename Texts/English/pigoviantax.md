# Pigovian Tax
## What Is a Pigovian Tax?

A Pigovian (likewise spelled Pigouvian) tax is a tax assessed against private individuals or businesses for taking part in activities that make adverse secondary effects for society. Adverse incidental effects are those costs that are excluded as a part of the item's [market price](/market-price). These incorporate environmental pollution, burdens on public healthcare from the sale of tobacco products, and whatever other secondary effects that have an outer, negative impact.

Pigovian taxes were named after English economist, Arthur Pigou, a critical supporter of early [externality](/externality) theory.

## Understanding a Pigovian Tax

The Pigovian tax is intended to discourage activities that impose a cost of production onto outsiders and society as a whole. As indicated by Pigou, [negative externalities](/externality-of-production) prevent a market economy from arriving at equilibrium when producers don't take on all costs of production. This adverse effect may be amended, he suggested, by levying taxes equivalent to the externalized costs. In a perfect world, the tax would be equivalent to the outside damage brought about by the producer and subsequently reduce the outer costs proceeding.

Negative externalities are not "genuinely terrible." Instead, a negative externality happens at whatever point an economic entity doesn't completely incorporate the costs of its activity. In these circumstances, society, including the environment, bears a large portion of the costs of economic activity.

A famous illustration of a Pigovian-style tax is a tax on pollution. Pollution from a factory makes a negative externality on the grounds that impacted outsiders bear part of the cost of pollution. This cost could manifest through sullied property or wellbeing risks. The polluter just thinks about the private costs, not the outside costs.

When Pigou factored in outside costs to society, the economy endured [deadweight loss](/deadweightloss) from excess pollution past the "socially ideal" level. Pigou accepted that state intervention ought to address negative externalities, which he considered a [market failure](/marketfailure). He suggested that this be achieved through taxation.

## Benefits and Disadvantages of a Pigovian Tax
### Benefits

Economists favor Pigouvian taxes since they will more often than not right for negative externalities, which are generally a burden on the public. For instance, air pollution from a factory is borne out in medical problems like cellular breakdown in the lungs among the population. On the off chance that the polluter were forced to pay a tax, it wouldn't just assist with offsetting the economic cost of such illnesses, it would discourage the factory from contaminating such a great amount in any case. This means that Pigouvian taxes benefit society and will quite often work on social welfare, insofar as they are appropriately applied.

### Disservices

Pigou's externality speculations were prevailing in mainstream economics for quite some time yet lost favor after Nobel Prize-victor, [Ronald Coase](/ronald-h-coase), introduced his thoughts. Using Pigou's scientific structure, Coase showed that Pigou's examination and solution were many times wrong, for no less than three separate reasons:

1. Negative externalities didn't be guaranteed to lead to an inefficient outcome.
1. Even assuming that they were inefficient, Pigovian taxes didn't will more often than not lead to an efficient outcome.
1. The critical element is transaction cost theory, not externality theory.

Pigovian taxes likewise experience what Austrian economist [Ludwig von Mises](/ludwig-von-mises) first portrayed as "estimation and information issues." A government can't issue the right Pigovian tax without knowing in advance what the most efficient outcome is. This would require knowing the exact amount of the externality cost imposed by the producer, as well as the right price and output for the specific market. Assuming administrators misjudge the outer costs included, Pigovian taxes really hurt more than great.

## Instances of a Pigovian Tax

Notwithstanding any counterarguments towards Pigou's hypotheses, Pigovian taxes are common in society today. One of the most famous Pigovian taxes is a [carbon emissions tax](/carbon-dioxide-tax). Governments impose a carbon emissions tax on any company that consumes non-renewable energy sources. At the point when consumed, petroleum derivatives produce ozone harming substances, the reason for global warming, which is harming our planet in a huge number of ways.

The carbon tax is expected to factor in the real cost of consuming non-renewable energy sources, which is paid by society. The end job of the carbon tax is to guarantee that the producers of carbon products are the ones bringing about this outer cost.

Another Pigovian tax, common in Europe, is a tax on plastic bags, and in some cases even paper bags. This encourages consumers to bring their own reusable bags from home to deflect the utilization of plastic and paper. Plastic is a side-effect of consuming petroleum products and results in the damage to marine life, while paper bags encourage deforestation. By charging even a small amount, similar to a couple of pennies for each bag, it encourages customers to bring along their own reusable bags.

[Taxes on "sin" items](/sin_tax) like liquor and cigarettes can be understood as a Pigovian tax. This is on the grounds that they discourage behavior that not can hurt an individual client, yet in addition has thump on effects for other people. Recycled smoke is a conspicuous model, however so too is the healthcare burden of smokers who become ill with malignant growth or emphysema. Liquor is responsible for plastered driving mishaps, including wounds and passings among innocent others.

Every one of the above cases refer to negative externalities, whose price doesn't think about the cost to society. The carried out taxes are a measure to reallocate those costs back to the producer or client that creates the negative externality.

> Gasoline taxes can be viewed as Pigouvian taxes since they discourage superfluous driving, and proceeds are utilized to build, repair, and upgrade transportation infrastructure that benefits society. Each state has its own gas tax in the U.S., and the federal government imposes an extra gas tax of 18.3 pennies per gallon for unleaded gasoline (24.3 pennies for diesel).

## Features
- Pigovian taxes are intended to approach the cost of the negative externality yet can be hard to decide and whenever misjudged can hurt society.
- A carbon emissions tax or a tax on plastic bags are instances of Pigovian taxes.
- Economists contend that the costs of these negative externalities, like environmental pollution, are borne by society instead of the producer.
- The purpose of the Pigovian tax is to reallocate the cost back to the producer or client of the negative externality.
- A Pigovian tax is expected to tax the producer of goods or services that make adverse secondary effects for society.
## FAQ
### What Is a Negative Externality?
In economics, a negative externality is a side-effect delivered by some individual, business, or industry that adversely affects society, yet where the entity that made this result doesn't pay for it. All things considered, society pays the price. Models incorporate air and noise pollution, toxic runoff, and the unintentional killing of pollinators through pesticides, among several others.
### What Is the Difference Between a Pigovian Tax and a Sin Tax?
Pigouvian taxes and sin taxes are very comparative and a specific levy might fulfill the two categories. The key difference is that a Pigouvian tax looks for essentially to limit negative externalities (i.e., damages to other people or society as a whole), while sin taxes try to reduce negative **internalities** (i.e., damages to oneself). On account of cigarettes and liquor, for instance, there are both likely negative internalities and externalities.
### How Do You Calculate a Pigovian Tax?
Working out a Pigouvian tax is famously hard to get right. In theory, the amount of the tax ought to be precisely equivalent to the net cost of the externality it looks to cure. In this manner, the tax would be equivalent to the difference between the social cost and the marginal private cost at a given level of production.
