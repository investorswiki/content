## What Is Quantitative Easing (QE) in Simple Terms?
In modern finance, when the economy hits a difficult situation, central banks frequently act the hero with emergency monetary stimulus, known as **quantitative easing (QE)**.

The central bank isn't buying products or administrations; it's not buying cars, for instance. Doing so would mean more money chasing less goods.
