# Lemons Problem
## What Is the Lemons Problem?

The lemons problem alludes to issues that emerge with respect to the value of an investment or product due to asymmetric data moved by the buyer and the seller. The theory of the lemons problem was put forward in a 1970 research paper in **The Quarterly Journal of Economics**, named, "The Market for 'Lemons': Quality Uncertainty and the Market Mechanism," written by George A. Akerlof, an economist and teacher at the University of California, Berkeley.

## Figuring out the Lemons Problem

In his paper, Akerlof analyzed the pre-owned vehicle market and showed how the [asymmetry of information](/asymmetricinformation) between the seller and buyer could make the market collapse, disposing of any opportunity for beneficial exchange and leaving behind as it were "lemons," or poor products with low strength that the buyer purchased without adequate data.

The problem of asymmetrical data emerges in light of the fact that buyers and sellers don't have equivalent measures of data required to pursue an educated choice in regards to a transaction. The seller or holder of a product or service generally knows its true value or if nothing else knows whether it is above or below average in quality. Expected buyers, in any case, commonly don't have this information, since they are not conscious of all the data that the seller has.

Akerlof's original illustration of the purchase of a trade-in vehicle noticed that the likely buyer of a pre-owned vehicle can only with significant effort find out the true value of the vehicle. Subsequently, they might pay something like a [average price](/averageprice), which they see as somewhere close to a bargain price and a premium price.

Taking on such a position may at first seem to offer the buyer some degree of financial protection from the risk of buying a lemon. Akerlof brought up, notwithstanding, that this position really leans toward the seller, since getting an average price for a lemon would in any case be beyond what the seller could get on the off chance that the buyer had the information that the vehicle was a lemon.

Unexpectedly, the lemons problem makes a weakness for the seller of a premium vehicle, since the expected buyer's asymmetric data — and the subsequent fear of stalling out with a lemon — means that they are not ready to offer a premium price for a vehicle of predominant value.

## Solutions to the Lemons Problem

The lemons problem exists in the marketplace for both consumer and business products, and furthermore in the arena of investing, connected with the disparity in the perceived value of an investment among buyers and sellers. The lemons problem is likewise common in the financial sector, including insurance and [credit markets](/credit_market). For instance, in the domain of [corporate finance](/corporatefinance), a lender has asymmetrical and not great data in regards to the genuine [creditworthiness](/credit-value) of a borrower.

Akerlof proposed strong [warranties](/guarantee) as one means of conquering the lemons problem, as they can safeguard a buyer from any negative results of buying a lemon. Another solution, one which Akerlof had close to zero familiarity with when he composed the paper in 1970, is the blast of promptly accessible, broad data that has been dispersed through the Internet and has additionally assisted with diminishing the problem.

For instance, data services, for example, Carfax and Angie's List assist buyers with feeling more positive about making a purchase, and they likewise benefit sellers since they empower them to command premium prices for truly premium products.
