## Types of Prepayment

Prepayments are common in various settings. Individuals and large organizations make prepayments.

### Corporate Prepayments

In the corporate environment, expenses are the most common prepayments. These expenditures are paid in full in one accounting period for goods or services that will be consumed in a future period. The prepayment is renamed as a normal expense when the asset is really utilized or consumed. A prepaid expense is first sorted as a current asset on the company's balance sheet.

For instance, a company can list $6,000 as a current asset under the prepaid rent account on its [balance sheet](/balancesheet) on the off chance that it rents office space for $1,000 per month and prepays a half year's rent. The company would reduce the current asset by $1,000 in each subsequent month and would list the expense on its income statement as an operating cost of $1,000 as the total prepaid rent expenses are really incurred.

### Prepayments by Individuals

Individuals additionally make prepayments, and the personal accounting process is a lot more straightforward. A consumer could run up a month to month credit card bill with a settlement date of 30 days after the month's end.

Assuming that a consumer causes $1,000 of total expenses on the card and pays it off on the 30th day of that month, it's viewed as a prepayment on the grounds that the bill isn't due for an additional 30 days. The consumer's credit card company tracks these prepayments, so there is little requirement for the consumer to personally account for it.

### Prepayment by Taxpayers

Taxpayers consistently — deliberately or not — make a prepayment of taxes when part of their pay is kept for taxes. Technically, taxes are due approximately April 15 every year, except their employers are required to keep taxes in each pay period and send the money to the government for the representative's sake.

Self-employed individuals are expected to make a prepayment of taxes by filing quarterly estimated taxes.

Regardless, in the event that they pay more than their taxes due for the year, taxpayers receive any excess back as a tax refund
