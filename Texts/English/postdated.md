# Postdated
## What's the significance here?

## Special Considerations

The [Uniform Commercial Code (UCC)](/uniform-commercial-code) empowers lenders to loan money, secured by a borrower's personal property. Adopted by virtually every state, the UCC is a standard set of business laws that was first distributed in 1952 to regulate financial contracts. Article 3, Section 113 of the UCC frames the rules for postdated checks. This section allows financial instruments to be either post or backdated and shows that the payment can't be made until the predefined date on the instrument.

Keep as a top priority, however, that banks and credit unions can cash postdated instruments early. While they may not do so intentionally, there are situations when checks are put through accidentally. For example, a teller may not notice the date on the check and cycle it that day. Or on the other hand an individual might deposit a check through the [automated teller machine (ATM)](/atm). Assuming the check goes through and bobs, the payer might be responsible for a NSF charge.

### Postdated Checks and Payday Loans
