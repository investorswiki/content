# Convenience Yield
## What is a Convenience Yield?

A convenience yield is the benefit or premium associated with holding an underlying product or physical great, as opposed to the associated derivative security or contract.

Once in a while, as the consequence of sporadic market developments, for example, a [inverted market](/invertedmarket), the holding of an underlying decent or security might turn out to be more productive than possessing the contract or [derivative instrument](/derivative) due to its relative scarcity versus high demand. Think about purchasing physical bundles of wheat as opposed to wheat future contracts. On the off chance that there's a sudden dry spell, and the requirement for wheat builds, the difference between the first [purchase price](/purchaseprice) of the wheat versus the price after the shock would be the convenience yield.

## Convenience Yield Explained

The storage of a physical decent or commodity closely connects with the convenience yield of products. Notwithstanding, there's a [inverse correlation](/inverse-correlation) between commodity prices and storage levels. In view of the levels of supply and demand, when storage levels of a commodity are scant, the commodity's price will in general rise. The inverse is likewise evident; when a commodity's storage levels are copious, the price normally diminishes.

Convenience yields will more often than not exist when the costs associated with physical storage, like warehousing, [insurance](/insurance), security, and so forth, are relatively low.

## Convenience Yield and Cost of Insurance

Investors can compute the convenience yield as the cost of insurance against price risk. The formula is calculated by duplicating the price of a [front-month](/front-month-contract) futures contract by the capital cost of money that is tied up in inventory, or [Euler's number](/eulers-consistent) raised to the borrowing rate duplicated when to maturity, then adding the storage cost and deducting the price of the futures contract for the back-month contract. Next, partition this calculation by the price of the front-month futures contract and add one to the quotient. The subsequent value is raised to the power of 365 separated by the number of days to maturity. At long last, deduct one from the subsequent value.

## Real World Example of Convenience Yield

The convenience yield is simple to compute on the off chance that a commodity's future price, spot price, borrowing rate and time to maturity are known. The futures price is calculated as the spot price increased by Euler's number, or the mathematical steady e, raised to the power of the difference between the borrowing rate and the convenience yield duplicated when to maturity. Thus, the convenience yield is settled to be the difference between the borrowing rate and one partitioned when to maturity increased by the natural log of the futures price separated by the spot price. This formula is utilized for ceaselessly [compounding](/compounding) rates and yields.

For instance, suppose that a trader wishes to work out the convenience yield of [West Texas Intermediate](/wti) (WTI) crude oil for delivery one year from today. Expect that the annual borrowing rate is 2%, the spot price of WTI crude oil is $50.50 and the futures price of crude oil contracts terminating one year from today is $45.50. In this way, the convenience yield is calculated to be 12.43% ceaselessly compounded each year, or 0.02 - (1/1) * LN($45.50/$50.50).

## Highlights
- Convenience yields regularly arise when costs associated with physical storage are low.
- A convenience yield is a premium associated with holding an underlying asset, as opposed to the associated derivative security or contract.
- Investors need to know the commodity's future price, spot price, borrowing rate and time to maturity to compute the convenience yield.
