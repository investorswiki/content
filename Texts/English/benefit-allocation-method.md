# Benefit Allocation Method
## What Is the Benefit Allocation Method?

A few companies that offer retirement pensions to their employees decide to fund them through the benefit allocation method. In this system, employees contribute a portion of their salaries to the fund while the company makes a single annual payment. That payment might be a fixed dollar amount or a percentage of salary.

Both the employee's contribution and the company's matching payment go into a fund that is invested in long-term assets.

## Figuring out the Benefit Allocation Method

Over the long haul, the joint payments by employer and employee develop into a pension fund that will be paid out to the employee as month to month annuity payments.

In basically any pension plan, the benefit every retired person receives depends on the employee's salary over the long run. The best-paying pensions are due to executives at the top compensation levels and the people who put in the most long periods of service, or both. There is regularly a vesting period, so employees who stay hands on just a short time might receive no pension.

Normally, the pension is paid as a month to month [annuity](/annuity) forever. Utilizing the benefit allocation method, payments are made for every time of service to the employer.

The particulars for each company's benefit allocation method are regularly covered in the company's [employee benefits plan](/employer_sponsored_plan).

## Benefit Allocation Method Considerations

A company that utilizes the benefit allocation method must consider that the cost of funding the pension plan will increase consistently from one year to another, for certain portions of their employee population. These costs can be amplified by the benefit allocation methodology.

Nonetheless, enrollment for most plans is open and new individuals join consistently. The key is to keep a balance. However long the average age of the employee population is somewhat stable, the low costs of more youthful individuals balance out the high costs for more seasoned employees, keeping contribution rates moderately reliable.

Taking everything into account, benefit allocation methods regularly bring about lower levels of funding than cost allocation methods.

## Cost Allocation Methods

Cost allocation methods view the total costs of the benefits, but they are accrued, as an amount to be allocated similarly to the entire long periods of service.

For instance, the [aggregate level cost method](/aggregatelevelcostmethod) commonly takes the current value of benefits minus asset value and spreads the excess amount over the future payroll of the participants.

Aggregate cost methods consider the whole group, with the cost of the plan calculated as a percentage of yearly payroll. The percent is adjusted yearly in the event that there are any [actuarial gains or losses](/actuarial-gain-misfortune).

## Highlights
- The benefit allocation method saves the money contributed by employer and employee into a fund that is invested to pay the benefit down the line.
- On the other hand, a cost allocation method gauges the overall cost of benefits that will be owed and saves that amount.
- A company that offers a pension benefit must reserve money to pay them, utilizing any of several accepted methods.
