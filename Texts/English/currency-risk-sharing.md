# Currency Risk Sharing
## What Is Currency Risk Sharing?

Currency risk sharing is an approach to hedging [currency risk](/currencyrisk) in which the two gatherings of a deal or a trade consent to share in the risk from exchange rate changes.

Investors or companies that have assets or business operations across national borders are presented to currency risk that might make erratic profits and losses. By going into a currency sharing agreement, at least two substances can mutually [hedge](/hedge) against those potential losses.

## Understanding Currency Risk Sharing

Currency risk sharing generally implies a legally binding price adjustment clause, wherein the base price of the transaction is adjusted in the event that the exchange rate changes past a specified neutral band or zone. Risk sharing in this manner happens provided that the exchange rate at the hour of transaction settlement is past the neutral band, in which case the two gatherings split the profit or loss.

By encouraging cooperation between the two gatherings, currency risk sharing disposes of the [zero-sum game](/zero-sumgame) nature of currency changes, in which one party benefits to the detriment of the other.

In any case, the degree of currency risk sharing will rely upon the relative bargaining position of the two gatherings and their readiness to go into such a risk-sharing arrangement. If the buyer (or seller) can direct terms and sees little risk of their profit margin is being affected by currency change, they might be less able to share the risk.

## Illustration of How Currency Risk Sharing Works

For instance, assume a speculative U.S. firm called ABC is bringing in 10 turbines from an European company called EC, priced at \u20ac1 million each for a total order size of \u20ac10 million. Inferable from their longstanding business relationship, the two companies consent to a currency risk sharing agreement. Payment by ABC is due in 90 days, and the company consents to pay EC at a [spot rate](/spot_rate) in 90 days of \u20ac1 = $1.30, and that means that every turbine would cost it $1.3 million, for a total payment obligation of $13 million. The currency risk sharing contract among EC and ABC specifies that the price per turbine will be adjusted assuming the euro trades below $1.25 or above $1.35.

Hence, a [price band](/price-band) of $1.25 to $1.35 forms the neutral zone over which currency risk won't be shared.

In 90 days, assume the spot rate is \u20ac1 = $1.38. Rather than ABC paying EC the equivalent of $1.38 million (or \u20ac1 million) per turbine, the two companies split the difference between the base price of $1.3 million and the [current price](/currentprice) (in dollars) of $1.38 million. The adjusted price per turbine is accordingly the euro equivalent of $1.34 million, which works out to \u20ac971,014.50 at the current exchange rate of 1.38. Consequently, ABC has gotten a price discount of 2.9%, which is half of the 5.8% depreciation in the dollar versus the euro. The total price paid by ABC to EC is in this way \u20ac9.71 million, which, at the exchange rate of 1.38, works out to precisely $13.4 million.

Then again, assuming that the spot rate in 90 days is \u20ac1 = $1.22, rather than ABC paying EC the equivalent of $1.22 million for every turbine, the two companies split the difference between the base price of $1.3 million and the current price of $1.22 million. The adjusted price per turbine is in this manner the euro equivalent of $1.26 million, which works out to \u20ac1,032,786.89 (at the current exchange rate of 1.22). Eventually, ABC pays an extra 3.28% per turbine, which is one-half of the 6.56% appreciation in the dollar.

## Features
- These agreements are not normalized nor typical, thus the presence of such an agreement and its terms will rely upon the ability of one of the counterparties to bargain with the other.
- Currency risk sharing clauses normally implies a foreordained base exchange rate and a threshold that, whenever crossed, will trigger the mutual split of the loss.
- Currency risk sharing is a contractual agreement between counterparties to a trade or deal to share in any losses due to currency risk or exchange rate variances.
