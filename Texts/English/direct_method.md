# Direct Method
## What Is the Direct Method?

The direct method is one of two accounting medicines used to produce a [cash flow statement](/cashflowstatement). The statement of cash flows direct method utilizes genuine cash inflows and outflows from the company's operations, rather than changing the operating section from [accrual accounting](/accrualaccounting) to a cash basis. Accrual accounting perceives revenue when it is earned versus when the payment is received from a customer.

On the other hand, the cash flow direct method measures just the cash that has been received, which is commonly from customers and the cash payments or outflows, for example, to providers. The inflows and outflows are netted to show up at the cash flow. The direct method is otherwise called the income statement method.

## Figuring out the Direct Method

The three principal financial statements are the balance sheet, income statement, and [cash flow statement](/cashflowstatement). The cash flow statement is separated into three classifications — cash flow from operating, cash flow from financing, and cash flow from investing activities. The cash flow statement can be prepared utilizing either the direct or indirect method. The cash flow from financing and investing activities' sections will be indistinguishable under both the indirect and direct method.

The indirect method for ascertaining cash flow from operations utilizes accrual accounting data, and it generally starts with the [net income](/netincome) from the income statement. The net income is then adjusted for changes in the asset and liability accounts on the [balance sheet](/balancesheet) by adding to or deducting from net income to get the cash flow from operations.

Under the direct method, the main section of the statement of cash flows that will contrast in the show is the cash flow from the operations section. The direct method records the cash receipts and cash payments made during the accounting period. The cash outflows are deducted from the cash inflows to work out the net cash flow from operating activities, before the net cash from investing and financing activities are incorporated to get the net cash increase or reduction in the company for that period of time.

## Intricacies of the Direct Method

The difficulty and time required to list all the cash payment and receipts — required for the direct method — makes the indirect method a preferred and all the more generally utilized practice. Since most companies utilize the accrual method of accounting, business activities are recorded on the balance sheet and income statement steady with this method.

For instance, a company utilizing accrual accounting will report [sales](/sale) revenue on the income statement in the current period even on the off chance that the sale was made on credit and cash has not yet been received from the customer. This equivalent amount would likewise show up on the balance sheet in accounts receivable. Companies that utilization accrual accounting don't likewise collect and store value-based data per customer or provider on a cash basis.

One more complexity of the direct method is that the FASB requires a business utilizing the direct method to uncover the reconciliation of net income to the cash flow from operating activities that would have been reported assuming the indirect method had been utilized to prepare the statement. The [reconciliation](/reconciliation) report is utilized to check the precision of the operating activities, and it is like the indirect report. The reconciliation report starts by listing the net income and adjusting it for non-cash transactions and changes yet to be determined sheet accounts. This additional task makes the direct method disliked among companies.

## Direct Method Example

Listing out data this way furnishes the financial statement client with a more definite perspective on where a company's cash came from and the way things were dispensed. Consequently, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) suggests companies utilize the direct method.
