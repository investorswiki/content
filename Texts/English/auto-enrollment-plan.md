# Auto Enrollment Plan
## What Is an Auto Enrollment Plan?

An auto-enrollment plan is a retirement savings plan in which employees are automatically enrolled to contribute a certain amount of their salary every paycheck. Auto-enrollment plans don't need the employee to make a move or to unequivocally consent to take part in an employer-sponsored retirement plan, similar to a [401(k)](/401kplan).

In such plans, the employer concludes which percentage of the employee's paycheck will automatically be placed in a retirement account — commonly 3% — and furthermore chooses whether to increase that percentage every year, maybe by 1% each year until the employee is contributing 10%.

## How an Auto Enrollment Plan Works

Automatic enrollment plans are expected to increase the number of workers who put something aside for [retirement](/retirement). While numerous employers have laid out retirement savings plans, these plans generally require the employee to opt in and to pick which percentage of their paychecks to have their employer place in retirement savings.

Numerous employees don't make this stride, and accordingly, they pass up [employer-matching contributions](/matchingcontribution) when they're offered, and they don't set to the side enough for retirement.

A 2018 report from the investment management firm Vanguard found that among the employer-sponsored retirement plans it managed, automatic enrollment essentially increased retirement plan participation by low-income employees, youthful employees and minority employees, as well as fundamentally expanding retirement plan participation by all employees.

## Employers Decision to Adopt Auto Enrollment

Employers could choose to adopt auto-enrollment to increase their employees' retirement plan participation. At the point when they do, they likewise need to pick a default investment for employees' retirement plan contributions. Employers can limit their fiduciary liability by picking lifecycle funds or balanced funds that are intended to assist employees with earning enough of an investment return to retire while facing the suitable amount of challenge for their age.

Even with auto-enrollment, employees frequently are given numerous decisions concerning how their money can pick how their money is invested. They don't need to remain invested in the default option and they can direct future contributions to one more option too. They can likewise decide to change their default contribution amount, the percentage that is kept from every paycheck, or opt out of contributing out and out.

Other than aiding their employees, one more incentive for employers to pick auto-enrollment is that it increases the probability that, if the IRS reviews the organization's retirement program, the [IRS ](/irs) will find the plan in compliance with the nondiscrimination rules employers need to follow when they offer retirement plans.
