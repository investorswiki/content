## More profound definition
At the point when an estate goes through probate, the executor, who is either named in the will or designated by a judge, records desk work in probate court to begin the cycle. The executor must initially demonstrate to the court the legitimacy of the deceased person's will and give the court a rundown of that person's property and beneficiaries. The court then chooses whether or not to sell the assets to pay obligations and taxes before distributing assets to the beneficiaries of the estate. During this interaction, the executor is likewise the manager of the assets.
An extended probate process reduces the amount of money left over for beneficiaries in light of the fact that the estate must pay court and attorney fees.
The individuals who need to stay away from probate have a couple of alternatives for passing along what they own without the court's contribution:
- **Revocable living trust** is a written agreement like a will that transfers ownership of property to a trust and names a trustee to deal with one's property.

Certain individuals utilize a trust to oversee money designated for minor children in the event of a parent's death.
- **Payable-on-death account (POD):** Sometimes alluded to as a "totten trust," a POD account specifies who gets the assets of a checking or savings account, security deposit, savings bond, or certificate of deposit after the original owner's death.

At the point when that person kicks the bucket, the bank quickly transfers the assets to the beneficiary and the funds don't go through probate.
- **Joint tenancy**: When at least two individuals similarly own property together or share a lease, they might decide to lay out joint tenancy.

With this information, they might decide to make a trust that gives more control over the assets and rewards beneficiaries for responsible financial behavior.
