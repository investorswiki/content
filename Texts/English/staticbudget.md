# Static Budget
## What Is a Static Budget?

A static budget is a type of budget that consolidates anticipated values about data sources and results that are considered before the period being referred to starts. A static budget-which is a forecast of [revenue](/revenue) and [expenses](/expense) over a specific period-stays unchanged even with increases or diminishes in sales and production volumes. Notwithstanding, when compared to the genuine outcomes that are received sometime later, the numbers from static [budgets](/budget) can be very unique in relation to the real outcomes. Static budgets are utilized by accountants, finance experts, and the management groups of companies hoping to check the financial performance of a company over the long run.

## Figuring out a Static Budget

The static budget is planned to be fixed and perpetual for the duration of the period, paying little heed to changes that might influence results. While utilizing a static budget, a few managers use it as a target for expenses, costs, and revenue while others utilize a static budget to forecast the company's numbers.

For instance, under a static budget, a company would set an anticipated expense, express $30,000 for a marketing campaign, as long as necessary. It is then dependent upon managers to stick to that budget paying little mind to how the cost of generating that campaign really tracks during the period.

## Benefits of a Static Budget

A static budget assists with monitoring expenses, sales, and revenue, which assists organizations with accomplishing optimal financial performance. By keeping every department or division inside budget, companies can stay on target with their long-term financial objectives. A static budget fills in as an aide or guide for the overall heading of the company.

Inside an organization, static budgets are frequently utilized by accountants and chief financial officers (CFOs)- furnishing them with financial control.

In short, a very much oversaw static budget is a [cash flow](/cashflow) planning tool for companies. Legitimate cash flow management guarantees companies have the cash accessible in the event a situation arises where cash is required, for example, a breakdown in equipment or extra employees required for additional time.

While utilizing a static budget, a company or organization can follow where the money is being spent, how much revenue is coming in, and assist keep focused with its financial objectives.

## Static Budgets versus Flexible Budgets

Dissimilar to a static budget, a flexible budget changes or varies with changes in sales, production volumes, or business activity. A flexible budget may be utilized, for instance, on the off chance that extra raw materials are required as production volumes increase due to seasonality in sales. Likewise, transitory staff or extra employees required for extra time during active times are best budgeted utilizing a flexible budget versus a static one.

For instance, suppose a company had a static budget for sales commissions by which the company's management allocated $50,000 to pay the sales staff a commission. No matter what the total sales volume-whether it was $100,000 or $1,000,000-the commissions per employee would be isolated by the $50,000 static-budget amount. Notwithstanding, a flexible budget permits managers to assign a percentage of sales in computing the sales commissions. The management could assign a 7% commission for the total sales volume created. Despite the fact that with the flexible budget, costs would rise as sales commissions increased, so too would revenue from the extra sales created.

## Limitations of Static Budgets

Static budgeting is compelled by the ability of an organization to precisely forecast its required expenses, the amount to apportion to those costs and its operating revenue for the impending period.

Static budgets might be more effective for organizations that have exceptionally unsurprising sales and costs, and for shorter-term periods. For example, in the event that a company sees similar costs in materials, utilities, labor, advertising, and production a large number of months to keep up with its operations and there is no expectation of change, a static budget might be appropriate for its requirements.

In the event that such predictive planning is preposterous, there will be a disparity between the static budget and genuine outcomes. Interestingly, a flexible budget could base its marketing expenses on a percentage of overall sales for the period. That would mean the budget would vary along with the company's performance and real costs.

At the point when the static budget is compared to different features of the budgeting system (like the flexible budget and the genuine outcomes), two types of [budget variances](/budget-variance) can be derived:

1. Static Budget Variance: The difference between the genuine outcomes and the static budget

2. Sales Volume Variance: The difference between the flexible budget and the static budget

These variances are utilized to survey whether the differences were great (increased profits) or unfavorable (diminished profits). On the off chance that an organization's genuine costs were below the static budget and revenue surpassed expectations, the subsequent lift in profit would be a great outcome. On the other hand, on the off chance that revenue didn't essentially meet the targets set in the static budget, or on the other hand assuming genuine costs surpassed the pre-laid out limits, the outcome would lead to bring down profits.
