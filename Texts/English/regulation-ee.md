# Regulation EE
## What Is Regulation EE?

Regulation EE, in some cases alluded to as netting qualification, is a rule set forward by the U.S. Federal Reserve Board. It extends the [FDIC Improvement Act](/federal-deposit-insurance-corporation-improvement-act-fdicia) of 1991 definition of "financial institution" to incorporate financial market participants who profit themselves of the act's netting provisions in regards to contracts in which the gatherings agree to pay or receive the net, as opposed to the gross, payment due.

## How Regulation EE Works

Regulation EE permits banks, investment brokers, and clearing organizations to settle mutual obligations at their net rather than their gross value. This form of settlement is known as contractual [netting](/netting). Netting offsets the value of various positions or payments due to be traded between at least two gatherings. In this way, if Party An owes Party B $1 million and Party B owes Party A $200,000, it would be netted to one transfer of $800,000 as opposed to two payments of $1 million and $200,000.

At the hour of its enactment in the mid 1990s, the Federal Reserve stated that the purpose of Regulation EE's expanded definition of financial institutions was to improve proficiency and reduce systemic risk in the [financial markets](/financial-market). In 2019 and again in 2021, the Federal Reserve additionally expanded the definition of financial institutions.

This expansion included extending the definition of financial institutions, as what a "financial institution" is changed definitely from the enactment of Regulation EE in 1994, per the Federal Reserve [Board of Governors](/board-of-governors). The expansion included adding [swap dealers](/swap-seller) and security-based swap dealers, as well as swap participants and security-based swap participants. Different firms incorporate nonbank deliberately important financial institutions and certain financial market utilities.

## Financial Institution Qualifications

A person or institution qualifies as a financial institution for purposes of sections 401-407 of the act assuming they address, orally or recorded as a hard copy, that they will participate in financial contracts as a counter-party on the two sides of at least one financial markets and by the same token:

- Had at least one financial contracts of the total gross dollar value of no less than $1 billion in [notional principal amount](/notionalprincipalamount) outstanding on any day during the previous 15-month period with counter-parties that are not its associates; or
- Had total gross mark-to-market positions of no less than $100 million (collected across counter-parties) in at least one financial contracts on any day during the previous 15-month period with counter-parties that are not its associates.

On the off chance that a person qualifies as a financial institution under passage (a) of this section, that person will be viewed as a financial institution for the purposes of any contract went into during the period it qualifies, even assuming that the person thusly neglects to qualify.

> In February 2021, the Federal Reserve concluded amendments to Regulation EE to grow the definition of "financial institution" for purposes of the bilateral netting provisions of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991 ("FDICIA"). This expansion added swaps dealers, foreign banks, central banks, and certain non-bank elements deemed efficiently important to the financial sector.
