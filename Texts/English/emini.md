# E-mini
## What Is an E-mini?

The term E-mini refers to an electronically-traded futures contract that is a negligible part of the size of a standard contract. E-minis are used to trade a variety of assets, like commodities and currencies, however the most regularly traded assets utilizing E-minis are [indexes](/index).

The [Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME)](/cme) launched the first E-mini futures contract in 1997 to give individual investors, for whom standard contract sizes were often too expensive, access to the futures market. Like other futures contracts, E-minis are traded on the CME and other exchanges, and allow investors to hedge their bets or speculate on the price movements of the underlying asset.

## Understanding E-minis

All futures are financial contracts that obligate the holder to buy or sell an asset, like a physical commodity or a financial instrument, at a predetermined future date and price. Futures contracts detail the quality and quantity of the underlying asset and are standardized to facilitate trading on a [futures exchange](/futuresexchange). Some futures contracts might call for [physical delivery](/physicaldelivery) of the asset, while others are settled in cash.

Futures contracts were typically simply accessible to [institutional investors](/institutionalinvestor) because of their size, which was often too large for small investors. The CME launched the first E-mini contract in 1997 to draw in average traders who were keen on partaking in this alternative investment. This first E-mini contract allowed traders to trade S&P 500 futures. Its value was set at one-fifth of the standard contract.

The E-mini immediately became a success and led to other comparative contracts. There are presently E-mini contracts that cover a variety of assets, including:

- **Indexes:** S&P 500, [Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA)](/djia), Nasdaq 100, S&P MidCap 400, and Russell 2000
- **Commodities:** Oil, wheat, corn, soybeans, gold, copper
- **Currencies**

The E-mini [S&P 500](/sp500), however, remains the most actively traded E-mini contract in the world.

Just like other futures contracts, traders can use a single E-mini contract to [hedge](/hedge) or speculate on broad market moves. Because they are traded electronically, E-mini futures contracts trade very nearly 24 hours daily between Sunday and Friday. Investors are required to open an account with a brokerage firm to begin E-mini futures trading.

> The CME delisted the standard-sized S&P 500 index futures and options (on which the E-mini contract was based) in September 2021. This contract was worth $250 times the value of the S&P 500 Index. So in the event that the index was 2,100, the contract would be worth $525,000.

## E-minis versus Regular Futures

E-mini contracts aren't that vastly different than regular futures contracts. These smaller contracts additionally allow investors to hedge or [speculate](/speculation) on price movements of the underlying asset, whether it's an index, commodity, or currency.

Accordingly, investors can achieve their trading strategies with E-minis, including [spread](/spread) trading. Also, E-minis are well known to the point that their trading volumes eclipse those of standard futures contracts.

## E-mini S&P 500 Futures Contract Specifications

As noted above, the E-mini contract was created to be one-fifth of the size of the standard-sized contract. The [contract size](/contractsize) is the value of the contract based on the price of the futures contract times a contract-specific multiplier.

For instance, the E-mini S&P 500 has a contract size of $50 times the value of the S&P 500. Assuming that the S&P 500 trades at 2,580, the value of the contract is $129,000 ($50 x 2,580). This means that a 0.25 point change in the S&P 500 index has a monetary value of $12.50.

The E-mini S&P 500 trades under the Globex ticker ES. As noted above, it is available on the CME nearly 24/7 from Sunday to Friday, 6 p.m. to 5 p.m. ET with a temporary trading halt between 5 p.m. furthermore, 6 p.m. ET. Contracts are quarterly (March, June, September, December) and are listed for nine consecutive quarters as well as three extra December contract months.
