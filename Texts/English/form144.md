# SEC Form 144
## What Is SEC Form 144: Notice of Proposed Sale of Securities?

Form 144: Notice of Proposed Sale of Securities is a document issued by the [Securities and Exchange Commission](/sec) (SEC). It must be filed with the SEC by an executive officer, director, or the [affiliate](/affiliate) of a company while putting in a request to sell that company's stock during any three-month period in which the sale exceeds 5,000 shares or units or has an aggregate sales price greater than $50,000. This is also known as [Rule 144](/rule144) of the Securities Act of 1933.

## Understanding Form 144: Notice of Proposed Sale of Securities

Anybody who sells restricted, unregistered, and control [securities](/security) in the United States must follow Rule 144 of the [Securities Act of 1933](/securitiesact1933), which was passed as a method for safeguarding investors after the stock market crashed in 1929. Selling these types of securities can frequently be confounded, so Rule 144 helps make the process somewhat easier. Under this rule, sellers can be exempt from registering the sale of securities as long as they meet several conditions, which are noted below. Sellers can be anybody including the issuer of a security, a broker-dealer, or even underwriters.

Since sales covered under Form 144 are in many cases exceptionally close to the interests of the issuing company, filers must register the securities under Section 5 of the Securities Act. Assuming the right conditions are met, Rule 144 can give the necessary [exemption](/exemption) and permit the resale to take place. Still, all parties must get a [transfer agent](/transferagent) to eliminate the securities' legend prior to sale.

Form 144 must be filed with the SEC by an affiliate as a notice of the proposed sale of securities when the amount to be sold under Rule 144 during any three-month period exceeds 5,000 [shares](/shares) or units or has an aggregate sales price in excess of $50,000. An entity filing a Form 144 must have a bona fide goal to sell the securities alluded to in the form inside a reasonable time after the filing of the Form. While the SEC does not require the form to be sent electronically to the SEC's [EDGAR](/edgar) database, some filers choose to do as such. Others might choose to do as such in print form.

Extra information on Form 144 for individuals might incorporate a physical address, a [Internal Revenue Service](/irs) (IRS) number, the idea of the payment, and extra similar sales in the first several months.

## Special Considerations

There are certain conditions that must be met under Rule 144 for these securities to be sold. They are:

- Companies must meet certain holding or lock-up periods — six months for [public companies](/publiccompany) and one year for others. More on this below.
- Companies must give sufficient information to the public including a description of the business, [financial statements](/financial-statements), disclosures, and information about the company's officers and other key personnel.
- Company affiliates can't resell over 1% of the total amount of [shares outstanding](/outstandingshares).
- Trading conditions still apply as they would under normal circumstances.
- As verified above, affiliated sellers must file a notice proposing the sale of securities. This is required on the off chance that in excess of 5,000 shares will be sold or on the other hand on the off chance that the value of the sale is expected to be more than $50,000 during a three-month period.

### Lock-Up Agreement

Underwriters will have company executives, managers, employees, and [venture capitalists](/venturecapitalist) sign lock-up agreements surrounding a company's initial public offering (IPO) to energize an element of stability in the stock's price in the first couple of months of trading.

A lock-up agreement is a legally binding contract between company [underwriters](/financier) and insiders that prohibits [inside individuals](/insider) from selling any shares of stock for a specified period of time. Lock-up periods normally last 180 days however can on occasion last for as little as 120 days or as long as 365 days.

### Other Relevant Forms

Notwithstanding From 144, critical SEC filing forms include:

- S-1 and S-1/A — the two of which are registration statements
