## What Is the Labor Force Participation Rate?

The labor force participation rate is an estimate of an economy's active workforce. The formula is the number of individuals ages 16 and more seasoned who are employed or actively seeking employment, separated by the total non-regulated, civilian working-age population.

In the 12 months ending May 2022, the U.S. labor force participation rate ran between a low of 61.6% and a high of 62.4% (which was the figure for March 2022), as per the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, which distributes the figures month to month. The labor force participation rate was 62.3% for May 2022.

From 2013 on, the month to month figures held consistent nearby 63%, after a sharp decline in the wake of the [Great Recession](/great-recession). Be that as it may, in mid 2020, the labor force participation rate fell particularly, dropping from 63.4% to 61.4% in the main half of the year, because of the COVID-19 pandemic. Its low point was arrived at in April 2020, when the rate sank to 60.2%.

## Understanding the Labor Force Participation Rate

The labor force participation rate is an important measurement to utilize while breaking down employment and [unemployment](/unemployment) data since it measures the number of individuals who are actively work hunting as well as the people who are presently employed. It omits regulated individuals (in detainment facilities, nursing homes, or mental clinics) and individuals from the military.

It incorporates any remaining individuals age 16 or more seasoned and compares the extent of the people who are working or seeking work outside the home to the individuals who are neither working nor seeking work outside the home.

Since it accounts for individuals who have given up searching for work, this might make the labor force participation rate a fairly more solid figure than the unemployment rate. The unemployment numbers don't consider the individuals who have given up searching for work.

A few financial experts contend that the labor force participation rate and unemployment data ought to be viewed as together with an end goal to better figure out an economy's real employment status.

In the short term, [business cycles](/businesscycle) and unemployment rates influence the participation rate.

This generally compares to a portion of the declining trends in labor force participation in the 21st century.

An increase in college attendance at the more youthful finish of the age range is another factor that reduces labor force participation. College enrollment by 18-to 24-year-olds increased from around 35% to 41% from 2000 to 2018. Notwithstanding, enrollment rates have dropped due to the pandemic, with undergrad enrollment declining 7.8% from fall 2019 to fall 2021.
