## Illustration of a Capitation Payment

A capitation model would be an IPA — a type of HMO — that has 5,000 patients. The IPA needs to secure insurance coverage for its patients for the impending year. Consequently, it would go into a capitation contract with a physician.

The physician would be paid a fixed payment to treat every one of the 5,000 patients. For instance, say the capitation fee is $400 each year per patient. The physician would collect $2 million every year from the IPA. In return, the physician would be expected to cover all expenses connected with treating those 5,000 patients.

The thought is that not all patients will utilize $400 in services throughout the span of the year. Some might utilize $2,000, yet others may just utilize $100 or none by any stretch of the imagination. Overall, the doctor is expecting to be that (on average) the patients from this IPA will utilize under $400 each in services.

The capitation payment amount is expected on how much every patient is expected to utilize the service. Patients, like those with preexisting conditions, are probably going to have higher expected medical requirements and costs. It's in the IPA or HMO's best interest to try and estimate as best as conceivable the expected utilization of services.
