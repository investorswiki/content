These deductions reduce a taxpayer's taxable income for a given year or concede income taxes into future years. Tax shields bring down the overall amount of taxes owed by an individual taxpayer or a business.

## Breaking Down Tax Shield

The term "tax shield" references a specific deduction's ability to shield segments of the taxpayer's income from taxation. Tax shields shift from one country to another, and their benefits rely upon the taxpayer's overall tax rate and cash flows for the given [tax year](/taxyear).

## Tax Shields for Charitable Giving

To qualify, the taxpayer must utilize itemized deductions on his tax return. The deductible amount might be all around as high as 60 percent of the taxpayer's adjusted gross income, contingent upon the specific conditions. For donations to qualify, they must be given to an approved organization.

## Tax Shields for Depreciation

The deduction can apply to unmistakable property, like vehicles and buildings, as well as to immaterial assets, like computer software and licenses. To qualify, the depreciation must be associated with an asset utilized in a business or income-producing activity, and have an expected life expectancy of over one year.
