# Full Ratchet
## What Is a Full Ratchet?

A full ratchet is a contractual provision intended to safeguard the interests of early investors. In particular, it is a [anti-dilution provision](/anti-dilutionprovision) that applies, for any shares of common stock sold by a company after the giving of an option (or convertible security), the most minimal sale price as the adjusted option price or [conversion ratio](/conversionratio) for existing shareholders.

## Seeing Full Ratchets

A full ratchet safeguards beginning phase investors by guaranteeing that their percentage ownership isn't decreased by future rounds of raising money. This provision likewise offers a level of cost protection should the pricing of future rounds be lower than that of the initial round.

However, there are a few provisos. Offering these affirmations to beginning phase investors can be very costly according to the point of view of company founders or investors participating in later rounds of gathering pledges.

Basically, the presence of a full ratchet provision can make it hard for the company to draw in new rounds of investment. Thus, full ratchet provisions are typically just saved in force for a limited period of time.

## Full Ratchet Example

To delineate, consider a scenario wherein a company sells 1 million convertible [preferred shares](/inclination shares) at a price of $1.00 per share, under terms that incorporate a full ratchet provision. Assume that the company then embraces a second raising support round, this time selling 1 million [common shares](/commonstock) at a price of $0.50 per share.

Due to the full ratchet provision, the company would then be obliged to remunerate the preferred shareholders by diminishing the conversion price of their shares down to $0.50. Actually, this means that the preferred shareholders would should be given new shares (at no extra cost) to guarantee that their overall ownership isn't decreased by the sale of the new common shares.

This dynamic can lead to a series of adjustments in which new shares should be made to fulfill the requests both of the original preferred shareholders (who benefit from the full ratchet provision) and of new investors who wish to purchase a fixed percentage of the company. All things considered, investors want an abstract number of shares, however a substantial percentage of ownership.

In this situation, company founders can find their own ownership stakes immediately reduced by the ever changing adjustments benefiting old and new investors.

## The Full Ratchet versus Weighted Average Approaches

An alternative provision, which utilizes a weighted average approach, is seemingly more pleasant in adjusting the interests of founders, early investors, and later investors. This approach comes in two assortments: the [narrow-based weighted average](/narrowbasedweightedaverage), and the [broad-based weighted average](/broadbasedweightedaverage).

## Features
