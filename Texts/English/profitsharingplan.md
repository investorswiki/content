# Profit-Sharing Plan
## What Is a Profit-Sharing Plan?

A profit-sharing plan is a retirement plan that gives employees a share in the profits of a company. Under this type of plan, otherwise called a [deferred profit-sharing plan (DPSP)](/dpsp), an employee gets a percentage of a company's profits in light of its quarterly or annual earnings. This is a great way for a business to provide its employees with a feeling of pride in the company, yet there are normally limitations concerning when and how a person can pull out these funds without punishments.

## Understanding Profit-Sharing Plans

So how in all actuality does profit sharing work? Indeed, to begin, a profit-sharing plan is any retirement plan that acknowledges discretionary employer contributions. This means a retirement plan with employee contributions, for example, a [401(k)](/401kplan) or something almost identical, isn't a profit-sharing plan, in view of the personal contributions.

Since employers set up profit-sharing plans, businesses conclude the amount they need to apportion to every employee. A company that offers a profit-sharing plan adjusts it depending on the situation, some of the time making zero contributions in certain years. In the years when it makes contributions, be that as it may, the company must concoct a set formula for profit allocation.

The most common way for a business to decide the allocation of a profit-sharing plan is through the comp-to-comp method. Utilizing this calculation, an employer initially ascertains the sum total of its employees' all's compensation. Then, to figure out which percentage of the profit-sharing plan, an employee is qualified for, the company partitions every employee's annual compensation by that total. To show up at the amount due to the employee, that percentage is increased by the amount of total profits being shared.

## Illustration of a Profit-Sharing Plan

We should assume a business with just two employees involves a comp-to-comp method for profit sharing. In this case, employee A procures $50,000 every year, and employee B acquires $100,000 per year. In the event that the business owner shares 10% of the annual profits and the business procures $100,000 in a fiscal year, the company would designate profit share as follows:

- Employee A = ($100,000 X 0.10) X ($50,000/$150,000), or $3,333.33
- Employee B = ($100,000 X 0.10) X ($100,000/$150,000), or $6,666.67

## Requirements for a Profit-Sharing Plan

A profit-sharing plan is accessible for a business of any size, and a company can lay out one even on the off chance that it as of now has other retirement plans. Further, a company has a ton of flexibility by they way it can carry out a profit-sharing plan. As with a 401(k) plan, an employer has full circumspection over how and when it makes contributions. Nonetheless, all companies need to demonstrate that a profit-sharing plan doesn't segregate for [highly compensated employees](/profoundly compensated-employee).

Starting around 2022, the contribution limit for a company sharing its profits may not surpass the lesser of 100% of your compensation or $61,000. This limit increments to $67,500 for 2022 assuming that you incorporate catch-up contributions. What's more, the amount of an employee's salary that can be considered for a profit-sharing plan is limited, in 2022 to $305,000.

To execute a profit-sharing plan, all businesses must finish up an Internal Revenue Service Form 5500 and unveil all participants of the plan. Early withdrawals, just similarly as with other retirement plans, are subject to punishments, however with certain exemptions.
