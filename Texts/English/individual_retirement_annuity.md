## What Is an Individual Retirement Annuity?

An individual retirement annuity is an investment vehicle that is sold by insurance companies, and works like a [individual retirement account](/ira) (IRA). Individual retirement annuities can give a constant flow of income to retired people. Notwithstanding, there are limits regarding how much can be contributed every year, and annuities regularly have higher fees associated with them.

## Figuring out Individual Retirement Annuities

Like different types of annuities, an individual retirement annuity is a contract between an individual and an insurance company. The individual contributes a settled upon amount, and the insurer vows to pay the money back, with interest, sometime not too far off, either in that frame of mind of a lump sum or as a series of customary payments. Individuals frequently buy annuities to supplement their other retirement income, like [Social Security](/socialsecurity).

Individual retirement annuities can appear as a [fixed annuity](/fixedannuity) or a [variable annuity](/variableannuity). Fixed annuities pay a set rate of interest, while variable annuities base their return on a portfolio of sub-accounts picked by the annuity owner. These sub-accounts look like [mutual funds](/mutualfund), follow similar strategies as mutual funds, and have comparative names to mutual funds, yet are not mutual funds.

During what's known as the [accumulation phase](/accumulationphase), the money in the annuity account develops tax-deferred.

### Contribution Limits

Individual retirement annuities bought inside an IRA have a similar contribution limits, catch-up provisions, and fundamental tax advantages as IRAs. For 2021 and 2022, the annual contribution limit is $6,000 for individuals under age 50. The people who are aged 50 and over are eligible to make an extra $1,000 catch-up contribution, for a total of $7,000.

Additionally, similar to IRAs, individual retirement annuities are accessible in both traditional and Roth forms. With the traditional variant, the owner's contributions are generally tax-deductible for the year they are made, yet withdrawals are taxed later on. The Roth variant gives no upfront tax deduction, yet later withdrawals can be tax-free.

### Payout Phase

At the point when the annuity owner starts getting standard income from the account — known as the [payout phase](/payoutphase) — that money will be taxed as ordinary income, on account of a traditional individual retirement annuity, or not taxed, in that frame of mind of a Roth. This is likewise how traditional and Roth IRAs work.

Several specific rules apply to individual retirement annuities. The annuity must be issued in the owner's name, and just the annuity owner or their enduring beneficiaries are eligible to receive benefits from the contract. The owner's whole interest in the annuity must be [fully vested](/completely vested), and the owner isn't permitted to transfer any of the equilibrium to someone else (however they might name a beneficiary to receive the money after their death). The annuity's [premiums](/insurance-premium) must be flexible with the goal that the owner can change the payment amounts assuming their income changes.

## Individual Retirement Annuity versus Individual Retirement Account

Then again, individual retirement accounts can hold a large number of investments, including stocks, bonds, mutual funds, and real estate. Annuities are likewise known for their frequently high fees, so IRAs are probably going to be a more prudent method for investing for retirement.
