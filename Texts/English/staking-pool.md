# Staking Pool
A staking pool permits different partners (or [bagholders](/packs)) to join their computational resources as a method for expanding their chances of being compensated. All in all, they join their staking power during the time spent checking and approving new [blocks](/block), so they have a higher likelihood of earning the [block rewards](/block-reward).
The overall thought of the staking pool model is very like the traditional mining pool, which includes the pooling of hash rate in a Proof of Work (PoW) blockchain. In any case, the staking pool setup is just accessible on [blockchains](/blockchain) that utilize the Proof of Stake (PoS) model or, in non-POS systems through protocol design highlights.
Regularly, a staking pool is managed by a pool operator and the partners that choose to join the pool need to lock their coins in a specific blockchain address (or wallet). While certain pools expect users to stake their coins with an outsider, there are numerous different alternatives that permit partners to contribute with their staking power while as yet holding their coins in a personal wallet. For example, the supposed cold staking pools empower a safer model, as users can take part in the staking system while keeping their funds on a hardware wallet.
Compared to solo staking, a staking pool will give more modest rewards in light of the fact that each fruitful block producing (validation) will split the rewards among the numerous participants of the pool. Furthermore, most pools will charge fees, which will reduce even more the last payout. Then again, staking pools give more unsurprising and regular staking rewards. Other than that, they permit partners to make a passive income without stressing over the technical implementation and maintenance of setting ready to go an approving node.
