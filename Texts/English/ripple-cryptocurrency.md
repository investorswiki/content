## What Is Ripple?

Ripple is a technology that acts as both a [cryptocurrency](/cryptocurrency) and a digital payment network for financial transactions. It was first delivered in 2012 and was helped to establish by Chris Larsen and Jed McCaleb. Ripple's principal interaction is a payment settlement asset exchange and remittance system, like the [SWIFT](/swift) system for international money and security transfers, which is utilized by banks and financial middlemen dealing across currencies.

The token utilized for the cryptocurrency is [premined](/premining) and uses the ticker symbol XRP. Ripple is the name of the company and the network, and XRP is the cryptocurrency token. The purpose of XRP is to act as an intermediate mechanism of exchange between two currencies or networks — as a kind of impermanent settlement layer denomination.

## Understanding Ripple

Ripple works on a [open-source](/open-source) and peer-to-peer decentralized platform that considers a consistent transfer of money in any form, whether it's dollars, yen, euros, or cryptocurrencies, as litecoin or bitcoin. Ripple is a global payments network and counts major banks and financial services among its customers. XRP is utilized in its products to work with quick conversion between various currencies

### Ripple as a Digital Hawala Network

To understand how the system functions, consider a money transfer structure where the two gatherings on one or the flip side of the transaction utilize their preferred middlemen to receive the money. In effect, Ripple capabilities as a digital [hawala](/hawala) service. Hawala is an informal method of transferring money, typically across borders, with next to no physical money actually moving.

Say that Lawrence needs to send $100 to River, who lives in an alternate city. Lawrence provides the funds to be shipped off River to Lawrence's nearby agent, Kate. Lawrence likewise provides a secret word that River is required to answer accurately to receive the funds in their city. Kate alarms River's agent, Asuka, of the transaction details — beneficiary, funds to be repaid, and the secret word. Assuming River gives Asuka the right secret word, Asuka gives them $100.

Nonetheless, the money comes from Asuka's account, and that means that Kate owes Asuka $100 (which will be settled sometime in the future). Asuka can either record a journal of all Kate's debt, which Kate would pay on an agreed day, or make counter transactions that would balance the debt. For instance, in the event that Asuka was additionally Martin's agent and Martin needed to transfer $100 to Etios, whose agent is Kate, this would balance out the $100 owed to Asuka, since Etios will be paid from Kate's account.

Albeit the Ripple network is somewhat more complex than this model, it demonstrates the fundamentals of how the Ripple system functions. From the model over, one can see that trust is required to start a transaction — trust among Lawrence and Kate, Kate and Asuka, and River and Asuka.

Ripple utilizes a medium, known as a gateway, as the connection in the trust chain between two gatherings needing to make a transaction. The gateway acts as the [credit intermediary](/financialintermediary) that receives and sends currencies to public tends to over the Ripple network. Anybody or any business can register and open a gateway, which approves the registrant to act as the intermediary for trading currencies, keeping up with [liquidity](/liquidity), and transferring payments on the network.

## Ripple's Digital Currency XRP

The digital currency, XRP, acts as a bridge currency to different currencies. It doesn't segregate between any [fiat](/fiatmoney)/cryptocurrency, which makes it simple for any currency to be exchanged for another. Every currency on the ecosystem has its own gateway — e.g., CADBluzelle, BTCbitstamp, and USDsnapswap. In the event that River wanted bitcoins as payment for the services rendered to Lawrence, Lawrence doesn't be guaranteed to must be in possession of any bitcoins. He can send the payment to his gateway in Canadian dollars (CAD), and River can receive bitcoins from his gateway. One gateway isn't needed to start a complete transaction; different gateways can be utilized, forming a chain of trust undulating across the users.

Holding balances with a gateway exposes the client to [counterparty risk](/counterpartyrisk), a risk that is likewise present in the traditional banking system. In the event that the gateway doesn't respect its [liability](/liability), the client could lose the value of their money held at that gateway. Users that have zero faith in a gateway can, in this way, transact with a trusted gateway that thus deals with the "untrusted" gateway. This way the IOU will be transacted through the trusted, or [creditworthy](/credit-worthiness)- ensured, gateway. Counterparty risk doesn't have any significant bearing to bitcoins (and most altcoins) since a client's bitcoin is no other client's IOU or liability.

## How Ripple Works

The Ripple network doesn't run with a [proof-of-work](/proof-work) (PoW) system like bitcoin or a [proof-of-stake](/proof-stake-pos) (PoS) system like Nxt. All things considered, transactions depend on a consensus protocol to validate account balances and transactions on the system. The consensus attempts to work on the integrity of the system by preventing double-spending.

A Ripple client that starts a transaction with numerous gateways, yet endeavors to send the equivalent $100 to the gateway systems, will have everything except the main transaction deleted. Individual distributed nodes decide by consensus which transaction was made first. The affirmations are instant and require about five seconds. Since there's no central authority that decides who can set up a node and affirm transactions, the Ripple platform is described as decentralized.

Ripple monitors all IOUs in a given currency for any client or gateway. IOU credits and transaction flows that happen between Ripple [wallets](/digital-wallet) are publicly accessible on the Ripple consensus ledger. Be that as it may, even however financial transaction history is publicly recorded and made accessible on a [blockchain](/blockchain), the data isn't linked to the ID or account of any individual or business. In any case, the public record of all dealings (i.e., the blockchain) makes the information powerless to [de-anonymization](/deanonymization) measures.

## Special Considerations

Ripple enhances a portion of the disadvantages credited to traditional banks. Transactions are settled inside the space of seconds on the Ripple network (even however the platform handles a large number of transactions regularly). This is not normal for banks, which could require days or weeks to complete a [wire transfer](/wiretransfer). The fee to conduct transactions on Ripple is likewise negligible, with the base transaction cost required for a standard transaction set at 0.00001 XRP, compared to the large fees charged by banks for conducting cross-border payments.

As of November 2021, one XRP is worth around $1.20, and Ripple was the seventh-largest cryptocurrency with a [market cap](/marketcapitalization) of more than $56 billion.

## Features
- Ripple transactions utilize less energy than bitcoin, are confirmed like a flash, and cost very little, though bitcoin transactions utilize more energy, take more time to affirm, and include higher transaction costs.
- Ripple (XRP) positions among the most significant blockchain-based tokens by market capitalization.
- Instead of purpose blockchain mining, Ripple utilizes a consensus mechanism, through a group of bank-owned servers, to affirm transactions.
- Ripple is a blockchain-based digital payment network and protocol with its own cryptocurrency, XRP.
