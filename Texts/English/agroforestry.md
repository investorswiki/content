## What Is Agroforestry?

Agroforestry is an approach to developing land where trees and bushes are integrated alongside agricultural yields and pastureland.

In spite of the fact that agroforestry has been practiced in different forms for millenia, it has considered freshly discovered prominence in recent years to be a method to increase the strength of agricultural land to climate change.

## How Agroforestry Works

Agroforestry can assist with expanding the sustainability of agricultural land by making crops less helpless against specific vermin, sicknesses, or climatic changes. This is accomplished through factors like increased biodiversity and further developed soil stabilization.

For instance, by incorporating different tree species alongside agricultural yields, farmers can benefit from the effect of those trees' root networks on lessening soil erosion. This better soil quality can likewise reduce the risk of dry spell, by working on the retention and distribution of water all through the neighborhood ecosystem.

> ### International Agroforestry
> The practice of agroforestry has long been practiced in many parts of the world. In sub-Saharan Africa, for example, tall banana trees are much of the time planted alongside more modest oil palms which yield an important cooking oil. Farmers will likewise pair these trees plant lower-developing cassava and pineapple plants, to use the accessible ground while restricting the vanishing of dampness from the soil completely.

Trees and growth can likewise add to agricultural yields by giving other [commodities](/ware) like products of the soil. This thusly can increase the [diversification](/diversification) of the agricultural land, making its farmers less defenseless against the sorts of wrecking nuisances and sicknesses that can influence enormous scope mono-crop agriculture. Agroforestry can likewise include different fauna, like deer, sheep, or swines which can additionally add to agricultural yields and sustainability.

In spite of its expected benefits, agroforestry requires seriously planning and progressing management as compared to less difficult land use systems. To find success, agroforestry must think about the assorted and now and again disconnected requirements of every part of the land base. For instance, while perhaps not appropriately managed, touching fauna could damage a tree's root system or rashly consume incipient harvests.

## Real World Example of Agroforestry

In the United States, agroforestry remains somewhat remarkable as compared to different parts of the world. By the by, the practice has acquired greater consideration in recent years for of expanding the strength of agricultural land to climate change.

In 2011, the [United States Department of Agriculture (USDA)](/usda) proposed the Agroforestry Strategic Framework trying to create and advance agroforestry in the United States. The program unites researchers, landowners and other USDA partners in applying research and technology to the practice of agroforestry.

Through this program, the USDA plans to accomplish different objectives, like forest protection, expanding the flourishing of rural networks, upgrading food security, and expanding the sustainability of domestic cultivating practices.

## Features
- The practice has received increased consideration both domestically and abroad, as a method of climate change prevention and transformation.
- It has long been practiced all through the world, however is somewhat unprecedented in the United States.
- Agroforestry is the practice of blending different types of harvests, verdure, and fauna to increase agricultural yields and [sustainability](/sustainability).
