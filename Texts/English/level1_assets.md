# Level 1 Assets
## What Are Level 1 Assets?

Level 1 assets incorporate listed stocks, bonds, funds, or any assets that have a standard [mark-to-market](/marktomarket) mechanism for setting a fair market value. These assets are considered to have a promptly noticeable, transparent prices, and thusly a dependable fair market value.

- Level 1 assets are liquids financial assets and liabilities, for example, stocks or bonds, that experience normal market pricing.
- Level 1 assets are the top classification based on their transparency and how dependably their fair market value can be calculated.
- Level 2 and 3 assets are not so much liquid but rather more hard to rapidly and accurately ascertain their fair value.

## Figuring out Level 1 Assets

[Publicly traded companies](/publiccompany) must group each of their assets based on the facilitate that they can be valued, with Level 1 assets being the most straightforward. A big part of esteeming assets comes from [market depth](/marketdepth) and [liquidity](/liquidity). For developed markets, robust market activity acts as a natural price discovery mechanism. This, thusly, is a core element to market liquidity, which is a connected check measuring a market's ability to purchase or sell an asset without causing a tremendous change in the asset's price.

Financial Accounting Standard 157 ([FAS 157](/fasb_157)) laid out a single reliable system for assessing fair value in the absence of quoted prices, based on the thought of an "leave price" and a three-level hierarchy to mirror the level of judgment engaged with assessing fair values, going from market-based prices to illiquid Level 3 assets where no discernible market exists and valuations must be based on proprietary internal data, similar to the latest funding round.

## Arranging Level 1 Assets

The classification system including Level 1, [Level 2](/level2_assets), and [Level 3](/level3_assets) under [(FASB)](/fasb) Statement 157 required public companies to distribute all assets based on the reliability of fair market values.

The statement became real for all fiscal years after 2007 and came about generally because of the [credit market](/credit_market) disturbance surrounding subprime mortgages and related securitized assets like [asset-backed securities](/asset-backedsecurity) (ABS). Numerous assets became illiquid and fair value pricing must be finished by internal appraisals or other mark-to-model procedures during 2007's credit crunch. Thusly, regulators required a method for illuminating investors about securities where value could be not entirely clear.

## Benefits of Level 1 Assets

Level 1 assets are one method for measuring the strength and reliability of an entity's balance sheet. Since the valuation of Level 1 assets is trustworthy, certain businesses can appreciate incremental benefits relative to one more business with less Level 1 assets. For instance, banks, investors, and regulators approve of an entity with a majority of assets that have a market-based valuation since they can depend on supplied financial statements. On the off chance that a business intensely utilizes derivatives and a majority of its assets fall into the Level 2 or 3 category, then, at that point, closely involved individuals are less OK with the valuation of these assets.

The issue with assets outside Level 1 is best shown during times of distress. Naturally, during an unpredictable market, liquidity and market depth dissolve and numerous assets won't partake in a reasonable price discovery mechanism. These assets then, at that point, should be valued by examinations or as per a model. Both of these are not exactly perfect methods, so investors and creditors frequently lose confidence in reported valuations. During periods of pinnacle uncertainty, for example, during the depths of the [Great Recession](/great-recession), Level 3 assets are particularly investigated â€” with pundits calling [mark-to-model](/mark_to_model) methods more like mark-to-fantasy.
