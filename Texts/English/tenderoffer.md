## What Is a Tender Offer?

All a tender offer is a bid to purchase some or shareholders' stock in a corporation.

On account of a takeover endeavor, the tender might be conditional on the prospective buyer having the option to get a certain amount of shares, for example, an adequate number of shares to comprise a controlling interest in the company.
