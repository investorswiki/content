The Pula Fund is designed according to SWFs laid out by different nations over the course of the last part of the twentieth century, one of the first was laid out by Kuwait in 1953. Countries with important natural resources frequently lay out SWFs to give a cushion to future periods when either resource prices or supplies decline essentially or out of nowhere.

The government trusts that by saving and investing these earnings while they are as yet accessible, the long-term economic impact can be relaxed.
