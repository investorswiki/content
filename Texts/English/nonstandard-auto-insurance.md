# Nonstandard Auto Insurance
## What Is Nonstandard Auto Insurance?

Nonstandard [auto insurance](/collision protection) is offered to drivers considered to carry the most risk of an automobile accident. Auto [insurance](/insurance) is a policy purchased by the owner of a vehicle — from an insurance company — to assist with covering the cost of an automobile accident.

Nonstandard collision protection is for vehicle owners who have a poor driving record or a history of accidents. Nonstandard collision protection is regularly more costly to the vehicle owner than a traditional policy since the insurance company has a greater risk that they might have to payout funds due to an accident.

## Figuring out Nonstandard Auto Insurance

Normally, an insurance company offers an auto policy to a vehicle owner and consents to pay for damages due to an accident. In any case, there are often limitations in regards to how much the insurance company will payout and the level of coverage. In return, the vehicle owner pays a month to month [premium](/premium) or fee to the insurance company for the coverage on the vehicle.

The people who have been in car accidents in the past or have a not exactly wonderful driving record will commonly have higher premiums for their policies since there's a higher risk to the insurance company of an accident and a [insurance claim](/insurance_claim) being documented.

### Explanations behind Nonstandard Auto Insurance

Drivers can fall into the nonstandard insurance category in light of multiple factors, including:

- The individuals who have had their license suspended or disavowed
- Exorbitant traffic infringement or speeding tickets
- Driving impaired (DUI)
- New drivers including teenagers and more seasoned drivers like senior residents

Nonstandard drivers are probably going to have been in different accidents, or received speeding tickets in the past, or might not have substantial driving experience. Insurers offering nonstandard collision protection might do without checking the driver's credit history, implying that the driver could have poor or no credit. Policies may not be offered to drivers who are too youthful or too old since drivers in that part of the age range carry too much risk.

### Deductible for Nonstandard Auto Insurance

A deductible is an amount of money that the insured must pay out-of-pocket before the insurance company covers a claim under the policy. A deductible can be a small or large amount, contingent upon the type of policy and the risk to the insurance company that the policyholder addresses.

Normally, a high-risk policyholder will have a higher deductible than a low-risk policyholder. Additionally, the size of the deductible can influence the month to month premium amount. For instance, in the event that a policyholder settles on a high-deductible, their month to month premium might be lower. The justification behind the inverse relationship among premiums and deductibles is that insurance companies have a lower risk of paying for a claim for policies with a higher deductible since the vehicle owner is on the hook for a larger amount of the costs associated with an accident.

On the other hand, a low deductible might mean a higher premium for a high-risk policyholder. Nonetheless, it's memorable's important that assuming a person is in a car accident and has a high deductible-low premium policy, the cost of the accident could surpass any savings from having low month to month premiums. All in all, the high out-of-pocket cost from the deductible may be so costly; it nullifies any of the savings from the low month to month premiums.

## How Insurance Premiums Are Determined

Insurance companies must estimate the claim risk in underwriting another policy since the premiums it acquires will surpass the benefits it pays out to be profitable. Claim risk is the probability or likelihood that the insurance company might have to pay out a claim to the policyholder or vehicle owner in the event of an accident.

Commonly, insurance companies must decide the legitimate balance of low claim risk drivers — that pay lower premiums — with reasonably to-high risk drivers — that pay higher premiums. In the event that the insurer doesn't actually manage their claim risk, they can end up taking on too much risk and paying out additional benefits than the premiums it gets.

While deciding a premium, an insurer for the most part thinks about the following factors:

- Driver's age
- Driving record
- Vehicle usage
- Credit history
- Geographic location, like a high risk of auto robbery

Albeit not a thorough rundown of each of the factors considered, the data listed above assists insurers with deciding the driver's probability of getting into an accident. From that point, a month to month premium amount to charge for the coverage can be calculated.

## Nonstandard versus Standard Auto Insurance

[Standard auto insurance](/standard-collision protection) is an essential insurance policy for drivers who fall into the average risk profile. Standard collision protection policies are ordinarily more affordable, significance lower premiums, than different types of collision protection since the drivers generally have a better driving record and few-to-no accidents.

On the other hand, nonstandard collision protection is a policy for vehicle owners who have a poor driving record and accompanies higher month to month premiums versus standard policies. In any case, there is often a third category of drivers called preferred drivers, who are viewed as the least risky in light of their driving history and vehicle usage qualities. Preferred drivers are generally offered even lower premiums than standard and nonstandard policyholders.
