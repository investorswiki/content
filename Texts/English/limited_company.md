# Limited Company (LC)
## What Is a Limited Company (LC)?

A limited company (LC) is a general form of incorporation that limits the amount of [liability](/liability) embraced by the company's shareholders. It alludes to a legal structure that guarantees that the liability of company individuals or supporters is limited to their stake in the [company](/company) via investments or commitments. From a legal perspective, a limited company is a person.

The naming convention for this type of corporate structure is normally utilized in the United Kingdom, where a company's name is trailed by the abbreviated "Ltd." In the United States, limited companies come in several forms, including the limited liability corporation (LLC).

## How a Limited Company Works

As noted, in a limited company, the assets and obligations of the company are separate from those of the shareholders. Thus, should the company experience [financial distress](/financial_distress) on account of normal business activity, the personal assets of [shareholders](/shareholder) won't be at risk of being seized by creditors.

Ownership in the limited company can be effortlessly moved, and a significant number of these companies have been gone down through ages. Dissimilar to a public company, wherein anybody can buy shares, participation in a limited company is represented by a company's rules and law.

A limited company can be "limited by shares" or "limited by guarantee." When limited by shares, a company is owned by at least one shareholders and managed by no less than one director. In a limited by guarantee arrangement, a company is owned by at least one underwriters and managed by no less than one director.

The primary benefit of a limited company is the separation of assets and income from the corporation and the owners and investors through [limited liability](/limitedliability). This means that assuming a company goes belly up, shareholders can lose as much as their original investment and no more; [creditors](/bank) or other [stakeholders](/partner) can't claim owners' personal assets or income. In view of limited liability, investors are more eager to risk capital since their losses are limited in that sense.

## Limited Company Benefits

Filing as a limited company accompanies a number of benefits. They include:

- A limited company and individuals who run it are legally distinct.
- A limited company structure gives a firewall between the finances of the company and its owners.
- A limited company is permitted to possess assets and hold any profits made after-tax.
- A limited company can go into contracts all alone.

For the privilege, limited companies in the U.K. must pay various taxes, for example, a [value-added tax (VAT)](/valueaddedtax) and capital gains tax, and must add to National Insurance. Limited companies in the U.K. receive great tax treatment once their income arrives at a certain threshold. The corporate tax rate is a flat rate of 19%.

By comparison, unincorporated businesses, for example, [sole proprietorships](/soleproprietorship) and traditional [partnerships](/organization), don't manage the cost of full limits on liability for owners since there is no legal distinction between the business and its owners. On the off chance that such a business were to become ruined, its owners would be responsible for its obligations.

## Limited Company Variations

Limited company structures are arranged in numerous nations, however the regulations administering them can contrast widely starting with one nation then onto the next. For instance, in the United Kingdom, there are private limited companies and public limited companies.

Private limited companies are not permitted to offer shares to the public. They are, nonetheless, the most well known structures for a small business. Public limited companies (PLCs) may offer shares to the public to raise capital. Those shares might trade on a stock exchange once a total share value threshold is met (basically GBP 50,000). Such a structure is widely employed by bigger companies.

In the United States, a limited company is all the more normally known as a corporation (Corp.) or as incorporated (Inc.). A few states permit the utilization of Ltd. (limited) after a company name. Such a designation relies upon filing the right desk work; just adding the postfix to a company name gives no liability protection. Limited companies in the U.S. are required to file corporate taxes yearly with regulators. [Limited liability companies (LLCs)](/llc) and limited companies have various structures.

Numerous countries separate among public and private limited companies. For instance, in Germany, the [Aktiengesellschaft](/ag-aktiengesellschaft) (AG) designation is for public limited companies that can sell shares to the public while [GmbH](/gmbh) is for private limited companies that can't issue shares.

## Features
