# Probable Maximum Loss (PML)
## What Is Probable Maximum Loss (PML)?

Probable maximum loss (PML) is the maximum loss that an insurer would be expected to cause on a policy. Probable maximum loss (PML) is most frequently associated with [insurance](/insurance) contracts on property, like fire insurance or flood insurance.

The probable maximum loss (PML) addresses the most dire outcome imaginable for an insurer, given that there is no failure of existing protections, like fire sprinklers or flood barriers. This is generally lower than the [maximum foreseeable loss](/maximum-foreseeable-loss), the possible damage assuming such protects fail.

## Grasping Probable Maximum Loss (PML)

Insurance companies utilize a wide assortment of data sets, including probable maximum loss (PML), while deciding the risk associated with [underwriting](/underwriting) another insurance policy, a cycle that likewise helps set the [premium](/premium). Insurers survey past loss experience for comparative perils, demographic and geographic [risk profiles](/risk-profile), and expansive data to set the premium.

An insurer expects that a portion of the policies that it guarantees will cause losses, however that the bulk of policies will not. An insurance company must continuously guarantee that it has an adequate number of funds to pay out claims on policies, and the probable maximum loss is one of numerous metrics that decides the amount of funds required.

Insurance companies contrast on what probable maximum loss means. No less than three distinct ways to deal with PML exist:

- PML is the maximum percentage of risk that could be subject to a loss at a given point in time.
- PML is the maximum amount of loss that an insurer could handle in a specific area before being [insolvent](/bankruptcy).
- PML is the total loss that an insurer would hope to cause on a specific policy.

Commercial insurance underwriters utilize probable maximum loss calculations to estimate the highest maximum claim that a business doubtlessly will file, versus what it could file, for damages coming about because of a catastrophic event. Underwriters utilize complex statistical equations and [frequency distribution ](/frequencydistribution)charts to estimate PML and utilize this data as a starting point in arranging positive commercial insurance rates.

## Step by step instructions to Calculate PML

There are several steps in ascertaining PML:

1. Decide the dollar value of the property to show up at the expected monetary loss from a catastrophic event on the off chance that the whole property was obliterated.
1. Decide the risk factors that are probably going to cause an event that would lead to damage or loss of the property. This can incorporate the location of the property; for instance, properties on the sea's shore are more inclined to flooding. It can likewise incorporate building materials; buildings made of wood are more helpless to fire.
1. Think about risk moderating factors that can prevent damage or loss, for example, closeness to a fire station, cautions, and sprinklers.
1. A risk analysis should be performed to decide the scale at which the risk moderating factors will reduce the likelihood of an event that would lead to damage or loss of the property.
1. The last step includes duplicating the value of the property by the expected loss percentage, which is the difference between the expected loss and the risk relieving factors. For instance, on the off chance that a house is on the shore and its value is $300,000, and the house has been raised on braces to abstain from flooding as a risk relieving factor, which reduces the expected loss by 30%, then, at that point, computing the probable maximum loss would be $300,000*(100%-30%) = $210,000.

The model above is a simplified rendition and the more risk moderating factors that a property has, the further the probable maximum loss will be reduced. Most properties are at risk of damage by various means thus guaranteeing protection against all factors won't just benefit an insurance company in the amount they should cover in case of a catastrophic event, yet it will likewise reduce the premiums a policyholder should pay.

## Features
- The probable maximum loss (PML) is the maximum loss that an insurer is expected to lose on an insurance policy.
- Computing probable maximum loss (PML) considers the accompanying factors: property value, risk factors, and risk moderating factors.
- The more risk moderating factors there are, the lower the probable maximum (PML) loss is.
- Every insurance company characterizes and computes probable maximum loss (PML) in an alternate way.
- Insurers utilize different models and data to decide the risk associated with underwriting a policy, which incorporates the probable maximum loss (PML).
