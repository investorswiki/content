## What Is a Patent Troll?

A patent troll is a derogatory term used to portray a company that utilizes [patent infringement](/copyright-infringement) claims to win court decisions revenue driven or to smother competition. The term might be utilized to portray a number of business activities that use patents and the court system to earn money.

While the practice of patent trolling isn't illegal, a company that acts as a patent troll files patent claims with practically no intention of truly fostering a product or service. The final product is dishonesty infringement dangers and licensing requests that expect companies to spend a lot of money to settle these claims with no expansion to the [public good](/public-great). A patent troll may likewise be called a "patent shark," "seller," "advertiser," or "privateer." A patent troll operation might be called a "patent statement company," "element," or a "non-manufacturing patentee."

## How a Patent Troll Works

A patent troll might utilize different methods and exploit legal [loopholes](/proviso) to create revenue without delivering any material benefits and with practically no intention to involve the patent being referred to. One similarity for a patent troll's actions would procure the right to charge tolls on a toll road without playing out any sort of improvements to the roadway. Speculatively, the patent troll would earn money from charging gigantic fees for the utilization of the roadway or from forcing serious punishments for any individual who utilizes the road without knowing the terms of purpose.

Patent trolls are more normal in the U.S. since patent trolls can exploit existing structural issues inside the U.S. patent and court systems. Patent trolls are less predominant in Europe on the grounds that numerous European countries specify that failures in patent claim court cases pay the legal expenses of the two players. This has successfully dispensed with a majority of paltry lawsuits.

In June 2013, former President Barack Obama tended to the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office about the abusive practices of patent trolls: "They don't actually create anything themselves, they're just attempting to basically leverage and commandeer another person's thought and check whether they can coerce some money out of them." In April 2014, the last ruling on the court case, Octane Fitness, LLC v. ICON Health and Fitness, Inc., filed in the U.S. High Court, made it more straightforward for courts to impose the legal expenses of the two players on the washouts in patent claim court cases from now on.

The term patent troll might have originated from an instructive video, called the Patents Video, created in 1994 by Paula Natasha Chavez, a U.S. Intellectual Property Law attorney. The goal of the video was to alert corporations and people to what some thought to be the weaponization of patents, as well as to discourage future patent trolls.

## Types of Patent Trolls

Patent trolls might utilize at least one the accompanying practices, however understanding the full breadth of patent troll practices would be troublesome in view of the numerous methods they use:

- Implementing a [patent](/patent) with practically no intent of manufacturing a product or offering a support in view of that patent, or without utilizing it to conduct research, or in any case using it for everyone's benefit
- Chasing after patent infringement claims that are unmerited with the intent of smothering competition (These claims are at last simpler and less expensive for contending companies to settle than to prosecute.)
- Buying a patent (normally from a bankrupt company at auction) with the intent of suing a contending company by claiming that it has a product that encroaches upon the recently purchased patent
- Any utilization of a patent to just implement patent rights

Patent trolling may likewise include scene shopping. For instance, in 2015, 45% of patent cases in the U.S. were filed in the Eastern District of Texas, home to a judge with both patent skill and a history of leaning toward offended parties. The U.S. High Court's last ruling in the 2017 court case, TC Heartland LLC v. Kraft Foods Group Brands LLC, has since limited the practice of setting shopping by patent trolls.

At the point when universities or non-profit research institutions file claims for the protection of unutilized patents, it isn't normally viewed as an act of patent trolling.
