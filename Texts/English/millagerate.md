# Millage Rate
## What Is a Millage Rate?

A millage rate is the tax rate used to work out neighborhood property taxes. The millage rate addresses the amount per each $1,000 of a property's assessed value. Assigned millage rates are applied to the total taxable value of the property to show up at the property tax amount.

Millage gets its name from the Latin word "millesimum," or "mill" for short, and that means "thousandth part" (1/1000). The term millage rate is additionally alluded to as the [mill rate](/millrate) or the effective property tax rate.

Various agencies inside a district might have their own millage rates, which are considered into a homeowner's property tax calculation. For instance, school boards utilize a millage rate to compute nearby school taxes in light of a deduction of the total property value inside school district limits.

## Grasping Millage Rates

Property taxes are determined by nearby governments and paid by homeowners. These taxes depend on a property's value, which accounts for both the structure and the land on which it sits. Millage rates for individual properties are typically found on the property [deed](/deed) itself.

A few districts utilize the term millage rate or mill rate when they allude to the property tax rate. One mill is equivalent to one-thousandth of a dollar — or $1 for each $1,000 — of property value. Millage rates are frequently communicated numerically with the symbol %o, as in 1%o, which is one part for each thousand, or 0.1%. Consequently, 30 mills are the equivalent of $30 for each $1,000 of the assessed value of a property.

As indicated over, the amount of tax a homeowner pays depends on the assessed value of the property. An assessor designated by the neighborhood government assesses the property each one or five years — contingent upon the region — and determines its assessed value. This value is simply used to work out property taxes.

## Computing Millage Rates

A homeowner's annual property taxes are calculated utilizing the property's tax assessed value, and the total assigned millage rate. A home's tax assessed value is a percentage of its market value. In certain areas, the evaluation of tax is on 100% of the [market value](/marketvalue), while the tax-assessed values can rise to just 10% or less of the market value in different districts. Millage likewise influences the property's tax assessed value as mills are assigned by the region.

For instance, consider a home with a market value of $200,000 in an area where the tax-assessed value equals 20% of the market value. Thus, the homeowner property tax has a premise of $40,000. Suppose the home's total millage rate is 70 mills (70/1000), and that means for each $1,000 assessed value, $70 in property taxes is due. Thusly, the homeowner owes $2,800 in property taxes: ($40,000 x 7%).

## Where Millage Rates Come From

Millage depends, in part, on the level of services that the property utilizes from the town or district. Every public service charges a certain amount of tax millage to property owners for the utilization of their services.

Several taxing specialists — each with millage rates — join their rates to work out the total [tax liability](/taxliability) of a property. These substances incorporate counties, regions, emergency services districts, community colleges, and school boards.

In the event that we utilize the model over, the millage rate is probable a combination of several millage rates forced by various taxing specialists. For instance, the region charges 20 mills, the region charges 15 mills, the emergency services district charges ten mills, the nearby community college charges ten mills, and the school board charges 15 mills, with the sum of the rates totaling 70 mills.
