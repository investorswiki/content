(CME). The federal funds rate is the rate banks charge each other for overnight loans of reserves on deposit with the [Federal Reserve](/federalreservesystem).

The Fed utilizes the federal funds rate to control U.S. [money supply](/moneysupply) and influence the cost of credit all through the economy. The prices of Fed funds futures reflect market expectations about future changes in the Fed funds rate based on the target goes the Fed sets as a key device of its [monetary policy](/monetarypolicy).

As the shortest-term risk-free interest rate, the federal funds rate sets the floor for other interest rates all through the economy. Increases in the fed funds rate raise borrowing costs for a wide assortment of new and variable-rate loans, and drive up [bond yields](/bond-yield). Alternately, when the fed funds rate drops, other interest rates will more often than not decline too. Lower interest rates advance quicker economic growth, while higher ones frequently sluggish it.

Banks and fixed-income portfolio managers utilize fed funds futures to hedge against market changes in short-term interest rates. The contracts additionally let traders conjecture on the [Federal Open Market Committee's](/fomc) monetary policy declarations.

## Contract Specifications

CME's 30-day fed funds futures are month to month contracts listed for 60 successive months and [cash settled](/cashsettlement) on the last business day of each and every month. For instance, the longest-dated fed funds futures contract on the CME in June 2022 was due to get comfortable May 2027. The CME additionally records options on fed funds futures contracts lapsing in two years or less.

The 30-day fed funds futures' contract price is the arithmetic average of the daily effective federal funds rates during the contract month as reported by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, deducted from 100. So assuming the effective fed funds rate were to average 1.75% for a given month, the settlement price of the fed funds futures contract terminating that month would be 100 - 1.75 = 98.25.

The base [contract size](/contractsize) is communicated in U.S. dollars by increasing the contract price by $4,167. In the model above, it would be 98.25 x $4,167 = $409,407.75.
