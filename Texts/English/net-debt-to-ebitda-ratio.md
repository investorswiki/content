# Net Debt-to-EBITDA Ratio
## What Is the Net Debt-to-EBITDA Ratio?

The net debt-to-[EBITDA](/ebitda) (earnings before interest depreciation and amortization) ratio is a measurement of leverage, calculated as a company's interest-bearing liabilities minus cash or cash equivalents, partitioned by its EBITDA. The net debt-to-EBITDA ratio is a debt ratio that shows what amount of time it would require for a company to pay back its debt in the event that net debt and EBITDA are held steady. Notwithstanding, in the event that a company has more cash than debt, the ratio can be negative. It is like the [debt/EBITDA ratio](/debt_edbitda), yet net debt takes away endlessly cash equivalents while the standard ratio doesn't.

## Everything that Net Debt-to-EBITDA Can Say to You

The net debt-to-EBITDA ratio is famous with analysts since it considers a company's ability to diminish its debt. Ratios higher than 4 or 5 regularly set off alerts since this shows that a company is less inclined to have the option to handle its debt burden, and subsequently is less inclined to have the option to assume the extra debt required to develop the business.

The net debt-to-EBITDA ratio ought to be compared with that of a benchmark or the industry average to determine the creditworthiness of a company. Furthermore, a [horizontal analysis](/horizontalanalysis) could be conducted to determine whether a company has increased or diminished its debt burden over a predefined period. For horizontal analysis, ratios or things in the financial statement are compared with those of previous periods to determine how the company has developed over the predetermined time period.

## Illustration of How to Use Net Debt-to-EBITDA

Assume an investor wishes to conduct horizontal analysis on Company ABC to determine its ability to pay off its debt. For its previous fiscal year, Company ABC's short-term debt was $6.31 billion, long-term debt was $28.99 billion, and cash holdings were $13.84 billion.

Thusly, Company ABC reported a net debt of $21.46 billion, or $6.31 billion-plus $28.99 billion less $13.84 billion, and an EBITDA of $60.60 billion during the fiscal period. Thusly, Company ABC's net debt-to-EBITDA ratio is 0.35 or $21.46 billion separated by $60.60 billion.

Presently, for the latest fiscal year, Company ABC had short-term debt of $8.50 billion, long-term debt of $53.46 billion, and $21.12 billion in cash. The company's net debt increased by 90.31% to $40.84 billion year-over-year. Company ABC reported an EBITDA of $77.89 billion, a 28.53% increase from its EBITDA the previous year.

Subsequently, Company ABC had a net debt to EBITDA ratio of 0.52 or $40.84 billion isolated by $77.89 billion. Company ABC's net debt to EBITDA ratio increased by 0.17, or 49.81% year-over-year.

## Limitations of Using Net Debt-to-EBITDA

Analysts like the net debt/EBITDA ratio since it is not difficult to compute. Debt figures can be found on the balance sheet and EBITDA can be calculated from the income statement. The issue, nonetheless, is that it may not give the most reliable measure of earnings. More than earnings, analysts need to check the amount of cash available for debt repayment.

Depreciation and amortization are non-cash expenses that don't actually impact cash flows, however interest can be a huge expense for certain companies. Banks and investors taking a gander at the current debt/EBITDA ratio to gain understanding on how well the company can pay for its debt might need to think about the impact of interest on the debt, even assuming that debt will be remembered for new issuance. Along these lines, net income minus capital expenditures, plus depreciation and amortization might be the better measure of cash available for debt repayment.
