## What Is Accrued Market Discount?

Accrued market discount is the gain in the value of a discount bond expected from holding it for any duration until its maturity. Since discount bonds are sold below face value, it is expected that they will steadily rise in market price until arriving at maturity.

## Understanding Accrued Market Discount

A bond can be purchased at par, [at a premium](/premiumbond), or [at a discount](/discountbond). No matter what the purchase price of the bond, in any case, all bonds mature to their [par value](/parvalue). The par value is the amount of money that a bond investor will be repaid at maturity. A bond that is purchased at a premium has a value better than expected. As the bond draws nearer to maturity, the value of the bond declines until it is at par on the maturity date. The diminishing in value over the long haul is alluded to as a [amortization of premium](/amortizable-bond-premium).

A bond that is issued at a discount has a value that is not exactly the par value. As the bond moves toward its redemption date, it will increase in value until it unites with the par value at maturity. This slow increase in value over the long haul is alluded to as the accrued market discount.

For instance, a 3-year bond with a par value of $1,000 is issued at $935. Among issuance and maturity, the value of the bond will increase until it arrives at its full par value of $1,000, which is the amount that will be paid to the bondholder at maturity. The difference between the discounted price for which the bond is sold and its face value at maturity ($1,000 - $935 = $65) is the accrued market discount and addresses the return on investment to the bondholder.

The accrued market discount is the portion of any price rise brought about by the consistent increase in bond value. This rise in price is unique in relation to that which happens in ordinary coupon bonds because of bringing down interest rates. The accrued market discount might be taxable at the federal, state as well as neighborhood level. An investor who decides to accrue the market discount over the period during which s/he possesses the bond would incorporate the amount accrued every year as interest income. Gathering market discount for tax purposes includes expanding the [cost basis](/costbasis) every year by the amount of the market discount included as income.

## Tax Considerations

An investor additionally has the option to not accrue market discount for the period s/he held the bond. In this case, on the off chance that the bond is held to maturity, the difference between the redemption price and the cost basis is added to the bondholder's income. In the event that the bond is sold before it matures, any gain produced using the accretion in bond value is treated as interest income. To put another way, the gain realized on the disposition of a market discount bond must be recognized as interest income to the degree of the accrued market discount, and any leftover gain will be capital in the event that the bond is a capital asset in the hands of the holder.

A taxpayer might choose to decide the accrued market discount under a [ratable accrual method](/ratable-accrual-method) or a [constant yield method](/constantyieldmethod). The consistent yield method is the method required by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) for computing the adjusted cost basis from the purchase amount to the expected redemption amount. This fans out the gain over the leftover life of the bond, rather than perceiving the gain in the extended period of the bond's redemption.
