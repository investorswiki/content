# Fibonacci Fan
## What Is a Fibonacci Fan?

A Fibonacci fan is a charting technique utilized in [technical analysis](/technicalanalysis) that utilizes the Fibonacci ratio to foresee support and resistance levels graphically.

The Fibonacci ratio can be utilized to depict the extents in things from nature's littlest building blocks, like particles, to the most advanced patterns in the universe, as unfathomably large heavenly bodies. Nature depends on this inborn extent to keep up with balance, yet the financial markets likewise appear to conform to this "brilliant ratio."

## Grasping Fibonacci Fans

Fibonacci fans are sets of sequential trendlines drawn from a trough or top through a set of points directed by [Fibonacci retracements](/fibonacciretracement). To make them, a trader draws a [trendline](/trendline) off of which to base the fan, generally covering the low and high prices of a security over a given period of time.

To arrive at retracement levels, the trader isolates the difference in price at the low and high end still up in the air by the Fibonacci series, regularly 23.6%, 38.2%, half, and 61.8%. The lines formed by interfacing the starting point for the base trendline and every retracement level make the Fibonacci fan.

Traders can utilize the lines of the Fibonacci fan to foresee key points of [resistance](/resistance) or [support](/support), at which they could expect price trends to reverse. When a trader recognizes patterns inside a chart, they can utilize those patterns to foresee future price developments and future levels of support and resistance. Traders utilize the expectations to time their trades.

## Fibonacci Ratio Investment Strategies

The [Fibonacci sequence](/fibonaccilines) starts with the digits zero and one, then, at that point, proceeds vastly with the next number in the sequence equivalent to the sum of the two numbers going before it (e.g., 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 35, and so forth.). The extent of any neighboring terms equals roughly 1.618, addressed in math by the Greek letter **phi** (\u03a6), and unintentionally underlies an enormous number of naturally happening patterns. For obscure reasons, stock prices seem to act in patterns steady with the Fibonacci ratio too.

Technical investigations based upon Fibonacci ratios exist for both the price and time tomahawks of charts. Analysts can likewise utilize retracements to deliver curves or fans utilizing arithmetic or logarithmic scales. No one seems to know whether these instruments work since stock markets display some form of natural pattern or on the grounds that numerous investors use Fibonacci ratios to foresee price developments, making them an unavoidable outcome. Regardless, key support and resistance levels will more often than not happen habitually at the 61.8% level on both uptrends and downtrends.

To determine the three key ratios normally utilized in technical analysis based upon the Fibonacci series, you just track down the extent of one number in the series to its neighbors. Contiguous numbers produce the inverse of phi, or 0.618, relating to a retracement level at 61.8%. Numbers two places separated in the sequence yield a ratio of 38.2%, and numbers three places separated yield a ratio of 23.6%.

## Fibonacci Fans versus Gann Fans

[Gann fans](/gann-fans) are one more form of technical analysis based on the possibility that the market is geometric and cyclical in nature. A Gann fan comprises of a series of trend lines called [Gann angles](/gannangles). These angles are superimposed over a price chart to show possible support and resistance levels. The subsequent picture should assist technical analysts with foreseeing price changes.

Gann fans are named after their maker W.D. Gann. Gann accepted his angles could foresee future price developments based on geometric angles of time versus price. Gann was a 20th-century market scholar.

## Highlights
- The Fibonacci ratio, otherwise called the "brilliant ratio," is generally 1.618. This ratio is found all through natural and social sciences.
- Trendlines are drawn at time frames, 38.2%, half, and 61.8% separated to anticipate retracements.
- A Fibonacci fan is a method of plotting support and resistance levels based on the ratios given by the Fibonacci series.
