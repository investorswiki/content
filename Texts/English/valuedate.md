# Value Date

A value date is a future date that is utilized for deciding the current value of a product or security that varies in price. It is the date at which funds, assets, or money's value becomes effective. Ordinarily, value dates are utilized in deciding the payment of financial products and accounts where there is a possibility for errors due to differences in the timing of valuations. Such financial products can incorporate [forward currency contracts](/forward-exchange-contract), option contracts, and the interest payable or receivable on personal accounts.

In [forex](/forex) markets, the value date might be alluded to as the "valuta," where it might likewise be utilized to depict the value of one currency communicated in terms of its exchange rate with another.

## Value Date in Banking

When a [payee](/payee) presents a check to the bank, the bank credits the payee's account. Notwithstanding, it could require days until the bank receives the funds from the payor's bank, accepting the payor and payee have accounts with various financial institutions. In the event that the payee approaches the funds immediately, the getting bank runs the risk of recording a negative cash flow. To keep away from this risk, the bank will estimate the day it will receive the money from the paying institution, and hold the funds in the payee's account until the expected day of receipt. In effect, the bank will post the amount of the deposit for several days, after which the payee can utilize the funds. The date the funds are delivered is alluded to as the value date.

Moreover, when a [wire transfer](/wiretransfer) is produced using an account in one bank to an account in another bank, the value date is the date on which the approaching wire opens up to the getting bank and its customer.

## Value Date in Trading

At the point when there is a possibility for errors due to differences in the timing of [asset valuation](/assetvaluation), the value date is utilized. In Forex trading, the value date is viewed as the [delivery date](/deliverydate) on which counterparties to a transaction consent to settle their particular obligations by making payments and transferring ownership. Due to differences in time regions and bank processing delays, the value date for [spot trades](/spottrade) in foreign currencies is normally set two days after a transaction is agreed on. The value date is the day that the currencies are traded, not the date on which the traders consent to the exchange rate.

The value date is likewise utilized in the bond market to compute [accrued interest](/accruedinterest) on a [bond](/bond). Calculation of accrued interest considers three key dates — [trade date](/tradedate), [settlement date](/settlementdate), and value date. The trade date is the date on which a transaction was executed. The settlement date is the date on which a transaction is completed. The value date is typically, yet not consistently, the settlement date. The settlement date can fall on a [business day](/business-day) — in the event that a bond was traded on Friday (trade date), the transaction will be considered complete on Monday, not Saturday. The value date can fall on any day as seen while computing accrued interest, which considers the entire given month.

The value date is additionally utilized while assessing [coupon bonds](/couponbond) that make semi-annual interest payments. For instance, on account of [savings bonds](/ussavingsbonds), the interest is accumulated semi-annually, so the value date is like clockwork. This eliminates any vulnerability for investors since their calculations of interest payments will be equivalent to the state run administrations.
