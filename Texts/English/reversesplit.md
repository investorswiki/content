For instance, Nasdaq might delist a stock that is reliably trading below $1 per share. Removal from a public level exchange consigns the company's shares to penny stock status, constraining them to list on the [Over-the-Counter Bulletin Board](/otcbb) (OTCBB) or the [pink sheets](/pinksheets). When set in these alternative marketplaces for low-value stocks, the shares become more enthusiastically to buy and sell.

They choose to go for the 1-for-5 reverse stock split, which basically means blending five existing shares into one new share. When the corporate action exercise is over, the company will have 2 million new shares (10 million/5), with each share presently costing $25 each ($5 x 5).

The proportionate change in share price additionally upholds the fact that the company has not made any real value essentially by performing the reverse stock split. Its overall value, addressed by [market capitalization](/marketcapitalization), before and after the corporate action ought to continue as before.

The previous market cap is the prior number of total shares times the prior price per share, which is $50 million ($5 x 10 million). The market cap following the reverse merger is the new number of total shares times the new price per share, which is additionally $50 million ($25 x 2 million).
