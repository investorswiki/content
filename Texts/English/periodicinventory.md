# Periodic Inventory
## What Is Periodic Inventory?

The periodic inventory system is a method of [inventory](/inventory) valuation for financial reporting purposes in which a physical count of the inventory is performed at specific stretches. This accounting method takes inventory toward the beginning of a period, adds new inventory purchases during the period and deducts ending inventory to infer the cost of goods sold (COGS).

## Figuring out Periodic Inventory

Under the periodic inventory system, a company won't have the foggiest idea about its unit inventory levels nor COGS until the physical count process is complete. This system might be acceptable for a business with a low number of [SKUs](/stock-keeping-unit-sku) in a slow-moving market, however for all others, the [perpetual inventory](/perpetualinventory) system is viewed as prevalent for the following principal reasons:

1. The perpetual system constantly refreshes the inventory [asset ledger](/asset-ledger) in a company's database system, providing management with an instant perspective on inventory; the periodic system is tedious and can create old numbers that are less helpful to management.
1. The perpetual system keeps refreshed COGS as developments of inventory happen; the periodic system can't give accurate COGS figures between counting periods.
1. The perpetual system tracks individual inventory things so in case there are defective things — for instance, the source of the problem can rapidly be recognized; the periodic system would probably not allow for brief resolution.
1. The perpetual system is tech-based and data can be upheld, organized and controlled to create educational reports; the periodic system is manual and more inclined to human blunder, and data can be lost or lost.

## Special Considerations: COGS

The cost of goods sold, normally alluded to as COGS, is a fundamental income statement account, yet a company utilizing a periodic inventory system won't have the foggiest idea about the amount for its accounting records until the physical count is completed.

Assume a company has a beginning inventory of $500,000 on January 1. The company purchases $250,000 of inventory during a three-month period, and after a physical inventory account, it decides it has ending inventory of $400,000 at March 31, which turns into the beginning inventory amount for the next quarter. COGS for the primary quarter of the year is $350,000 ($500,000 beginning + $250,000 purchases - $400,000 ending).

Due to the time disparities, it turns into the onus of the manager or business owner responsible for monitoring period inventory assuming it's a good idea to their primary concern to distribute hours to count inventory daily, week after week, month to month, or yearly.
