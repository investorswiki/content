## What Is a Reserve Currency?

A reserve currency is a large quantity of currency kept up with by [central banks](/centralbank) and other major financial institutions to prepare for investments, transactions, and international debt obligations, or to influence their domestic exchange rate. A large percentage of commodities, like gold and oil, are priced in the reserve currency, making different countries hold this currency to pay for these goods.

## Figuring out Reserve Currency

Holding a reserve currency limits [exchange rate](/exchangerate) risk, as the purchasing nation won't need to exchange its currency for the current reserve currency to make the purchase. Starting around 1944, the U.S. dollar has been the primary reserve currency utilized by different countries. Thus, foreign nations closely monitor the [monetary policy](/monetarypolicy) of the United States to guarantee that the value of their reserves isn't adversely impacted by [inflation](/inflation) or rising prices.

## How the U.S. Dollar Became the World's Reserve Currency

The post-war development of the U.S. as the predominant economic power had gigantic ramifications for the global economy. At one time, U.S. [Gross Domestic Product (GDP)](/gdp), which is a measure of the total output of a country, addressed half of the world's economic output.

Thus, it seemed OK that the U.S dollar would turn into the global currency reserve. In 1944, following the [Bretton Woods Agreement](/brettonwoodsagreement), delegates from 44 nations formally agreed to take on the U.S. dollar as an official reserve currency. From that point forward, different countries pegged their exchange rates to the dollar, which was convertible to gold at that point. Since the gold-backed dollar was generally stable, it empowered different countries to settle their currencies.

In the beginning, the world profited from a strong and stable dollar, and the United States thrived from the ideal exchange rate on its currency. The foreign legislatures didn't completely understand that albeit gold reserves backed their currency reserves, the United States could keep on printing dollars that were backed by its debt held as U.S. Treasuries. As the United States printed more money to finance its spending, the gold backing behind the dollars lessened. The increase monetary supply of dollars went past the backing of gold reserves, which diminished the value of the currency reserves held by foreign countries.

## The Gold-to-Dollar Decoupling

As the United States kept on flooding the markets with paper dollars to finance its heightening war in Vietnam and the [Great Society](/great-society) programs, the world developed mindful and started to change over dollar reserves into gold. The run on gold was broad to such an extent that President Nixon was constrained to step in and decouple the dollar from the gold standard, which gave way to the floating exchange rates that are being used today. Before long, the value of gold significantly increased, and the dollar started its long term decline.

## Proceeded with Faith in the U.S. Dollar

The U.S. dollar stays the world's currency reserve, due fundamentally to the way that countries collected such a large amount it, and that it was as yet the most stable and liquid form of exchange. Backed by the most secure of all paper assets, U.S. Treasuries, the dollar is as yet the most redeemable currency for facilitating world commerce. It hence that it's profoundly impossible the U.S. dollar will experience a collapse any time soon.

The euro, presented in 1999, is the second most generally held reserve currency in the world. As per the [International Monetary Fund (IMF)](/imf), which is accused of advancing global growth and trade, central banks hold more than $6.7 trillion in dollar reserves versus 2.2 trillion in euros as of Q4 2019.
