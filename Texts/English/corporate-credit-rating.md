## What is a Corporate Credit Rating?

A corporate credit rating is an assessment of an independent agency in regards to the probability that a corporation will completely meet its financial [obligations](/commitment) really.

[Standard and Poor's](/sp) (S&P), [Moody's](/moodys), and [Fitch](/fitch-ratings) are the three principal suppliers of corporate credit ratings. Every agency has its own rating system that doesn't be guaranteed to relate to the next agencies' rating scale, however they are comparable. For instance, Standard and Poor's purposes "AAA" for the highest credit quality with the lowest [credit risk](/creditrisk), "AA" for the next best, followed by "A," then, at that point "BBB" for good credit.

These ratings are viewed as [investment grade](/investmentgrade), and that means that the security or corporation being rated conveys a quality level that numerous institutions require. Everything below "BBB" is viewed as speculative or more terrible, down to a "D" rating, which shows default or "[junk](/junkbond)."
