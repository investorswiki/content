## What Is a Credit Agency?

A credit agency is a for-benefit company that gathers data about individuals' and businesses' debts and doles out a mathematical value called a [credit score](/credit_score) that shows the borrower's creditworthiness.

## Grasping Credit Agencies

Creditors and lenders, for example, credit card companies and banks, report their clients' borrowing activity and history to credit agencies. Individuals and businesses can get duplicates of the data reported about them by contacting the credit agency or a connected third-party company and paying a nominal fee.

Nonetheless, in 1970 the Federal Trade Commission passed the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA), which requires the major credit agencies to give a free copy of your credit report once like clockwork upon request.

The data gave to credit agencies incorporates how much [credit](/credit) is accessible to that borrower, the amount of the accessible credit they have utilized, and what their repayment activity resembles. Credit agencies, otherwise called credit rating agencies, assist possible lenders and creditors with deciding if to loan or stretch out credit to an individual or business, by foreseeing the probability that the borrower will repay the debt on time.

## Ways Credit Agencies Affect Financial Transactions

The evaluations and ratings given by credit agencies can influence financing-driven purchases and activities like buying a vehicle or tying down a mortgage to obtain real estate. On the other hand, the repayment of tuition loans for college understudies might influence the ratings assigned by credit agencies.

Three consumer credit agencies are TransUnion, Equifax, and Experian. There can be variances in the ratings assigned by the agencies for a similar individual. These differences might stem from various businesses and lenders reporting financial data about borrowing and repayment activity to certain agencies, yet not to every one of the three.

The scores and credit reports that are produced by these agencies might be utilized for different purposes outside of loan endorsement. For example, certain employers could request the credit rating of potential recruits while considering job applicants. This might be due to the idea of the position, which could require a high feeling of fiscal responsibility.

Businesses can in like manner be assessed by credit agencies, not just for their financial wellness to repay financing they apply for, yet additionally for possible investors in the business. As part of a due diligence process before a deal, the credit score of the business will probably be inspected by the party that desires to take part in a financial transaction. For instance, a potential buyer who needs to obtain a business might need to comprehend its financial wellbeing before it gets the deal.

In like manner, possible supporters in a funding round or prospective buyers for a public offering from the company might require a report from a credit agency before propelling their plans.
