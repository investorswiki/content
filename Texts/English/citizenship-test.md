# Citizen Test
## What Is a Citizen Test?

A citizen test, likewise called a resident test, decides if a taxpayer can claim a dependent under rules set by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). The claimed dependent must be a U.S. citizen, a U.S. resident, a resident of Mexico or Canada, or an adopted child who has lived with the taxpayer all year long. On the off chance that none of these criteria is met, the person can't be claimed as a dependent. A citizen test ought not be mistaken for a citizenship test, which is the test given to settlers seeking U.S. citizenship.

## How a Citizen Test Works

The citizen test, from Internal Revenue Code Section 152, is one of several tests that must be met for somebody to be claimed as a dependent. The others are the relationship, age, residency, [joint return](/joint-return-test), and [support tests](/support-test).

A U.S. citizen is either brought into the world in the U.S. or on the other hand fulfills the requirements of naturalization, which is a legal interaction laid out by Congress. U.S. citizens whose children are brought into the world outside the United States and who don't routinely dwell in the U.S. can complete the Application for Certificate of Citizenship to apply for citizenship for their children when certain conditions are fulfilled. Besides, both parent and child must meet with a U.S. migration officer, and the child must fulfill required conditions at the time their Oath of Allegiance is taken.

> On the off chance that you were a U.S. citizen when your child was conceived, yet your spouse was not, and your child was brought into the world in a foreign country, the child might be a U.S. citizen, in which case you can take the exemption — even assuming the child lives abroad with the nonresident parent.

In the event that you were a U.S. citizen when your child was conceived, the child might be a U.S citizen even in the event that the other parent was a nonresident and the child was brought into the world in a foreign country. In this case, as long as the other dependency tests are met, the child is your dependent, and you might take the exemption — even assuming the child lives abroad with the nonresident parent.

In the event that you are a U.S. citizen living abroad who has legally adopted a child who isn't a U.S. citizen or resident, and the other dependency tests are met, the child is considered your dependent. Consequently, you might take the exemption in the event that your house is the child's [main residence](/principalresidence) and the child is a member of your household for your whole tax year.
