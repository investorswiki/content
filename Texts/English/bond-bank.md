# Bond Bank
## What is Bond Bank?

A bond bank is an independent state-made entity that solidifies nearby bond [issues](/issue) into a single pool to offer better financing options for state or municipal undertakings.

## Understanding Bond Bank

Bond banks might be made through legislation, however they are separate and distinct from the state government itself. They have independent boards and commissioners. A state's bond bank credit rating contrasts from the state's credit rating. For instance, [Moody's Investors Service](/moodys) relegates one credit rating to the Maine Municipal Bond Bank (MMBB) and an alternate credit to the state of Maine itself. The higher credit rating for MMBB assists it with gaining access to better interest rates, which brings down borrowing costs for the state of Maine.

Nonetheless, a few states have credit ratings that are on par with their bond bank. In these cases, bond banks may not get a better rate than the state would all alone. In any case, bond banks assist with expressing governments by combining the borrowing system, making it more streamlined and simpler for the state to gain financing.

Bond banks generally make no less than two annual bond issuances and most will be tax-exempt. The consolidation of the different investment grade fixed-income securities that is finished by the bond bank has the planned effect of bringing down the overall risk of that pooled offering to the investor.

The money generated from bond bank issues goes to the state or municipality, which utilizes the money to fund public tasks like schools, emergency clinics, and drinking water infrastructure. Bond banks act as fundamental go-betweens, permitting states to finance infrastructure through huge bond issues, as opposed to piecemeal through more modest issues controlled straight by the state government, which significantly brings down issuance costs. Moreover, pooling debt gives the bond bank offering a higher credit rating that outcomes in better [interest rates](/interestrate) for the borrower.

## Maine Bond Bank

The most seasoned bond bank in the U.S. is the Maine Municipal Bond Bank, made in 1971 by the state's council. The bond bank is an independent agency, however its commissioners are designated by the lead representative. The bond bank issues bonds for undertakings, for example, the Transcap Bond Program, which helps fund the Maine Department of Transportation; and the Drinking Water SRF Program, which assists the state with keeping up with clean drinking water supplies for its residents. Investors who wish to purchase these bonds can do as such through designated brokers listed with the bond bank.

Not all states have bond banks. The [Tax Reform Act of 1986](/taxreformact1986) fixed rules to keep states and municipalities from giving large measures of [tax-exempt](/tax_exempt) bonds to sponsor private business. This implied that bond banks in operation before 1986 could build up resources through borrowing before the limitations became effective. Bond banks made after the act confronted more severe limits, making it harder for them to build up a base from which to develop.
