# Price Persistence
## What Is Price Persistence?

Price persistence is the propensity of a security's price to keep moving in its present heading. A stock that has been in a strong vertical or downward [trend](/trend) for a really long time is displaying price persistence. On the other hand, a stock that has been trading in a choppy way for an extended period of time will display a low degree of price persistence.

## What Does Price Persistence Tell You?

Price persistence is basically an indicator of how strong a security is. Price persistence in certain stocks might last just seven days, while in others it might last months (or even years). Price persistence doesn't be guaranteed to mean there will not be corrections against the prevailing trend heading — there frequently will be. It just means that those corrections or [pullbacks](/pullback) are relatively short-lived, with the trend heading taking over after the pullback.

While the rules of physical science don't be guaranteed to apply to stock prices, price will change heading when another force acts on it. These different forces are supply and demand, which might line up with pre-existing resistance and support levels.

Expect that a stock is trending higher. It is trending higher overall, yet will in any case have short-term drops in the price, followed by moves back to new highs. As the price approaches a support level on a pullback —, for example, a rising [trendline](/trendline) or a well known moving normal — demand for that security might increase. Additionally, since the price has previously fallen, supply — the number of individuals remaining who wish to sell — may likewise begin to decrease. These forces bring about pushing the price back up. With strong price persistence, this happens rapidly, as there is significantly more demand for a stock (uptrend) than there is supply.

The reverse is true for a downtrend with persistence. As the price drops, it might have short-term rallies, even on the off chance that the overall movement is lower. However, since the price direction is down, there might be less individuals who wish to buy, and many individuals who wish to sell. As the price skips higher, the demand — the number of buyers remaining — is discounted, while the supply remains predictable or increases. This outcomes in the price moving down. The more rapidly this occurs, the more persistence the price is appearing.

## Illustration of How to Use Price Persistence

The following chart of Shopify Inc. (SHOP) shows price persistence in more than one way and on various time spans.
<!--7B7A7CA2B1527E36222CC2DDC7595AA4-->
At first, the stock is rising with not many pullbacks and corrections. For almost a year the price showed strong price persistence along these lines.

This period was followed by a bigger correction, which framed a [cup and handle pattern](/cupandhandle). Yet again in the wake of moving off the lower part of the cup, the stock showed strong price persistence to the upside. The persistence might have proceeded, albeit the 2020 crisis fears pushed virtually all stocks lower as investors hoped to exit securities and move to cash.

This [sell-off](/sell-off), while steep, was short-lived. The stock showed strong price persistence revitalizing to new highs rapidly. No security trend, regardless of how strong, lasts until the end of time. There are dependably reversals. Commonly, the greater the trend, the bigger the reversal to follow.

Follow the trend and profit from it while it is there, yet get out when corrections become bigger than they have been. At the point when corrections or pullbacks get bigger, this can be an indication that the trend is losing [momentum](/momentum): The persistence is breaking.

## The Difference Between Price Persistence and Relative Strength

Price persistence alludes to the price of a security trending toward a path for an extended period of time. It doesn't include comparison to different securities. [Relative strength](/relativestrength) is taking a gander at how the strength of the trend in one security compares to another. In the event that two stocks are in an uptrend, however Stock A has climbed more than Stock B, then, at that point, Stock A has relative strength compared to Stock B.

## Features
- Price persistence lasts until there is a shift in supply or demand that reverses the trend.
- Price persistence is the ability of a stock to keep moving in the trending bearing.
- Eventually, all trends end with a reversal; investors can profit by riding a trend while it continues.
