## What Is a Joint-Stock Company?

The joint-stock company is an ancestor to the modern corporation. A joint-stock company is a business owned by its investors, with every investor possessing a share in view of the amount of stock purchased.

Joint-stock companies are made to finance endeavors that are too costly for an individual or even a government to fund. The owners of a joint-stock company hope to share in its profits.

## Figuring out Joint-Stock Companies

Except if the company is incorporated, the shareholders of a joint-stock company have unlimited liability for company debts. The legal course of incorporation, in the U.S., decreases that liability to the face value of stock owned by the shareholder. In Great Britain, the term "limited" has a comparative significance.

The shares of a joint-stock company are transferable. Assuming the joint-stock company is public, its shares are traded on registered stock exchanges. Shares of private joint-stock company stock are transferable between parties, however the transfer interaction is much of the time limited by agreement, to family individuals, for instance.

## A Short History of Joint-Stock Companies

Records of joint-stock companies are being framed in Europe as soon as the thirteenth century. Be that as it may, they seem to have duplicated beginning in the 16th century, whenever courageous investors started hypothesizing about opportunities to be found in the New World.

European exploration of the Americas was largely financed by joint-stock companies. Governments were excited for a new area yet were hesitant to take on the colossal costs and risks associated with these ventures.

That drove entrepreneurs to devise a [business plan](/business-plan). They would sell shares in their ventures to numerous investors to fund-raise to fund journeys to the New World. The potential for resources to be taken advantage of and trade to be developed was the fascination for some investors. Others wanted to in a real sense have a special interest in the New World and lay out new networks that would be free of strict mistreatment.

In American history, the Virginia Company of London is one of the earliest and most well known joint-stock companies. In 1606, King James I marked a royal charter allowing the company exclusive rights to lay out a province in what is presently Virginia. The Virginia Company's business plan was aggressive, going from taking advantage of the district's gold resources (there weren't any) to finding a safe route to China (they didn't).

After numerous difficulties, the company effectively settled the Jamestown province in Virginia and started to develop and export tobacco. Nonetheless, in 1624, an English court ordered the company to disintegrate and changed over Virginia into a royal province. The investors in the Virginia Company never saw a profit.
