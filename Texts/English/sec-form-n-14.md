## Understanding SEC Form N-14

SEC Form N-14 is otherwise called the "Registration Statement Under the Securities Act of 1933." SEC Form N-14 is required in order to furnish investors with the significant financial and company information they need to settle on an informed conclusion about the decision about whether to invest in the company. The SEC Form N-14 additionally prevents misrepresentations, tricky behavior, and other fraud in the sale of securities.

Part A, the [prospectus](/prospectus), contains a simple and direct explanation of the type of fund or separate account; the proposed transaction; the investment's fee structure and risk components; information about the registrant; information about the company being acquired, voting information; information about the interest of certain persons and specialists; and additional information required for reoffering by persons considered to be underwriters. Part B contains additional information about the registrant, the company being acquired and financial statements.

The information gave in the SEC Form N-14 and different filings is required to be accurate. The SEC cannot guarantee the precision of the information in corporate filings, however it can and brings enforcement actions against companies that have been dishonest in their filings or generally failed to give accurate information to investors. On the off chance that investors endure losses due to a company's underhanded filings, they might have the option to recuperate a portion of those losses.

The SEC Form N-14 and its associated prospectuses become public record soon after they are filed with the SEC. All foreign and domestic companies are required to electronically file the SEC Form N-14. Investors are then able to access the form and associated prospectuses, as well as other company filings, through the [EDGAR database](/edgar).

Offerings of securities are not generally required to be registered with the SEC; some are exempt. Exempt offerings include private offerings available only to a limited number of individual or institutional investors; intrastate offerings; small offerings; and municipal, state, or federal government offerings. Exempting a few offerings from the registration requirement is a means of lowering the cost for companies of providing securities to the public, by creating more opportunities for these companies to form capital.
