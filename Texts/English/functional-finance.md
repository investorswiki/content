## What Is Functional Finance?

Functional finance is a heterodox or strange macroeconomic theory developed by Russian-conceived, British-raised economist Abba Lerner during World War II that looks to kill economic weakness (i.e., the business cycle) through government intervention in the economy.

## Grasping Functional Finance

Functional finance accentuates the consequence of interventionist policies on the economy. It actively advances government [deficit spending](/deficit-spending) as an effective approach to lessening unemployment. The theory contends that the government's priority ought to adjust supply and demand at full employment, versus attempting to balance the budget.

## Functional Finance Theory

Functional finance depends on three major convictions:

1. It is the job of government to fight off [inflation](/inflation) and unemployment by controlling [consumer spending](/consumer-spending) through the raising and bringing down of taxes.
1. The purpose of government borrowing and lending is to control interest rates, investment levels, and inflation.
1. The government ought to print, crowd, or obliterate money as it wants to accomplish these objectives.

## Special Considerations

Functional finance likewise says that the sole purpose of [taxation](/taxation) is to control consumer spending on the grounds that the government can pay its expenses and obligations by printing money. Moreover, Lerner's theory doesn't really accept that it is important for governments to balance their [budgets](/budget).

## Abba Lerner

Lerner earned a B.A. in economics from the London School of Economics in 1932 and was an educator there for quite a long time. Afterward, he attended the University of Cambridge, where he concentrated on [John Maynard Keynes](/john_maynard_keynes') "The General Theory of Employment, Interest, and Money" (1936).

### The Impact of Keynes

Lerner was a devotee of the incredibly powerful economist and assisted with creating and promote a portion of his thoughts. [Keynesian economics](/keynesianeconomics) embraced the concept that optimal economic performance could be accomplished by utilizing economic intervention policies by the government to influence aggregate demand. It is viewed as a demand-side theory.

### Lerner's Work

Lerner looked to make sense of the correlation between high employment rates and inflation. He likewise imagined a strategy for measuring the power of restraining infrastructures that was known as the Lerner Index. He was open to communist contentions quite a bit of his life, and contended for arranged economies, as shown in his 1944 book, "The Economics of Control: Principles of Welfare Economics."

In his lifetime, he educated at a number of American universities, including Columbia and the University of California, Berkeley and ended his showing career at Florida State University. He kicked the bucket in Tallahassee, Florida in 1982 at 78 years old.
