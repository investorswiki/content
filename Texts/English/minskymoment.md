He felt that extended bull markets generally end in awe-inspiring collapses.

Minsky hypothesized that an abnormally long bullish economic growth cycle will prod an asymmetric rise in market speculation that will, eventually, bring about market shakiness and collapse. A Minsky Moment crisis follows a prolonged period of bullish speculation, which is likewise associated with high measures of debt taken on by both retail and institutional investors.

The term Minsky Moment was begat in 1998 by Paul McCulley, of [PIMCO](/pimco) notoriety while alluding to the Asian Debt Crisis of 1997.

As a speculative model, consider a market in the pains of a bullish flood that sees investors borrowing funds aggressively, frequently to the limits of their capacities, to take part in the economic boom. On the off chance that the market follows somewhat, which is normal market behavior, the valuations of their leveraged assets could diminish to the point where they probably won't cover the debts taken to get them. [Lenders](/moneylender) begin calling in their loans. Speculative assets are difficult to sell, so investors are forced to sell less speculative ones to fulfill the moneylender's demands. The sale of these investments causes an overall decline in the market. As of now, the market is in a Minsky Moment. The demand for [liquidity](/liquidity) could even force the country's central bank to intercede.
