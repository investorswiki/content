# European Option
## What Is an European Option?

An European option is a rendition of a [options contract](/optionscontract) that limits execution to its expiration date. At the end of the day, on the off chance that the underlying security, for example, a stock has moved in price, an investor wouldn't have the option to exercise the option early and take delivery of or sell the shares. All things being equal, the call or put action will just happen on the date of option [maturity](/maturity).

One more form of the options contract is the [American option](/americanoption), which can be exercised any time up to and including the date of expiration. The names of these two variants ought not be mistaken for the geographic location as the name just means the right of execution.

## Grasping an European Option

European options characterize the time period when holders of an options contract might exercise their contract rights. The rights for the option holder incorporate buying the underlying asset or selling the underlying asset at the predetermined contract price — the [strike price](/strikeprice). With European options, the holder may just exercise their rights upon the arrival of expiration. Likewise with different forms of options contracts, European options come at an upfront cost — the [premium](/option-premium).

It is important to note that investors normally don't have a decision of buying either the American or the European option. Specific stocks or funds could be offered in one form or the other, and not in both. Most [indexes](/index) utilize European options since it lessens the amount of accounting required by the brokerage.

> Many brokers utilize the [Black-Scholes model](/blackscholes) (BSM) to value European options.

European index options halt trading at business close Thursday before the third Friday of the expiration month. This lapse in trading permits the brokers the ability to price the individual assets of the underlying index.

Due to this interaction, the [settlement price](/settlementprice) of the option can frequently come as a shock. Stocks or different securities might take exceptional actions between the Thursday close and market opening Friday. Likewise, it might require hours after the market opens Friday for the clear settlement price to distribute.

European options regularly trade [over the counter](/otc) (OTC), while American options as a rule trade on normalized exchanges.

## Types of European Options
### Call

An European call option gives the owner the right to gain the [underlying security](/underlying-security) at expiry. For an investor to profit from a [call option](/calloption), the stock's price, at expiry, must exchange high sufficient over the strike price to cover the cost of the option premium.

### Put

An European put option permits the holder to sell the underlying security at expiry. For an investor to profit from a [put option](/putoption), the stock's price, at expiry, must exchange far sufficient below the strike price to cover the cost of the option premium.

## Closing an European Option Early

Typically, [exercising](/exercise) an option means initializing the rights of the option with the goal that a trade is executed at the strike price. In any case, numerous investors could do without to sit tight for an European option to [expire](/expirationdate). All things being equal, investors can sell the option contract back to the market before its expiration.

Option prices change in light of the movement and [volatility](/volatility) of the underlying asset and the time until expiration. As a stock price rises and falls, the value — connoted by the premium — of the option increments and diminishes. Investors can unwind their option position early assuming that the current option premium is higher than the premium they initially paid. In this case, the investor would receive the net difference between the two premiums.

Closing the option position before expiration means the trader understands any gains or losses on the contract itself. An existing call option could be sold early in the event that the stock has risen essentially, while a put option could be sold assuming that the stock's price has fallen.

Closing the European option early relies upon the common market conditions, the value of the premium — its [intrinsic value](/intrinsicvalue) — and the [option's time value](/timevalue) — the amount of time staying before a contract's expiration. Assuming an option is close to its expiration, it's impossible an investor will get a lot of return for selling the option early in light of the fact that there's brief period left for the option to bring in money. In this case, the option's worth lays on its intrinsic value, an assumed price in light of in the event that the contract is in, out, or [at the money](/atthemoney) (ATM).

## European Option versus American Option

European options must be exercised on the expiration date, while American options can be exercised whenever between the purchase and expiration dates. At the end of the day, American options permit investors to understand a profit when the stock price moves in support of themselves and enough to more than offset the premium paid.

Investors will utilize American options with [dividend](/dividend)- paying stocks. Along these lines, they can exercise the option before a [ex-dividend date](/ex-date). The flexibility of American options permits investors to claim an organization's shares so as to get compensated a dividend.

Notwithstanding, the flexibility of utilizing an American option includes some major disadvantages — a premium to the premium. The increased cost of the option means investors need the underlying asset to move far enough from the strike price to make the trade return a profit.

Likewise, in the event that an American option is held to maturity, the investor would have been better off buying a lower-priced, European rendition option and paying the lower premium.

## Example of an European Option

An investor purchases a July call option on Citigroup Inc. with a $50 strike price. The premium is $5 per contract — 100 shares — for a total cost of $500 ($5 x 100 = $500). At expiration, Citigroup is trading at $75. In this case, the owner of the call option has the privilege to purchase the stock at $50 — exercise their option — making $25 per share profit. While calculating in the initial premium of $5, the net profit is $20 per share or $2,000 (25 - $5 = $20 x 100 = $2000).

We should consider a second scenario by which Citigroup's stock price tumbled to $30 when of the call option's expiration. Since the stock is trading below the strike of $50, the option isn't exercised and expires worthless. The investor loses the premium of $500 paid at the beginning.

The investor can hold on until expiry to decide if the trade is profitable, or they can try to sell the call option back to the market. Whether the premium received for selling the call option is sufficient to cover the initial $5 paid is dependent on many conditions, including economic conditions, the organization's [earnings](/earnings), the time left until expiration, and the volatility of the stock's price at the hour of the sale.

There's no guarantee the premium received from selling the call option before expiry will be sufficient to offset the $5 premium paid initially.
