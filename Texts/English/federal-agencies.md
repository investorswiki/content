# Federal Agency
## What Is a Federal Agency?

Federal agencies are special government organizations set up for a specific purpose, for example, the management of resources, financial oversight of industries, or national security issues. These organizations are regularly made by legislative action, yet may initially be set up by presidential order too. The directors of these agencies are normally chosen by presidential arrangement.

## Figuring out Federal Agencies

Federal agencies are made by the government to direct industries or practices that require close oversight or specialized aptitude. A few organizations, for example, the [Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation](/fdic) (FDIC) and the [Government National Mortgage Association](/ginniemae) (GNMA), have their operations unequivocally backed by the [U.S. Treasury](/ustreasury). Different organizations, like Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and Sallie Mae are just given an implicit guarantee from the U.S. Treasury.

A number of the organizations which are a genuine part of the government issue securities like stocks and bonds. These have been generally famous with investors. [Federal agency bonds](/agencybonds), which are bonds that are backed by the [full faith and credit](/full-faith-credit) of the United States government, are instances of federal agency securities. Investors hope to receive customary interest payments from holding an agency bond. At maturity, the full [face value](/facevalue) of the agency bond is reimbursed to the bondholder. Since federal agency bonds are less liquid than [Treasury bonds](/treasurybond), they offer a somewhat higher rate of interest than Treasury bonds. Instances of federal agencies that guarantee certain bonds or securities incorporate the [Federal Housing Administration](/federal-housing-administration) (FHA), [Small Business Administration](/small-business-administration) (SBA), and [Government National Mortgage Association](/ginniemae) (GNMA or Ginnie Mae).

## Different Types of Government Bonds

One more type of bond issued by government agencies is the [government-sponsored enterprise](/gse) (GSE) bond. These bonds are issued by corporations that are not exactly part of the government but rather are set up by Congress to work to bring about some benefit for the country. These enterprises generally operate all alone and are publicly held on the major exchanges. GSEs incorporate the Federal National Mortgage Association (Fannie Mae), [Federal Home Loan Mortgage](/freddiemac) (Freddie Mac), Federal Farm Credit Banks Funding Corporation, and the [Federal Home Loan Bank](/fhlb) (FHLB). The government guarantee that applies to agency bonds doesn't matter to GSE bonds, which hence have [credit risk](/creditrisk) and [default risk](/defaultrisk). Thus, the yield on these bonds is commonly higher than the yield on Treasury bonds.

Mortgage loans are backed by federal agency securities issued by Ginnie Mae, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac or the FHLB, and hold an exceptionally high credit rating. Agency securities are likewise utilized as collateral for the supply of money delivered by the [Federal Reserve](/federalreservebank). Sold by a cross country group of banks and dealers, these securities fund-raise to fund public requirements, for example, road building, low-cost housing, urban renewal, and furthermore to give low-interest rate loans to farmers, small business owners, and veterans.
