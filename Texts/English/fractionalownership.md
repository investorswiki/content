# Fractional Ownership
## What is fractional ownership?
Fractional ownership is where several individuals share the ownership of an asset, for example, a holiday home. Dissimilar to different forms of shared utilize that give rights to utilize a property yet don't present ownership rights, every person participating in fractional ownership claims a portion of the asset.
## More profound definition
The concept behind fractional ownership is that it works with the group purchase of a costly asset, allowing every owner access to and utilization of the asset, as indicated by the size of their share. At the point when property is purchased with fractional ownership, the title is split between the owners in proportion to their ownership.
Fractional ownership can be utilized to purchase any form of major asset, including:
- Real estate.
- Yachts and boats.
- Sporting vehicles.
- Aircraft.
- Sports cars.

The big advantage of fractional ownership is that every owner has a direct share in the property. This means the value of the owner's share changes as the asset appreciates or deteriorates. Besides, each fractional owner has something to do with what befalls the asset and the way things are utilized.
Fractional ownership is not the same as a period share in that a period share permits utilization of the asset for a defined period of time just, generally seven days. Time-share owners have no direct say in how the asset is utilized, kept up with or sold.
With fractional ownership, you can buy a bigger share of a vacation property, ordinarily for a period of as long as 26 weeks.
Fractional owners share responsibility for the maintenance and upkeep of the asset, in spite of the fact that it is common practice to contract this out to a management company.
## Fractional ownership model
Fractional ownership permits you to buy a share in an asset that is past your immediate financial reach. For instance, to approach an upscale vacation property several times every year, you can accomplish that with fractional ownership. Besides, to utilize the property, you can sell your fractional ownership to another person.
