# Bottleneck
## What Is a Bottleneck?

A bottleneck is a point of congestion in a production system, (for example, an assembly line or a computer network) that happens when responsibilities show up too rapidly for the production cycle to handle. The shortcomings brought about by the bottleneck frequently make delays and higher [production costs](/production-cost). The term "bottleneck" alludes to the ordinary state of a container and the way that the jug's neck is the tightest point, which is the most probable place for congestion to happen, dialing back the flow of liquid from the jug.

A bottleneck can fundamentally affect the flow of [manufacturing](/manufacturing) and can forcefully increase the time and expense of production. Companies are more at risk for bottlenecks when they start the production interaction for another product. This is on the grounds that there might be defects in the process that the company must recognize and address; this situation requires more examination and fine-tuning. Operations management is worried about controlling the production interaction, distinguishing likely bottlenecks before they happen, and finding efficient arrangements.

## Grasping a Bottleneck

For instance, expect that a furniture manufacturer moves wood, metal, and other [raw materials](/rawmaterials) into production, and afterward causes labor and machine costs to create and collect furniture. At the point when production is complete, the completed goods are stored in inventory. The inventory cost is frequently moved to the [cost of goods sold](/cogs) (COGS) when the furniture is sold to a customer.

Assuming that there is a bottleneck toward the beginning of production, the furniture maker can't move an adequate number of raw materials into the cycle, and that means that machines sit idle and salaried workers are not working productively, causing a situation of underutilization of resources. This increases the cost of production, as well as presents a possibly large [opportunity cost](/opportunitycost), and may mean that completed goods don't ship to customers on time.

> Traffic on streets and highways are frequently brought about by bottlenecks that limit the flow of traffic. This can be due to poor planning, roadwork, or an accident that closes at least one paths.

## Bottlenecks and Production Capacity

A bottleneck influences the level of [production capacity](/capacity) that a firm can accomplish every month. Hypothetical capacity expects that a company can deliver at maximum capacity consistently. This concept accepts no machine breakdowns, washroom breaks, or employee excursions.

Since hypothetical capacity isn't sensible, most organizations utilize viable capacity to oversee production. This level of capacity expects downtime for machine repairs and employee downtime. Pragmatic capacity gives a reach to which various processes can operate efficiently without breaking down. Go over the optimum reach and the risk increases for a bottleneck due to a breakdown of at least one processes.

In the event that a company observes that its production capacity is lacking to meet its production objectives, it has several options at its disposal. Company management could choose to bring down their production objectives to align them with their production capacity. Or on the other hand, they could attempt to find arrangements that all the while forestall bottlenecks and increase production. Companies frequently use [capacity requirements planning](/capacity-requirements-planning) (CRP) tools and methods to determine and meet production objectives.

## Bottlenecks and Production Variances

A [variance in the production process](/production-volume-variance) is the difference among planned and genuine outcomes. Managers investigate variances to make changes, including changes to eliminate bottlenecks. Assuming real labor costs are a lot higher than planned amounts, the manager might determine that a bottleneck is postponing production and wasting labor hours. On the off chance that management can eliminate the bottleneck, labor costs can be reduced.

A bottleneck can likewise cause a material variance on the off chance that materials are presented to spoilage or conceivable damage as they sit on the factory floor waiting to be utilized in production. Bottlenecks might be settled by expanding [capacity utilization](/capacityutilizationrate), finding new providers, computerizing labor processes, and making better estimates for consumer demand.

## True Example of a Bottleneck

Bottlenecks may likewise emerge when demand spikes suddenly and surpasses the production capacity of a firm's processing plants or providers. For example, when Tesla, Inc. (TSLA) initially started production of its all-electric vehicles, demand was high for the vehicles and a few analysts were worried that production would be eased back due to issues in the production line. Furthermore, as a matter of fact, Tesla has encountered continuous production bottlenecks due to the need to make the custom battery loads that supply their vehicles with power.

Tesla pioneer Elon Musk has said the company's ability to grow its product setup relies squarely upon its ability to deliver a large number of batteries. To get that going, in a joint venture with Panasonic, Tesla opened an enormous "Gigafactory" close to Reno, Nevada in 2016, which makes the company's lithium-particle batteries and electric vehicle subassemblies. By mid-2018, the company asserted its factory was at that point the highest-volume battery plant in the world in terms of gigawatt-hours (GWh). To leave a mark on the shortlist for backordered vehicles, Tesla says it should keep on investing in and build more Gigafactories worldwide.

## Highlights
- A bottleneck influences the level of production capacity that a firm can accomplish every month.
- A bottleneck is a point of congestion in a production system, (for example, an assembly line or a computer network) that happens when jobs show up too rapidly for the production cycle to handle.
- Reducing bottlenecks is key to expanding proficiency.
- A bottleneck can essentially affect the flow of manufacturing and can strongly increase the time and expense of production.
## FAQ
### What Is a Bottleneck in Manufacturing?
A bottleneck happens in manufacturing when there is a stage (or stages) in the process that dials back the overall production of a decent. For example, initial steps may quickly collect key parts, yet an essential next step that welds the parts together will most likely be unable to keep pace with the prior stages. Thus, a backlog happens and effectiveness is reduced. The bottleneck ought to be tackled by extending that cycle, investing in better technology to speed up that interaction, or hiring more workers to assist with that interaction.
### What Is a Bottleneck in the Services Industry?
Many services are carried out by human creatures that have a natural limit on how fast or efficiently they can function. For example, a stylist may simply have the option to cut the hair of three people each hour. On the off chance that more individuals need a haircut, they should pause, and this can cause a backlog. Ways of decreasing the bottleneck are to hire extra stylists, or to increase the proficiency of the hairdresser utilizing technology or skills training (so they can go to four customers each hour).
### Why Is It Called a Bottleneck?
A bottleneck happens when there isn't sufficient capacity to fulfill the need or [throughput](/throughput) for a product or service. It is called a "bottleneck" since the neck of a jug limits and tightens, confining the amount of liquid that can flow out of a jug without a moment's delay.
