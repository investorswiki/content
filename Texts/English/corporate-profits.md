## What Is Corporate Profit?

All corporate profit is the money left over after a corporation pays its expenses. All of the money collected by a corporation during the reporting period from services delivered or sales of a product is viewed as top-line revenue. From revenue, a company will pay its expenses. Money left after expenses are paid is viewed as the company's profit.

Corporate profit is likewise a statistic reported quarterly by the U.S. [Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA)](/bea) that sums up the [net income](/netincome) of corporations in the National Income and Product Accounts (NIPA).
