## What are Adopter Categories?

Adopter categories partition consumers into portions in view of their eagerness to try out another innovation or product.

## Grasping Adopter Categories

Adopter categories, as a term, is part of the [diffusion of innovations theory](/diffusion-of-innovations-theory) and has been applied to several studies, including [marketing](/marketing), organizational studies, information management, communications, and complexity studies, among others.

The adopter categories were first named and depicted in the milestone book **Diffusion of Innovations** by social scientist Everett Rogers in 1962. As indicated by his research, there are five adopter categories â€” pioneers, [early adopters](/early-adopter), [early majority](/early-majority), [late majority](/late-majority), and loafers.

Rogers distinguished key attributes of every adopter category, for example, the way that early adopters have the highest degree of assessment leadership among the adopter categories, while the loafers are probably going to be more seasoned, conservative, and more price conscious. The concept of adopter categories is widely utilized in present-day marketing, particularly for progressive new products or services. For instance, adopter categories are particularly applicable to social network analysis.

## Adopter Categories: Characteristics

In Roger's adopter categories, he recognizes that not every person has a similar motivation to take on new advances.

- Trailblazers: These people embrace new technology or thoughts basically in light of the fact that they are new. Pioneers will quite often face challenges all the more promptly and are the most bold.
- Early adopters: This group will in general make suppositions, which drive trends. They are similar to trailblazers in how rapidly they take on new advancements and thoughts yet are more worried about their reputation as being ahead of the curve.
- Early majority: If a thought or other innovation enters this group, it will in general be widely adopted before long. This group pursues choices in light of utility and functional benefits over coolness.
- Late majority: The late majority shares a few characteristics with the early majority however is more mindful before committing, requiring more hand-holding as they embrace.
- Slouches: This group is delayed to adjust to groundbreaking thoughts or technology. They will quite often embrace just when they are forced to or on the grounds that every other person has as of now.

While contrasting these groups, the progression of adoption is slow and legitimate. Most advertisers and business engineers find that overcoming any barrier between early adopters and the early majority is their most vexing task. It addresses a fundamental change in behavior to take on something since it is new and cool and afterward progress to judging and embracing some innovation since it is important, valuable, and productive. On account of the early majority, coolness may be a disservice.
