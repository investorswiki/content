# Split-Funded Annuity
## What Is a Split-Funded Annuity?

A split-funded annuity is a type of [annuity](/annuity) that utilizes a portion of the [principal](/principal) to support immediate regularly scheduled payments and afterward saves the leftover portion to subsidize a deferred annuity.

## How a Split-Funded Annuity Works

A [immediate payment annuity](/immediatepaymentannuity) changes over a lump sum into a surge of fixed payments right away. Conversely, a [deferred annuity](/deferredannuity) (some of the time called a [delayed annuity](/delayed-annuity)) develops the initial lump sum for a while — frequently several years — before the [annuitization phase](/annuitizationphase) is set off and payments start.

Utilizing a split-funded annuity gives the two products, implying that people don't need to trust that the annuity will come to the [payout phase](/payoutphase) in light of the fact that the flood of income starts immediately. Simultaneously, the annuity's excess balance [compounds](/compounding) tax-deferred.

## At the point when Split-Funded Annuities Make Sense

This type of annuity might be generally interesting to individuals approaching [retirement](/retirement) age or for the people who are as of now retired.

For instance, somebody with a $3,000,000 nest egg could split the amount between an immediate annuity with a 10-year term and a deferred annuity with a similar term. Assuming a 5% annual return, this person could collect regularly scheduled payments for a considerable length of time, and toward the end anticipate that the account should be worth about what it was the point at which they began.

To structure the annuity so it bounces back into its original principal, the split might be lopsided, with more directed to the deferred portion of the annuity.

## Sticking to a Budget

These instruments may likewise be a decent decision for individuals who are not proficient at dealing with money. The funds in the annuity are locked away so it's simpler to stick to a [budget](/budget) and know the month to month stream of payments will be there.

One analysis of annuities is that they are [illiquid](/illiquid). Deposits into annuity contracts are regularly locked up for a while, known as the [surrender period](/surrender-period), where the [annuitant](/annuitant) would cause a penalty if all or part of that money were contacted. These surrender periods can last somewhere in the range of six to eight years, contingent upon the particular product. Surrender fees can begin at 10% or more, and the penalty normally declines annually over the surrender period.

Annuities are proper financial products for people seeking stable, guaranteed retirement income. Since the lump sum put into the annuity is illiquid and subject to withdrawal punishments, it isn't suggested for more youthful people or for those with liquidity needs. Annuity holders can't outlast their income stream, which [hedges](/fence) longevity risk. Inasmuch as the purchaser comprehends that they are trading a liquid lump sum for a guaranteed series of [cash flows](/cashflow), the product can be suitable.
