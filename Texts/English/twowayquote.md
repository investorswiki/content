# Two-Way Quote
## What Is a Two-Way Quote?

A two-way (or [two-sided](/two-sidedmarket)) quote demonstrates both the current [bid price](/bidprice) and the current [ask pric](/ask)e of a security during a trading day on an exchange. To a trader, a two-way quote is more useful than the standard last-trade quote, which shows just the price at which the security last traded.

A two-way quote includes a [bid-ask spread](/bid-askspread), or the difference between the highest price that a buyer will pay for an asset and the least price that a [seller](/seller) will acknowledge. An individual hoping to sell will receive the bid price while one hoping to buy will pay the ask price.

Two-way quotes can be diverged from [one-way quotes](/onewaymarket), which give just the bid side **or** the ask side.

## Grasping a Two-Way Quote

A [quote](/quote) is the price at which an asset can be traded; it might likewise allude to the latest price that a buyer and seller agreed upon and at which some amount of the asset was executed. A two-way quote tells traders the current price at which they can buy or sell a security. In addition, the difference between the two demonstrates the spread or the difference between the bid and the ask, providing traders with a thought of the [current liquidity](/current-liquidity) in the security.

A more modest spread demonstrates greater [liquidity](/liquidity). There are an adequate number of shares available at that moment to satisfy need, causing a restricting of the gap between the bid and ask.

Two-way price citations are frequently conveyed as $X/$Y when written, or "$X bid at $Y" when spoken.

Here is an illustration of a two-way quote for a stock: Citigroup $62.50/$63.30, or "$62,50 bid at $63.30." This lets traders know that they can currently purchase Citigroup shares for $63.30 or sell them for $62.50. The spread between the bid and the ask is $0.80 = ($63.30-$62.50).

> A one-way quote, or one-sided market, happens in a security in which market makers just quote either the bid or the ask price. This condition can emerge when the market is moving firmly in a certain heading or on the other hand on the off chance that volatility increments out of nowhere.

## About the Bid-Ask Spread

Whether the quote included is in stocks, bonds, futures contracts, options, or currencies, the bid-ask spread is the difference between the price quoted for an immediate sale or purchase. The size of the bid-offer spread is one measure of the liquidity of the market and the size of the transaction cost. On the off chance that the spread is zero, the security is called a [frictionless asset](/frictionlessmarket).

[Market makers](/marketmaker) are professional traders who offer to sell securities at a given price (the ask price) and will likewise bid to purchase securities at a given price (the bid price). At the point when an investor starts a trade, they will acknowledge one of these two prices relying upon whether they wish to buy the security (ask price) or sell the security (bid price).

The difference between these two, the spread, is the principal transaction cost of trading (outside of commissions), and it is collected by the market maker through the natural flow of processing orders at the bid and ask prices. This is the very thing financial brokerages mean when they state that their incomes are derived from traders "crossing the spread."

The bid-ask spread can be viewed as a measure of the supply and demand for a specific asset. Since the bid can be said to address demand and the ask to address the supply for an asset, the facts would show that when these two prices grow further separated the price action mirrors a change in supply and demand.

## Depth and Liquidity

The [depth](/marketdepth) of the "bids" and the "asks" can essentially affect a two-way quote. The spread might broaden fundamentally in the event that less participants place limit orders to buy a security (in this manner generating less bid prices) or on the other hand on the off chance that less sellers place limit orders to sell. Thusly, it's critical to keep the bid-ask spread as a primary concern while putting in a buy limit request to guarantee it executes effectively.

Market makers and professional traders who perceive impending risk in the markets may likewise broaden the difference between the best bid and the best ask they will offer at a given moment. In the event that all market makers do this on a given security, the quoted bid-ask spread will mirror a bigger than normal size. Some high-frequency traders and market makers endeavor to bring in money by taking advantage of changes in the bid-ask spread.

## The Costs of Liquidity

On any normalized exchange, two components include practically all of the transaction costs: [brokerage fees](/brokerage-expense) and bid-offer spreads. Under competitive conditions, the bid-offer spread measures the cost of making transactions immediately.

The price difference is paid by an earnest buyer and received by a critical seller. This is called the liquidity cost. Differences in two-way quote spreads show differences in the liquidity cost.
