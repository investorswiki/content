# Qualified Disclaimer
## What Is a Qualified Disclaimer?

A qualified disclaimer is a refusal to acknowledge property that meets the provisions set forward in the Internal Revenue Code (IRC) Tax Reform Act of 1976, considering the property or interest in property to be treated as an entity that has never been received. Section 2518 of the IRC permits a beneficiary of an estate or trust to make a qualified disclaimer so it is like the beneficiary never received the property, for tax purposes.

## Grasping the Qualified Disclaimer

Some of the time, the costs of getting a gift might be greater than the benefits of the gift, because of tax suggestions. In these cases, declining the gift might be the [tax-efficient](/tax-proficiency) what should be done. The disclaim of any gift or bequest is known as a qualified disclaimer, for [federal income tax](/federal_income_tax) purposes. The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) characterizes a qualified disclaimer as an irrevocable and unqualified refusal by a person to acknowledge an interest in property.

Qualified disclaimers are utilized to stay away from federal [estate tax](/estatetax) and [gift tax](/gifttax), and to make legal between generational transfers which stay away from taxation, gave they meet the accompanying set of requirements:

1. The disclaimer is made recorded as a hard copy and endorsed by the disclaiming party. What's more, they must recognize the property or interest in property that is being disclaimed. The disclaimed interest must then be delivered, recorded as a hard copy, to the person or entity accused of the obligation of transferring assets from the provider to the receiver(s).
1. The document is received by the transferor of the property (e.g., legal agents or the holder of legal title to the property to which the interest relates) in something like nine months from the date the property was transferred. On account of a disclaimant aged under 21, the disclaimer must be written under nine months after the disclaimant arrives at 21.
1. The disclaimant doesn't acknowledge the interest or any of its benefits. In effect, when an individual has accepted the property, they can't disclaim it.
1. Because of such refusal, the interest passes with next to no heading with respect to the person making the disclaimer and passes either to the spouse of the decedent, or to a person other than the person making the disclaimer.

Provided that these four requirements are met can the disclaimant be treated as though they never received the gift in the first place. The disclaimed property is then passed to the "[contingent beneficiary](/contingent_beneficiary)" of course, that is to say, to a party other than the original stated beneficiary of the gift or bequest. Fundamentally, the property passes to the contingent beneficiary with no tax outcome to the person disclaiming the property, gave the disclaimer is qualified. Under federal tax law, if an individual makes a "qualified disclaimer" with respect to an interest in property, the disclaimed interest is treated as though the interest had never been transferred to that person, for gift, estate, and [generational-skipping transfer](/age skipping-transfer-tax) (GST) tax purposes. Consequently, a person that makes a qualified disclaimer won't cause transfer tax results since they are ignored for transfer tax purposes. The federal law doesn't treat the disclaimant as though they had predeceased the decedent. This is in opposition to many states' disclaimer laws in which disclaimed property interests are transferred as though the disclaimant had predeceased the benefactor or decedent.

## Qualified Disclaimer Regulations and Estate Planning

Because of the severe regulations that decide if disclaimers are thought of "qualified" as per the standards of the IRC, it is essential that the revoking party comprehend the risk implied in disclaiming property. Generally speaking, the tax outcomes of getting property fall far short of the value of the property itself. It is generally more beneficial to acknowledge the property, pay the taxes on it, and afterward sell the property, rather than disclaiming interest in it.

On the off chance that a disclaimer doesn't meet the four requirements listed above, then, at that point, it is a non qualified disclaimer. In this case, the disclaimant, as opposed to the decedent, is treated as having transferred the interest in the property to the contingent beneficiary. Moreover, the disclaimant is treated as the [transferor](/transferor) for gift tax purposes and should apply the gift tax rules to decide if a taxable gift was made to the contingent beneficiary.

When utilized for [succession planning](/succession-planning), qualified disclaimers ought to be utilized considering the desires of the deceased, the beneficiary, and the contingent beneficiary.
