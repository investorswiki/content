# Nonperiodic Distribution
## What Is a Nonperiodic Distribution?

A nonperiodic distribution is a one-time, [lump-sum payment](/lump-sum-payment) of a qualified retirement plan [distribution](/distribution).

## How Nonperiodic Distribution Works

Just taxable distributions that are taken in cash are subject to the withholding tax in nonperiodic distributions. The withholding rule is expected to deter employees from pulling out their retirement assets before they are retired. Periodic distributions would rather be paid month to month or annually.

Nonperiodic distributions paid directly to an employee might be subject to a 10% early-withdrawal penalty and any owed [withholding tax](/withholdingtax) except if the beneficiary chooses to have no taxes held back. Nonperiodic distributions do exclude [individual retirement account](/ira) (IRA) transfers or rollovers, systematic withdrawals, or [required least distributions](/requiredminimumdistribution) (RMDs). A nonperiodic distribution may likewise be taken out without penalty for certain qualified expenses, like purchasing a first home.

## Types of Retirement Accounts

The following are several types of retirement accounts:

- **Payroll deduction IRA**: Even to embrace a retirement plan, it can permit its employees to add to an IRA through payroll deductions, giving a simple and direct way for eligible employees to save.
- **Salary Reduction Simplified Employee Pension (SARSEP)**: This is a [simplified employee pension](/sep) (SEP) set up before 1997 that incorporates a salary reduction arrangement. Rather than laying out a separate retirement plan, in a [SARSEP](/sarsep), employers make contributions to their own IRA and the IRAs of their employees, subject to certain rates of pay and dollar limits.
- **SEP**: They give a simplified method to employers to make contributions to a retirement plan for their employees. Rather than laying out a [profit-sharing](/profitsharingplan) or money purchase plan with a [trust](/trust), employers can take on a SEP agreement and make contributions directly to an individual retirement account or an individual retirement annuity laid out for each eligible employee.
- **SIMPLE IRA plan**: These are tax-leaned toward retirement plans that small employers, including self-employed individuals, can set up for the benefit of their employees, a SIMPLE IRA plan is a written salary reduction agreement among employee and employer that permits the employee, if eligible, to decide to have the employer contribute the [salary reductions](/salaryreductioncontribution) to a SIMPLE IRA for the employee's sake.
- [401(k)](/401kplan): This defined contribution plan permits employee salary deferrals or employer contributions.
- **SIMPLE 401(k)**: This [defined contribution plan](/definedcontributionplan) is accessible to small business owners with 100 or less employees. An employee can choose to concede some compensation.
- [403b Tax-Sheltered Annuity Plan](/403bplan): These are annuity plans for certain public schools, colleges, universities, houses of worship, public emergency clinics, and charitable substances considered tax-exempt under Internal Revenue Code segment 501c3.
- [Profit-Sharing Plan](/profitsharingplan): This defined contribution plan permits discretionary annual [employer contributions](/employeecontributionplan).
- [Money-Purchase Plan](/moneypurchasepensionplan): In this defined contribution plan, employer contributions are fixed.
- [Defined-Benefit Plan](/definedbenefitpensionplan): This is plan is funded basically by the employer for which the contributions not set in stone.
