## Understanding Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs)

An ETF is called a **exchange-traded** fund since it's traded on an exchange just as are stocks. The price of an ETF's shares will change all through the trading day as the shares are bought and sold on the market. This is not normal for mutual funds, which are not traded on an exchange, and which trade just once per day after the markets close. Furthermore, ETFs tend to be more cost-successful and more [liquid](/liquidity) compared to mutual funds.

### Passive and Active ETFs

ETFs are generally characterized as either [passive](/passive-etf) or actively managed.

A [leveraged ETF](/leveraged-etf) looks to return a few multiples (e.g., 2\u00d7 or 3\u00d7) on the return of the underlying investments.

These products use derivatives, for example, options or futures contracts to leverage their returns. There are likewise leveraged inverse ETFs, which look for an inverse increased return.

## Actively Managed ETFs

Regularly, an all the more actively managed fund will have a higher expense ratio than passively managed ETFs. To ensure that an ETF is worth holding, investors should determine how the fund is managed, whether it's actively or passively managed, the subsequent expense ratio, and the costs versus the rate of return.

## Special Considerations
### Indexed-Stock ETFs

An indexed-stock ETF gives investors the diversification of an index fund as well as the ability to sell short, [buy on margin](/buying-on-margin), and purchase just one share since there are no base deposit requirements. Nonetheless, not all ETFs are similarly diversified. Some might contain a heavy concentration in one industry, or a small group of stocks, or assets that are highly related to one another.

### Dividends and ETFs

However ETFs furnish investors with the ability to gain as stock prices rise and fall, they additionally benefit from companies that pay dividends. Dividends are a portion of earnings allocated or paid by companies to investors for holding their stock. ETF shareholders are qualified for a proportion of the profits, for example, earned [interest](/interest) or [dividends](/dividend) paid, and may get a residual value on the off chance that the fund is [liquidated](/liquidation).

### ETFs and Taxes

An ETF is more tax-efficient than a mutual fund in light of the fact that most buying and selling happen through an exchange and the ETF sponsor doesn't have to recover shares each time an investor wishes to sell or issue new shares each time an investor wishes to buy. Reclaiming shares of a fund can trigger a tax liability, so listing the shares on an exchange can keep tax costs lower. On account of a mutual fund, each time an investor sells their shares, they sell it back to the fund and cause a tax liability that must be paid by the shareholders of the fund.

### ETFs' Market Impact

Since ETFs have become progressively well known with investors, many new funds have been made, bringing about low trading volumes for some of them. The outcome can lead to investors not having the option to buy and sell shares of a low-volume ETF without any problem.

Concerns have surfaced about the influence of ETFs on the market and whether demand for these funds can blow up stock values and make delicate air pockets. A few ETFs depend on portfolio models that are untested in various market conditions and can lead to extreme inflows and outflows from the funds, which adversely affect market stability.

Since the financial crisis, ETFs play played major parts in market flash-declines and instability. Issues with ETFs were huge factors in the flash slumps and market declines in May 2010, August 2015, and February 2018.

## ETF Creation and Redemption

The supply of ETF shares is regulated through a mechanism known as creation and redemption, which includes large specialized investors called [authorized participants (APs)](/authorizedparticipant).

### ETF Creation

At the point when an ETF needs to issue extra shares, the AP buys shares of the stocks from the index — like the S&P 500 followed by the fund — and sells or exchanges them to the ETF for new ETF shares at an equivalent value. Thus, the AP sells the ETF shares in the market for a profit. At the point when an AP sells stocks to the ETF sponsor in return for shares in the ETF, the block of shares utilized in the transaction is called a [creation unit](/creationunit).

### Creation When Shares Trade at a Premium

Envision an ETF that invests in the stocks of the S&P 500 and has a share price of $101 at the close of the market. Assuming that the value of the stocks that the ETF possesses was just worth $100 on a per-share basis, then the fund's price of $101 is trading at a premium to the fund's [net asset value (NAV)](/nav). The NAV is an accounting mechanism that determines the overall value of the assets or stocks in an ETF.

An AP has an incentive to bring the ETF share price once again into equilibrium with the fund's NAV. To do this, the AP will buy shares of the stocks that the ETF needs to hold in its portfolio from the market and sells them to the fund in return for shares of the ETF. In this model, the AP is buying stock on the open market worth $100 per share however getting shares of the ETF that are trading on the open market for $101 per share. This interaction is called creation and increases the number of ETF shares on the market. On the off chance that all the other things continues as before, expanding the number of shares available on the market will reduce the price of the ETF and align shares with the NAV of the fund.

### ETF Redemption

Alternately, an AP likewise buys shares of the ETF on the open market. The AP then sells these shares back to the ETF sponsor in exchange for individual stock shares that the AP can sell on the open market. Accordingly, the number of ETF shares is reduced through the cycle called [redemption](/redemption-mechanism).

The amount of redemption and creation activity is a function of demand in the market and whether the ETF is trading at a discount or premium to the value of the fund's assets.

### Redemption When Shares Trade at a Discount

Envision an ETF that holds the stocks in the Russell 2000 small-cap index and is as of now trading for $99 per share. Assuming that the value of the stocks that the ETF is holding in the fund is $100 per share, then the ETF is trading at a discount to its NAV.

To take the ETF's share price back to its NAV, an AP will buy shares of the ETF on the open market and sell them back to the ETF in return for shares of the underlying stock portfolio. In this model, the AP can buy ownership of $100 worth of stock in exchange for ETF shares that it bought for $99. This cycle is called redemption, and it diminishes the supply of ETF shares on the market. At the point when the supply of ETF shares is diminished, the price ought to rise and draw nearer to its NAV.

## ETFs versus Mutual Funds versus Stocks

Contrasting elements for ETFs, mutual funds, and stocks can be a test in a world of consistently changing broker fees and policies. Most stocks, ETFs, and mutual funds can be bought and sold without a commission. Funds and ETFs vary from stocks on account of the management fees that the greater part of them carry, however they have been trending lower for a long time. As a rule, ETFs tend to have lower average fees than mutual funds. Here is a comparison of different similitudes and differences.
