# Credit Spread Option
## What Is a Credit Spread Option?

In the financial world, a credit spread option (otherwise called a "credit spread") is an options contract that incorporates the purchase of one option and the sale of a second comparative option with an alternate strike price. Successfully, by trading two options of a similar class and expiration, this strategy transfers [credit risk](/creditrisk) starting with one party then onto the next. In this scenario, there is a risk that the specific credit will increase, making the spread extend, which then, at that point, decreases the price of the credit. Spreads and prices move in inverse headings. An initial premium is paid by the buyer in exchange for potential [cash flows](/cashflow) if a given [credit spread](/creditspread) changes from its current level.

## Understanding a Credit Spread Option

The buyer of a credit [spread option](/spreadoption) can receive cash flows on the off chance that the credit spread between two specific benchmarks enlarges or limits, contingent on how the option is written. Credit spread options come as the two calls and puts, permitting both long and short credit positions.

Credit spread options can be issued by holders of a specific organization's debt to [hedge](/hedge) against the risk of a negative credit event. The buyer of the credit spread option (call) expects all or a portion of the risk of default and will pay the option seller if the spread between the organization's debt and a [benchmark](/benchmark) level (like LIBOR) develops.

Options and different derivatives in view of credit spreads are fundamental apparatuses for dealing with the risks associated with lower-evaluated bonds and debt.
