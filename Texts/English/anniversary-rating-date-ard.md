# Anniversary Rating Date (ARD)
## What Is the Anniversary Rating Date (ARD)?

Anniversary Rating Date (ARD) is the day and month that an insurance policy happened, and, when arrived at the next year, points the date at which the policy can be rethought. The anniversary rating date, or ARD, determines how changes to the rules and rates of the policy are applied.

The [premiums](/premium) in certain types of insurance policies, for example, [workers' compensation](/laborers compensation) insurance, are represented by predefined rules and may change after some time. The anniversary rating date decides how these rules are applied. For instance, laborers' compensation rates are many times set by the state and change at a specific date every year. This specific date is alluded to as the effective date.

## Understanding Anniversary Rating Dates

An anniversary rating date endorsement is connected to a policy just when the ARD is not quite the same as the policy renewal date. This attachment alters the policy to permit the insurer to utilize the rates from the ARD as opposed to the rates from the policy renewal date. This forestalls the insurance company from dropping the policy before the [expiration date](/expiration-date) and afterward reissuing it with an end goal to exploit new winning rates in the marketplace.

For instance, a policy with an anniversary rating date of May 1 yet a [effective date](/effectivedate) of Jan. 1 will just have new rates apply once May 1 is reached. This is on the grounds that a policy with an anniversary rating date that falls after the effective date will just have new rates apply starting on the anniversary date and staying through the policy period.

## New ARD Rules

Insurance is represented by the states, and a few states don't make a difference anniversary rating dates. In these states, the effective date is the date one which rules and it are applied to rate changes. Anniversary rating dates are particularly important in cases in which a policy has been canceled or changed several times, or on the other hand in the event that various policies exist with various effective dates.

The National Council on Compensation Insurance Inc. (NCCI) wiped out the anniversary rating date rule on May 1, 2017. The organization gave this guide to show the new rule:

>
> An employer has a full-term policy effective Jan. 1, 2015, with a Jan. 1, 2015, ARD. The policy is canceled short term, effective Aug. 15, 2015. The changed policy is a full-term policy effective Aug. 15, 2015, through Aug. 15, 2016. The policy would utilize the accompanying two sets of rates: 2015, rates would apply from Aug. 15, 2015, through Jan. 1, 2016. 2016, rates would apply from Jan. 1, 2016, through Aug. 15, 2016. Under the change, the reworked policy effective on Aug. 15, 2015, utilizes rates effective on that date, not the rates effective on Jan. 1, 2015.
