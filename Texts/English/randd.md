Without a R&D program, a company may not make due all alone and may need to depend on alternate ways of innovating like engaging in [mergers and acquisitions](/mergersandacquisitions) (M&A) or partnerships. Through R&D, companies can design new products and work on their existing offerings.

Research and development is separate from most operational activities performed by a corporation. The research and additionally development is normally not performed with the expectation of immediate profit. Instead, it is expected to add to the long-term profitability of a company. Research and development might lead to licenses, copyrights, and brand names as revelations are made and products made.

Companies that set up and utilize whole R&D departments commit substantial capital to the work. They must estimate the risk-adjusted return on their R&D consumptions — which inevitably involves risk of capital — on the grounds that there is no immediate payoff, and the [return on investment](/returnoninvestment) (ROI) is uncertain. As more money is invested in R&D, the level of capital risk increases. Different companies might decide to re-appropriate their R&D for various reasons including size and cost.

Companies across all sectors and industries go through R&D activities. Corporations experience growth through these improvements and the development of new goods and services. Pharmaceuticals, [semiconductors](/semiconductor), and software/technology companies will more often than not spend the most on R&D. In Europe, R&D is known as research and technical or mechanical development (RTD).

Companies spend billions of dollars on R&D to deliver the freshest, most sought-after products. According to public company filings, these companies incurred the highest research and development spend in 2020:

- Amazon: $42.7 billion
- Alphabet, Inc.: $27.6 billion
- Huawei: $22.0 billion
- Microsoft: $19.3 billion
- Apple: $18.8 billion
- Samsung: $18.8 billion
- Facebook: $18.5 billion

## Types of Research and Development

One R&D model is a department staffed basically by engineers who grow new [products](/pricetoresearchratio) — a task that regularly involves broad research. There is no specific goal or application in mind with this model. Instead, the research is finished for research.

The subsequent model involves a department made out of industrial researchers or researchers, who are all tasked with applied research in technical, logical, or industrial fields. This model works with the development of future products or the improvement of current products and additionally operating procedures.
