## UST Securities and Asset Pricing

A lot of finance is about the pricing of assets. UST securities are assumed to have virtually no [default risk](/defaultrisk). As a result, these securities are often utilized as a proxy for a [risk-free asset](/riskfreeasset).

UST securities set the [benchmark](/benchmark) for pricing financial assets. Assuming UST securities are trading at 3%, any remaining fixed-income securities with similar characteristics will trade at some price higher than 3%. It is assumed that there is no borrower with better credit than the United States.

Measures of risk can be founded on metrics like debt ratios and price volatility. A greater leverage or price volatility prompts a greater risk of either the principal as well as the interest not being paid back. Risk is synonymous with return probabilities, also. Investments that offer the possibility of making greater returns are priced higher, even assuming that possibility is thin. A higher level of risk associated with an investment means a higher conceivable return. A downside to possessing UST securities is that, due to the lower yield, the interest payments (an investor's income) will be lower.
