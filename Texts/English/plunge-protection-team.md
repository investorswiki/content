## What Is the Plunge Protection Team?

The "Plunge Protection Team" (PPT) is a conversational name given to the Working Group on Financial Markets. Made in 1988 to give financial and economic recommendations to the U.S. President during tempestuous market times, this group is going by the Secretary of the Treasury; different members incorporate the Chair of the Board of Governors of the [Federal Reserve](/federalreservebank), the Chair of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Chair of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (or the assistants or officials they assign to address them).

## How the Plunge Protection Team (PPT) Works

In March 1988, in the wake of the [stock market crash of 1987,](/stock-market-crash-1987) then, at that point President Ronald Reagan made by executive order the President's Working Group on Financial Markets. The concept was to make an educated, yet casual, advisory group on the markets for the president and regulators. Accused of "upgrading the integrity, effectiveness, orderliness, and intensity of our Nation's financial markets and keeping up with investor confidence."

Its original purpose was to report specifically on the Black Monday events of October 19, 1987 — during that event, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 22.6% — and, what moves, if any, ought to be made. However, the group has proceeded to meet and report to different presidents throughout the long term, typically (yet not continuously) during violent times in the financial markets.

In 1999, it issued a recommendation to Congress, mentioning changes in the derivatives markets regulations. It assembled during the global credit crisis of 2008. The Plunge Protection Team's latest gathering (as of March 2019) was on Christmas Eve, 2018. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin chaired a conference call with different members of the group, notwithstanding delegates from the Comptroller of the Currency and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.

## Worries About the Plunge Protection Team (PPT)

However not precisely a secret, the Plunge Protection Team isn't widely covered and doesn't release the minutes of its gatherings or its recommendations, reporting just to the president. This behavior drives a few onlookers to contemplate whether the government's most important financial officials are accomplishing more than breaking down and prompting — as a matter of fact, that are actively mediating in the markets.

Scheme scholars have speculated that the group executes trades on several exchanges when prices are going downward, teaming up with big banks like Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley in unrecorded transactions. They frequently point to a 1989 discourse distributed in **The Wall Street Journal** by former [Federal Reserve Board ](/frb)of Governors member Robert Heller, which suggested the Fed could straightforwardly support the [stock market](/stockmarket) by purchasing [index futures](/indexfutures) contracts.

## How the Plunge Protection Team (PPT) Might Work

On Monday, February 5, 2018, the [Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA)](/dow-jones-all out market-index) encountered a drop that was two times as large as its biggest point decline ever. However, erratic and aggressive buying cut the decline in half in one day. On Tuesday and Wednesday of that week, stocks opened lower, and each time aggressive buying floated the markets. That aggressive buying, some say, was being organized by the Plunge Protection Team.

Or on the other hand, to take a later model: The Plunge Protection Team's previously mentioned teleconference on Dec. 24, 2018. That whole month, the S&P 500 had been going towards a record decline — the motive for the team's gathering — and the DJIA dropped 650 on the 24th alone. Be that as it may, while trading continued after Christmas, the DJIA energized more than 1,000 points. On the 27th, it lost half those gains, until a late-day reversal stopped the slide, and made the market close 600 points up. That is no incident, trick scholars contend.

If true, this kind of manipulation isn't not normal for the activities of consortia of private bankers and lenders in the late nineteenth and mid twentieth century who, during financial frenzies, would step in to support the stock market with monstrous purchases. The difference, of course, is that the Working Group on Financial Markets is made out of U.S. government officials, and the U.S. should operate on an unregulated economy system. And furthermore an open one, not one impacted by strange powers.
