# Vortex Indicator (VI)
## What is the Vortex Indicator (VI)?

A vortex indicator (VI) is an indicator made out of two lines - an uptrend line (VI+) and a downtrend line (VI-). These lines are normally colored green and red separately. A vortex indicator is utilized to spot trend [reversals](/reversal) and affirm current trends.

## Figuring out Vortex Indicator (VI)

The vortex indicator was first developed by Etienne Botes and Douglas Siepman who presented the concept in a 2009 release of "Technical Analysis of Stocks and Commodities." The vortex indicator depends on two trendlines: VI+ and VI-.

## Vortex Indicator Calculations

The calculation for the indicator is divided into four parts.

1. True reach (TR) is the best of:

- Current high minus current low
- Current high minus previous close
- Current low minus previous close

2. [Uptrend](/uptrend) and downtrend movement:

- VM+ = Absolute value of current high minus prior low
- VM-= Absolute value of current low minus prior high

3. Boundary length (n)

- Settle on a boundary length (somewhere in the range of 14 and 30 days is common)
- Sum the last n time frame's true reach, VM+ and VM-:
- Sum of the last n periods' true reach = SUM TRn
- Sum of the last n periods' VM+ = SUM VMn+
- Sum of the last n periods' VM-= SUM VMn−

4. Make the trendlines VI+ and VI-

- SUM VMn+/SUM TRn = VIn+
- SUM VMn-/SUM TRn = VIn−
- Rehashing this cycle daily forms the VI+ and VI-trendlines.

The traditional application of utilizing VI-and VI+ hybrids can bring about a number of false trade signals when price action is choppy. Increase the number of periods utilized in the indicator to reduce this, for instance, utilizing 25 periods rather than 14.

## Deductions

The vortex indicator is commonly utilized related to other reversal trend examples to assist with supporting a reversal signal. It is integrated into most [technical analysis](/technicalanalysis) software programs. VI+ and VI-are ordinarily diagramed freely below a candlestick chart. The chart below provides a model with lines that show changing trend signals on a [candlestick](/candlestick) chart.

An uptrend or buy signal happens when VI+ is below VI-and afterward crosses above VI-to take the top position among the trendlines. A downtrend or sell signal happens when VI-is below VI+ and crosses above VI+ to take the top position among the trendlines. Overall, the trendline in the top position generally directs whether the [security](/security) is in an uptrend or downtrend.
