## What Is a Family Limited Partnership (FLP)?

A family limited partnership (FLP) is an arrangement where family members pool money to run a business project. Every family member buys units or shares of the business and can profit in relation to the number of shares they own, as illustrated in the [partnership](/partnership) operating agreement.

## Understanding a Family Limited Partnership (FLP)

Family Limited Partnerships have two types of partners. [General partners](/generalpartner) typically own the biggest share of the business and are responsible for everyday management tasks like regulating all cash deposits and investment transactions. The general partner may likewise take a management fee from profits whenever illustrated in the partnership agreement. [Limited partners](/limited-partner) have no management obligations. They rather buy shares of the business in exchange for dividends, interest, and profits the FLP might produce.

FLPs shift contingent upon the idea of the business. For instance, assume an individual needs to begin a luxury condo venture. They anticipate that the project should cost $1 million, including working capital, and take in about $200,000 in cash every year before interest on mortgage payments and taxes. They compute that they'll require essentially a half down payment of $500,000. In this way, they call some family members, and they all consent to lay out a FLP that will issue 5,000 [limited partnership](/limitedpartnership) shares at $100 each for a total of $500,000. The limited partnership agreement states that units can't be sold for no less than six years, and the FLP will pay 70% of cash earnings as dividends.

As the general partner, the original individual who settled on the decisions buys 500 shares by contributing $50,000 to the FLP. Family members buy the excess shares. Presently, every family member possesses a stake in a FLP starting at $500,000. Next, the general partner could get a first mortgage loan until the end of the $500,000 to begin the $1 million luxury housing project.

The FLP then rents these condos to tenants and starts taking income from rent. As the mortgage is paid off, profits and dividends are distributed, and every family member becomes wealthier.

## Advantages of Family Limited Partnerships

There are some estate and gift tax advantages of a family limited partnership. Several families lay out FLPs to pass wealth down to ages while getting some tax protections.

Individuals can gift FLP interests tax-free to others consistently up to the [annual gift tax exclusion](/annual-exclusion). Currently, the gift exclusion is $15,000 for individuals (in 2021) and $16,000 (in 2022).

Assume a couple amassed savings worth $5 million. They have three children and nine grandchildren. The couple chooses to transfer the whole amount to the FLP they laid out. Every year, they gift $30,000 worth of FLP interests to every one of their 12 children or grandchildren. This means the couple can transfer $360,000 worth of FLP interests gift-tax-free consistently (accepting the gift tax exclusion continues as before).
