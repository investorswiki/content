# Interledger Protocol
## What Is the Interledger Protocol?

Interledger protocol is a [blockchain](/blockchain) protocol utilized for payments across various payment networks. The [open-source](/open-source) protocol interfaces ledgers from at least two unique banks, subsequently eliminating delegates and central specialists from the system. It vows to reduce costs and the time required to deal with cross-border transactions.

Interledger is used by Ripple Labs to interface bank systems across borders where the [Ripple](/ripple-cryptocurrency) (XRP) token capabilities as a normalized settlement layer between global banks, making Ripple to some degree likened to a digital [hawala](/hawala) service.

## Grasping the Interledger Protocol

The current cycle for cross-border transfers between banks includes route of numerous payment protocols utilized by digital ledgers to deal with transactions. The protocols convey utilizing connectors, yet the devices and standards utilized in such systems are divided.

For instance, the current set of connectors don't have normalized modes for communication. The acquaintance of intermediary banks with work with transactions between substances that don't have a direct relationship with one another further convolutes the interaction. This is on the grounds that it increases the number of bounces to complete a transaction, subsequently making it more costly and time-consuming. It likewise amplifies security risks since payments need to go through numerous systems to arrive at the last beneficiary.

The Interledger Protocol utilizes the concept of cryptographic [escrow](/escrow) to empower the section of funds through connectors or hubs in the network. The Interledger protocol whitepaper characterizes cryptographic escrow as the financial equivalent of a two-stage commit protocol. The last protocol comprises of two steps:

1. The initial step comprises of characterizing a set of conditions for a transaction to push ahead or cut off.
1. The subsequent step characterizes the processing of the transaction whenever conditions are met.

Cryptographic escrow for ledgers is the conditional locking of funds between two gatherings. The funds are delivered solely after certain conditions, including time-based ones for the transaction to occur, are met. In any case, the transaction is voided. Toward the finish of a fruitful payment transaction, the source gets a cryptographic receipt from the beneficiary. On the other hand, the escrowed funds are returned to separate gatherings.

## Atomic versus Universal Mode

The Interledger protocol can be executed in two modes: atomic mode and universal mode. In atomic mode, public accountants are incorporated into the system. They are an impromptu group that is utilized to check and approve transactions. Normally, atomic modes happen between believed connector hubs between banks or financial service companies that could connect with one another.

The universal mode doesn't need legal officials and can work between untrusted connectors. It utilizes Ripple's internal cryptocurrency, XRP, to work with transfers. The transfer is joined by time requirements. In the event that it doesn't happen inside a certain timeframe, then, at that point, the transaction is canceled.

## Features
- Interledger is an open-source protocol suite for sending payments across various ledgers.
- Based on blockchain technology, the goal is to eliminate mediators to make a secure, decentralized, and cross-border interbank payments network.
- Interledger isn't tied to a single company, blockchain, or currency, despite the fact that it is highlighted unmistakably with the Ripple cryptocurrency.
