# Verge (XVG)
## What Is Verge (XVG)?

Verge (XVG) is an open-source, decentralized cryptocurrency that claims to offer completely anonymous transactions by jumbling the location and the [Internet Protocol (IP) address](/ip-address) of the executing participants. Verge trades on leading [cryptocurrency](/cryptocurrency) exchanges with the symbol XVG.

Verge appeared in 2014 under the name DogeCoinDark, yet it was rebranded to Verge in 2016. DogeCoinDark was a fork of Dogecoin and was intended to give an anonymous alternative to Dogecoin. Verge is in the class of "privacy coins" that likewise incorporates Monero, Pivx, and Zcash.

## Grasping Verge (XVG)

Verge centers around namelessness by jumbling clients' IP addresses. An IP address is a recognizing number that is associated with a specific computer or computer network. Utilizing an IP address, it is feasible to trace the client and the online activities they performed on the associated gadget; muddling IP addresses makes transactions completely untraceable.

Numerous well known cryptocurrencies (counting [Bitcoin](/bitcoin)) face difficulties in protecting participants' complete obscurity. Cryptocurrencies like Verge have prompted an increase in the prevalence of private ledgers that offer unique ways of concealing clients' characters.

Verge guarantees obscurity using multiple namelessness driven networks like The Onion Router (TOR) and Invisible Internet Project (I2P). TOR safeguards clients' characters by skipping their communications over a distributed network of transfers and passages. This network is run by volunteers spread across the globe. I2P encodes client data and sends it through a worker run anonymous peer-to-peer worldwide distributed network.

While anybody can see the different transactions happening on the Verge public ledger, the utilization of TOR and I2P network layers conceal the location — as well as the IP addresses — of the executing participants.

While there are numerous other cryptocurrencies, as [Monero](/monero) and Dash, which additionally claim to offer higher levels of privacy and obscurity, they depend on cryptography strategies and implementation. However such cryptocurrencies have made fluctuating levels of progress in getting client namelessness, their implementation has made their particular public ledgers secure yet less transparent. This tradeoff on occasion makes it challenging to publicly check transactions, which is a core requirement of decentralized cryptocurrency.

## How Is Verge Different From Bitcoin?

Both Verge and Bitcoin are decentralized digital currencies. Be that as it may, Verge was made with a special accentuation on privacy. As a virtual currency, Verge has a fundamentally more modest market capitalization than Bitcoin. As of Sept. 22, 2021, the market capitalization of Bitcoin is around $813 billion and the value of a Bitcoin is $40,693.68. The market capitalization of Verge is around $350 million and the value of a Verge token is $0.021.

While the supply of Bitcoin is limited to 21,000,000, the total number of Verge tokens is more noteworthy — it is limited to a total supply of 16,555,000,000. Both Verge and Bitcoin utilize a [proof-of-work](/confirmation work) (PoW) system to check transactions on the blockchain.

## Objectives of Verge (XVG)

Verge attempts to handle the problem of getting client secrecy technically. It doesn't depend intensely on cryptography; rather it banks on the existing and tried technology of TOR and I2P network to accomplish its objectives of client identity protection. Verge's founders say that an open ledger is mandatory for the participants to check their transactions, and for different participants to publicly confirm and check the overall improvements happening on the [blockchain](/blockchain) without the requirement for a participant's identity. Verge's implementation assists it with accomplishing both.

The obscurity of Verge was quoted as the primary justification for a grown-up website network to begin accepting cryptocurrency payments solely in the Verge cryptocurrency in April 2018. As of September 2021, Verge is positioned 152 in the rundown of cryptocurrencies by market capitalization.
