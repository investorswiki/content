# Covariance
## What Is Covariance?

Covariance measures the directional relationship between the returns on two [assets](/asset). A positive covariance means that asset returns move together while a negative covariance means they move inversely.

Covariance is calculated by breaking down at-return shocks ([standard deviations](/standarddeviation) from the expected return) or by duplicating the correlation between the two random variables by the standard deviation of every variable.

## Figuring out Covariance

Covariance assesses how the mean values of two random variables move together. In the event that stock A's return moves higher at whatever point stock B's return moves higher and a similar relationship is found when each stock's return diminishes, then these stocks are said to have positive covariance. In finance, covariances are calculated to help [diversify](/diversification) security holdings.

### Formula for Covariance

At the point when an analyst has a set of data, a couple of x and y values, covariance can be calculated utilizing five variables drawn from the data being investigated.
<!--1EA5EE4FB781B8E6C1FC3F1F141C7CDD-->
Where:

- x~i~ = a given x value in the data set
- x~m~ = the mean, or average, of the x values
- y~i~ = the y value in the data set that compares with x~i~
- y~m~ = the mean, or average, of the y values

## Special Considerations

Covariances have huge applications in finance and [modern portfolio theory](/modernportfoliotheory). For instance, in the capital asset pricing model ([CAPM](/capm)), which is utilized to work out the expected return of an asset, the covariance between a security and the market is utilized in the formula for one of the model's key variables, [beta](/beta). In the CAPM, beta measures the volatility, or systematic risk, of a security in comparison to the market overall; a down to earth measure attracts from the covariance to check a financial backer's risk exposure specific to one security.

Meanwhile, portfolio theory utilizes covariances to statistically reduce the overall risk of a portfolio by protecting against volatility through covariance-informed diversification.

> Having [financial assets](/financialasset) with returns that have comparative covariances doesn't give a lot of diversification; in this manner, a diversified portfolio would probably contain a blend of financial assets that have shifting covariances.

## Types of Covariance

The covariance equation is utilized to decide the course of the relationship between two variables as such, whether they will generally move in something similar or inverse headings. This not entirely settled by the sign (positive or negative) of the covariance value.

### Positive Covariance

A positive covariance between two variables shows that these variables will more often than not be higher or lower simultaneously. As such, a positive covariance between variables **x** and **y** shows that **x** is higher than average at the very times that **y** is higher than average, and vice versa. At the point when diagrammed on a two-layered graph, the data points will more often than not slant upwards.

### Negative Covariance

At the point when the calculated covariance is under zero, this shows that the two variables have an inverse relationship. At the end of the day, a **x** value that is lower than average will in general be paired with a **y** that is greater than average, and vice versa.

## Covariance versus Variance

Covariance is connected with [variance](/variance), a statistical measure for the spread of points in a data set. Both variance and covariance measure how data points are distributed around a calculated [mean](/mean). Be that as it may, variance measures the spread of data along a single pivot, while covariance inspects the directional relationship between two variables.

In a financial setting, covariance is utilized to look at how changed investments perform corresponding to each other. A positive covariance shows that two assets will more often than not perform well simultaneously, while a negative covariance demonstrates that they will quite often move in inverse headings. Most investors look for assets with a negative covariance to [diversify](/diversification) their holdings.

## Covariance versus Correlation

Covariance is likewise distinct from [correlation](/correlation), one more statistical measurement frequently used to measure the relationship between two variables. While covariance measures the bearing of a relationship between two variables, correlation measures the strength of that relationship. This is generally communicated through a correlation coefficient, which can go from - 1 to +1.

> While the covariance estimates the directional relationship between two assets, it doesn't show the strength of the relationship between the two assets; the [coefficient of correlation](/correlationcoefficient) is a more fitting indicator of this strength.
>

A correlation is viewed as strong on the off chance that the correlation coefficient has a value that is close to +1 (positive correlation) or - 1 (negative correlation). A coefficient that is close to zero demonstrates that there is just a weak relationship between the two variables.

## Illustration of Covariance Calculation

Assume an analyst in a company has a five-quarter data set that shows quarterly total national output ([GDP](/gdp)) growth in rates (x) and a company's new product line growth in rates (y). The data set might seem to be:

- Q1: x = 2, y = 10
- Q2: x = 3, y = 14
- Q3: x = 2.7, y = 12
- Q4: x = 3.2, y = 15
- Q5: x = 4.1, y = 20

The average x value equals 3, and the average y value equals 14.2. To compute the covariance, the sum of the products of the x~i~ values minus the average x value, duplicated by the y~i~ values minus the average y values would be separated by (n-1), as follows:

>
> Cov(x,y) = ((2 - 3) x (10 - 14.2) + (3 - 3) x (14 - 14.2) + ... (4.1 - 3) x (20 - 14.2))/4 = (4.2 + 0 + 0.66 + 0.16 + 6.38)/4 = 2.85
>

Having calculated a positive covariance here, the analyst can say that the growth of the company's new product line has a positive relationship with quarterly GDP growth.

## The Bottom Line

Covariance is an important statistical measurement for contrasting the relationships between numerous variables. In investing, covariance is utilized to distinguish assets that can assist with broadening a portfolio.

## Highlights
- Covariance is a critical device in modern portfolio theory used to learn what securities to put in a portfolio.
- At the point when two stocks will more often than not move together, they are viewed as having a positive covariance; when they move inversely, the covariance is negative.
- Risk and volatility can be reduced in a portfolio by matching assets that have a negative covariance.
- Covariance is a statistical device that is utilized to decide the relationship between the developments of two random variables.
- Covariance is not the same as the correlation coefficient, a measure of the strength of a reciprocal relationship.
## FAQ
### What Is Covariance versus Variance?
Covariance and variance are both used to measure the distribution of points in a data set. Be that as it may, variance is normally utilized in data sets with just a single variable, and shows how closely those data points are bunched around the average. Covariance measures the bearing of the relationship between two variables. A positive covariance means that the two variables will more often than not be high or low simultaneously. A negative covariance means that when one variable is high, the other will in general be low.
### How Is a Covariance Calculated?
For a set of **n** data points with two variables **x** and **y**, the covariance is measured by taking the difference between each **x** and **y** variable and their particular means. These differences are then increased together, and averaged across each of the data points. In mathematical documentation, this is communicated as:
### What Does a Covariance of 0 Mean?
A covariance of zero demonstrates that there is no reasonable directional relationship between the variables being measured. At the end of the day, a high **x** value is similarly liable to be paired with a high or low value for **y**.
### What Is the Difference Between Covariance and Correlation?
Covariance measures the heading of a relationship between two variables, while correlation measures the strength of that relationship. Both correlation and covariance are positive when the variables move in a similar heading, and negative when they move in inverse bearings. Be that as it may, a correlation coefficient must continuously be between - 1 and +1, with the extreme values showing a strong relationship.
