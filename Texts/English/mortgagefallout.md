A soft fallout happens when the loan terms are changed, and those changes negatively impact the lender's ability to keep the loan in place. Most frequently, soft fallout happens when rate renegotiations happen. At the point when a lender is working out a soft fallout, the lender normally makes it happen "on a case-by-case basis with the percentage of total profitability disadvantage rising to the percentage of effect on the total pull-through of that loan," as indicated by MCT's research.
