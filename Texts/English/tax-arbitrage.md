## Understanding Tax Arbitrage

Tax arbitrage alludes to transactions that are placed into to profit off the spread between tax systems, tax medicines, or tax rates. The two people and corporations try to pay the least amount of tax that they legally can; they can achieve this in a wide range of ways.

A business can exploit tax systems, for example, by perceiving incomes in a low tax region while perceiving expenses in a high tax region. Such a practice would limit the tax bill by expanding [deductions](/derivation) while limiting taxes paid on earnings. An entity may likewise resort to profit on price differences on a similar security coming about because of various tax systems in the countries or purviews in which the security is traded. For example, capital gains on [cryptocurrency](/cryptocurrency) trading are taxed in the U.S. yet, are tax-exempt in certain countries.

Tax arbitrage can happen when a retail or institutional investor purchases a stock before the [ex-dividend date](/ex-dividend) and sells later. The price of shares before the ex-dividend date is generally higher than the price after the date.
