# All-Time High (ATH)
The term "All-Time High" relates to the highest price that an asset has accomplished on an exchange, for the current trading pair that is being referred to. For instance, in the event that a share of stock in XZY Corp comes to IPO at a price of $5 per share, then trades as high as $20 per share, before falling to $10 in a certain period of time, we could say that the "All-Time High" for the XZY Corp share price was $20.
In the bull-run of late 2017, numerous digital currencies set new All-Time High records, with Bitcoin setting another ATH in mid-December. Every cryptocurrency exchange has an alternate ATH value for Bitcoin. In certain markets, each coin was being traded over the mark of $20,000, yet many consider that Bitcoin's ATH was roughly $19,665.
Bitcoin has broken its previous ATH on many exchanges on the 30th of November, 2020. The previous ATH on the BTC/USDT pair on Binance was 19,798.68 USDT, which was broken around 15:00 UTC. This event marked Bitcoin entering another phase of price discovery.
The ATH value addresses the hypothetical maximum price that one might have sold the specific asset for, and furthermore addresses the maximum price that another trader was ready to pay for that asset, during that period. Notwithstanding, given the fractional idea of most digital assets, it is conceivable that the ATH was derived through the trade of a small portion of an asset, rather than a full coin or token.
For instance, during the level of a bull-run, a trader might make a purchase of 0.1BTC for $5,000 just before a big drop. Proportionally talking, this would give Bitcoin another ATH at the price of $50,000 per unit of BTC, albeit just 0.1 BTC at any point traded costing that much.
The concept of All-Time High may likewise be applied to the values of market capitalization (market cap). Toward the beginning of January 2018 - two or three weeks after Bitcoin's ATH - the market cap of the whole cryptocurrency market arrived at an ATH of about $661.2 billion.
Something contrary to ATH is the "All Time Low" (ATL) which is utilized to allude to the least price point an asset has traded at, typically just recorded after an asset is listed and starts trading on an exchange.
