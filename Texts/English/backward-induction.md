# Backward Induction
## What Is Backward Induction?

Backward induction in [game theory](/gametheory) is an iterative course of thinking backward in time, from the finish of a problem or situation, to settle finite broad form and sequential games, and construe a sequence of optimal actions.

## Backward Induction Explained

Backward induction has been utilized to address games since John von Neumann and Oskar Morgenstern laid out game theory as a scholastic subject when they distributed their book, **Theory of Games and Economic Behavior** in 1944.

At each stage of the game backward induction decides the optimal strategy of the player who takes the last action in the game. Then, the optimal action of the next-to-last moving still up in the air, accepting the last player's action as given. This cycle proceeds backward until the best action for each point in time not entirely set in stone. Actually, one is deciding the [Nash equilibrium](/nash-equilibrium) of each subgame of the original game.

In any case, the outcomes derived from backward induction frequently fail to foresee genuine human play. Experimental studies have shown that "normal" behavior (as anticipated by game theory) is only occasionally displayed in real life. Irrational players may really wind up acquiring higher payoffs than anticipated by backward induction, as delineated in the [centipede game](/centipede-game).

In the centipede game, two players on the other hand have an opportunity to take a bigger share of a rising pot of money, or to pass the pot to the next player. The payoffs are organized so that assuming the pot is passed to one's adversary and the rival takes the pot on the next round, one receives somewhat not exactly on the off chance that one had taken the pot on this round. The game closes when a player takes the reserve, with that player getting the bigger portion and the other player getting the more modest portion.

## Illustration of Backward Induction

For instance, accept Izaz goes first and needs to choose if they ought to "take" or "pass" the reserve, which right now adds up to $2. On the off chance that they take, Izaz and Jian get $1 each, however assuming Izaz passes, the decision to take or pass currently must be made by Jian. Assuming Jian takes, they get $3 (i.e., the previous reserve of $2 + $1) and Izaz gets $0. Be that as it may, assuming Jian passes, Izaz currently will choose whether to take or pass, etc. In the event that the two players generally decide to pass, they each receive a payoff of $100 toward the finish of the game.

The point of the game is if Izaz and Jian both collaborate and keep on passing for the rest of the game, they get the maximum payout of $100 each. However, assuming that they doubt the other player and anticipate that they should "take" at the primary opportunity, Nash equilibrium predicts the players will take the most minimal conceivable claim ($1 in this case).

The Nash equilibrium of this game, where no player has an incentive to go astray from their picked strategy in the wake of thinking about a rival's decision, recommends the main player would take the pot on the absolute first round of the game. In any case, in reality, moderately couple of players do as such. Thus, they get a higher payoff than the payoff anticipated by the equilibria analysis.

## Tackling Sequential Games Using Backward Induction

Below is a simple sequential game between two players. The marks with Player 1 and Player 2 inside them are the information sets for players a couple, individually. The numbers in the parentheses at the lower part of the tree are the payoffs at each separate point. The game is additionally sequential, so Player 1 pursues the best option (left or right) and Player 2 settles on its choice after Player 1 (up or down).

Backward induction, similar to all game theory, utilizes the suspicions of rationality and maximization, implying that Player 2 will augment their payoff in some random situation. At either information set we have two options, four on the whole. By wiping out the decisions that Player 2 won't pick, we can narrow down our tree. Along these lines, we will mark the lines in blue that augment the player's payoff at the given information set.

After this reduction, Player 1 can boost its payoffs now that Player 2's decisions are spread the word about. The outcome is an equilibrium found by backward induction of Player 1 picking "right" and Player 2 picking "up." Below is the solution to the game with the equilibrium path bolded.

For instance, one could undoubtedly set up a game like the one above involving companies as the players. This game could incorporate [product release](/rollout) scenarios. To release a product, what could Company 2 do in response? Will Company 2 release a comparable contending product? By [forecasting](/forecasting) sales of this new product in various scenarios, we can set up a game to foresee how situation could develop. Below is an illustration of how one could model such a game.
