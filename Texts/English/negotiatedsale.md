# Negotiated Sale
## What is Negotiated Sale?

A negotiated sale is the point at which the issuer and a couple of buyers arrange the terms of a transaction (municipal bonds) in lieu of [competitive bidding](/competitivebid).

## Figuring out Negotiated Sale

In the [fixed-income](/fixedincome) arena, a negotiated sale is a method of offering [municipal bonds](/municipalbond), or comparative financial instruments, where the responsible entity and a chose [underwriter](/underwriter) arrange the terms of the issue, rather than having numerous underwriting bunches competitively bidding on the issue to lay out its terms. The principal benefits of a negotiated sale are:

- offers a layer of confidentiality that isn't accessible in competitive bidding
- not as disruptive to operations as a conventional controlled auction process
- whole interaction is quicker and more efficient

In a negotiated sale, a portion of the primary points to turn out for an issuer are the [interest rate](/interestrate), call highlights and purchase price of the issue. The sale of another issue of securities thusly is otherwise called a negotiated [underwriting](/underwriting). The primary value of a negotiated sale is that, of the limited pool likely buyers, there is normally just a single interested party with a high likelihood of culminating the deal. Negotiated sales are normally initiated by:

- legitimate buyers: elements that would regularly be interested in the offering
- brokers: go-betweens who know possible buyers.

In a negotiated sale, the underwriter, chose by the responsible entity before the sale date, will perform the financing for the issue. Lower quality issues generally receive the main reward from this type of underwriting technique as the underwriter works with the company to sell the offering to the marketplace. At the point when the underwriter and the [issuer](/issuer) cooperate to make sense of the offer obviously, they will frequently receive a better rate in the market for the issuer. Negotiated sales consider greater flexibility concerning when the issue is delivered with the goal that it tends to be better planned in the market to get the best rate.

## Upsides and downsides of a Negotiated Sale

An advantage of a negotiated sale is that it permits the issuer to build entirely pure intentions, trust and a relationship with the expected buyer. Assuming that the offer meets the purchase price expectations and terms of the issuer, they don't need to spend time engaging different offers. Moreover, the issuer is under no obligation to continue with the negotiated sale in the event that it doesn't live up to their assumptions.

A major disadvantage of negotiated sales is that an issuer's arranging power is decreased as the buyers realize that there isn't a lot of in that frame of mind of competition. Basically, a buyer might try squeeze the issuer, which is the reason it is incumbent upon issuers to ensure they are getting the best conceivable price.
