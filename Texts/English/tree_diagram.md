## What Is a Tree Diagram?

A tree diagram is a device in the fields of general mathematics, [probability](/probabilitydistribution), and statistics that works out the number of potential outcomes of an event or problem, and to refer to those expected outcomes in an organized manner.

Tree diagrams, otherwise called likelihood trees or decision trees, are very adaptable and might be helpful in many fields, including finance.

## Understanding a Tree Diagram

A tree diagram allows a client to begin at a single point and settle on mutually exclusive choices or experience mutually exclusive events to follow a path down the branches of the tree. Utilizing a tree diagram is simple once you assign the suitable values to every node.

Chance nodes, addressing a potential outcome, must be assigned a likelihood. Decision nodes ask an inquiry and must be followed by answer nodes, for example, "yes" or "no." Often, a value will be associated with a node, like a cost or a payout.

Tree diagrams join the probabilities, decisions, costs, and payouts of a decision and give a strategic response. In finance, we can model the price of a put or call [option](/option) utilizing a decision tree given the price of the underlying security at a given point in time.

## Tree Diagrams being used

The thought behind a tree diagram is to begin the left with the whole thing, or one. Each time several potential outcomes exist the likelihood in that branch separates into a more modest branch for every outcome.

The diagram begins at a single node, with branches radiating to extra nodes, which address mutually exclusive decisions or events. In the diagram below, the analysis will start at the main clear node. A decision or event will then lead to node An or B. From these secondary nodes, extra decisions or events will happen leading to the third level of nodes until an end is reached.

### Extra Uses

Notwithstanding mathematics, tree diagrams are utilized in strategic decision-production, company valuations, or likelihood estimations. Tree diagrams consolidate the probabilities, decisions, costs, and payouts of a decision and give a strategic response. In finance, we can model the price of a put or call option utilizing a decision tree given the price of the underlying security at a given point in time.

Progressively, decision trees are utilized in fintech algorithm design and client experience in [fintech](/fintech) applications. One use case of decision trees would be the way to set a suitable investment strategy for another client of a [robo-advisor](/roboadvisor-roboadviser) in light of an onboarding survey.
