## What Is a Contingent Annuitant?

A contingent annuitant is somebody designated by a [annuitant](/annuitant) to receive the annuitant's payments when they die. When a [annuity](/annuity) has a contingent annuitant, the annuity doesn't stop causing payments until both the annuitant and the contingent annuitant to have died. In the event that the policy doesn't consider a contingent annuitant, the annuity stops making payments when the annuitant passes on. A contingent annuitant can be considered the second beneficiary of an annuity.

## How a Contingent Annuitant Works

An annuity is a financial product that pays a fixed income stream to an individual. Annuities are regularly utilized by retired folks and are sold by [financial institutions](/financialinstitution). The buyer of the annuity, known as the annuitant, pays a lump sum or a series of payments over the long haul, which are invested by the financial institution or [insurance](/insurance) company.

Contingent upon the type of annuity, eventually, the financial services provider pays the annuitant a surge of income payments. A few annuities could pay for a set period, like 10 years, while others could pay for the excess lifetime of the annuitant.

For a similar initial lump sum (or [principal](/principal)), an annuity that accommodates a contingent annuitant might make lower payments to the annuitant and the contingent annuitant during their lifetimes. This is rehearsed on the grounds that the annuity is expected to pay out for a more extended period than an annuity that ends when the annuitant dies. It is a means of loosening up the funds further in time.

By and large, when payments start on an annuity, a contingent annuitant's name may not be changed. As such, the contingent annuitant can be a [irrevocable beneficiary](/irrevocablebeneficiary), meaning the person designated to receive the assets from the insurance policy can't be changed by exclusively the owner, yet all things being equal, must have the beneficiary's consent also.

This is true even if the contingent bites the dust before the original annuitant. Contingent annuitants will generally be spouses or domestic partners.

Annuity providers will assist annuitants with choosing which payment options to pick. For instance, the benefit for an enduring annuitant may be half to 100% of the original annuitant's benefit payment. Higher payments for the contingent will generally mean lower payments for the original annuitant.

## Contingent Annuitant Annuity Options

Annuities are meant to give a stable source of income, as a rule to [retirees](/retirement-arranging) through recurring regularly scheduled payments, however they might be quarterly or yearly too. There are various types of annuities, so consumers can pick one that accommodates their unique conditions, budget, age, life expectancy, and the longing to accommodate an enduring spouse.

A few annuities pay out for a foreordained number of years regardless ([period certain annuity](/periodcertain)), and on the off chance that the annuitant kicks the bucket during that period, the excess payments go to the annuitant's beneficiary. Different annuities pay out just until the annuitant dies. In any case, others keep making payments until the contingent annuitant kicks the bucket.

[Joint and survivor](/jointandsurvivorannuity) annuities are intended to turn out stable revenue to every spouse even after one spouse dies. Upon the primary spouse's death, these annuities could keep on paying a similar month to month benefit, or they could pay 66% or one-half of the original month to month benefit.

There are annuities that let individuals invest step by step during their working years and others that can be purchased with a lump sum. How much the annuity costs relies on how much the annuitant needs to receive in regularly scheduled payments, the annuitant's life expectancy, and other annuity highlights, for example, whether the annuity will have a contingent beneficiary. Fundamentally, the more the insurance company hopes to pay out, the more the annuitant should pay in.
