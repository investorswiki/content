# Fixed-Rule Policy
## What Is a Fixed-Rule Policy?

A fixed-rule policy is a [fiscal](/fiscalpolicy) or [monetary policy](/monetarypolicy) that operates naturally founded on a predetermined set of criteria. Supporters of fixed-rule policies contend they kill policymakers' caution trying to stay away from the problem of skewed incentives between individual policymakers and the more extensive public.

## Figuring out a Fixed-Rule Policy

Fixed-rule policies get from the public decision theory of [political economy](/political-economy). This theory underlines the economic incentives of policymakers and the economic effects of those incentives.

The overall concept is that chosen authorities and policymakers will more often than not excessively center around the short-term impact of policies and are handily affected by special interests over the interests of the overall population (the two of which assist with determining their re-appointment or reappointment to office and career possibilities in the wake of leaving office). This frequently brings about policy decisions that are not in the public interest.

Fixed-rule policies oblige authorities to policy decisions in light of predetermined criteria. Since policymakers, as a general rule, can't tie their own future decisions, fixed-policy rules for the most part must be implemented by a higher authority to be binding, for example, a constitutional amendment or high court ruling.

The criteria used to limit policy decisions generally incorporate economic, fiscal, legal, or demographic factors outside of the policymakers' reach. These criteria limit the carefulness of policymakers, which can settle on economic choices more stable and unsurprising for citizens and market participants and can offset the political incentives made by concentrated interests. Well known criteria for fixed-rule policies incorporate [inflation](/inflation) and population growth rates.

## Types of Fixed-Rule Policies

Fixed-rule policies are common at many levels of government. In terms of economic policy, fixed-rule policies can apply to fiscal or monetary policies.

### Monetary Policy

[Taylor's Rule](/taylorsrule), developed by economist John Taylor, is the most popular illustration of a fixed-rule monetary policy. Calculation of the Taylor Rule brings about what the targeted[ federal funds rate](/federalfundsrate) ought to be. The rule's equation incorporates factors for the rate of inflation as estimated by the [GDP deflator](/gdppricedeflator), [real GDP](/realgdp) growth, and the possible output of the economy.

Beforehand, the [gold standard](/goldstandard) filled in as a fixed-rule policy for monetary policy (and in a roundabout way for fiscal policy too). Since currencies were named in gold (or different metals), a central bank's ability to print paper notes (and a government's ability to borrow for [deficit spending](/deficit-spending)) was limited by its accessible gold reserves.

### Fiscal Policy

A fiscal policy is many times subject to fixed rules too. These rules can incorporate essential constitutional requirements to keep a balanced budget as well as more nuanced tax, expenditure, and debt limitations.

For instance, the European Union has the [Stability and Growth Pact](/stability-growth-pact), which limits members to a budget deficit of something like 3% of [gross domestic product](/gdp) (GDP) and public debt levels to 60% of GDP. The pact went under pressure following the global financial crisis of 2008 and the subsequent European debt crisis.

In the United States, the House of Representatives and Senate each have rules that require new legislation not to increase the federal budget deficit. These rules, known as PAYGO, were first presented in 1990. The rules mean that offsets must be found for any proposed tax cuts or spending increases. In any case, Congress can postpone rules for a specific bill, for example, for the bailout and recovery bills passed in 2008 and 2009, and tax cuts adopted in 2012 and 2017. The American Rescue Plan of 2021 is subject to these rules (except if Congress passes legislation to exempt the law from PAYGO).

## Contentions for and Against Fixed-Rule Policies

Backers of fixed-rule policies contend that adhering to a predetermined plan makes certainty in the market. This system tries not to subject policy choices to the slanted incentives of individual policymakers or a political party. Allies contend that central bankers, for instance, are boosted to keep [interest rates](/interestrate) low in the short term to animate growth, which will gain public endorsement while the central banker is in office. Be that as it may, low rates could be awful over the long haul assuming that they add to flourish and-fail changes in the economy.

Pundits contend that fixed-rule policies are too inflexible and don't leave governments with adequate space to handle crises or set policy at levels expected to restart economic growth. Fixed rules tie policymakers' hands exactly when intense action is required.

Then again, advocates say fixed-rule policies can be overlooked and are frequently abrogated in crises in any case. For instance, notwithstanding the EU pact, member states regularly keep away from sanctions for structural budget deficits of over 3%.

## Highlights
- Fixed-rule policies are predetermined policies that oblige policymakers' actions in view of objective criteria.
- The planned goal of fixed-rule policies is to eliminate oneself serving interests of policymakers to disclose the best choices for the general.
- In economic terms, fixed-rule policies can apply to monetary or fiscal policies.
- Policymakers frequently pursue choices in light of what those choices will mean for their careers, including their possibilities of re-appointment or careers after their terms are finished.
