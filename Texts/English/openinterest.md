# Open Interest
## What Is Open Interest?

Open interest is the total number of outstanding derivative contracts, like [options ](/option)or [futures](/futurescontract) that poor person been settled for an asset. The total open interest doesn't count, and total each buy and sell contract. All things being equal, open interest gives a more accurate image of the options trading activity, and whether money flows into the futures and options market are expanding or decreasing.

In the event that a buyer and seller meet up and start another position of one contract, then, at that point, open interest will increase by one contract. Should a buyer and seller both exit a one contract position on a trade, then, at that point, open interest diminishes by one contract. Notwithstanding, on the off chance that a buyer or seller gives their current position to another buyer or seller, then open interest stays unchanged.

## Open Interest Explained

To comprehend open interest, we must initially investigate how options and futures contracts are made. On the off chance that an options contract exists, it must have had a buyer. For each buyer, there must be a seller since you can't buy something not ready to move.

The relationship between the buyer and seller makes one contract, and a single contract likens to 100 shares of the underlying asset. The contract is thought of "open" until the counterparty closes it. Adding up the open contracts, where there are a buyer and seller for each, brings about the open interest.

## Changes to Open Interest

It's important to note that open interest equals the total number of contracts, not the total of every transaction by each buyer and seller. As such, open interest is the total of all the buys or the sells as a whole, not both.

The open interest number possibly changes when another buyer and seller enter the market, making another contract, or when a buyer and seller meet — in this manner shutting the two positions. For instance, assuming one trader has ten contracts short (sale) and another has ten contracts long (purchase), and these traders then buy and sell ten contracts to one another, those contracts are presently closed and will be deducted from open interest.

Open interest is commonly associated with the futures and options markets, where the number of existing contracts changes from one day to another. These markets vary from the stock market, where the [outstanding shares](/outstandingshares) of an organization's stock stay consistent once a stock issuance has been completed.

A common misconception of open interest lies in its implied predictive ability. It can't forecast price action. High or low open interest reflects investor interest, however it doesn't mean that their perspectives are right or their positions will be profitable.

## Open Interest versus Trading Volume

Open interest is some of the time mistook for trading [volume](/volume), yet the two terms allude to various measures. On a day when one trader who as of now holds 10 option contracts sells those 10 contracts to another trader entering the market, the transfer of contracts makes no change in the open interest figure for that specific option.

No new option contracts have been added to the market since one trader is transferring their position to another. Nonetheless, the sale of the 10 option contracts by an existing option holder to an option buyer builds the trading volume figure for the day by 10 contracts.

## The Importance of Open Interest

Open interest is a measure of market activity. Next to zero open interest means there are no opening positions, or virtually every one of the positions have been closed. High open interest means there are many contracts actually open, and that means market participants will watch that market closely.

Open interest is a measure of the flow of money into a futures or options market. Expanding open interest addresses new or extra money coming into the market while decreasing open interest demonstrates money flowing out of the market.

Open interest is especially important to options traders, as it gives key data in regards to the [liquidity](/liquidity) of an option.

## Open Interest and Trend Strength

Open interest is likewise utilized as a [indicator](/indicator) of trend strength. Since rising open interest addresses extra money and interest coming into a market, it is generally deciphered to be an indication that the existing market trend is picking up speed or is probably going to proceed.

For instance, assuming the trend is rising at the cost of the underlying asset, for example, a stock, expanding open interest will in general lean toward a continuation of that trend. A similar concept applies to downtrends. At the point when the stock price is declining, and open interest is expanding, open interest upholds further price declines.

Numerous [technical analysts](/technical-investigator) accept that information on open interest can give valuable data about the market. For instance, on the off chance that there is a deceleration in open interest following a supported move — either up or down — in price, then, at that point, it very well may be hinting a finish to that trend.
