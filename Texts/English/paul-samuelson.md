# Paul Samuelson
## Who Is Paul Samuelson?

Paul Samuelson was a prominent scholastic economist who left an enduring engraving on the field. In 1970, Samuelson was the primary American to be awarded the [Nobel Memorial Prize in Economics](/nobel-memorial-prize-in-economic-sciences) for his outstanding contributions. After getting the award, Samuelson was applauded for raising "the level of logical analysis in economic theory."

His legacy incorporates a college textbook called **Economics: An Introductory Analysis**, first distributed in 1948, right now in its nineteenth version, and accessible in 40 languages.

## Figuring out Paul Samuelson

Samuelson went to the University of Chicago and later Harvard University, where he was awarded a Ph.D. in economics. His 1941 doctoral paper was the basis for **Foundations of Economic Analysi**s, distributed by Harvard Press in 1947.

At 25, Samuelson started to instruct at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), where he stayed until the end of his career, turning into a full teacher at 32. While at MIT, Samuelson showed ages of understudies on the principles of economics, and proceeded with research into numerous parts of economic theory.

Samuelson likewise served the U.S. government as an advisor to two presidents, Kennedy and Johnson, and later filled in as a consultant to the United States Treasury, the Bureau of the Budget, and the president's [Council of Economic Advisers](/council_economic_advisors). In 1996, President Clinton praised Samuelson's contribution to economics when he gave him the National Medal of Science, recognizing him for his "central contributions to economic science" across a 60-year career.

Samuelson was both a serious technical wonk and a libertarian about the field of economics, diving into such thick research points as consumer theory, modern [welfare economics](/welfare_economics), linear programming, [Keynesian economics](/keynesianeconomics), economic dynamics, international trade theory, and logical decision and maximization, while likewise co-writing (with Milton Friedman) a column on economic issues for **Newsweek** magazine.

Samuelson kicked the bucket in 2009 at 94 years old, following a splendid career in which he made contributions as a teacher, researcher, speaker, and adviser to understudies and partners in the field of economics.

## Research

Samuelson's original work, **Foundations of Economic Analysi**s, set the stage for his surprisingly useful career as a scholarly economist. Quite, this work expressly set his economic analysis in the language of formal mathematical logic, which was to turn into the prevailing paradigm for economic theory and research through to the current day.

**Foundations** introduced economic analysis as essentially centered around the detailing and exploration of different issues of compelled optimization and equilibration. His later book, **Economics,** originally introduced what might come to be known as the neoclassical amalgamation, which consolidates [neoclassical](/neoclassical) microeconomics with neo-Keynesian mathematical macroeconomics. Inside the structures laid out in these two books, Samuelson would build the remainder of his research career.

All through his career, Samuelson would lean toward a balanced approach between [free markets](/freemarket) and [technocratic regulation of the economy](/order economy). He contended that individual markets typically incline toward productivity in a [microeconomic](/microeconomics) sense, however that the [macroeconomy](/macroeconomics) was not efficient overall.

Samuelson introduced his speculations as functioning as per individual, rational decision, yet didn't really accept that that free markets would settle themselves. He emphatically scrutinized free market economists of his time and more than once distributed excessively hopeful projections that the Soviet Union would economically outperform and overwhelm the U.S. economy by the 1980s or 1990s.

### Microeconomics

Samuelson developed the concept of [revealed preference](/revealed-preference), which contends that a consumer's [utility](/utility) function can be concluded from their behavior. His application of the arithmetic of obliged optimization to consumer behavior manages consumers' preferences as revealed by their decisions, instead of an assumed utility function.

He likewise made contributions to welfare theory, including the Lindahl-Bowen-Samuelson criteria for deciding if a change in the economy will further develop welfare.

### Financial Theory and Public Finance

Samuelson contributed to the development of the [efficient market hypothesis](/efficientmarkethypothesis) with a mathematical proof that says in the event that markets are efficient, asset prices will follow a random walk. Nonetheless, he likewise contended that noticing a [random walk](/randomwalktheory) in asset prices didn't demonstrate that financial markets are efficient (and he accepted that they are).

In public finance theory, he developed the theory of public goods and optimal public financing of public goods in a market economy of private goods markets.

### Macroeconomics

Samuelson created and promote neo-Keynesian mathematical macroeconomics, including the overlapping ages model and utilization of the multiplier and accelerator effects to make sense of [business cycles](/businesscycle) and downturns.

His most important contribution was his presentation of the neoclassical amalgamation. This is the view that, under [full employment](/fullemployment) and macroeconomic equilibrium, an economy in light of neoclassical microeconomics of supply and demand could (generally) function efficiently. Notwithstanding, that neo-Keynesian theory better depicted the macroeconomy and upheld the important government macroeconomic policies to accomplish and keep up with conditions of full employment, which microeconomic markets expect to efficiently function.

This overall concept of economics is as yet the prevailing paradigm in economics and economic policy.
