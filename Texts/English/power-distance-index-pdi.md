# Power-Distance Index (PDI)
## What Is the Power-Distance Index (PDI)?

The power-distance index (PDI) is a measurement of the acceptance of a hierarchy of power and wealth by the people who make up everybody of a nation, culture, or business. Developed by Dutch social psychologist Geert Hofstede, the PDI eventually gives knowledge into the degree to which standard residents, or subordinates, acknowledge or demand the authority of the person or individuals in charge.

Hofstede's PDI is lower in countries and organizations where authority figures work closely with subordinates. The PDI is higher in places with a strong hierarchy.

## Understanding the Power-Distance Index

Highly structured businesses, societies, and institutions frequently have high indices. A high index shows that the hierarchy is obviously defined, present, and unchallenged.

A low index shows a less inflexible or dictator system. Individuals in a low index society or group will challenge authority and promptly connect with authority figures in the expectation that they can influence choices.

### PDI and Cultural Dimensions Theory

The power-distance index is one part of Hofstede's social aspects theory, which was the main endeavor to evaluate the differences among cultures. This theory is presently applied widely in a number of fields including multifaceted psychology, diverse communication, and international business.

Driven by factor analysis, the social aspects theory in its original form depended on the consequences of Hofstede's global survey of the values of IBM employees. Testing and assortment of the outcomes were led somewhere in the range of 1967 and 1973.

In light of these and different outcomes, Hofstede determined that there are six distinct aspects to each culture: power distance, vulnerability avoidance, independence versus community, short term versus long term, manliness versus gentility, and patience versus guilty pleasure.

(The original model had just four aspects however was subsequently expanded to six. Long-term versus short-term was added after Hofstede performed independent research in Hong Kong, and guilty pleasure versus patience was added in 2010.)

## Business and the PDI

Hofstede's theory acquired extensive reputation on account of its analysis of social and national differences. It has been particularly powerful in the business world. With the growth of the global economy, the PDI and the factors that add to it have been utilized to foster a comprehension of social differences and what they mean for international business dealings.

The differences in view of power appear to be particularly significant during business talks. For instance, Austria has a power distance index of roughly 11, while numerous Arab nations have indices of around 80. Utilizing Austrian business practices or management styles in an Arab country might be counterproductive, or in any event can create a degree of [culture shock](/culture-shock).

The United States, incidentally, has a PDI of 40.
