# Economic Value Added (EVA)
## What Is Economic Value Added (EVA)?

Economic value added (EVA) is a measure of a company's [financial performance](/financialperformance) in light of the residual wealth calculated by deducting its cost of capital from its operating profit, adjusted for taxes on a cash basis. EVA can likewise be alluded to as [economic profit](/economicprofit), as it endeavors to capture the true economic profit of a company. This measure was formulated by management consulting firm Stern Value Management, initially incorporated as Stern Stewart and Co.

## Understanding Economic Value Added (EVA)

EVA is the incremental difference in the [rate of return (RoR)](/rateofreturn) over a company's cost of capital. Basically, it is utilized to measure the value a company generates from funds invested in it. On the off chance that a company's EVA is negative, it means the company isn't generating value from the funds invested into the business. Conversely, a positive EVA shows a company is creating value from the funds invested in it.

The formula for working out EVA is:

EVA = NOPAT - (Invested Capital * WACC)

Where:

- [NOPAT](/nopat) = Net operating profit after taxes
- [Invested capital](/invested-capital) = Debt + capital leases + shareholders' value
- [WACC](/wacc) = Weighted average cost of capital

## Special Considerations

The equation for EVA shows that there are three key components to a company's EVA — NOPAT, the amount of capital invested, and the WACC. NOPAT can be calculated physically however is typically listed in a [public company's](/publiccompany) financials.

Capital invested is the amount of money used to fund a company or a specific project. WACC is the average rate of return a company hopes to pay its financial backers; the loads are derived as a small part of each financial source in a company's [capital structure](/capitalstructure). WACC can likewise be calculated however is typically given.

The equation utilized for invested capital in EVA is normally total assets minus current liabilities — two figures effectively found on a firm's balance sheet. In this case, the modified formula for EVA is NOPAT - (total assets - current liabilities) * WACC.

As verified by Stern Value Management, in 1983 the management team developed EVA, "another model for boosting the value made that can likewise be utilized to give incentives at all levels of the firm." The goal of EVA is to measure the cost of investing capital into a certain project or firm and afterward survey whether it generates sufficient cash to be considered a wise investment. A positive EVA shows a project is generating returns in excess of the required least return.

## Benefits and Disadvantages of EVA

EVA surveys the performance of a company and its management through the possibility that a business is just profitable when it makes wealth and returns for [shareholders](/shareholder), hence requiring performance over a company's cost of capital.

EVA as a performance indicator is extremely valuable. The calculation shows how and where a company made wealth, through the inclusion of [balance sheet](/balancesheet) things. This powers managers to know about assets and expenses while settling on managerial choices.

In any case, the EVA calculation depends vigorously on the amount of [invested capital](/invested-capital) and is best utilized for resource rich companies that are stable or mature. Companies with [intangible assets](/intangibleasset), like technology businesses, may not be great possibility for an EVA evaluation.
