# Bearer Instrument
## What Is a Bearer Instrument?

A bearer instrument, or bearer bond, is a type of fixed-income security where no ownership information is recorded and the security is issued in physical form to the purchaser.

The holder of a bearer instrument is ventured to be the owner, and whoever is in possession of the physical bond is qualified for the coupon payments.

## Understanding Bearer Instruments

Securities can be issued in two forms: registered or bearer. Most securities issued today are [registered instruments](/registeredsecurity). A registered instrument is one in which the responsible firm keeps records of a security's owner, mailing payments to the owner of the record. The name and address of an owner of a registered security is engraved on a certificate, and dividend or interest payments must be made out to the named security owner.

To transfer ownership, the current owner must support the certificate which is introduced to the issuer's transfer agent. The transfer agent checks the endorsement, drops the certificate, and issues another one to the new owner. The issuer, then, has a record of who possesses the security and can make interest and dividend payments to the suitable owner. In any case, a significant chunk of time must pass for another security to be issued in another's name.

An issuer of a [bearer form](/bearerform) security keeps no record of who possesses the security at some random point in time. This means that the security is traded with no record of ownership, so physical possession of the security is the sole evidence of ownership. In this way, whoever delivers the bearer certificate is assumed to be the owner of the security and can collect dividends and interest payments tied to the security.

Ownership is transferred by just transferring the certificate, and there is no requirement for reporting the transfer of bearer securities. Securities in bearer form can be utilized in certain purviews to stay away from [transfer taxes](/transfertax), despite the fact that taxes might be charged when bearer instruments are issued.

## Bearer Bonds

A bearer bond, otherwise called a [coupon bond](/couponbond), is a [negotiable instrument](/negotiable-instrument) that has part of its certificate as a series of coupons, each relating to a scheduled interest payment on the bond. At the point when an interest payment is due, the bondholder must clasp off the coupons appended to the bond and present them for payment.

Consequently, interest payments on bonds are alluded to as [coupons](/coupon). The bearer of the bond certificate is attempted to be the owner who collects interest by cutting and saving coupons semi-yearly. The issuer won't help the bearer to remember coupon payments.
