As part of the Act, Congress stated that a financial institution couldn't be held obligated for delivering suspicious transactional information to law enforcement.

This was in effect until April 1996 when the [Suspicious Activity Report](/suspicious-activity-report) (SAR) was presented. CTRs were initially filed on form 104; they are currently filed on form 112.
