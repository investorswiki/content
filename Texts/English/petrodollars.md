## What Are Petrodollars?

Petrodollars are crude oil export revenues designated in [U.S. dollars](/usd). The term acquired currency during the 1970s while taking off oil prices generated large trade and [current account surpluses](/current-account-excess) for oil exporting countries.

Then, at that point, as now, oil sales and the subsequent current account excesses were designated in dollars in light of the fact that the U.S. dollar was — and remains — by a long shot the most widely utilized currency. The U.S. dollar's global prominence doesn't rely upon the kindness of oil exporters. It depends on U.S. status as the world's largest economy and goods importer, with deep, liquid capital markets backed by the rule of law as well as military power.

## Figuring out Petrodollars

Petrodollars are oil export revenues named in U.S. dollars. Petrodollars are not a distinct currency; they are essentially U.S. dollars accepted as payment by an oil exporter.

Global crude oil exports averaged around 70 million barrels each day in the two years before the COVID-19 pandemic. That pace would generate annual global petrodollar supply of more than $2.5 trillion assuming an average price of $100 per barrel.

Petrodollars are the primary source of revenue and wealth for some individuals from the [Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC)](/opec) as well as non-OPEC oil and gas exporters including Russia, Qatar, and Norway.

Just as the petrodollar isn't a currency, nor is it a global trading system. The wide utilization of the U.S. dollar as payment for crude oil mirrors the traditional inclinations of non-U.S. oil providers.

## Petrodollar Recycling

Oil exporters incline toward the U.S. dollar since it is the pre-famous global currency for global investments. That makes it the most helpful store of value for accumulated oil revenue, which necessities to earn a [rate of return](/rateofreturn) to be helpful.

An early illustration of petrodollar reusing is the 1974 deal between the U.S. also, Saudi Arabia to funnel Saudi petrodollars into U.S. Treasuries.

Subsequent deals sent Saudi oil export proceeds to pay for U.S. aid and development projects in Saudi Arabia and to finance U.S. weapons sales to the realm.

Many oil exporters presently invest their petrodollars in stocks, bonds and other financial instruments through [sovereign wealth funds](/sovereign_wealth_fund). Norway's sovereign wealth fund had assets of about $1.4 trillion toward the finish of 2021. With a 72% allocation to stocks, the fund holds almost 1.5% of the world's publicly listed shares.

## The Problem With the Petroyuan

To assess the benefits for an oil exporter of getting compensated in U.S. dollars, consider periodic claims over the course of the last decade that the petrodollar would before long face a test from the petroyuan: oil exports designated and paid for with Chinese currency.

All purchasers of exported oil hold or can undoubtedly access U.S. dollars, while just China and for the most part Chinese companies hold the Chinese national currency, called the yuan or renminbi. In contrast to the U.S. dollar, the renminbi isn't a freely [convertible currency](/convertible-currency); its exchange rate against different currencies including the U.S. dollar keeps on being managed by China's central bank.

U.S. dollars from crude exports can be effortlessly invested worldwide, remembering for the $13.4 trillion eurodollar market for short-term dollar designated deposits in European banks. Crude export proceeds in Chinese currency can't be invested outside China as widely as USD, and must be invested inside China at the tact of the Chinese government. However Chinese capital markets have developed fast, they stay a lot more modest and less liquid than U.S. capital markets.

To sum up, claims that the U.S. dollar's supremacy lay on its status as the settlement currency for oil exports have it backwards: the dollar's status as the global reserve currency keeps it key to oil exporters. The dollar was the laid out global store of value decades before non-U.S. crude oil exporters rose to unmistakable quality.

## The Real Problem With Petrodollars

Petrodollars reused into investments overseas or development programs at home can create positive financial and social returns. Results are distinctly more negative when petrodollars are spent on strengthening domestic mistreatment, powering an arms race or taking up arms abroad.

In recent years, activities including the homicide of U.S. resident Jamal Khashoggi by Saudi state agents in Turkey and Russia's attack of Ukraine have energized worries that petrodollars are financing war and human rights infringement, while safeguarding culprits from accountability.

## The Bottom Line

Petrodollars are U.S. dollars received in return for oil exports. The growth in global oil flows after some time has increased the economic association of crude exporters and importers and the volume of international capital flows. Yet, the oil trade and related investments rely urgently upon the U.S. dollar as the most widely accepted global currency. The U.S. dollar is probably not going to be superseded as the global payments currency of decision in the close to term.
