A capital blockade might be combined with [freezing foreign bank accounts](/frozenaccount) that have a place with the target country's residents to add pressure.

## Grasping Capital Blockades

A country, or group of countries, may impose a capital blockade to hamper the [economic growth](/economicgrowth) of the endorsed country as a measure intended to pressure that country to determine differences through exchanges. Such sanctions might be an effective and moderately tranquil method for returning the culpable country to the bargaining table without the requirement for acceleration to armed conflict.

They might be exhaustive — denying commercial activity with a whole country — or they might be targeted, obstructing the [transactions](/transaction) of and with specific businesses, groups, or people.

National state run administrations, and especially international administering bodies like the [United Nations](/united-nations-un) (UN) and [European Union](/europeanunion) (EU), have imposed economic sanctions to constrain, dissuade, rebuff, or disgrace substances that jeopardize their interests or disregard international standards.

Sanctions have been utilized to advance foreign policy objectives including counterterrorism, counternarcotics, restraint, advancing majority rules system, growing human rights, conflict resolution, and cybersecurity.

Extraterritorial sanctions, likewise called secondary sanctions or a secondary blacklist, are intended to confine the economic activity of states, businesses, and nationals of extra countries. Numerous legislatures think about these sanctions a violation of their sovereignty and international law.

Endorse results shift by case. Sanctions with moderately limited objectives show up bound to prevail than those with major political desires. Sanctions might develop. For instance, with the exception of a concise period during the 1980s, the United States has had sanctions on Iran since U.S. prisoners were taken in 1979, however the scope and logic of the sanctions have changed. Most frequently, the utility of sanctions is a higher priority than whether they accomplish their objectives. Now and again, sanctions might be expected just to express rebuke.
