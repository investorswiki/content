# Security Interest
## What Is a Security Interest?

Security interest is an enforceable legal claim or [lien](/lien) on [collateral](/collateral) that has been pledged, generally to get a loan. The borrower furnishes the lender with a security interest in certain assets, which gives the lender the right to repossess all or part of the property on the off chance that the borrower stops making loan payments. The lender can then sell the repossessed collateral to pay off the loan.

## Understanding a Security Interest

Getting interest on a loan brings down the risk for the lender and, thus, permits the lender to charge lower interest, subsequently bringing down the [cost of capital](/costofcapital) for the borrower. A transaction wherein a security interest is granted is called a "secured transaction."

Granting a security interest is the standard for loans, for example, vehicle loans, business loans, and mortgages, all in all called [secured loans](/secureddebt). Credit cards, in any case, are classified as [unsecured loans](/unsecuredloan). The credit card company won't repossess the garments, food, or excursion you purchased with the card on which you default. [Signature loans](/signature_loan) are one more illustration of unsecured loans. The fundamental difference between these two types of loans is the nonappearance or presence of collateral.

The [Uniform Commercial Code](/uniform-commercial-code) (UCC) determines three requirements for a security interest to be legally substantial, a cycle known as "connection."

1. The security interest is given a value.
1. The borrower possesses the collateral.
1. The borrower has marked a [security agreement](/security-agreement).

Further, the collateral must be explicitly depicted in the security agreement. For instance, the security listed in the loan agreement could determine the borrower's 2013 Honda Accord, not "the borrower's all's vehicles."

The lender must likewise "awesome" its security interest to ensure no other lender has rights to a similar collateral. A perfected security interest is any secure interest in an asset that can't be claimed by some other party. The interest is perfected by enrolling it with the suitable statutory authority, so it is made legally enforceable and any subsequent claim on that asset is given a [junior status](/subordinateddebt). As a note, a [deed of reconveyance](/deed-of-reconveyance) demonstrates that a bank no longer has a security interest over a property.

> A perfected security interest is a secure interest in an asset owned exclusively by the borrower and must be registered with the proper statutory authority.

## Instances of Security Interests

Suppose Sheila borrowed $20,000 to buy a vehicle and stopped making payments when her loan balance was $10,000 in light of the fact that she lost her job. The lender repossesses her vehicle and sells it at auction for $10,000, which fulfills Sheila's loan balance. Sheila no longer has her vehicle, yet she additionally no longer owes the lender any money. The lender no longer has a [bad loan](/baddebt) on its books.

One more situation in which a lender could require the borrower to grant a security interest in assets before it will issue the loan is the point at which a business needs to borrow money to purchase machinery and equipment. The business would grant the bank a security interest in the machinery and, on the off chance that the business can't make its loan payments, the bank would repossess the machinery and sell it to recover the money it had loaned. In the event that the business stopped paying its loan due to bankruptcy, its secured lenders would have priority over its unsecured lenders in making claims on its assets.
