Funds most ordinarily close to new accounts to limit the total size of the fund.

A few mutual funds become so large that month to month inflows can amount to billions of dollars. After some time, the expected return from new money will drag down the returns of current investors. Closing a fund off to new accounts is just a single method of controlling the asset base's growth. Different means of controlling a fund's growth incorporate raising the base investment amount or preventing existing investors from offering more to the fund.
