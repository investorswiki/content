# Early Amortization
## What Is Early Amortization?

Early amortization is an accelerated payment of bond principal to investors holding asset-backed security (ABS) products. Early amortization is likewise called an early call or a payout event.

## How Early Amortization Works

Early amortization lessens the amount of time before an investor will receive the repayment of their principal from a [asset-backed security](/asset-backedsecurity) (ABS) purchase. Typically, when an investor purchases a bond, they receive routinely scheduled interest payments over a set period, or until the maturity of the bond. At the point of bond maturity, the investor gets back the full value of the bond principal and interest payments cease.

Asset-backed securities (ABS) are financial securities that are [collateralized](/collateralization) by a pool of underlying assets, for example, loans, leases, credit card debt and other receivables. For instance, a bank could bundle vehicle loans on which they collect interest and sell them to finance future vehicle loans. Assets like these are typically [illiquid](/illiquid) and can be difficult to sell voluntarily. Be that as it may, the course of securitization makes them marketable to investors as bundling these assets can spread the risk out over a large portfolio.

Early amortization will mean a liquidity crisis for the bond originator, as funding evaporates. The event is typically set off on the off chance that there is a sudden increase in delinquencies in the underlying loans. Other early amortization triggers for asset-backed securities include:

- The bond's sponsor, like a bank, or servicer going into chapter 11
- Deficient payments from underlying borrowers
- Deficient excess spread, or low leftover interest payments and other collected fees on the security subsequent to covering costs
- Default rate increases over an acceptable level

At the point when early amortization happens, it can't be switched or repealed, and all bond principal and interest payments go to investors no matter what a bond's expected maturity date.

## What Early Amortization Means for Investors

[Rating agencies](/bond-rating-agencies) typically require asset-backed securities to remember language for their contracts about early amortization to receive a debt rating. This language is required in light of the fact that the payout from an early amortization event shields investors from delayed exposure to receivables with deteriorated credit performance. Investors ought to know that while early amortization mitigates the risks implied with investing in asset-backed securities, it doesn't dispose of it. There is as yet the risk that investors won't earn all of the guaranteed interest from the security assuming an early amortization event is set off.

The cash flow of asset-backed securities isn't solid all of the time. Therefore, they are not sold with a guaranteed maturity date, however all things considered, with an average maturity. Early amortization can assist with safeguarding investors in the event that the bond's maturity is cut short.
