# Pacific Exchange (PCX)
## What Was the Pacific Exchange (PCX)?

The Pacific Exchange (PCX) was a California regional stock exchange in presence from 1882 to 2005 (2002, in physical form). It currently exists basically as an electronic trading program that works through the New York Stock Exchange's Arca platform, [NYSE Arca](/nyse-arca).

## Grasping the Pacific Exchange (PCX)

For quite a bit of its history, the PCX facilitated robust equity trading activity, turning into the country's third-largest options market by the mid-1980s. It was one of just four U.S. exchanges to trade equity [options](/choice) and was quick to create and execute an electronic trading system. During its prime, the PCX held operations in both Los Angeles and San Francisco, with two trading floors in the last city.

Notwithstanding, the Los Angeles and the Pine Street, San Francisco trading floors closed in the mid 2000s when the PCX sold its stock trading operations to the Archipelago Exchange (ArcaEx), Archipelago Holdings, a leading electronic-trading firm situated in Chicago.

The exchange kept on existing in digital form: In 2003, it sent off an electronic options platform, the PCX-Plus, which permitted options market-producers to make trades-either from its floor or electronically, from remote areas. In 2005, however, its parent firm, PCX Holdings, agreed to sell this operation to Archipelago too. It was as of now at the Pacific Exchange quit existing as a separate entity.

Archipelago likewise acquired Pacific's self-regulatory license, which permits Pacific to act as the compliance guard dog over ArcaEx.

### PCX Today

A year later, in 2006, Archipelago merged with the New York Stock Exchange; consequently, the NYSE Arca platform presently manages all PCX transactions.

Be that as it may, while equity trading on the Pacific Exchange happens just through NYSE ARCA, the Pacific Exchange keeps on running its options business out of the Mills Building, its historic Montgomery Street HQ, in San Franciso. Right up 'til now, nearby firms, for example, Casey Securities and Student Options keep a presence on the options floor, as do major sell-side investors like Goldman Sachs.

## History of the Pacific Exchange (PCX)
### Early Days

The Pacific Exchange advanced from two late nineteenth century financial markets starting in California.

The first was the San Francisco Stock and Bond Exchange, founded in 1882. Its original purpose was to work with financial trades associated with the large measures of silver found in the Comstock Lode of Nevada — and the fortunes produced using it.

> Four men, specifically, became moguls from the Comstock Lode discovery, and strongholds of the youthful San Francisco exchange: James Graham Fair, John William Mackay, William S. O'Brien, and James Claire Flood, for whom San Francisco's famous Flood Building on Market Street is named.

While mining money was forming the San Francisco Stock and Bond Exchange, another commodity was funding a financial market toward the south. The Los Angeles Oil Exchange opened in 1889, drove by oil magnates, for example, Wallace Libby Hardison, a founder of Union Oil, which later merged into Chevron.

In 1957, the two exchanges merged, formally making the Pacific Stock Exchange or PCX. The name was abbreviated to the Pacific Exchange 40 years later, in 1997.

For quite a long time, the PCX was a backbone in San Francisco's financial district. It worked during a portion of the country's most impactful economic events, including the California Gold Rush and the [Great Depression](/great_depression). At its level, the Pacific Exchange was trading in excess of 2,700 stocks, bonds, and different securities on trading floors in San Francisco and Los Angeles. A record 3.3 billion shares changed hands there in 1997. It likewise traded options on in excess of 800 stocks on its San Francisco options trading floor, taking care of 46.7 million options contracts that year.

### Later Years

At the point when PCs began turning into a fact of business — and financial industry — life, the PCX was among the primary exchanges to mechanize in 1969 by utilizing PCs on the floor to complete a few trades.

In any case, PCX's trade floors and open outcry system of stock buying and selling became old with the coming of electronic trading. With an end goal to remain beneficial, PCX Holdings, the exchange's owner, chose to demutualize in 1999, making PCX the main U.S. stock exchange to do as such.

With the onset of the 21st century, PCX started to destroy. The exchange sold its equity trading business to Archipelago in 2000. Subsequently, the PCX trading floor in Los Angeles closed in 2001, with San Francisco Pine Street floor closing the year later.

At the point when Archipelago Holdings Inc. absorbed PCX absolutely in 2005, Arca agreed to pay PCX's parent company, PCX Holdings, $50.7 million to obtain its two key assets: its electronic system utilized for trading stock options, and the self-regulatory license that has permitted the exchange to self-police its operations. PCX shareholders received 20% of the purchase price in Archipelago stock, giving shareholders a substantial stake in the entity.

Today equity trading on the Pacific Exchange happens just through the electronic communications network NYSE ARCA.

## Special Considerations

The PCX wasn't the main exchange whose destiny was altered by advances in trading technology. The Cincinnati Stock Exchange, founded in 1885, closed its floor and went almost completely electronic in 1980 being renamed the National Stock Exchange (NSE). Likewise, The Boston Stock Exchange, presently Nasdaq, sent off in 1830, is a founding member of the all-electronic Boston Options Exchange. The Chicago Stock Exchange (CHX), laid out in 1882, absorbed several of its rivals in Cleveland, St. Louis, Minneapolis, and, surprisingly, New Orleans throughout the long term.
