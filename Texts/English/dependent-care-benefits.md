## What Are Dependent Care Benefits?

Dependent care benefits are given by an employer to an employee for use in focusing on [dependents](/dependent), like small kids or disabled family individuals. Dependent care benefits might incorporate [flexible spending accounts (FSAs)](/flexiblespendingaccount), paid leave, and certain [tax credits](/taxcredit) and can be worth a huge number of dollars to eligible participants.

## How Dependent Care Benefits Work

Dependents, as per the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), are treated as an exemption credit that might be guaranteed on an annual tax return. All alone, the dependent credit can reduce a filer's taxable income by huge number of dollars. Children are the most normally guaranteed dependent, however dependent care benefits might be extended to cover various individuals, gave they meet several expectations. For instance, dependents may likewise be family members, flat mates, or even significant others. The IRS gives an aide on who might be guaranteed as a dependent.

Dependent care benefits are accessible to individuals whose children are cared for by a daycare facility or provider. Such benefits might appear as childcare tax credits or a [dependent care flexible spending account (FSA)](/dependent-care-fsa). Each gives tax savings in view of money spent on childcare.

Dependent care benefits are part of an overall employee benefits system administered by the IRS.

## Dependent Care Benefits: Flexible Spending Account

A dependent care flexible spending account is accessible for individuals who care for a child or grown-up who is unequipped for taking care of oneself, who lives in the taxpayer's home for something like eight hours every day, and who can be guaranteed as a dependent on an income tax return. These accounts permit individuals to pay for qualified child and dependent care expenses while bringing down their taxable income.

This type of FSA is set up by an employer. Participants approve their employer to keep a predefined amount from their paycheck each pay period and deposit the money in an account. Rather than utilizing the FSA money to pay for expenses straightforwardly, those costs are paid [out-of-pocket](/outofpocket), and [reimbursement](/reimbursablecosts) must be applied for.
