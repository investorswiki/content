## What Are Long-Term Investments?

A long-term investment is an account on the asset side of a company's [balance sheet](/balancesheet) that addresses the company's [investments](/investment), including stocks, bonds, real estate, and cash. Long-term investments are assets that a company plans to hold for over a year.

The long-term investment account varies to a great extent from the [short-term investment](/shorterminvestments) account in that short-term investments will no doubt be sold, though the long-term investments won't be sold for a really long time and, at times, might in all likelihood never be sold.

Being a long-term investor means that you will acknowledge a certain amount of risk in quest for possibly higher rewards and that you can stand to show restraint for a longer period of time. It likewise proposes that you have sufficient capital accessible to stand to tie up a set amount for a long period of time.

## Long-Term Investments Explained

A common form of long-term investing happens when company A puts generally in company B and gains critical influence over company B without having a majority of the [voting shares](/votingshares). In this case, the [purchase price](/purchaseprice) would be displayed as a long-term investment.

While a holding company or other firm purchases bonds or shares of common stock as investments, the decision about whether to characterize it as short-term or long-term has a few fairly important ramifications for the way those assets are valued on the balance sheet. Short-term investments are set apart to market, and any declines in value are recognized as a loss.

In any case, expansions in value are not recognized until the thing is sold. Consequently, the balance sheet classification of investment — whether it is long-term or short-term — straightforwardly affects the net income that is reported on [the income statement](/incomestatement).

In the event that an entity plans to keep an investment until it has matured and the company can show the ability to do as such, the investment is noted as being "held to maturity." The investment is recorded at cost, albeit any premiums or discounts are amortized over the life of the investment.

When PayPal had essentially developed its infrastructure and client base, it was then turned out similar to claim company in 2015 with a five-year agreement to keep processing payments for eBay. This investment helped PayPal develop and simultaneously permitted eBay the benefit of claiming a top notch payment processing solution for almost twenty years.

Investments held with the expectation of resale in the span of a year, to gather a short-term profit, are classified as current investments. A trading investment may not be a long-term investment. Notwithstanding, a company might hold an investment with the expectation to sell from here on out.

These investments are classified as "ready to move" as long as the anticipated sale date isn't inside the next 12 months. Ready to move long-term investments are recorded at cost when purchased and thusly adjusted to mirror their fair values toward the finish of the reporting period.
