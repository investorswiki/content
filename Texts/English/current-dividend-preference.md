Current dividend preference means that [preferred shareholders](/preferredstock) have priority or preference over common shareholders with regards to dividend distributions. This feature infers that by no means might dividends at any point be paid to common shareholders before preferred shareholders.

## Grasping Current Dividend Preference

Dividend distributions rely upon a number of factors, for example, the company's operating performance, level of [retained earnings](/retainedearnings), and [payout ratio](/payoutratio). While dividend payments on common shares are generally at the company's circumspection, preferred dividends generally have a greater degree of stability.

Common shareholders have voting rights and get to take part in the growth of the company through common share price changes. Preferred shareholders typically don't have voting rights and are paid a fixed or floating dividend rate. The rate influences the price at which the preferred shares trade, making them a combination of both a stock and a [bond](/bond).

This makes them dissimilar to common share dividends, which could change relying upon a company's profits still up in the air by the company's board of directors.

Generally talking, preferred share dividends are seen as more stable than common stock dividends, and have a higher likelihood of being paid, given that preferred stockholders are paid their full set dividend rate every period as long as the company is in operation.

One feature that frequently accompanies the current dividend preference is a cumulative preferred shares function, where all missed (cumulative) dividends on preferred shares must be paid before any dividends can be issued to common stock shareholders.

In this case, preferred stock shareholders stand ahead of common stock shareholders should a bankruptcy court split a company's assets. In any case, preferred shareholders rank behind bond holders, so bond holders get compensated before preferred shareholders.

On the off chance that the company has a solid financial position and is consistently productive, paying these dividends shouldn't cause it any issues. Nonetheless, on the off chance that it has a couple of unfruitful or insignificantly beneficial years, it might consider managing dividends on its [common stock](/commonstock), or even suspending them out and out. In any case, even in this scenario, it must pay out preferred share dividends, either during this period or sometime in the future.

On the off chance that the company enters bankruptcy procedures, preferred shareholders will be paid out any capital left over ahead of common shareholders. Bond holders are paid first, then preferred shareholders, then common shareholders.
