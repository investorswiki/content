# Dark Wave
## What Is a Gray Wave?

A dim wave portrays an investment or company remembered to be productive in the long term or extended long term. [Speculators](/speculator) of dark waves will buy an investment vehicle that they accept will show a return in the extremely long term, and not before. The term "dark wave" can be made sense of by the figuring out that while buying into a dim wave company, the investor shouldn't plan for an immediate or even short-term positive return at the same time, all things considered, just when they are a lot more seasoned and have silver hair.

## Grasping a Gray Wave

Dark wave depicts an investment in the company that will probably not yield a positive return until a long time has elapsed. Dim wave investments are not suitable for all investor types. Frequently, portfolio managers buy stocks that are expected to yield a specific return inside a specific time span, commonly three to five years.

These [portfolio](/portfolio) managers are probably not going to purchase dark wave stocks. Dim wave stocks are purchased by long-term investors who are checking out at a very long or perpetual time horizon. The time horizon is one of the most critical investing concepts. Before pursuing investment choices, an investor must consider when they should either pull out the [principal](/principal), or start drawing down on the [dividends](/profit) and return. The longer the time horizon, the more room an investor has for possible errors, change in accordance with market swings, and benefit from [compounding interest](/compoundinterest).

### Speculators versus Investors

You can be a speculator or an investor in the stock market. A speculator seeks after the short-term climb in a company's share price. For instance, a biotech company applies for FDA endorsement for a cutting edge malignant growth treatment. The investor buys ahead of the announcement and sells right after the uplifting news of the endorsement emerges and the stock has move subsequently.

An investor, then again, is searching for an all the more long-term proposition. The investor will buy the stock and hold it since they accept the company will pay dividends over the long term. The stock is held for quite a long time. This is a dim wave investment. The investor will have silver hair when they sell their shares.
