# Sell-Off
## What Is a Sell-Off?

A sell-off happens when a large volume of [securities](/security) are sold in a short period of time, making the price of a security fall in quick succession. As additional shares are offered than buyers will acknowledge, the decline in price might accelerate as market psychology turns skeptical.

There are several likely triggers of a sell-off, which might incorporate the release of disheartening [earnings reports](/earningsreport) or poor guidance, fears of increased competition, or the threat of innovative disruption. More extensive causes, for example, [macroeconomic](/macroeconomics) concerns or natural fiascos, can likewise trigger sell-offs.

A sell-off might be diverged from a market [rally](/rally).

## How Sell-Offs Work

Sell-offs happen in light of the principle of [supply and demand](/law-of-supply-demand). On the off chance that a large number of investors choose to sell their holdings with next to no compensating increase in buyers, the price of that investment will fall.

Sell-offs are an impression of investor psychology. For example, if a sell-off happens after another earnings report, the sellers might have been excessively hopeful about that security when they bought it in advance.

For contrarian investors, sell-offs can introduce an opportunity to buy at low prices. Assuming investors trust that the sell-off was ridiculous or excessively extreme, they could make a move to buy the security at a "deal" price.

The following circumstances might trigger a sell-off:

- After the market close, a company gives strongly lower earnings [guidance](/guidance) for the current fiscal year. In [after-hours trading](/afterhourstrading), there is a precarious sell-off of the shares of the company.
- During market trading hours, a word report rapidly gets out that customers of a restaurant have contracted E. coli. The stock of the restaurant chain sells off, as the market currently accepts that the earnings of the company will be seriously impacted.
- A higher-than-anticipated inflation report is released in Germany, which triggers a sell-off in German [bunds](/bund).
- China surprises the global market by giving a [gross domestic product](/gdp) (GDP) growth rate forecast that is well below expectations. A major sell-off in numerous essential commodities happens.
- Talk during market hours that a company is going to report a highly [dilutive acquisition](/dilutiveacquisition) prompts a sell-off. In any case, the company releases a statement that no such discussions with the supposed target have occurred, and the stock rapidly turns around and heads back up.

## Illustration of a Sell-Off: The BP Oil Spill

A striking illustration of a sell-off happened in April 2010 during the Deepwater Horizon oil spill. During that month, the Deepwater Horizon offshore oil drilling platform detonated off the bank of Louisiana, eventually releasing an estimated 4,000,000 barrels of oil into the Gulf of Mexico (the evaluations shift widely somewhere in the range of three and five million barrels).

Notwithstanding its environmental impact, this event seriously affected the [shareholders](/shareholder) of British Petroleum (BP), which was responsible for operating the Deepwater Horizon. Soon after the oil spill, BP's shares lost more than half of their value, prodded by a hundredfold increase in selling volume. Justifiably, investors were fearful of possible fines and legal outcomes.

Eventually, the Deepwater Horizon oil spill ended up costing BP $65 billion in fines and settlements and contributed to its quarterly loss of $17 billion in July 2010.

By November 2010, be that as it may, BP's financial performance gave indications of recovery, ending the quarter with a profit of $1.8 billion. Appropriately, the share price recuperated about half of its losses before the year's over.

For the majority contrarian investors, this sell-off gave an appealing buying opportunity. The people who contradicted some common norms and purchased BP's shares at their most depressed prices saw their shares rise by more than 30% before the year's over.

## Highlights
