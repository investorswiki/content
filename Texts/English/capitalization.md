Companies that fall below this threshold are in some cases alluded to as miniature cap.
## Why Is Market Capitalization Important?

Somebody trading $10 million worth of a large-cap stock wouldn't influence the stock's price close to however much somebody trading $10 million worth of a small-cap stock. Large-cap stocks, in this manner, will generally be safer than smaller-cap stocks. That being said, smaller-cap stocks might have more room for growth and might actually offer higher returns in certain cases.
## Market Cap versus Enterprise Value

A considerably more exacting valuation metric is shown up at by adding up a company's assets and debt (the things that give it genuine value as a business) then, at that point, deducting its cash (which could be utilized to pay off debt). This is the amount a company could really be sold for to another company.
## Market Cap versus Book Value
[Book value](/bookvalue) alludes to the value of a company's all's assets minus its liabilities. This is how much would hypothetically be split between shareholders assuming that the company were to be liquidated. Book value partitioned by shares outstanding gives the net asset value (NAV) per share, or how much money in company assets each share of a company's stock addresses. Regularly, book value is lower than market cap. In theory, the nearer a company's market cap is to its book value, the more genuinely valued it is.
