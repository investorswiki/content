# Credit Risk
## What is a credit risk?
Credit risk is a proportion of the creditworthiness of a borrower. In computing credit risk, lenders are measuring the probability they will recuperate all of their [principal](/principal) and [interest](/interest) while making a loan. Borrowers viewed as a low credit risk are charged lower interest rates. Lenders, investors, and other counterparties counsel ratings agencies to asses the credit risk of working with companies.
## More profound definition
While deciding the credit risk implied in making loans, lenders are passing judgment on borrowers' ability to pay back debt. A scope of factors go into evaluations of credit risk, including [credit history](/credit-history) and [credit score](/credit_score), [debt-to-income ratio](/dti), and collateral.
- **Credit history and credit score**: Independent [credit bureaus](/creditbureau) keep up with records of borrowers' credit payment history, total debt load, and types of credit assumed out to create praise scores. They sell this data to financial institutions to assist them with evaluating credit risks.
- **Total debt load**: This measures how much existing credit has been stretched out to a borrower and the amount of that credit she has previously used. The less credit a borrower has utilized, the more able they ought to be to pay back another loan. Creditors like to perceive how effectively a borrower can get credit and sensibly they balance it.
- **Debt-to-income ratio**: This compares the amount a person makes against their everyday costs and debt payments. Lenders use it to choose if a borrower can bear to assume another debt payment.
- **Collateral**: This is the assets owned by a borrower that can be utilized to secure a loan. The more collateral a borrower has, the lower the conceivable credit risk for a lender.

For companies, credit risk implies the liability that a company will be unable to make payments on its outstanding debt. Ratings agencies — Moody's and Standard and Poor's, for instance — dissect bond offerings and issue [credit ratings](/creditrating) that grade the credit risk of various debt instruments.
It's feasible to give your creditworthiness a facelift by looking into your credit report for any mix-ups, paying down credit card debt, making all payments on time and cutting expenses at every possible opportunity.
## Credit risk model
Disregarding credit risks was the major quickening factor behind the financial crisis of 2007-2008. In the years leading up to the crisis, banks and different lenders loaned tremendous aggregates as subprime mortgages to high-risk borrowers. As the economy slowed in 2006-2007, large numbers of these risky borrowers couldn't repay their loans, and the disturbance from this systemic inability to appropriately account for credit risk almost destroyed the global financial system in late 2008. Major banks endured losses on the grounds that the models they utilized inaccurately assessed the probability of default on mortgage payments.
