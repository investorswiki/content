# FDIC Improvement Act (FDICIA)
## What Is the FDIC Improvement Act (FDICIA)?

The FDIC Improvement Act (FDICIA) was passed in 1991 at the level of the savings and loan (S&L) crisis. The act strengthened the job and resources of the [Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation](/fdic) (FDIC) in protecting consumers. The most eminent provisions of the act raised the FDIC's [U.S. Treasury](/ustreasury) credit extension from $5 million to $30 million, patched up the FDIC auditing and evaluation standards of member banks, and remembered the [Truth for Savings Act](/truth-in-savings-act), otherwise called Regulation DD.

## Understanding the FDIC Improvement Act (FDICIA)

The FDIC was laid out in 1933 with the death of the [Emergency Banking Act](/emergencybankingact) to help confidence in the American banking system. An independent government agency gives deposit insurance to consumer bank accounts and other qualified assets when and assuming financial institutions fail. The FDIC isolates institutions into three tiers in view of consolidated [total assets](/resource), including:

- Institutions with under $500 million in consolidated total assets
- Institutions with consolidated total assets between $500 million and $1 billion
- Institutions with consolidated total assets greater than $1 billion

Huge number of financial institutions fell under somewhere in the range of 1986 and 1995, bringing about the [savings and loan crisis](/sl-crisis). The FDICIA was put into place to reinforce the FDIC's power. It laid out the requirement for greater oversight and more thorough [audits](/audit) for financial institutions with more than $500 million in assets. Under the act, they:

- Have annual reporting requirements
- Must give written statements with respect to the board's liabilities in setting up the foundation's [financial statements](/financial-statements)
- Must comply with certain audit committee provisions

Institutions that fail to consent to these audit standards could face FDIC civil punishments or administrative actions.

While it could be difficult to completely see the value in the changes made to the internal operations of the FDIC through the FDICIA, most consumers can concur that the Truth in Savings Act has gone a long way toward compelling banks to deliver on their advertised commitments. The Truth in Savings Act, which is part of the FDICIA, forced banks to start revealing savings account interest rates, utilizing the uniform [annual percentage yield](/apy) (APY) method. This has assisted consumers with bettering figure out their likely return on a deposit at a bank, as well as to at the same time look at numerous products and various banks.

> Since the FDICIA was endorsed into law in 1991, the FDIC practiced its assigned authority to refresh and reexamine its regulations forcing annual reporting requirements on [insured depository institutions](/insured-financial-establishment). The FDIC's Annual Independent Audits and Reporting Requirements frame these changes.

## History of the FDICIA

Subsequent to laying out the FDIC in 1934, [bank failures](/bank-failure) in the United States found the middle value of approximately 15 annually until 1981, when the number of bank failures started to rise. It came to around 200 every year by the late 1980s, and this trend was to a great extent because of the flood and subsequent collapse in several industries.

Among 1980 and the finish of 1991, almost 1,300 commercial banks either failed or required failing bank assistance from the FDIC. The FDIC closed down ruined institutions. By 1991, it turned out to be seriously [undercapitalized](/undercapitalization), which made the legislation vital.

### Savings and Loan (S&L) Crisis

Other than bank failures, the S&L crisis contributed to issues in the financial services industry, which at last prompted the death of FDICIA. In the late 1970s, there was a large, unforeseen increase in interest rates. For savings and loan institutions, this implied depositors moving funds out of savings and loan institutions and into institutions that were not restricted on the amount of interest they could pay depositors.

The congressional deregulation of savings and loans in 1980 gave these institutions a large number of similar capacities as banks with less regulation, causing regulatory forbearance as an additional strain in the mid 1980s.

From 1983 to 1990, almost 25% of savings and loans were closed, merged, or placed in conservatorship by the [Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation](/federal-savings-and-loan-insurance-corporation-fslic) (FSLIC). This collapse drove the FSLIC into insolvency, leading to its abolishment by the [Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery, and Enforcement Act](/financial-institutions-reform-recovery-enforcement) (FIRREA) in 1989.
