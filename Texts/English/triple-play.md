A few investors like to see triple-play stocks as a preliminary filter for finding great stocks to research for investment.

## Figuring out the Triple Play

A triple play is viewed as a highly positive sign for a stock since it shows that in addition to the fact that a company developing is its business and earnings, yet in addition doing it in a way that is expected to last throughout the next quarter, year, or more, contingent upon the guidance offered.

Frequently when a stock beats revenue and earnings gauges, analysts keep thinking about whether the higher numbers can be expected to proceed. In the event that the company doesn't raise guidance, it might demonstrate that management anticipates a drop in the next period.

A few companies don't offer guidance, and thusly, will not have triple plays. However, they can in any case beat revenue and earnings gauges.

## Revenue and Earnings Estimates and Price Action

On the off chance that a company can beat revenue and earnings expectations, this is normally something beneficial at the stock cost. Analysts were anticipating certain numbers, and the company beat those numbers.

There is likewise something many refer to as the [whisper number](/whispernumber). The whisper number is what the market or traders accept the revenue and earnings figures will be. Traders might be positioned appropriately ahead of the announcement, or they might be waiting to get in following the announcement on the off chance that they like what they hear.

As a result of the whisper number, stocks don't necessarily respond true to form to positive or unfavorable revenue and earnings numbers. For instance, a company might emerge with both revenue and earnings numbers 20% over the analyst consensus numbers, but the stock tumbles decisively on the news.

## Guidance Pros and Cons

On the off chance that a company issues guidance, and not all do, it very well may be both a decent and terrible thing.

On the brilliant side, it gives data to investors. Accepting the company is giving quality and accurate data, this data can assist investors with planning out how they need to manage the stock throughout the next quarter, year, or longer. As new guidance is given, the investor can adjust as needs be.

The downside is that the company is caring for its own interest too. Guidance might be "changed" with the goal that investors hear what they need and it benefits the share price. For instance, after a long rally a company might issue extremely perky guidance to push the stock somewhat higher, even however the stock may currently be overpriced and the company facing longer-term difficulties. Or on the other hand, a company might low-ball their guidance, so that come next quarter they look incredible when they beat their own guidance and reasonable analyst gauges in light of the guidance.

These are two or three instances of how guidance could be utilized to not be guaranteed to mirror the best data, yet rather is utilized to possibly cause short-term spikes in the share price at different times.

One could contend that killing guidance would be beneficial, albeit this too has its disadvantages. Guidance takes into consideration investors to adjust positions throughout the span of the quarter (or longer), and expecting the company has quality guidance their earnings results ought not be as [volatile](/volatility). A company that doesn't give guidance (or a company that misses their guidance numbers from the prior quarter/year) could see a ton of volatility around earnings as investors have less of a thought of what's in store.
