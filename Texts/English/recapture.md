## What Is Recapture?

Recapture is a condition set by the seller of an asset that gives him/her the right to purchase back some or every one of the assets inside a certain period of time. Along these lines, it is like a [repurchase agreement](/repurchaseagreement) (repo).

Recapture likewise alludes to a situation where an individual must add back a deduction from a previous year to their income.

## How Recapture Works

Recapture is a term utilized in conditional activities between at least two gatherings. It gives a seller the option to buy back their assets sooner or later following the occurrence of an event. For instance, a [public company](/publiccompany) may have a recapture clause, a limitation that permits it to buy back a percentage of its shares from the market assuming that its cash level surpasses a stated threshold. A pawn shop is one more model that permits sellers of household things to recapture them sometime in the not too distant future.

One more form of a recapture should be visible when two gatherings go into, say a [lease agreement](/lease), in which the lessee consents to pay a fixed percentage of its revenues to the lessor. In the event that the lessee doesn't produce sufficient revenue to make the lease contract beneficial to the lessor, the lessor might decide to terminate the agreement and reclaim full control of the property until a more productive tenant is found.

At the point when an entity is required to add back a [deduction](/deduction) or [credit](/taxcredit) from a previous year to income, a recapture results. For instance, when a business sells an asset and must recapture (add back) a portion of the depreciation, this is known as a [depreciation recapture](/depreciationrecapture).

## Recovering a Depreciation Deduction

Depreciation recapture is the gain received from the sale of [depreciable capital property](/depreciable-property) that must be reported as income. Depreciation recapture is assessed when the sale price of an asset surpasses the tax basis or [adjusted cost basis](/adjustedcostbase). The difference between these figures is accordingly "recaptured" by reporting it as income. The recapture is a tax provision that permits the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) to collect taxes on any beneficial sale of asset that the taxpayer had used to offset their taxable income. Since depreciation of an asset can be utilized to deduct [ordinary income](/ordinaryincome), any gain from the disposal of the asset must be reported as ordinary income, instead of the more great [capital gain](/capitalgain).

The first step in assessing depreciation recapture is to determine the cost basis of the asset. The original cost basis is the price that was paid to procure the asset. The adjusted cost basis is the original cost basis minus any permitted or admissible depreciation expense incurred. For instance, say a business equipment was purchased for $10,000, and had a depreciation cost of $2,000 each year. Following four years, its adjusted cost basis will be $10,000 - ($2,000 x 4) = $2,000.

The depreciation will be recaptured on the off chance that the equipment is sold for a gain. In the event that following four years, the equipment is sold for $3,000, the business will have a taxable gain of $3,000 - $2,000 = $1,000. It is not difficult to think that a loss happened from the sale since the asset was purchased for $10,000 and sold for just $3,000. Be that as it may, gains and losses are realized from the adjusted cost basis, not the original cost basis. In this case, the business must report a recaptured gain of $1,000.
