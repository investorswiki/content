# Occurrence Policy
## What Is an Occurrence Policy?

An occurrence policy covers [claims](/insurance_claim) made for wounds supported during the life of a [insurance](/insurance) policy. Under these types of contracts, the insured party has the privilege to request compensation for damages that happened inside the period of time that the policy was active, even assuming several years have since passed and the insurance agreement is as of now not in force.

## Grasping Occurrence Policies

[Liability insurance](/liability_insurance) policies generally fall into one of two categories: [Claims-made](/claimsmade-policy) or occurrence. The last option offers protection against financial loss on incidents that occurred while the policy was in effect, paying little heed to when they're hailed and became apparent. As such, it's feasible to file a claim later, long after the contract has expired, if there's evidence that its goal or triggering event took place during the period the insurance was active.

Occurrence policies cook explicitly to events that might cause injury of damage a very long time after they happen. For instance, in the event that an individual is presented to hazardous synthetic substances, a lot of time could elapse before they fall ill.

Occurrence coverage will generally cover the employer and the former employee forever. Years can pass before the wounds or damages become clear, and the policyholder is still protected, even subsequent to halting insurance or switching to another provider.

Insurers commonly place a cap on the total [coverage](/insurance-coverage) offered through such a policy. One form of cap limits the amount of coverage offered every year except allows the coverage to limit reset every year. For example, a company that purchases five years of occurrence coverage with an annual cap of $1 million will permit the policyholder to have up to $5 million in total coverage.

## Occurrence Policies versus Claims-Made

Claims-made insurance possibly pays out in the event that a claim is filed while the policy is active. That means in the event that you cancel protection and, ask for compensation, you won't be given it â€” except if an extended reporting period (ERP) or "tail coverage" is purchased.

[Business insurance](/business-insurance) policies are many times offered as either a claims-made policy or an occurrence policy. While the claims-made policy gives coverage to claims when the event is reported, the occurrence policy gives coverage when the event happens.

Claims-made policies are utilized to cover the risks associated with business operations, for example, the potential for botches associated with errors and omissions in [financial statements](/financial-statements). They are additionally applied to cover businesses from claims made by employees, including illegitimate termination, lewd behavior, and discrimination charges. This type of liability is alluded to as [employment rehearses liability](/employers-liability-insurance) (EPLI), and could likewise cover the activities of directors and officers of the business.

Until the mid-1960s the claims-made phrasing didn't exist, and into the right on time to mid-1970s its utilization was irregular. The occurrence form presently overwhelms, aside from most professional and executive liability exposures, where claims-made policies rule.

## Advantages and Disadvantages of an Occurrence Policy

The clearest benefit of an occurrence policy is that it offers long-term protection. However long coverage is in place when the episode happened, making a claim on that period years into the future is conceivable.

Another advantage is that occurrence policy costs will more often than not be fixed. [Premiums](/insurance-premium) generally don't increase except if the [risk profile](/risk-profile) of the insured changes.

On the downside, occurrence policies are, naturally, more costly than claims-made ones. Sometimes, they can be more diligently to drop by, too.

There's likewise the risk that a company taking out such a policy underrates the level of damages it could cause later on down the line, driving it, thus, to pay out a piece at its personal expense.
