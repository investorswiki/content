## What Is a Cylinder?

In finance, "cylinder" is a term used to portray a transaction, or series of transactions, that don't need an initial or progressing cash investment. The term is most regularly utilized in [derivative](/derivative) transactions in forex or [options](/option) markets.

## Grasping Cylinder

With derivatives, at least two gatherings exchange the financial risks associated with various types of assets. Critically, derivative transactions don't need either party own or claim the underlying assets being referred to.

For instance, one of the biggest financial risks looked by investors is the risk of [currency fluctuations](/currencyrisk). Companies and people the same hold critical exposure to currency risk as [inventory](/inventory), [bank deposits](/bank-deposits), and financial assets designated in different currencies. They can hedge against currency changes by utilizing derivative products like [currency futures](/currencyfuture) and [forward contracts](/forwardcontract). These instruments can likewise be utilized to guess on currency developments.

A large number of these transactions don't need participants exchange cash when the contract is initiated. All things being equal, the value of the contract will vacillate in view of the shifting value of the underlying assets, and the gatherings will exchange cash toward the finish of the contract in light of the change in value of those assets.

In different cases, [premiums](/premium) will be endless supply of the contract, albeit these payments are unobtrusive compared to the total value of the contract. For example, while buying a [call option](/calloption) the investor will pay a premium to the option seller. Be that as it may, this premium is generally small compared to the value of the [underlying assets](/underlying-resource) addressed by the option.

Due to these factors, a venturesome trader could put together an investment, or a series of investments, where no initial outlay of capital is required, and in which the gains from every investment are constantly reinvested in subsequent trades. Of course, this strategy may not succeed, and the disappointment of the strategy would eventually be costly.

## Cylinder Example

An options trader wishes to develop a cylinder trade including shares in XYZ Corporation, which is right now trading for $20 per share.

To achieve this, they start by selling a [put option](/putoption) against XYZ shares. The put option has a [strike price](/strikeprice) of $10 and terminates in one year. This means that for the next year, the holder of the option has the privilege to sell [100 shares](/contractsize) of XYZ to the option seller for $10 a share. Normally, the option holder would possibly exercise this right in the event that the market price of XYZ declines below $10 plus the premium they paid. In exchange for committing to the option holder, the writer gets a $5 premium.

With this premium close by, the writer's next step is to buy a call option against XYZ shares. The option they pick has a strike price of $30 and an expiration date one year later. On the off chance that the price of XYZ shares rises above $30 plus the premium they paid, they can exercise this option, buying shares at the $30 strike price and selling them at the higher market price, subsequently getting a profit. In exchange for this right, they pay a $5 premium to the seller of this option. Since they had previously received $5 from selling the put option in advance, their net cash investment is $0.

Basically, the option trader has structured a cylinder transaction with no upfront cost to themselves and presently has a derivative position in XYZ stock without using any cash.

The trader isn't guaranteed a risk-free profit, in spite of putting up no cash upfront. All things being equal, what has really happened is that they "paid" for the XYZ position by accepting financial risk. Specifically, they assumed the liability of being responsible to buy XYZ shares at a loss on the off chance that their price declines below $10 per share. In exchange, they earned the right to buy XYZ shares at a profit on the off chance that their price rises above $30.

Obviously, an investor would possibly expect this position assuming they accept that XYZ shares are bound to rise above $30 than to decline below $10 during the time horizon of the investment. As such, they will possibly expect this position on the off chance that they are [bullish](/bull) on XYZ shares.
