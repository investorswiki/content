# Care, Custody, or Control (CCC)
## What Is Care, Custody, or Control (CCC)?

Care, custody, or control is an exclusion found in [liability insurance](/liability_insurance) policies that eliminates compensation for the insured when a property that is set in their care is harmed. The care, custody, or control (CCC) exclusion generally applies to property that isn't owned by the insured, for example, rental equipment or goods being shipped. CCC suggests that assuming an individual damages property that is in their care however isn't their property, their [insurance](/insurance) won't cover the damages.

## Figuring out Care, Custody, or Control (CCC)

Commercial general liability policies frequently contain several exclusions. Coverage commonly applies to property that is owned by the insured party, or generally specifically listed in the insurance policy language. Other property, like leased property, is much of the time left uncovered via care, custody, or control exclusions.

Whether property falls under care, custody, or control exclusions might shift on a case-by-case basis. On the off chance that a claim is documented, courts will consider current realities of the case to determine assuming the exclusion applies. The exposure that sets off the CCC exclusion is made by having another person's property in your possession. The exclusion applies to personal property, as opposed to [real property](/real-property), like structures or permanently appended fixtures. Real property is a separate thing in your liability policy.

## The Components of Care, Custody, or Control (CCC)

The exclusion applies assuming any of the three terms is true.

- **Care:** The insured is responsible for supervising the property for a specific time frame period.
- **Custody:** The insured is in charge of securely monitoring the property.
- **Control:** The insured has power over the property.

The CCC exclusion is different in each situation. There is certainly not a specific definition or guideline that would determine assuming compensation is owed or held back. Various factors in comparative situations can have various decisions by insurance companies on regardless of whether coverage applies.

## Illustration of Care, Custody, or Control (CCC)

A delivery truck driver is charged with picking up an order of apples from a plantation. This interaction requires the plantation manager to load the apples into a trailer, which he has leased for this purpose. During loading, the leased trailer is harmed by the plantation manager crashing it into the truck. The plantation manager's liability insurance provider might deny coverage in light of the fact that the trailer was harmed while under the care, custody, or control of the plantation manager.

In this case, notwithstanding, while at the same time renting the trailer, almost certainly, the plantation manager would've taken out some insurance on the trailer given by the rental business. While care, custody, or control exclusions eliminate coverage for property, other [insurance coverage](/insurance-coverage) options offer protection, like truck cargo or garage insurance.
