# Judgment Proof
## What Is Judgment Proof?

Judgment proof is a description of a not person have an adequate number of assets for a [creditor](/creditor) to seize when a court order requires debt repayment. A [debtor](/debtor) who is destitute and jobless can be viewed as judgment proof, as can a debtor who just has certain legally protected types of assets or income.

Being judgment proof, likewise called "collection proof," isn't permanent. [Judgments](/judgment) can be substantial for a long time, and creditors can keep on trying to collect what the judgment permits long after they win a lawsuit against a [delinquent](/delinquent) borrower.

## Understanding Judgment Proof

By and large, two criteria are utilized to distinguish a person as judgment proof. The first is the shortfall of legitimate [income](/income). An individual who is jobless or working a low-paying job that pays [minimum wage](/minimum_wage) and earns to the point of barely enduring may squeeze into this category.

The second is the shortfall of [assets](/resource, for example, bank accounts or real estate that can be utilized as [collateral](/collateral) by creditors. Income earned from the government, including social security, unemployment benefits, and disability, is exempt from collection by creditor agencies.

At the point when a person is considered judgment proof, creditors are unable to collect any money they owe. This status is viewed as brief until the individual can earn a legitimate income.

Most legal counselors exhort debtors not to answer [debt collectors](/debt-collector) assuming that they accept they are judgment proof. Along these lines, the company or agency responsible for recuperating money owed on delinquent accounts gets a [default judgment](/default-judgment).

> State laws decide the assets and amount of wages that can't be collected regardless of a judgment.

## Illustration of Judgment Proof

Assume a person — call him Mike — ends up being too sick to work and uses a [credit card](/creditcard) to pay his everyday costs and medical bills for a year. He recuperates from his illness and returns to work, yet he can't stand to repay the debt he accumulated. The credit card company bombs in its debt collection efforts, then offers Mike's unpaid debt to a [collection agency](/collectionagency).

The collection agency contacts Mike over and again, however he doesn't pay them anything; he's battling to hang onto his home, buy food, and keep the lights on. As a last resort, the collection agency sues Mike and gets a judgment against him for the unpaid [debt](/debt). The agency currently has a court order expecting Mike to repay a sum the still up in the air to be legitimate.

Nonetheless, in light of the fact that Mike barely earns beyond what the lowest pay permitted by law, his wages can't be [garnished](/garnishment), and in light of the fact that he resides in a state that safeguards his primary residence from creditors, the collection agency can't place a [lien](/lien) on his home. Mike has no money in the bank, and he doesn't possess a vehicle or whatever other assets that can be seized and sold to repay his debt. Mike is as of now judgment proof.

In the event that Mike's financial conditions work on next year and he begins earning fundamentally more, the collection agency could then have the option to embellish a percentage of his wages to begin recovering what it is owed. Since judgments can stay legitimate for quite a while and be restored once they terminate, creditors might have the option to collect on Mike's debt numerous years down the road.
