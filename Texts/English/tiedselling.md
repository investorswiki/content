## What Is Tied Selling?

Tied selling is the illegal practice of a company giving a product or service depending on the prerequisite that a customer purchases another product or service. It is habitually utilized in reference to banks and is some of the time alluded to as coercive tied selling.

Tied selling is likewise associated with the sales practices of product tying or [bundling](/bundling), which might be legal in certain unique situations. Tied selling may likewise be alluded to as a "tying arrangement" or a "tying agreement."

## How Tied Selling Works

Tied selling is connected with the practice of "tying," the frequently illegal arrangement where, to buy one product, the consumer must purchase one more product that exists in a separate market. Tying might be applied more extensively than tied selling, which alludes specifically to a banking practice and is a more normal term in Canada.

Tied selling in a banking setting is frequently alluded to as "coercive tied selling." Tied selling is tended to in Canada's Bank Act: "A bank will not impose undue pressure on, or constrain, a person to get a product or service from a specific person, including the bank and any of its subsidiaries, as a condition for acquiring one more product or service from the bank."

In the U.S., tying falls under the more extensive legal umbrella of illegal competition that was initially rebuked by the [Sherman Antitrust Act](/sherman-antiturst-act) and refined in later acts. Tying as a practice, as well as "tied-in" selling or "tied" products, is tended to by both the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ).

## Tied Selling versus Tying versus Bundling

Tied selling contrasts from bundling, which joins products and can bear the cost of consumers lower prices than if things were purchased independently, and particular pricing, which is better pricing in the event that a customer utilizes to a greater extent a company's goods or services. The qualification between tying (illegal) and bundling (legal inside limits) is an important one for businesses to comprehend.

It might likewise obstruct competition by giving bigger, full-service companies an edge over more modest, single-service providers or those with more limited product arrangements, for example, with [startup](/startup) companies.

With regards to bundling, tying might be beneficial to a consumer, giving discounts to bundling related products, (for example, inexpensive food value feasts that are less expensive than if their part parts were purchased separately or better rates, fees, or terms for banking products when numerous service services are utilized).

Bundling or tying may likewise offer a better support or product experience for consumers, for example, in the event that a computer manufacturer limits the utilization of a specific type of fringe hardware or software in light of the fact that aftermarket options might make errors or damage their product.
