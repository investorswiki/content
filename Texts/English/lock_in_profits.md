All potential profits are unrealized in light of the fact that the position isn't somewhat or completely closed. On the off chance that the stock moves lower, your profits will diminish, and vice versa assuming it goes higher. You might choose to lock in the profits by selling 50 shares since 50 x $36 = $1,800. Even on the off chance that the stock winds up dropping to $1, you will have still created a gain. At the end of the day, locking in profits made it conceivable to "play with house money" in the investment.
