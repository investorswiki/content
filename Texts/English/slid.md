# Student Loan Interest Deduction
## What Is the Student Loan Interest Deduction?

The term student loan interest deduction alludes to a federal income [tax deduction](/tax-deduction) that permits borrowers to subtract up to $2,500 of the interest paid on qualified student loans from their [taxable income](/taxableincome). It is one of several tax breaks accessible to students and their parents to help pay for higher education. People must meet certain qualification criteria, including filing status and income level, to fit the bill for the deduction.

## How the Student Loan Interest Deduction Works

The [Internal Revenue Service (IRS)](/irs) frames an assortment of tax deductions that permit people to reduce their taxable income for the year. One of these is the student loan interest deduction, which takes into consideration the deduction of up to $2,500 of the [interest](/interest) paid on a student loan during the tax year. So people who fall in the 22% tax bracket and claim a $2,500 deduction can reduce their federal income tax for the year by $550.

Taxpayers who wish to utilize the deduction must meet certain capabilities. For example:

- The student loan must have been taken out for the taxpayer, the taxpayer's spouse, or [dependent(s)](/dependent). Parents who assist legal borrowers with repayment can't claim the deduction.
- The loan must be taken out during a scholarly period for which the student is enrolled in some measure half-time in a program leading to a degree, certificate, or other recognized qualification.
- The loan must be utilized for [qualified higher-education expenses](/qhee) (tuition, fees, course books, supplies, and equipment) and ca exclude room and board, student wellbeing fees, insurance, and transportation.
- The loan must be utilized inside a "sensible period" after it is taken out, and the proceeds must be dispensed either in no less than 90 days before the scholarly period starts or 90 days after it closes.
- The school where the student is enrolled must be an eligible institution, including all accredited public, non-benefit, and privately owned for-benefit post-auxiliary institutions that participate in the student aid programs managed by the U.S. Department of Education.

Dissimilar to most different deductions, the student loan interest deduction is claimed as an adjustment to income on Form 1040. This means you don't need to finish up a Schedule A, which is utilized to [itemize deductions](/itemizeddeduction), to claim it.

## Special Considerations

As noted, you can deduct up to $2,500 of the interest you paid on an eligible student loan. Assuming you paid not exactly that, your deduction is [capped](/cap) at the amount you paid. On the off chance that you paid more than $600 in interest for the year, you ought to receive a Form 1098-E from the lending institution. On the off chance that you don't receive it, you can download the form straightforwardly from the IRS website.

### Income Limits for Eligibility

The student loan interest deduction is reduced or dispensed with for higher-income taxpayers. For the 2021 and 2022 tax years, the amount of your student loan interest deduction is slowly reduced or phased out if your [modified adjusted gross income (MAGI)](/magi) is somewhere in the range of $70,000 and $85,000 for single taxpayers. It's somewhere in the range of $140,000 and $170,000 in the event that you file a joint return in 2021, rising to $145,000/$175,000 in 2022. You can't claim the deduction assuming that your MAGI is over the maximum amount.

## Student Loan Interest Deduction versus Different Breaks

Students enrolled in higher education programs and their parents might be eligible for different breaks, including [tax credits](/taxcredit), notwithstanding the student loan interest deduction. Tax credits are even more important than deductions since they are subtracted from the tax you owe on a dollar-for-dollar basis as opposed to just diminishing your taxable income.

### American Opportunity Tax Credit (AOTC)

The [American Opportunity Tax Credit (AOTC)](/american-opportunity-tax-credit) permits taxpayers to receive a credit for qualified expenses paid for the higher education of an eligible student during their first four years at a post-optional institution. The total credit is capped at $2,500 per student each year. Taxpayers receive 100% of the credit for the first $2,000 spent on expenses and 25% for the next $2,000 spent on that student.

### Lifetime Learning Credit (LLC)

The [Lifetime Learning Credit (LLC)](/lifelearningcredit) furnishes students with a maximum tax credit of $2,000 per tax return for qualified tuition and school-related expenses who are enrolled in an eligible post-optional institution. This incorporates any qualified expenses used to pay for undergraduate, graduate, and courses toward a professional degree. There is no cap on the number of years that taxpayers can claim the credit.

There are three criteria that taxpayers must meet to claim the credit:

1. The taxpayer, their dependent, or another party pays for qualified higher education expenses.
1. The taxpayer, their dependent, or another party pays the expenses for an eligible student enrolled at a qualified institution.
1. The taxpayer is the student, their spouse, or a dependent listed on their [tax return](/taxreturn).

> Starting in 2021, the permissible amount of the American Opportunity Tax Credit and the Lifetime Learning Credit is phased out for single taxpayers with MAGIs more than $80,000, and more than $160,000 for joint filers.

### College Savings Plans

You can likewise get tax benefits by participating in a [529 Plan](/529plan). This type of savings plan offers tax benefits to parents as they put something aside for the education of their children. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) of 2017 expanded the rules to incorporate payment of up to $10,000 in annual tuition costs of K-12 programs at private, public, and strict schools.

The rules were expanded even further while the Setting Every Community Up for Retirement Enhancement (SECURE) Act was passed in December 2019. This act permits account holders to utilize their plans to pay for costs associated with a recipient's approved apprenticeship program and to pull out a lifetime maximum of $10,000 to apply to qualified student debt.

### Student Loan Payment Suspensions

On March 13, 2020, President Trump suspended federal student loan payments, interest-free, endlessly during the coronavirus crisis. Then, on his first day in office, Jan. 20, 2021, President Joe Biden proceeded with the respite until Sept. 30, 2021. This cutoff time has been extended on numerous occasions and is currently set to run through Aug. 31, 2022.

Keep as a top priority, however, that this doesn't influence private student loans, yet it will mean that you might not have interest payments to deduct for any federal student loans while this suspension is in effect.

> As part of the American Rescue Plan, endorsed into law on March 11, 2021, by President Biden, all forms of student loan forgiveness from January 1, 2021, for the rest of 2025, are currently tax-free.
