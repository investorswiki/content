# Financial Management Rate of Return - FMRR
## What Is Financial Management Rate of Return - FMRR?

The financial management rate of return (FMRR) is a measurement used to assess the performance of a real estate investment and relates to a [real estate investment trust](/reit) (REIT). REITs are shares offered to the public by a real estate company or trust that holds a portfolio of pay creating properties as well as mortgages.

The FMRR is like the internal rate of return and considers the length and risk of the investment. The FMRR indicates cash flows (inflows and outflows) at two distinct rates known as the safe rate and the reinvestment rate.

## The Financial Management Rate of Return Explained

Since the calculation of financial management rate of return is so complex, numerous real estate experts and investors decide to involve different metrics for real estate analysis. The benefit of utilizing FMRR is that it permits investors to compare investment opportunities on par with each other.

Albeit the [Internal Rate of Return](/irr) (IRR) has long been a standard measure of return inside the financial vocabulary, a primary drawback is the value's powerlessness to account for time or a holding period. In that capacity, it's a weak indicator of liquidity, which assumes a material part in determining the overall risk level of some random investment security or vehicle. For example, while utilizing just IRR, two funds might resemble the other the same in view of their rates of return, yet one might accept two times the length of the other to absolutely return to an original principal investment amount. Numerous analysts will supplement IRR or MIRR return measures with the payback period to evaluate the time span required to recover a principal investment sum.

The [modified internal rate of return](/mirr) enhances the standard internal rate of return value by adjusting for differences in the assumed reinvestment rates of initial cash outlays and subsequent cash inflows. FMRR makes things a stride further by indicating cash outflows and cash inflows at two distinct rates known as the "safe rate" and the "reinvestment rate." FMRR likewise makes an extra assumption excluded with IRR and MIRR that positive cash flows happening quickly prior to negative cash flows will be utilized to cover that negative cash flow.

- **Safe rates** assume that funds required to cover negative cash flows are earning interest at a rate effectively feasible and can be removed when required immediately (i.e., like from a day of deposit account). In this occurrence, a rate is "safe" on the grounds that the funds are exceptionally liquid and safely accessible with negligible risk when required.
- **Reinvestment rates** incorporate a rate to be received when positive cash flows are reinvested in a comparative intermediate or long-term investment with comparable risk. The reinvestment rate is higher than the safe rate since it isn't liquid (i.e., it relates to another investment) and in this manner requires a higher-risk discount rate.

## Working out FMRR

Since FMRR is a modified internal rate of return, there is no predictable method for working out it, rather it must be processed by emphasess of trial and blunder, made simple by computer software. Before utilizing such software, there are a few important steps that must be embraced to determine a safe rate and reinvestment rate (higher than the safe rate) to apply to all future cash flows throughout the span of a specific holding period.

1. Take out each representing things to come negative cash flows by taking a gander at the previous year's positive cash flows whenever the situation allows. Outflows are rather discounted back at the safe rate of return and deducted from any positive cash flows.
1. Discount any remaining cash outflows that might not have applied to step one to the present at the safe rate too.
1. Compound forward to the furthest limit of the holding period the excess positive cash flows at the reinvestment rate. These will then be added to the projected cash flows anticipated from a sale toward the finish of the holding period of the investment.
1. Compute the IRR.

The consequence of these steps is the financial management rate of return.
