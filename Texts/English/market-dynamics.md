Notwithstanding, the overall concept is that production, or the supply of goods and services, is most important in deciding economic growth. The supply-side theory diverges from [Keynesian theory](/keynesianeconomics), which considers that demand for products and services can drop and, in that case, the government ought to mediate with fiscal and monetary boosts.

## Dynamics of Securities Markets

Economic models and speculations endeavor to account for market dynamics such that captures whatever number pertinent variables as could be expected under the circumstances. In any case, not all variables are effectively quantifiable.

Models of markets for physical goods or services with generally direct dynamics are, generally, efficient, and participants in these markets are assumed to make [rational decisions](/rational-behavior).
