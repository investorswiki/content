## Understanding the Securities Act of 1933

The Securities Act of 1933 was the main major legislation in regards to the sale of securities. Prior to this legislation, the sales of securities were fundamentally administered by state laws. The legislation tended to the requirement for better disclosure by expecting companies to register with the [Securities and Exchange Commission](/sec) (SEC). Registration guarantees that companies furnish the SEC and expected investors with all significant data through a [prospectus](/prospectus) and registration statement.

The act — otherwise called "Reality in Securities" law, the 1933 Act, and the Federal Securities Act — expects that investors receive financial data from securities being offered for public sale. This means that prior to opening up to the world, companies need to submit data that is promptly accessible to investors.

Today, the required prospectus must be made accessible on the SEC website. A prospectus must incorporate the accompanying data:

- A description of the organization's properties and business
- A description of the security being offered
- Data about executive administration
- Financial statements that have been certified by independent bookkeepers

## Securities Exempt from SEC Registration

- Intrastate offerings
- Offerings of limited size
- Securities issued by municipal, state, and federal governments
