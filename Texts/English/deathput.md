# Death Put
## What Is Death Put?

A death put is an option added to a bond that guarantees that the heirs of a deceased bondholder can sell it back to the issuer at [par value](/parvalue). One more term for a death put is a survivor's option.

## Understanding Death Put

Issuers might incorporate a death put to make their bonds more alluring to long-term investors, however these bonds may likewise carry a lower yield since the [embedded put option](/putbond) benefits the bondholder.

Likewise with any option, the death put gives the [bondholder's](/bondholder) estate the right, yet not the obligation, to sell the bond back to the original issuer at face value in the event of the bondholder's death or legal debilitation.

A death put is like a [put option](/putoption) on a stock or other asset, in that the holder has the decision to exercise it assuming certain conditions are met. In this case, that condition is the death or the legal crippling of the bondholder. It is an optional [redemption](/redemption) feature sold with the bond permitting the [beneficiary](/beneficiary) of an estate to sell the bond back to the issuer. Proceeds from the sale become part of the estate funds.

Typically, the prices of [fixed-income](/fixedincome) debt instruments and interest rates have an inverse relationship. Fixed-income investments return intermittent, standard income. As interest rates increase, the open market price of fixed-income debt instruments will diminish. The death put is significant for the bondholder's estate when interest rates are higher than they were at the hour of original purchase. Typically, a bond's [coupon rate](/coupon-rate) is predicated on the overarching interest rates, so any changes in the market rates will significantly affect the value of the bond.

Bond issuers might incorporate the death put feature to make them more appealing to the bond buyer, albeit the holder might need to acknowledge a lower [interest rate](/interestrate) in return. These types of redemption features put a floor under the price to safeguard the bondholder. For the most part, protection from events can unfavorably affect the bond's value, as [interest rate risk](/interestraterisk), however in this case, it is protection from interest rate risk if a quite certain event — the bondholder's death — happens.

## Death Put Benefits and Caveats

The primary benefit for the bondholder is that interest rate risk at the hour of death is killed. Higher interest rates won't hurt the value of the bonds at the hour of the bondholder's death.

In the event that interest rates are lower than the coupon rate when the bondholder kicks the bucket, then, at that point, the price of the [bond](/bond) will be higher. Consequently, the estate can go into the [open market](/open-market) to sell the bonds and receive a premium over the price that was paid (par value), just likewise with any bond.

In the event that, then again, interest rates are higher than the coupon rate, then the market value of the bond will be below par. This is the point at which the estate can exercise the death put option, would it be advisable for them they decide to, to sell the bond back to the issuer at par.

Given the specific idea of the death put, the bondholder could find it hard to sell it while they are alive. The principal problem is that the [secondary market](/secondarymarket), which is where a non-normalized asset, for example, this is typically traded, will be limited.

There is another caveat: a call (or early redemption) feature could be remembered for the bond's [indenture](/indenture) contract. Early redemption permits the issuer to buy back (or call) the bond before [maturity](/maturity).

Typically, early redemption happens in light of the fact that interest rates sufficiently fell to make refinancing the debt a decent strategy. In this case, the bondholder who previously accepted a lower interest rate to begin with (buying the death put) will lose the bonds and need to reinvest the proceeds at a lower interest rate.

## Death Put Example

Expect a [investor](/investor) takes the option of having a death put on a $1,000 par value bond they purchase. The coupon rate is 3%, paid every year, and the bond develops in 20 years.

After five years, the bondholder dies. Rates on comparative bonds are currently yielding 5%, and that means the purchased bond will be worth under $1,000. This is on the grounds that individuals will sell the 3% coupon bond for buying a 5% coupon bond. The 3% coupon bond will fall in price until the return on the bond (below par), plus the coupon, equals 5%. By then, new buyers will step in to prevent the price from dropping further in light of the fact that the [yield](/yield) (coupon plus capital gain) equals 5%, which is the going rate in the market.

This is the type of situation that turns out great for the death put holder. The face value is below $1,000, yet the bond can be recovered for $1,000.

In the event that the contrary scenario happened, and the coupon rate on comparable bonds was currently 2%, the 3% bond would exchange above $1,000 on the grounds that it would be in demand for its higher coupon rate. Subsequently, the death put is of no utilization. The heirs are better off selling the bond in the open market for more than $1,000.
