# Soft Metrics
## What Are Soft Metrics?

In finance, the term "soft metrics" is utilized to portray indicators connected with the value or performance of a company which stray from traditional "hard" metrics, for example, [net profit margins](/net_margin) or [earnings per share (EPS)](/eps).

Soft metrics are regularly utilized when hard metrics are challenging to acquire. During periods of [irrational exuberance](/irrationalexuberance, for example, the [dotcom bubble](/dotcom-bubble) that happened in the last part of the 1990s, investors will frequently point to soft metrics to legitimize a company's valuation. In those occasions, the companies' valuations would normally not be justified on the basis of hard metrics.

In those scenarios, even brief change in suppositions could to a great extent affect the outcomes. Furthermore, on the grounds that the company may not be required to uncover the idea of those suspicions, investors might have no means of freely checking the reasonableness of the figures introduced.

Albeit the new raising money round was generally viewed as a triumph, one of the [venture capitalist (VC)](/vcfund) firms that partook in the absolute first round of gathering pledges was recognizably missing from the subsequent round, rather deciding to sell their position to another VC firm.

At the point when inquired as to why they decided to exit their position, the VC firm answered that they were unconvinced by the progress being guaranteed by XYZ because the company didn't give them a nitty gritty clarification for how their soft metrics were calculated. Without hard metrics to confirm XYZ's progress, the VC firm felt really awkward procedure as supporters of the firm.
