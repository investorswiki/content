# Buying on Margin
## What Is Buying on Margin?

Buying on [margin](/margin) happens when an investor buys an asset by borrowing the balance from a bank or broker. Buying on margin alludes to the initial payment made to the broker for the asset — for instance, 10% down and 90% financed. The investor involves the marginable securities in their broker account as [collateral](/collateral).

The buying power an investor has in their brokerage account mirrors the total dollar amount of purchases they can make with any margin capacity. [Short sellers](/shortselling) of stock use margin to trade shares.

## Figuring out Buying on Margin

The [Federal Reserve Board](/frb) sets the margins securities. Starting around 2019, the board requires an investor to fund no less than half of a security's purchase price with cash. The investor might borrow the leftover half from a broker or a dealer.

Similarly as with any loan, when an investor buys securities on margin, they must eventually pay back the money borrowed, plus [interest](/interest), which shifts by brokerage firm on a given loan amount. Month to month interest on the principal is charged to an investor's brokerage account.

Basically, buying on margin infers that an individual is investing with borrowed money. In spite of the fact that there are benefits, the practice is subsequently risky for the investor with limited funds.

## How Buying on Margin Works

To find out how buying on margin functions, we are turning out to improve on the interaction by taking out the month to month interest costs. In spite of the fact that interest influences returns and losses, it isn't so huge as the margin principal itself.

Consider an investor who purchases 100 shares of Company XYZ stock at $100 per share. The investor funds half the purchase price with their own money and buys the other half on margin, carrying the initial cash outlay to $5,000. After one year, the share price ascends to $200. The investor sells their shares for $20,000 and pays back the broker the $5,000 borrowed for the initial purchase.

At last, in this case, the investor significantly increases their money, making $15,000 on a $5,000 investment. In the event that the investor had purchased similar number of shares utilizing their own money, they would just have multiplied their investment from $5,000 to $10,000.

Presently, consider that as opposed to doubling following a year, the share price falls by half to $50. The investor sells at a loss and receives $5,000. Since this equals the amount owed to the broker, the investor loses 100% of their investment. In the event that the investor had not involved margin for their initial investment, the investor would in any case have lost money, however they would just have lost half of their investment — $2,500 rather than $5,000.

### The most effective method to Buy on Margin

The broker sets the base or [initial margin](/initialmargin) and the [maintenance margin](/maintenancemargin) that must exist in the account before the investor can start buying on margin. The amount depends generally on the investor's creditworthiness. A maintenance margin is required of the broker, which is a base balance that must be retained in the investor's brokerage account.

Assume an investor deposits $15,000 and the maintenance margin is half, or $7,500. On the off chance that the investor's equity dips below $7,500, the investor might receive a [margin call](/margincall). Right now, the investor is required by the broker to deposit funds to acquire the balance the account to the required maintenance margin. The investor can deposit cash or sell securities purchased with borrowed money. In the event that the investor doesn't agree, the broker might sell off the investments held by the investor to reestablish the maintenance margin.

### Who Should Buy on Margin?

Generally talking, buying on margin isn't really for amateurs. It requires a certain amount of risk tolerance and any trade utilizing margin should be closely checked. Seeing a stock [portfolio](/portfolio) lose and gain value over the long haul is in many cases unpleasant enough for individuals without the additional leverage. Besides, the high potential for loss during a stock market crash makes buying on margin especially risky for even the most experienced investors.

Notwithstanding, a few types of trading, for example, [commodity futures](/commodityfuturescontract) trading, are quite often purchased utilizing margin while different securities, for example, [options contracts](/optionscontract), have generally been purchased utilizing all cash. Buyers of options can now buy equity options and equity index options on margin, gave the option has more than nine (9) months until expiration. The initial (maintenance) margin requirement is 75% of the cost (market value) of a listed, long term equity or equity index put or call option.

For most individual investors fundamentally centered around stocks and bonds, buying on margin presents a superfluous level of risk.
