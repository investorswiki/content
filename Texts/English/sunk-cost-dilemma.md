# Sunk Cost Dilemma
## What Is the Sunk Cost Dilemma?

The Sunk Cost Dilemma is a formal economic term that portrays the emotional difficulty of choosing whether to continue with or abandon a project when time and money have been spent, yet the ideal outcomes have not been accomplished.

## Grasping the Sunk Cost Dilemma

Sunk Cost Dilemma, when endeavored to be settled, requires an evaluation of whether further investment would just be squandering valuable resources. The simply rational economic person would think about just the variable costs, yet a great many people irrationally factor the sunk costs into our decisions. The Sunk Cost Dilemma is additionally called the Concorde Fallacy.

Sunk costs are expenditures that can't be recuperated. For instance, in the event that you conclude part of the way through putting in new hardwood flooring in your home that you disdain the manner in which it looks, you have a sunk cost. You can't return the ground surface that is as of now been set down. The dilemma is whether to introduce the remainder of the deck and hope you figure out how to love it since you disdain the possibility of losing the money you've proactively spent, or whether to acknowledge the sunk cost, tear up the new wood floors and buy one more type of ground surface.

Sunk costs can happen both in the past and later on. Suppose you buy something from the store. The store receipt shows the [refund](/refund) period or the number of days you need to change your psyche and make a return and get your money back. This period is known as the retrievable cost since you actually have time the recover your money from the store. Assuming that you've passed that period — some might give you upwards of 90 days to have the money in question returned — then, at that point, you will be unable to have the money in question returned, bringing about a sunk cost.

Yet, how does a sunk cost connect with a situation in the future when you haven't spent the money yet? That is simple. Consider post-paid cell telephone, or cable and Internet services. At the point when you join, you'll most likely be under a contract to lock in your month to month rate. A large portion of these companies demand a base investment for you to remain with the service, mostly to keep you from escaping to an offer contender you a [better deal](/cutthroat valuing) later on. On the off chance that you move or choose to cancel your service before your contract is up, you might need to pay out the remainder of your contract. This money is called a sunk cost.

## Sunk Cost Dilemma and Rationality

We should investigate how the Sunk Cost Dilemma functions and how it connects with rational reasoning. The Sunk Cost Dilemma puts individuals at a junction. The dilemma happen when you consider the money you've spent, as well as money that will be spent from here on out. It's not monetarily prudent to walk away from something in light of the money you've put into the decision, however you additionally can't walk away on the grounds that doing so will cost you more money also.

Suppose a homeowner chooses to do renovations on his home. The contractor does a walk-through with the owner, examines the project requirements, and provides a total construction cost estimate of $100,000 to complete the job. The renovations will require six months to complete. The two players concur, and the homeowner puts down 25%, or $25,000.

After the second month of work, the contractor tracks down a problem with the foundation, and tells the homeowner he should increase the original price by another $30,000. The homeowner presently faces the dilemma of walking away from the job and losing the $25,000 he's as of now spent, or spend the extra $30,000 — on top of the leftover $75,000 — to complete the job.

There are two variables at play here. The homeowner can't be guaranteed to discount the sunk costs, which will in general be a rational point of view. Doing so means he falls into the Sunk Cost Dilemma. Yet, in the event that he decides to disregard the sunk costs, he falls into the [sunk cost trap](/sunk-cost-trap) or the sunk cost fallacy. This happens when he pursues an irrational choice, one made disregarding the money he's as of now spent.

## Illustration of Sunk Cost Dilemma

Thomas Edison, the designer of the light, was finding it challenging to cut out a market for his electric lights during the 1880s. Thus, his manufacturing plant was not operating at full capacity and the cost to deliver an electric light was costly.

Rather than abandoning his product for another line or strategy, Edison chose to double down on them. He increase his manufacturing to full capacity to zero in on volume. Expanding his manufacturing capacity added 2% to Edison's operational costs while permitting him to increase production by 25%.

The recently made lights were sold in Europe for a cost that was fundamentally higher than the manufacturing cost. His sunk costs in manufacturing enabled Edison to increase manufacturing output rapidly. Yet, he went with a rational choice to seek after a future course of action, independent of the sunk costs and no matter what the way that his electric lights were struggling in the US market.
