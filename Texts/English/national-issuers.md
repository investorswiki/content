## What Are National Issuers?

The term "national issuer" alludes to financial institutions that offer credit cards on a national scale, like American Express (AXP), Citigroup (C), and Discover Financial Services (DFS). However national issuers normally offer a more modest assortment of credit card programs, their [loyalty programs](/loyalty-program) will generally be advanced.

Then again, more modest issuers, for example, regional banks typically offer a more extensive assortment of cards yet with less enrollment incentives.

## Grasping National Issuers

National issuers are generally household names with laid out [brand equity](/brandequity). The [annual percentage rates](/apr) (APRs) that national issuers offer will quite often be genuinely normalized. Hence, customers who shop around might have the option to track down better arrangements among more modest regional issuers.

Where the national issuers partake in an advantage is in their cardholder reward programs. Since these programs depend on partnerships with large participating organizations, national issuers can leverage their scale and brand awareness to offer appealing benefits their more modest adversaries can rarely match. In like manner, competition among national issuers will in general zero in on loyalty programs, as opposed to financial terms, for example, [minimum regularly scheduled payments](/least regularly scheduled installment) or APRs.

One more important difference among national and regional issuers connects with [cross-collateralization](/cross-collateralization). It is common for regional issuers to require the collateral associated with a customer's different loans to be utilized to secure their credit card debt too.

For instance, in the event that a customer has a vehicle loan and credit card with a similar regional issuer, the issuer could require the card to act as [collateral](/collateral) for both the car loan and credit card. If the cardholder [defaults](/default2) on either, their vehicle could be repossessed to cover the outstanding balance. National issuers, then again, don't will generally require cross-collateralization of credit lines.

## Illustration of a National Issuer

Emma is investigating potential credit card suppliers. She sees a large number of the most well known credit card issuers market their products cross country, though regional banks and credit unions market their cards in their own lawns.

In concluding what sort of credit card to pick, Emma's priority is to get the most reduced conceivable APR while additionally keeping away from account fees and different charges whenever the situation allows. She is less interested in advantages, for example, cash-back programs and enrollment rewards.

Since the national issuers will generally contend on the basis of enrollment rewards rather than alluring APRs and different terms, Emma settles on a more modest regional issuer offering the most reduced available [interest rate](/interestrate) and fees.
