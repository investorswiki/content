# Cipher
In [cryptography](/cryptography), a cipher is a series of defined directions that one can follow to encode or decode an instant message. The course of [encryption](/encryption) comprises of changing over clear information into a muddled or blocked off rendition. The original text that can be obviously perceived is known as plaintext, while its scrambled form is called ciphertext. The two texts contain a similar information, the main difference is that the ciphertext is written in a format that must be perused or gotten to by the ones that have the right [decryption](/decryption) mechanism.
Most cipher calculations include the utilization of a specific piece of secret information, which is ordinarily alluded to as a cryptographic key. The encryption scheme differs as indicated by the key model, and ciphers calculations can be defined as symmetric or asymmetric. Symmetric ciphers utilize just a single key for both encryption and decryption, while asymmetric ciphers utilize different keys for every operation.
Albeit most modern encryption techniques are finished by PCs, ciphers were at that point being utilized to encode messages since before the antiquated Greeks, around 400 BC. The notable Roman lawmaker Julius Caesar utilized substitution ciphers, supplanting each letter in a message with the letter that was found three places further down the alphabet.
For example, assuming we utilize a similar technique to encode the word BINANCE, the subsequent ciphertext would be ELQDQFH. This message looks futile to an outsider yet can be handily decoded by the planned beneficiary since he definitely realizes the shift number employed by the source to encode it.
