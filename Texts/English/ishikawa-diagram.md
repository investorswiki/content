# Ishikawa Diagram
## What Is an Ishikawa Diagram?

An Ishikawa diagram is a diagram that shows the reasons for an event and is in many cases utilized in manufacturing and product development to frame the various strides in a cycle, exhibit where [quality control](/quality-control) issues could emerge, and figure out which resources are required at specific times.

The Ishikawa diagram was developed by Kaoru Ishikawa during the 1960s as an approach to measuring quality control processes in the shipbuilding industry.

## Figuring out Ishikawa Diagrams

Ishikawa diagrams are sometimes alluded to as fish bone diagrams, herringbone diagrams, circumstances and logical results diagrams, or Fishikawa. They are causal diagrams made by Kaoru Ishikawa to show the reasons for a specific event. They look like a fish skeleton, with the "ribs" addressing the reasons for an event and the ultimate result showing up at the head of the skeleton. The purpose of the Ishikawa diagram is to permit management to figure out which issues must be addressed to gain or stay away from a specific event.

Other common purposes of the Ishikawa diagram incorporate involving it as a methodology for making product designs that tackle viable problems. It can likewise be utilized in quality deformity prevention to distinguish potential factors causing an overall effect. Each reason or justification behind flaw is a source of variation. Makes are generally grouped into major categories distinguish and characterize these sources of variation.

## Cycle to Make an Ishikawa Diagram

To make an Ishikawa Diagram, a group will require a white board, flip chart, and some checking pens.

1. The group ought to settle on a problem statement (effect).
1. Compose the problem statement at the middle right of the flipchart or whiteboard, box it, and draw a horizontal arrow running to it.
1. Conceptualize the essential categories of foundations for the problem. For example, it could appear to be legit to begin with these generic headings: methods, machines (equipment), individuals (labor), materials, measurement, and environment.
1. Compose the categories of causes as branches from the fundamental arrow.
1. Conceptualize potential causes. Ask: "For what reason does this occur?" As every thought is given, the facilitator composes it as a branch from the suitable category. Causes can be written in several spots, in the event that they connect with several categories.
1. Ask the inquiry "for what reason does this occur?" again. Compose sub-causes branching off the causes. Keep on asking "Why?" and create further levels of causes. Layers of branches show causal connections.
1. At the point when the group runs out of thoughts, center thoughtfulness regarding areas in the chart where thoughts are thin.

## Features
- An Ishikawa diagram is utilized to show the causal factors that go into some ultimate result, frequently connected with a production or design problem.
- Formed fairly like a fish, these charts are sometimes called 'Fishikawa' diagrams.
- Ishikawa diagrams follow a series of eight moves toward build.
