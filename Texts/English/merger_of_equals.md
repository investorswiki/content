# Merger of Equals
## What Is a Merger of Equals?

A merger of equals is when two firms of about a similar size meet up to form a single new company. In a [merger](/merger) of equals, shareholders from the two firms surrender their shares and receive securities issued by the new company. Companies might converge to gain [market share](/marketshare) or venture into new fragments of their existing market. Normally, a merger of equals will increase shareholder value.

## Understanding a Merger of Equals

At the point when two companies choose to consolidate in a merger of equals, they do as such to work on the standing of both of their businesses. A merger of equals brings about a reduction of costs, the creation of [synergies](/collaboration), and a reduction in competition, as the two companies are done vieing for a similar market share.

Frequently it is challenging to make a merger of equals, as two companies are not really equivalent. One is in every case better positioned than the other. Be that as it may, there are critical legal and technical processes to assist with making a merger of equals.

Typically, the [board of directors](/boardofdirectors) of the new company comprises similarly of individuals from every individual company. There is likewise an agreement on power-dividing among the two executives. The merger is structured as a "stock-for-stock tax-free exchange," where [shareholders](/shareholder) keep a similar ownership. The most troublesome part of a merger of equals, or any merger, is attempting to join two unique corporate cultures into one.

## Change in a Merger of Equals

As consolidating two unique [corporate cultures](/corporate-culture) is a troublesome task, at the beginning, the two companies need to characterize the different jobs, qualities, and shortcomings of the two companies that will become possibly the most important factor in the new entity. Executive jobs should be plainly expressed; who will lead the firm, who will lead certain divisions, and the obligations these jobs will involve. This has frequently been troublesome in mergers of equals, as self image, loyalty, and corporate politics become possibly the most important factor. For a fruitful merger, feelings and wants should be put as a second thought while truth and logic jump in the driver's seat to improve all interested parties.

It's important to settle on these momentary choices rapidly, to abstain from blocking business operations, the dialing back of sales, and some other adverse impacts an impasse could have.

## Characterizing the New Entity

Joining two unique cultures is a critical test. Leaders must rethink the company by zeroing in on social qualities that adjust. Culture is quite possibly of the main component that can doom a deal, and getting right is hard.

The perfect model is that of the merger among AOL and Time Warner that made AOL Time Warner. The new company combined the culture of AOL, which was youthful and part of the [dotcom](/dotcom) boom, while Time Warner was more established, bigger, and a traditional media company. The cultures conflicted and AOL Time Warner was eventually split.

When a merger closes, employees are many times left in the dark with regards to how the new company will continue or on the other hand in the event that their positions are in peril due to any redundancies that could lead to [layoffs](/cutback). Leadership genuinely should characterize the purpose of the new company, its bearing proceeding, the qualities and benefits of the merger, and what this will emphatically mean for employees. However it is important to keep employees excited, it's likewise important to be honest to them and deal with their expectations.

## A Merger of Equals versus an Acquisition

A merger of equals isn't the most reliable definition of a merger. Most merger activity, even [friendly takeovers](/friendly-takeover), sees one company procure another. At the point when one company is an acquirer, it is appropriate to call the transaction a [acquisition](/acquisition). Since one company is the purchaser and the other is available to be purchased, such a transaction can't be seen as a merger of equals.

Acquisitions can be friendly — where the target business consents to the takeover — or might be forced against the desire of the target company, known as a [hostile takeover](/hostiletakeover). When one entity holds over half of the target firm's shares and assets, they can gain control of the heading of the business.

For instance, the creation of DaimlerChrysler saw both Daimler-Benz and Chrysler end individual operations and form one company, DaimlerChrysler. At the time it was introduced as a merger of equals on the grounds that another company was formed. In any case, just two years after the fact, J\u00fcrgen Shrempp, CEO of Daimler-Benz, had forced out Robert Eaton, the CEO of Chrysler. Also, Daimler-Benz had bought 80% of Chrysler in the merger. Eaton would later agree that that the term "merger of equals" was utilized for "psychological reasons" to make the deal appealing to Chrysler and it was actually an acquisition. The two companies isolated a couple of years after the fact.
