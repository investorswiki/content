# Economic Growth Rate
## What Is an Economic Growth Rate?

An economic growth rate is the percentage change in the value of the goods in general and services delivered in a nation during a specific period of time, as compared to a prior period. The economic growth rate is utilized to measure the comparative strength of an economy after some time. The numbers are generally aggregated and reported quarterly and annually.

As a rule, the economic growth rate measures the change in a nation's [gross domestic product](/gdp) (GDP). In nations with economies that are vigorously dependant on foreign earnings, [gross national product](/gnp) (GNP) might be utilized. The last option considers net income from foreign investments.

The formula above shows how an economic growth rate is calculated.

At the point when it is followed after some time, the economic growth rate proposes the overall heading of a nation's economy and the size of its growth (or contraction). It likewise might be utilized to project the economic growth rate for the quarter or the year ahead.

An increase in the economic growth rate is generally viewed as a positive. On the off chance that an economy shows two successive quarters of negative growth rates, the nation is formally in a [recession](/recession). To put it baldly, assuming that an economy contracts by 2% from the previous year, its overall population has encountered a reduction in income of 2% in that year.

In the U.S., GDP started filling in March 2009 as it arose out of the Great Recession. From a horrifying rate of more than - 4%, it climbed consistently until it topped in 2014 at a rate of almost 6% growth. In 2018, it was 2.9%, up from 2.2% for the previous year.

The U.S. numbers are calculated by the federal Bureau of Economic Analysis ([BEA](/bea)), which reports GDP on a quarterly basis and incorporates the economic growth rate as a title figure.

### Why Economies Expand or Contract

Economic growth can be supported by a number of factors and occasions. Most generally, increases in demand for products lead to relating increases in production. The net outcome is more income.

Innovative advances and new product improvements can apply positive impacts on economic growth. Increases in demand from foreign markets can lead to higher export sales.

In all of these cases, the convergence of income, assuming that adequately big, causes an increase in the economic growth rate.

An economic contraction is a mirror picture. Consumers pull back on spending, so demand falls and production falls with it. In the most dire outcome imaginable, the effects snowball. As production falls, positions are lost. Demand falls further. GDP for the quarter comes in at a negative number.

## Instances of Economic Growth Rates

In July 2019, the U.S. denoted an economic achievement. Its economy had been encountering growth persistently since June 2009, making it the longest economic expansion in the nation's history.

On the other hand, the economic growth rate of India tumbled to 5.8% In the primary quarter of 2019, the most minimal growth rate in five years. Given the nation's quick growth in recent years, there was a lot of hand-wringing over a serious slump in industrial output and a tumble off in vehicle sales, the two factors in the lower rate.

Nonetheless, government market analysts have raised the projected growth for the full fiscal year that started March 31 to 7%, compared to the previous annual growth of 6.8%. The government of India plans to support the economy with tax incentives and new investment.
