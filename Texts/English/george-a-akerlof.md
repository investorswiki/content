## The Market for Lemons

George A. Akerlof presented his theory of markets under asymmetric data in his paper, **The Market for Lemons, Quality Uncertainty and the Market Mechanism**, distributed in 1970.

Asymmetric data exists when one party in an economic transaction has more data than the other. **The Market for Lemons** refers to the case of a trade-in vehicle purchase where the seller has more data than the buyer in a market of both great cars and "[lemons](/lemons-issue)."

Akerlof claims that when a buyer can't recognize the top notch vehicle and the "lemon," the buyer becomes reluctant to pay the genuine value of the better vehicle offered available to be purchased. Due to limited data, the buyer expects that the better vehicle is likewise of lower quality and the buyer will thus offer a lower price for even an excellent vehicle.

This makes all of the vehicle prices fall, and makes a market of just lower-priced "lemons." This unreasonably powers sellers of new or top notch cars to demonstrate their product's unwavering quality, frequently through policies like guarantees.
