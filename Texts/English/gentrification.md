In the United Kingdom, the term "landed upper class" originally depicted landowners who could live off of the [rental income from their properties](/income_property). In its current setting, gentrification was first advocated by the British humanist Ruth Glass in 1964, when she utilized the term to depict the flood of working class individuals into London's average areas, uprooting the former occupants of those territories.

Various urban communities around the world experience the phenomenon of gentrification, which can straightforwardly affect housing market dynamics. In most major urban areas, a few areas that were previously not exactly alluring have transformed into energetic locale with extravagant townhouses and offices, new coffee shops and caf\u00e9s, costly retail customer facing facades, and different diversion decisions.

Dislodging frequently prompts exclusion of the original inhabitants, especially ethnic minorities, and a lack of government support — for low-income housing assistance, for instance — as well as debilitated social and community ties.

> One method for combatting pricing individuals out of affordable housing, a form of housing discrimination, is a community land trust (CLT).
