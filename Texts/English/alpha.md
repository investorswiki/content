## What Is Alpha?
The principal letter in the Greek alphabet, alpha (\u03b1), has come to connote something of primary or critical significance. In finance, an investment with high alpha is one that has surpassed its benchmark in terms of returns.
Alpha is a risk ratio that measures how well a [security](/security, for example, a[ ](/security)[mutual fund](/mutualfund) or even a [stock](/commonstock), has performed relative to a[ market index](/marketindex, for example, the[ S&P 500](/sp500). Alpha is paired with[ beta (\u03b2)](/beta), the second letter of the Greek alphabet, which measures an asset's[ volatility](/volatility).
In actively managed mutual funds and [ETFs](/indexfund), alpha is seen as an indicator of fund manager performance. A positive alpha demonstrates that the fund has performed better than its benchmark, while a negative alpha shows that the fund has failed to meet expectations. It's additionally important to note that alpha is measured after management fees (e.g., [expense ratios](/expense-ratio)) are taken out.
The concept of alpha originated from the presentation of weighted index funds; alpha was made as a method for contrasting active investing and passive index investing.
## Illustration of Alpha
Alpha is communicated in numeric terms: The higher the alpha number is, the better. For instance, a fund with an alpha of 5 means it outperformed the market by 5%. Assuming the fund had an alpha of - 2, that would mean it failed to meet expectations its benchmark by 2%. An alpha of zero means that its performance matched its benchmark.
## How Do I Use Alpha? How Can It Work?
Alpha is a historical measurement — it isn't forward-looking. Generally, alpha is based on[ earnings-per-share](/essential earnings-per-share) growth. On account of mutual funds, alpha is determined by ascertaining the excess returns from the weighted average of the stocks in the fund.
## Why Is Alpha Important?
Alpha is important in light of the fact that the point of investing is to generate a positive return — commonly one that is greater than the rate of [inflation](/inflation) or the performance of the market overall. And keeping in mind that the long-term trend for the market is up, there are many funds that generate a lot higher returns than the market indexes. Investors ought to consider how much risk they will take to get that reward, and one method for estimating that is through alpha.

## How Do I Calculate Alpha?
To compute a fund's alpha, utilize the following equation:
Alpha = (R - R~f~) - Beta * (R~m~ - R~f~)
Where:
- **R** is the portfolio's return.
- **Rf** is the risk-free rate of return.
- **Rm** is the return of the market or a benchmark index.
- **Beta** is the risk of the portfolio.

We should compute the alpha of a mutual fund. We will expect that the genuine return of the fund is 20, the risk-free rate of return is 5%, its beta is 1.1, and the benchmark index return is 20%.
Its alpha would be:
Alpha = (R - R~f~) - Beta * (R~m~ - R~f~)
Alpha = (0.20 - 0.05) - 1.1 (0.20 - 0.08)
Alpha = 0.018 or 1.8%
The mutual fund outperformed its benchmark index by 1.8%, so it has an alpha of 1.8.
## How Does Alpha Work with Beta? What Is Considered "Great" Alpha?
The calculation of alpha incorporates the measurement of beta. All in all, it's possible that alpha **depends** on beta, truth be told. Since alpha is determined by both risk and performance, two funds could have similar returns yet really have altogether different alphas due to their contrasting betas.
Most investors would prefer to have a fund with a high alpha and a low beta since that means it has market-beating returns with relatively little risk.However, aggressive investors could see the value in a higher beta in light of the fact that their investment strategy capitalizes on volatility.
More conservative investors would dislike funds with a high alpha and a high beta; for example, in the event that they are moving toward retirement and realize they need to pull out funds — they would have zero desire to do that when there's a ton of volatility.
Thus, "great alpha" all relies upon your risk tolerance.
## Is a Negative Alpha Bad?
Not generally. For example, in 2020, a fund could have had a high alpha in light of the fact that its manager "lucked out" and weighted it vigorously in shares of Tesla when the stock soar 700%. Simultaneously, a fund's underperformance may be due more to soak management fees than inferior stock picking. Alpha isn't long-lasting; a high alpha today could turn into a low alpha next earnings season, and vice versa.
## What Are Some Other Statistical Measurements Used to Calculate Returns?
Alpha and beta spread the word about up a pricing viewpoint as the **capital asset pricing model**, which is one part of a 20th-century investment theory known as **modern portfolio theory (MPT)**. The goal of MPT was to distinguish and collect a diversified mix of investments to outperform, or expand market returns, while facing low or negligible risk.
And keeping in mind that alpha and beta are great measures of fund performance, there are other technical indicators that investors can benefit from surveying too. [Correlation](/correlationcoefficient) measures the strength and bearing of a fund with its benchmark. [Standard deviation](/standarddeviation) measures the variability of a fund's return throughout some stretch of time. These metrics are a part of the [fundamental](/fundamentals) analysis of a company, which should be visible to exploring its financial statements.
Inspecting various metrics can give a more all encompassing image of an investment vehicle. All things considered, a very much educated investor is a beneficial investor.

## Highlights
- Active portfolio managers look to generate alpha in diversified portfolios, with diversification expected to take out unsystematic risk.
- Since alpha addresses the performance of a portfolio relative to a benchmark, it is frequently considered to address the value that a portfolio manager adds to or deducts from a fund's return.
- Alpha alludes to excess returns earned on an investment over the benchmark return.
- [Jensen's alpha](/jensensmeasure) thinks about the capital asset pricing model (CAPM) and incorporates a risk-adjusted part in its calculation.
