# Brand Loyalty

As Harvard Business Review (HBR) has reported, companies with high scores on two often-ignored (and closely related) [market research](/market-research) metrics — brand loyalty and customer loyalty — not just develop [revenues](/revenue) 2.5 times quicker than industry peers, yet in addition deliver two to five times the [returns](/get back) to shareholders throughout 10-year time spans. The way that brand loyalty — a long-term commitment to make repeat purchases of a specific brand — isn't dependent on price makes this metric an especially powerful driver of both profit and profitability (i.e., profit relative to expenses).

The primary explanation that brand loyalty is so important to profitability is direct: 65% of revenue in many companies comes from repeat business with existing clients. Not in the least do existing customers faithful to brands purchase 90% more oftentimes than new customers, yet keeping up with the brand-steadfast segment is likewise undeniably more affordable than marketing to draw in new customers.

In the wake of diving sales during the 2020 pandemic, it is a higher priority than any time in recent memory for businesses in each industry to increase investment in marketing programs designed to hold each company's most significant asset: their existing, brand-faithful customer base.

Brand-steadfast customers accept that a certain brand addresses both higher quality and better service than any contender — and the price doesn't make any difference. Brand-faithful customers could make less total purchases, however the profit edges on their purchases are larger. Once settled, brand loyalty is genuinely simple to hold — expecting, of course, that product quality and service level stay high.

Then again, companies that reliably deliver best-in-class quality will change over customers into brand-faithful promoters who spread positive word-of-mouth and never feel the need to shop somewhere else.

**Customer Service:** Exceptional customer service is costly — day in and day out talk reps, social-media managers, telephone administrators, support-ticket staff — yet guaranteeing that customers generally receive five star service is an investment that drives the level of brand loyalty that generates big returns. As a matter of fact, in a crowded market, top notch service that causes customers to feel valued may be the main thing that separates a brand from its rivals. For customer service to expand brand loyalty, customers must approach easy to understand systems to submit feedback and register objections — and a dedicated team of partners ought to be prepared to immediately address their entries.

Past this, the best brand ministers are additionally skilled at gathering the critical customer and contender intelligence that can convert into profitable business improvements.

**Loyalty Programs:** Establishing a program to reward existing customers for their business is one of the most direct ways of building brand loyalty. It is worth repeating that — regardless of how costly the recoveries for store credits, discounts, and free products are — putting resources into the retention and loyalty of existing customers is undeniably more affordable than marketing for new customers. This is particularly true for premium-priced brands, on the grounds that an exclusive discount for loyalty-program individuals can be just the right incentive to pick the pricey brand over a more affordable option.

**Online Community:** As internet business keeps on speeding up — U.S. online spend for 2022 is expected to hit $1 trillion — building an online community to drive brand loyalty is essential for businesses across industries. Dissimilar to static commercials, social media has a scope of instruments to fashion further, more personal associations with customers, from facilitating Q&As and live streams with employees to taking customers on in the background voyages through the business. Besides the fact that a digital community fills in as a simple access point to communicate with customers who spend hours online, however — as an extension of the site — a community can likewise act as a bridge from social collaboration to purchase conversion.

## Brand-Loyalty Leaders

The following are two instances of companies who have made highly profitable investments in brand loyalty by focusing on quality and customer service. Not exclusively could these brand-loyalty leaders at any point charge something else for their products, however they likewise save money on marketing costs — social media and email marketing to existing customers is a small part of the cost of drawing in new customers.

**Apple:** In 2021, Apple had an outstanding brand loyalty score of 92% — the tech goliath retained a higher percentage of existing clients than some other company in any industry. Apple's status as the world's most important brand is based not just on progressive technology and cutting edge design yet additionally on unmatched brand power and stellar customer service. Any individual who has at any point seen a line of customers wrapping around an Apple store in anticipation of the most recent release comprehends that brand power influences the true value of a product as much as — or more than — some other driver of market performance. As Apple carries out fee-based services, including Apple TV and gaming, the company is probably going to add to even more [share of wallet](/share-of-wallet) (SOW) — the dollar amount a customer spends on one company's brand to the detriment of contenders.

**Nike:** One of the main reasons that Nike is the most significant games brand in the world is an industry-driving participation program that delivers four drivers of brand loyalty: 1) restrictiveness (access to exclusive advantages: tickets and product dispatches); 2) community (free workout classes, training support); personalization (birthday and anniversary gifts, personalized product suggestions); 4) omnichannel experience (in-store, nearby, mobile app).

## Statistics on Brand Loyalty and Profitability

The correlation between brand loyalty and profitability has been irrefutable for a really long time. The following are a couple of noteworthy statistics:

**Customer Retention:** In 2020, Harvard Business School reported that — "in many industries" — expanding customer retention rates by 5% increases profits by no less than 25% and up to 95% — a statistic that "set off a race to create retention strategies, a considerable lot of which keep on paying large dividends."

## Brand Loyalty: Customer Capitalism versus Shareholder Primacy

One could ask — assuming the association among profitability and customer metrics like brand loyalty is so deeply grounded — for what reason do businesses often neglect their most important customers? The Harvard Business Review (HBR) proposes a couple of intriguing solutions to that inquiry: financial accounting and shareholder power.

The HBR article contends that, on the grounds that financial disclosure rules and corporate accounting rehearses require practically no reporting on customer value, a short-term mentality that focuses on quarterly earnings over customer relationships has dazed both management and shareholders to the vital job that loyalty plays in profitability. Compounding the financial reporting omissions, two altogether different profitability strategies — shareholder supremacy versus customer capitalism — have impacted how customer metrics like brand loyalty are positioned as profit drivers.

On one side, during the 1950s, Peter Drucker, who was called "the dad of business counseling" by Forbes and "the best management scholar of the last 100 years" by GE Chair [Jack Welch](/jack-welch), said that "the true purpose of a business is to make and keep customers." On the opposite side, during the 1970s, [Milton Friedman](/milton-friedman) said that companies exist to expand shareholder value — period — a contention that HBR said presented "the age of shareholder power."

Current disciples of the "customer capitalism" approach contend that companies that put customers — not shareholders — first can make even greater value for shareholders. For instance, in 2019, the New York Times reported that CEOs from the Business Roundtable — including power players like Tim Cook of Apple, Jeff Bezos of Amazon, Mary Barra of General Motors, Robert F. Smith of Vista Equity Partners, and Larry Fink of BlackRock — broke with many years of corporate universality by giving a statement that "the purpose of an enterprise" is no longer to advance just the interests of shareholders. All things being equal, companies must now deliver value on several new fronts: both directly to customers and indirectly by supporting customer values on issues like protecting the environment and dealing morally with providers.
