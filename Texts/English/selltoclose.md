# Sell to Close
## What Is Sell from Close's perspective?

Sell to close demonstrates that a [options](/option) order is being put to exit a trade. The trader as of now claims the options contract and by selling the contract will [close the position](/closeposition).

Sell to close is employed to close a long position initially settled with a [buy to open](/buytoopen) order and can measure up to [buy to close](/buytoclose) and [sell to open](/selltoopen) orders. It is likewise utilized, yet once in a while, in equity and fixed-income trading to show a sale that closes an existing long position.

## Understanding Sell to Close

Sell to close alludes to the action of [closing out](/close) the position by selling the contract. In options trading, both short and [long positions](/long) are taken through contracts that are purchased. When a contract is owned by a trader, it must be managed in three ways:

1. The option is [out of the money](/outofthemoney) (OTM) and terminates worthless;
1. The option is [in the money](/inthemoney) (ITM) and can be practiced to trade for the underlying or settle for the distinction; or
1. The option can be sold to close the position. A sell to close order might be made with the option ITM, OTM, or even [at the money](/atthemoney) (ATM).

Traders will typically sell to close [call options](/calloption) contracts they own when they never again need to hold a long bullish position on the underlying asset. They sell to close [put options](/putoption) contracts they own when they never again need to hold a long bearish position on the underlying asset.

## Instance of Selling to Close

We should expect a trader is long an exchange-traded option utilizing a buy to open order on a call option on Company A. Envision that, at that point, the stock was priced at $175.00. We should likewise expect that the $170.00 [strike](/strikeprice) call, with a [expiration date](/expirationdate) 90 days away, was selling for $7.50 per share. This gives the option $5.00 of intrinsic value ($175.00 stock price - $170.00 strike price = $5.00 intrinsic value) and $2.50 of extrinsic value ($7.50 option premium - $5.00 intrinsic value = $2.50 extrinsic value).

As time passes by and the value of Company A changes all over, the value of the call option will vary too. The higher the value of the call option goes, the more profitable it will turn into. On the other hand, the lower the value of the call option goes, the less profitable it will turn into. Notwithstanding, those profits, or losses, may be realized once the [trader](/trader) exits the position utilizing a sell to close order.

There are three potential results when a trader sells to close a long option.

### Model: Sell to Close for a Profit

If the price of the [underlying asset](/underlying-asset) increases all that could possibly be needed to offset the [time decay](/timedecay) the option will experience (the closer it gets to expiration) then the value of the call option will likewise increase. In this case, a trader can sell to close the long call option for a profit.

We should expect in this scenario that Company An ascents from $175.00 to $180.00 by expiration, expanding the value of the call option from $7.50 to $10.00. This option is currently contained $10.00 of [intrinsic value](/intrinsicvalue) ($180.00 stock price - $170.00 strike price = $10.00 intrinsic value) and $0.00 of [extrinsic value](/extrinsicvalue) (options have no extrinsic value at expiration). The trader can now sell to close the long call option position for a profit of $2.50 ($10.00 current value - $7.50 purchase price = $2.50 profit).

### Model: Sell to Close at Break-Even

In the event that the price of the underlying asset increases the right amount to offset the time decay the option will experience then the value of the call option will stay unchanged. In this case, a trader can sell to close the long call option at [break-even](/breakeven-price).

We should expect in this scenario that Company An ascents from $175.00 to $177.50 by expiration, keeping the value of the call option at $7.50. This value is involved $7.50 of intrinsic value ($177.50 stock price - $170.00 strike price = $7.50 intrinsic value) and $0.00 of extrinsic value. The trader can now sell to close the long call option position at break-even ($7.50 current value - $7.50 purchase price = $0.00 profit).

### Model: Sell to Close for a Loss

On the off chance that the price of the underlying asset doesn't increase to the point of offsetting the time decay the option will experience, then the value of the call option will decline. In this case, a trader can sell to close the long call option at a loss.

We should expect in this scenario that Company A main ascents from $175.00 to $176.00 by expiration, dropping the value of the call option to $6.00. This value is involved $6.00 of intrinsic value ($176.00 stock price - $170.00 strike price = $6.00 intrinsic value) and $0.00 of extrinsic value. The trader can now just sell to close the long call option position at a loss of $1.50 ($6.00 current value - $7.50 purchase price = $1.50 loss).
