# Fungibility
An asset is viewed as fungible when its units are compatible with each other, it are vague to mean they. At the end of the day, an asset class is fungible when every unit of the asset has a similar legitimacy and market value. For instance, a pound of pure gold is equivalent to some other pound of pure gold, no matter what the shape. Different instances of fungible asset classes might incorporate commodities, fiat currencies, bonds, precious metals, and cryptocurrencies.
In any case, an equivalent exchange of a fungible asset doesn't be guaranteed to mean trading of two indistinguishable units. However long the transaction occurs between instruments of the very kind and that share a similar usefulness, it tends to be considered as an equivalent exchange. For example, a five-dollar bill can be exchanged with five one-dollar bills, yet they have a similar legitimacy. In this model, the US dollar is the fungible asset, while the bills only address their underlying value.
As a general rule, most [cryptocurrencies](/cryptographic money) are viewed as fungible assets. For instance, we might consider Bitcoin fungible in light of the fact that every unit of BTC is equivalent to some other unit, meaning they have a similar quality and usefulness. So it doesn't exactly make any difference in which [block](/block) the coins were issued (mined), all Bitcoin units are part of the equivalent blockchain and have a similar usefulness. Note that assuming that somebody forks the blockchain and make another Bitcoin, those coins won't be viewed as original as they would be part of another network.
It has been directed out that due toward the inherent traceability of BTC and comparable cryptocurrencies, a few coins may be less alluring than others - particularly in the event that they have been recently utilized in questionable or illegal activities. This means that a few traders or service gives might deny getting Bitcoins as payments assuming they accept those particular coins were utilized by lawbreakers in the past.
Not at all like some will generally accept, nonetheless, this reality doesn't eliminate Bitcoin's property of fungibility. Traceability and fungibility are two unique things and, regardless of their transactional history, each Bitcoin is as yet unchanged in terms of quality, technology, and usefulness. Essentially, the US dollar is as yet a fungible asset, in spite of the fact that crooks have been involving it for illegal activities for a long time.
