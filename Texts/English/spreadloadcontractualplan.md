# Spread-Load Contractual Plan
## What Is a Spread-Load Contractual Plan?

A spread-load contractual plan spreads a [mutual fund](/mutualfund's) sales charge, or [load](/load), throughout some undefined time frame. It is a fee-payment structure applicable to mutual funds in which the sales charge or commission (load) isn't completely paid at the time the investor initially contributes funds to the mutual fund. All things being equal, the mutual fund load is scattered across an extended period of time.

## Figuring out Spread-Load Contractual Plans

A spread-load contractual plan permits greater bits of the investor's initial contribution to the account to be applied to genuine investments, rather than sales charges. Thusly, the investor can gain a generally bigger position in the mutual fund front and center, however future contribution will be more modest.

A contractual plan is a unique type of mutual fund purchasing plan. These plans require the investor to focus on purchasing a set dollar amount, say $10,000, and to make payments toward this amount over the long haul. The plan as a rule calls for payments to be made month to month in a fixed amount north of a 10-to 15-year time period. In return, the mutual fund company issues [trust certificates](/trust-endorsement) for their interest in the shares.

The maximum allowable sales charge over the life of the plan is 9%. Be that as it may, there are two distinct types of "load plans" permitted. Note that under both of these plans, a full refund of all sales charges is made in the event that the investor drops in something like 45 days of beginning.

### Front-End Load Plan

In a [front-end load](/front-endload) plan, up to half of the principal year's payments might be applied to the sales charge. Assuming the investor drops in somewhere around 18 months of beginning, their refund comprises of the net asset value of the shares plus all sales charges paid minus 15% of total payments made.

### Spread-Load Plan

For a spread-load plan**,** something like 20% of one year's payments might apply to sales charges and something like 16% average over the initial four years might be deducted for sales charges. Refunds (following 45 days) comprise of just NAV; there is no refund of sales charges.

Likewise, a custodial fee is charged (notwithstanding the sales charge) since there are increased custodial and accounting capabilities in this type of plan. Payments from the investor are stored with the custodian (or trustee).

Other important elements of contractual plans include:

- Two types of outlines are required â€” one for each underlying fund, and one specific to the terms of the contractual plan itself.
- Lump-sum purchases might be permitted.
- Dividends and capital gains are consequently reinvested at NAV.
- Breakpoints are available in view of the scheduled payments.
