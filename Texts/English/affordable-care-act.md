### Orders for individuals and employers

There are a couple of exceptions to the command. Individuals who participate in a recognized medical services sharing service, whose employers' health care coverage is too costly or are incarcerated may meet exception requirements.
Under the ACA, employers with at least 100 full-time employees were required to protect no less than 70 percent of their full-time employees by 2015 and 95 percent by 2016.
Employers with 50 to 99 full-time employees were required to start protecting their employees by 2016. Employers with under 50 full-time employees are not subject to the ACA's command.
