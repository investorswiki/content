# Non-Competitive Tender
## What Is a Non-Competitive Tender?

A non-competitive tender is an offer to buy [United States Treasury](/ustreasury) securities that is made by non-institutional investors. These smaller investors don't take part in a conventional auction for the securities yet rather acknowledge the market price set by different participants. Paradoxically, competitive tender offers are those made by large institutional buyers who all in all set the price of Treasury securities through a [Dutch auction](/dutchauction) process.

## How Non-Competitive Tenders Work

The United States Treasury sells trillions of dollars of securities consistently. The buyers of these securities range from large organizations, for example, [primary dealer banks](/primarydealer) and foreign state run administrations, to individual [retail investors](/retailinvestor). As opposed to haggling with these buyers directly, the Treasury rather holds customary auctions with certain large buyers and afterward utilizes the price set by those auctions to sell securities to smaller investors.

In 2019, the Treasury held 322 auctions through which it issued nearly $12 trillion in securities. At these auctions, large institutional buyers place their bids at the cost and amount of Treasury securities they wish to purchase. The Treasury, wishing to pay the lowest amount of interest conceivable on its debts, first acknowledges the bids with the lowest [yields](/yield) and afterward slowly acknowledges more costly offers until it has raised the quantity of funds it requires. Through this competitive bidding process, the Treasury decides the [fair market value](/fairmarketvalue) of its securities and afterward sells extra securities to non-institutional buyers at that market price.

There are several benefits associated with purchasing Treasury securities through non-competitive tenders. Utilizing non-competitive tenders can allow small investors to purchase securities without paying costly [brokerage fees](/brokerage-expense, for example, by utilizing the public authority run [Treasury Direct](/treasurydirect) platform. Utilizing non-competitive tenders can likewise guarantee investors that they will receive a fair price on their investment, since the price they receive is set by the real trading activity of large institutional buyers. The requirements for investing utilizing non-competitive tenders are likewise generally humble, with a base offer size of just $10,000 and a maximum of $500,000.

## Illustration of a Non-Competitive Tender

Utilizing the Dutch auction process, the Treasury would start by offering securities at an extremely low yield (one which it suspects will be too low to draw in any bids from the auction participants). Then, at that point, they would bit by bit raise the offered yield until it starts drawing in offers and would keep doing as such until the total number of bids made has been adequate to retain each of the securities the Treasury wishes to sell.

The participants in this auction cycle would be institutional buyers, and their offers would be considered [competitive tenders](/competitivetender). When the Treasury has received the ideal quantity of tenders, all of the auction participants who submitted winning bids will actually want to purchase their securities at the higher yield associated with the last fruitful bid.

For instance, on the off chance that an investor with an effective bid was able to purchase securities at a yield of just 0.10%, and if the last investor to issue a fruitful bid offered to purchase at a yield of 0.30%, then, at that point, the investors with fruitful bids would be all paid the higher yield of 0.30%, even assuming that they were initially ready to acknowledge lower yields. That last yield, 0.30%, would then apply to any non-competitive tenders offered by non-institutional investors. Thusly, the competitive bidding cycle of the institutional buyers sets the price received by the smaller buyers who utilize non-competitive tenders.
