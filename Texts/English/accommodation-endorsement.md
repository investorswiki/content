# Accommodation Endorsement
## What Is an Accommodation Endorsement?

An accommodation endorsement is an agreement for one business to back the credit liability of another. Generally, this type of agreement adds strength to the creditworthiness of the financially more fragile of the two substances. For instance, a [parent company](/parentcompany) frequently gives accommodation endorsements to a subsidiary. This allows the subsidiary to partake in the parent company's credit rating, in certain occasions, and frequently, better loan terms.

## Understanding an Accommodation Endorsement

An accommodation endorsement is the corporate equivalent of a co-consenting to loan arrangement. Suppose a 19-year-old college student with just a seasonal job and no [credit history](/credit-history) needs a trade-in vehicle for use throughout a late spring entry level position. This student's parent might have to [cosign](/co_sign) the vehicle loan, showing that they are responsible for the debt assuming the student defaults.

Essentially, an accommodation endorsement happens when a subsidiary company applies for a loan, however it's not completely secure that this entity can pay, due to its less than impressive balance sheet. In this case, the parent company issues an accommodation paper. This gives a guarantee to the bank that the parent company, with undeniably more assets, will get the loan assuming that the original borrower defaults.

Accommodation endorsements are uncommonly useful to small companies. For the large parent companies, be that as it may, accommodation endorsements don't necessarily in all cases work out. The bank, or holder of the banknote, in the event that the loan is exchanged, can pursue the parent company on the off chance that they are not getting compensated. This is significant assuming the smaller entity borrowed substantially.

According to a useful point of view, an obliging endorser should simply leave all necessary signatures, demonstrating that this group is the financial backstop for the smaller organization or subsidiary. Like the way the U.S. government completely backs [U.S. Treasuries](/treasurybond), the parent company's reputation is presently on the line for the loan.

## Special Considerations

Note that a [accommodation endorser](/accommodation-endorser) isn't generally a parent company. In any case, it quite often has a close relationship with the borrower. In this manner, a larger company might give an obliging endorsement to one of its critical providers. A large soft drink company should be the accommodation endorser for one of its bottlers, for instance.

Accommodation endorsements likewise occur among the [keiretsu](/keiretsu) structure of companies in Japan, where a group of endeavors take equity stakes in each other and some of the time work together and share projects. Once more, it's the strongest of these companies giving the accommodation endorsement to the others.

Another model is a national bank that supports the acknowledgments of one of its regional auxiliaries. In the event that the regional branch runs into depository issues the national bank parent can step in to supply vital funds.

In a partnership, in the event that one partner makes accommodation endorsements that are not under the business, the business or the leftover partners are not held accountable.

The accommodation endorser ought to continuously know about the backing that they are giving to guarantee that they will actually want to cover any liabilities in case the company they are backing neglects to meet its financial obligations. For instance, on the off chance that a subsidiary takes out a $100 million loan and pulls out the whole amount yet is unable to pay any of it back, the accommodation endorser will be on the hook for the whole $100 million.

In the event that the endorser isn't in the financial position to pay that amount back at the given time, as maybe they had a terrible fiscal quarter or [fiscal year](/fiscalyear), or are paying down their own debt, this could adversely impact their financial standing and [credit rating](/creditrating).
