# Philadelphia Federal Index
  **Official name**: Business Outlook Survey
**What exactly**? Regional manufacturing index that covers Pennsylvania, New Jersey and Delaware. The overall business conditions index signals production line area expansion when over zero and contraction when below it.
**Source**: Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia
**Frequency**: Monthly
**Delivered when**? Around the eighteenth of the month at 10 a.m. Eastern. Data for current month.
**Market importance**: Much. At times moves markets. Convenient. Alongside the Chicago Purchasing Managers' Index, considered a decent measure of what's in store from the national Purchasing Managers' Index (which comes out a couple of days after the fact).

## Features
- The Philadelphia Federal Index (or Philly Fed Index) is a regional federal-reserve-bank index measuring changes in business growth covering the Pennsylvania, New Jersey, and Delaware districts.
- At the point when the Philadelphia Federal index is over zero, it demonstrates processing plant area growth, and when below zero, it shows contraction.
- Otherwise called the "Business Outlook Survey," a rising index is much of the time a signal that a bull market is on the horizon.
