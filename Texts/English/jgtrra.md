# Occupations And Growth Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2003 (JGTRRA)
## What Is JGTRRA?

The Jobs and Growth Tax Relief Reconciliation Act (JGTRRA) was a U.S. tax law Congress passed on May 23, 2003, which brought down the maximum individual income tax rate on corporate dividends to 15%.

The JGTRRA was put forward as part of a work to kick off the U.S. economy following the assaults of 9/11 and the 2001 recession. By diminishing the amount of tax financial backers paid on dividends and capital gains, public companies were urged to pay dividends as opposed to holding onto their cash, accordingly invigorating the overall economy.

## Figuring out JGTRRA

Following the recession of 2001 and the 9/11 assaults, the Jobs and Growth Tax Relief Reconciliation Act (JGTRRA) was passed into law and accomplished its goal of prodding the U.S. economy. The law reduced the [long-terms capital gains](/long-term_capital_gain_loss) rate to 15% from 20%. All the more dubiously, the law at this point not regarded capital gains as standard income however rather as long-term capital gains.

As additionally seen with EGTRRA, passed in June of 2001 during President George W. Bramble's most memorable year as president, the law was not initially considered to go on until the end of time. By 2004 the U.S. economy was performing great, with [GDP](/gdp) between 3-4%. A few financial experts believe the best reach for GDP to be 2-3%. As we currently know, the economy overheated with different speculative new investments in housing and somewhere else leading to the crash of 2008, one of the most obviously awful recessions in U.S. history. Because of the [2008 Great Recession](/great-recession), President Obama and Congress had their hands tied with both the [EGTRRA](/egtrra) of 2001 and the JGTRRA of 2003 and neither one of the laws was ended as intended when originally passed.

## Sunset Provisions and the JGTRRA

The global economy is a fragile difficult exercise and many would contend the U.S. economy is currently especially out of balance with an almost $21.0 trillion [budget debt](/budget-shortage). As any household knows, you can't increase spending and reduce income and earn a living wage without borrowing. It's politically convenient to make short-term fixes during troublesome times, yet the inquiry waits whether there is any practical method for implementing the [sunset provisions](/sunsetprovision) put into place at the hour of entry. As just one model, the tax cuts passed in late 2017 call for the individual tax brackets to return to their former levels by 2025.

Sunset provisions have been around for quite a while. Thomas Jefferson accepted no law passed by one generation ought to go on into the next. At its most philosophical level, this generational concern has directed the use of sunset clauses as a form of fairness in society. The last thing the guardians of one generation need is to leave the world more terrible off for their children. Given the recent fame in U.S. politics of involving the sunset clause as the best way to push through tax cuts, we currently have a $21 trillion debt trouble prone to influence several generations.
