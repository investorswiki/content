## What Is the Indonesian Rupiah (IDR)?

The Indonesian rupiah (IDR) is the official currency of Indonesia, a Southeast Asian country comprised of thousands of small islands. IDR is the unique [currency code](/isocurrencycode) of the Indonesian rupiah under ISO code 4217.

## Figuring out the Indonesian Rupiah (IDR)

The IDR is comprised of 100 **sen**, and is frequently given the symbol or condensing Rp. The rupiah is controlled by the Bank of Indonesia. The rupiah is additionally casually called the **perak** by local people, which is Indonesian for silver.

The Indonesian rupiah was first found in October 1946, however was only one of a number of currencies in circulation. Others incorporated the Netherlands Indies gulden, a Japanese rendition of the gulden, and others. Somewhere in the range of 1950 and 1951 different currencies dropped off and the IDR turned into the official currency of Indonesia following independence from the Dutch.

Somewhere in the range of 1949 and 1952 the exchange rate for the IDR was 3.8 per [U.S. dollar](/usd-US dollar) (USD). The country presented various rates for imports (11.4) and exports (7.6) in 1950, albeit this was subsequently repealed and the 3.8 rate was once again introduced.

In 1952 the currency was devalued to 11.4 IDR per USD. The government kept on trying different [tariff](/tariff) ways to deal with balance out the currency and acquire revenue, however they failed. While the official rate was as yet 11.4, on the [black market](/blackmarket) the currency had fallen to 31/USD in 1956 and 90 IDR/USD by 1958.

In 1959 the official rate was changed to 45/USD. Following this, [inflation](/inflation) went uncontrolled into the 60s, with effective rates for the IDR hitting close to 5,000/USD by 1965, albeit the official rate continued as before.

In 1965, new rupiah notes were presented, supplanting the old at 1,000 old IDR for one new IDR. The exchange rate was set at 0.25 rupiah per USD. Stabilization efforts started once more under the leadership of Suharto, and by 1970 inflation had fallen and exports had developed. A more practical exchange was set at 378/USD, however at that point altered in 1971 to 415/USD. That rate remained in effect till 1978 when it was devalued again to 625/USD.

In 1978 the country moved to a managed float rather than a [fixed exchange rate](/fixedexchangerate) system. The currency kept on declining, trading almost 1,664/USD in 1983 and 2,350 of every 1997.

Due to the [Asian financial crisis](/asian-financial-crisis), Indonesia abandoned the managed float and the currency became [free-floating](/floatingexchangerate). Through the crisis, the currency fell below 16,800 IDR/USD. As the restructuring started, the currency had recuperated to approach 8,000 IDR/USD by 1999.

In the following years, the Indonesian rupiah kept on giving foundation, and as of June 2019, the exchange is 14,234 IDR/USD.

While looking into a [currency quote](/currencypair), the rate will regularly be given as USD/IDR. The relating rate, for example, 14,234, means it costs 14,234 IDR to buy one USD.

Expect a traveler is monitoring exchange rates for an impending trip. In June 2018, they would have seen the rate was around 14,000, however by October 2018 the rate had increased to 15,400. That means the IDR had fallen in value, since it costs more IDR to buy one USD. On the other hand, this could be seen as the USD expanding in value relative to the IDR.

By mid 2019 the rate had fallen back to approach 14,000. This means the USD had declined in value relative to the IDR (or IDR increased relative to USD) since it costs less IDR to buy one USD than it did a couple of months prior.

To figure out the amount one IDR is worth in USD, partition one by the exchange rate. For instance, assuming that the rate is 14,200, partition one by 14,200 to get 0.00007. This is the IDR/USD exchange rate, meaning it costs $0.00007 for every Indonesian rupiah.
