# Contingent Asset
## What Is a Contingent Asset?

A contingent asset is a potential economic benefit that is dependent on some future event(s) generally beyond a company's control. A contingent asset is in this way known as a likely asset.

Not knowing for certain if these gains will appear, or having the option to decide their exact economic value, means these assets can't be recorded on the [balance sheet](/balancesheet). In any case, they can be reported in the accompanying footnotes of [financial statements](/financial-statements), given that certain conditions are met.

## Figuring out Contingent Assets

A contingent asset turns into a realized asset recordable on the balance sheet when the realization of [cash flows](/cashflow) associated with it turns out to be moderately certain. In this case, the asset is recognized in the period when the change in status happens.

Contingent assets might emerge due to the economic value being obscure. On the other hand, they could happen due to uncertainty connecting with the outcome of an event where an asset might be made. A contingent asset seems as a result of previous events, yet the entirety of all asset data won't be collected until future events occur.

There additionally exists [contingent](/contingentliability) or possible liabilities. Not at all like contingent assets, they allude to a potential loss that might be incurred, contingent upon how a certain future event unfurls.

## Instances of Contingent Assets

A company engaged with a claim that hopes to receive compensation has a contingent asset on the grounds that the outcome of the case isn't yet known and the dollar amount is yet not entirely settled.

Suppose Company ABC has documented a claim against Company XYZ for encroaching a [patent](/patent). Assuming there is a nice chance that Company ABC will win the case, it has a contingent asset. This potential asset will generally be uncovered in its financial statement, however not recorded as an asset until the claim is settled.

In light of this equivalent model, Company XYZ would have to reveal an expected contingent liability in its notes and afterward record it in its accounts, would it be advisable for it lose the claim and be requested to pay damages.

Contingent assets likewise crop up when companies hope to receive money using a warranty. Different models incorporate benefits to be received from an estate or other court settlement. Anticipated [mergers and acquisitions](/mergersandacquisitions) are to be revealed in the financial statements.

## Reporting Requirements

Both [generally accepted accounting principles](/gaap) (GAAP) and [International Financial Reporting Standards](/ifrs) (IFRS) expect companies to uncover contingent assets assuming there is a respectable possibility that these potential gains will eventually be realized. For U.S. GAAP, there generally should be a 70% probability that the gain happens. IFRS, then again, is somewhat more merciful and generally permits companies to make reference to expected gains assuming there is basically a half probability that they will happen.

[International Accounting Standard](/ias) 37 (IAS 37), applicable to IFRS, states the accompanying: **"**Contingent assets are not recognized, yet they are revealed when it is very likely that an inflow of benefits will happen. In any case, when the inflow of benefits is basically certain an asset is recognized in the statement of financial position since that asset is not generally viewed as contingent."

Contingent asset accounting policies for GAAP, in the mean time, are predominantly illustrated in the [Financial Accounting Standards Board's](/fasb) (FASB) Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) Topic 450.

## Special Considerations

Companies must rethink the potential asset persistently. At the point when a contingent asset turns out to be possible, firms must report it in financial statements by assessing the income to be collected. The estimate is created utilizing a scope of potential outcomes, the associated risks, and experience with comparative possible contingent assets.

Contingent assets are managed under the [conservatism](/accounting-conservatism) principle, which is an accounting practice that states that uncertain events and outcomes ought to be reported in a way that outcomes in the least potential [profit](/profit). As such, companies are discouraged from swelling expectations and are generally encouraged to use the most minimal estimated asset valuation.

Moreover, no gain might be recorded from a contingent asset until it really happens. The conservatism principle overrides the matching principle of [accrual accounting](/accrualaccounting), meaning the asset may not be reported until a period after associated costs were incurred.

## Features
- After meeting certain conditions, contingent assets are reported in the accompanying notes of financial statements.
- A contingent asset is just valuable on the off chance that certain events or conditions that are independent of a company's own decisions happen from here on out.
- A contingent asset can be recorded on a company's balance sheet just when the realization of cash flows associated with it turns out to be somewhat certain.
