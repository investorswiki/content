## How the Profit Motive Works

In theory, the profit motive aides everybody from people to [corporations](/enterprise) choose what to do at a particular time. Taking a gander at profit, or the potential for profit, works on numerous decisions. On the off chance that a company makes five distinct products and procures the vast majority of its profit from just two, then the profit motive view would recommend that the company dump the unprofitable lines and invest more in the profitable [production lines](/product offering).

Essentially, a person would need to zero in on the activities or employment opportunities that offer the most [return](/return) for their efforts. For certain individuals, this will mean the highest paying job. For other people, it might mean making their own enterprise bearing in mind the end goal of a higher income later on.

The profitability of a particular activity is, in theory, conveyed by market flags that eventually are a function of supply and demand. The higher the demand (or likely demand), the higher the profitability (or expected profitability). At the point when the profitability is high, more individuals and businesses will search out that activity.
