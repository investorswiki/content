# Box-Top Order
## What Is a Box-Top Order?

A box-top order is a buy or sell order made at the best [market price](/market-price). It is an old fashioned method for alluding to a [market order](/marketorder).

A market order is among the most common and clear transactions found in the financial markets. It is intended to be executed as fast as conceivable at the current asking price, and it is in many cases the default order type on most brokerage platforms.

## Understanding Box-Top Orders

Box-top orders execute market orders at the current best price. In the event that the order can't be totally filled, a limit order is placed for the excess shares at the price at which the filled portion was executed. A [limit order](/limitorder) is an order placed to execute a buy or sell transaction at a set number of shares and at a predetermined limit price or better.

For instance, assuming a trader entered a box-top order to buy 1,000 shares at the current market price of $50, and just half of the shares are traded costing that much, then, at that point, a buy limit order is placed for the other 500 shares. On the off chance that anytime during the life of the order the price returns to $50, the limit order kicks in and the leftover shares will be traded at $50.

## Limit Orders and Stop Orders

Limit orders permit an investor to limit the time span an order can be outstanding before being canceled. Limit orders empower box-top orders to be executed successfully. The execution of a limit order isn't generally guaranteed, however it assists with guaranteeing that the investor doesn't botch the opportunity to buy or sell at a target price point. These orders set a maximum or least at which a trader will buy or sell a specific stock. An investor can set specific conditions for limit orders, for example, expecting that all ideal shares be bought or sold simultaneously assuming the trade is to be executed, which is called a [all-or-none](/aon) order.

Then again, a [stop-loss order](/stop-lossorder) guarantees that a transaction doesn't happen at a price more terrible than the indicated target. It tends to be utilized to sell an existing instrument or to go into another transaction. With a stop order, a trade is possibly executed when the security arrives at a specific price known as the stop price. For investors who can't monitor their stocks for a certain period of time, stop orders are especially advantageous. Brokerages once in a while even set stop orders at no charge.

While stop orders may exclude a brokerage charge, limit orders might carry a higher commission. The advantage of a limit order is that it guarantees a trade will be made at a specific price; in any case, it's conceivable the order won't get executed on the off chance that the limit price isn't reached.
