## Figuring out Interbank Deposits

Interbank deposits are part of the [interbank market](/interbankmarket). The interbank market is a system utilized by banks and other financial institutions to trade currencies. This system avoids [retail investors](/retailinvestor) — people who buy and sell securities for their personal account rather than for another company or association — and other, smaller trading parties. Most interbank trading led on the market is proprietary, importance banks do as such between and for one another. There are occasions, however, where this type of banking happens for large, institutional customers.

In the interbank market, banks borrow and loan money between one another to oversee [liquidity](/liquidity) and meet the [reserve requirements](/requiredreserves) that regulators place on them. A reserve requirement is the amount of money a bank must keep in their vaults. Deposits, as well as loans, are among the many types of transactions that happen between banks that assist them with meeting these conditions. These transactions likewise furnish the market with a great deal of liquidity.

At the point when two banks make an arrangement for an interbank deposit, the holding bank sets up a due to account for the relating bank — the institution that sets aside the installment. The due to account is a holding account, otherwise called a payable account.

Banks utilize a special interest rate on deposits and short-term loans. This rate is known as the [interbank rate](/interbankrate). The interbank rate relies upon maturity, market conditions, and the [credit ratings](/creditrating) of the institutions in question. The Intercontinental Exchange [London Interbank Offered Rate](/libor) (ICE LIBOR) is a [benchmark](/benchmark) rate, which a portion of the world's leading banks charge each other for short-term loans.

## Special Considerations

As referenced over, the bank for which the due to account is held is alluded to as the relating bank. This assignment is generally held for deposits that happen between domestic banks. Yet, the terms change when the [correspondent bank](/correspondent-bank) is a foreign institution. In this case, the due to account is a [nostro](/nostroaccount) — got from the word our own in Latin — account for the bank holding the deposit. Put just, this is an account held by a bank in a foreign currency at another institution. This is in contract to a [vostro](/vostroaccount) — the Latin word for yours — account for the foreign correspondent bank. A vostro account is the term bank utilizations to depict accounts that different firms have on their books in their home currency. So the correspondent bank will call its account at the holding bank a nostro account, while the holding bank calls it a vostro account.

Here is a guide to assist with making it more clear. Suppose Bank A puts aside an interbank installment with Bank B, which is in an alternate country. The account is called a nostro account — our account on your ledger — to Bank, some time it's a vostro account or your account to Bank B.
