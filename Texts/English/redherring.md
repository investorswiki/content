## What Is a Red Herring?

A red herring is a preliminary prospectus recorded by a company with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), usually regarding the company's [initial public offering](/ipo) (IPO). A red herring prospectus contains most of the information relating to the company's operations and prospects however does exclude key details of the security issue, such as its price and the number of shares offered.

## How a Red Herring Works

A red herring prospectus might allude to the first prospectus recorded with the SEC as well as different subsequent drafts made prior to getting endorsement for public release. To be considered eligible for release, the SEC must completely survey a red herring [prospectus](/prospectus) to ensure the information contained in that does exclude any purposeful or incidental falsehoods or statements that are in violation of any laws or regulations. The SEC may also note any inability to disclose required information.

The term "red herring" is derived from the striking disclaimer in red on the cover page of the preliminary prospectus. The disclaimer states that a registration statement connecting with the securities being offered has been documented with the SEC however has not yet become effective. That is, the information contained in the prospectus is incomplete and might be changed. Thus, the securities may not be sold, and offers to buy may not be accepted before the registration statement becomes effective. The red herring does not state a price or issue size. You could view at it as the case of a medication having great effectiveness data submitted to the FDA for endorsement, yet that has not received the FDA endorsement yet, yet in this case, no endorsement is conceded, just effective registration.

When the registration statement becomes effective, the company disseminates a last prospectus that contains the last IPO price and issue size. Expressions of interest then convert to orders for the issue at the buyer's option. The base period between a registration statement filing and its effective date is 15 days. The SEC does not endorse the securities but rather simply ensures that all significant information is disclosed in the registration statement.
