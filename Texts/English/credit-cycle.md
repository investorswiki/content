A credit cycle portrays the phases of access to credit by borrowers. Credit cycles initially go through periods in which funds are moderately simple to get; these periods are portrayed by lower interest rates, lowered lending requirements, and an increase in the amount of accessible credit, which animates an overall expansion of economic activity. These periods are followed by a [contraction](/contraction) in the availability of funds.

During the contraction period of the credit cycle, interest rates climb and lending rules become more severe, implying that less credit is accessible for business loans, home loans, and other personal loans.
