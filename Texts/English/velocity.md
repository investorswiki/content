# Velocity of Money
## What Is the Velocity of Money?

The velocity of money is a measurement of the rate at which money is exchanged in an economy. It is the number of times that money moves starting with one entity then onto the next. It likewise alludes to how much a unit of currency is utilized in a given period of time. Basically, it's the rate at which consumers and businesses in an economy on the whole spend money.

The velocity of money is typically measured as a ratio of [gross domestic product](/gdp) (GDP) to a nation's M1 or M2 [money supply](/moneysupply).

## Figuring out the Velocity of Money

The velocity of money is important for measuring the rate at which money in circulation is being utilized for purchasing goods and services. It is utilized to assist financial experts and investors with checking the wellbeing and imperativeness of an economy. High money velocity is normally associated with a solid, growing economy. Low money velocity is normally associated with recessions and compressions.

Financial experts utilize the velocity of money to measure the rate at which money is utilized for goods and services in an economy. While it isn't really a key economic indicator, it tends to be followed alongside other key indicators that assist with determining economic wellbeing like GDP, unemployment, and inflation. GDP and the money supply are the two parts of the velocity of money formula.

[Economies](/economy) that show a higher velocity of money relative to others will generally be more developed. The velocity of money is additionally known to vary with business cycles. At the point when an economy is in an expansion, consumers and businesses will generally more promptly spend money making the velocity of money increase. At the point when an economy is contracting, consumers and businesses are normally more hesitant to spend and the velocity of money is lower.

Since the velocity of money is ordinarily corresponded with business cycles, it can likewise be associated with key indicators. Accordingly, the velocity of money will for the most part rise with GDP and inflation. On the other hand, it is typically expected to fall when key economic indicators like GDP and inflation are falling in a contracting economy.

## Illustration of Velocity of Money

Consider an economy comprising of two individuals, An and B, who each have $100 of money in cash. Individual A purchases a vehicle from individual B for $100. Presently B has $200 in cash money. Then B purchases a home from A for $100 and B enrolls An's assistance in adding new construction to their home and for their efforts, B pays An another $100. Individual A now has $200 in cash. Individual B then, at that point, offers a vehicle to A for $100 and both An and B end up with $100 in cash. Subsequently, the two players in the economy have made transactions worth $400, even however they just had $100 each.

In this economy, the velocity of money would be two (2) coming about because of the $400 in transactions partitioned by the $200 in money supply. This duplication in the value of goods and services exchanged is made conceivable through the velocity of money in an economy.

## The Velocity of Money Formula

While the above gives a simplified illustration of the velocity of money, the velocity of money is involved on a lot bigger scale as a measure of transactional activity for a whole nation's population. As a rule, this measure can be considered the turnover of the money supply for a whole economy.

For this application, financial specialists normally use GDP and either [M1](/m1) or [M2](/m2) for the money supply. In this way, the velocity of money equation is written as GDP partitioned by money supply.

GDP is generally utilized as the numerator in the velocity of money formula however gross national product (GNP) may be utilized also. GDP addresses the total amount of goods and services in an economy that are accessible for purchase. In the denominator, business analysts will regularly recognize money velocity for both M1 and M2.

M1 is defined by the Federal Reserve as the sum of all currency held by the public and [transaction deposits](/transaction-store) at depository institutions. M2 is a more extensive measure of money supply, adding in savings deposits, time deposits, and real money market mutual funds. Also, the St. Louis Federal Reserve tracks the quarterly velocity of money utilizing both M1 and M2.

## Velocity of Money and the Economy

There are varying perspectives among financial experts concerning whether the velocity of money is a valuable indicator of the strength of an economy or, all the more explicitly, inflationary tensions. The "monetarists" who buy into the [quantity theory of money](/quantity_theory_of_money) contend that money velocity ought to be stable missing evolving expectations, however a change in money supply can modify expectations and thusly money velocity and inflation.

For instance, an increase in the money supply ought to hypothetically lead to a commensurate increase in prices since there is more money chasing similar level of goods and services in the economy. The inverse ought to occur with a reduction in money supply. Pundits, then again, contend that in the [short term](/shortterm), the velocity of money is highly variable, and prices are resistant to change, bringing about a weak and indirect connection between money supply and inflation.

Exactly, data recommends that the velocity of money is without a doubt variable. In addition, the relationship between money velocity and inflation is likewise variable. For instance, from 1959 through the finish of 2007, the velocity of M2 money stock averaged roughly 1.9x with a maximum of 2.198x in 1997 and at least 1.653x in 1964.

Beginning around 2007, the velocity of money has fallen decisively as the Federal Reserve significantly expanded its balance sheet with an end goal to combat the global financial emergency and deflationary tensions.

Money velocity appeared to have reached as far down as possible at 1.435 in the second quarter of 2017 and was bit by bit rising until the global recession set off by the COVID-19 pandemic prodded monstrous U.S. Federal economic stimulus. Toward the finish of the second quarter of 2020, the M2V was 1.100, the lowest perusing of M2 money velocity ever.

## Highlights

- The velocity of money equation isolates GDP by money supply.
- Velocity of money is a measurement of the rate at which money is exchanged in an economy.
- The velocity of money formula shows the rate at which one unit of money supply currency is being executed for goods and services in an economy.
## FAQ
### How Do You Calculate the Velocity of Money?
The velocity of money is calculated by partitioning a nation's gross domestic product by the total supply of money.

### Why Is the Velocity of Money So Low?
