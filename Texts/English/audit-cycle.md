# Audit Cycle
## What Is an Audit Cycle?

A [audit](/audit) cycle is the accounting system that auditors utilize in the survey of a company's financial statements and related data. An audit cycle incorporates the steps that an[ auditor](/auditor) takes to guarantee that the company's financial data is legitimate. The audit cycle can call for various tasks to be performed at various times â€” for instance, inventory can be included in October, and account receivables not entirely set in stone in November.

## How the Audit Cycle Works

The audit cycle typically includes several distinct steps. First is the identification interaction, where the company meets with auditors to recognize the accounting areas that should be investigated. Second, the audit methodology stage, where the auditors conclude how the data will be collected for survey.

The third step is the audit hands on work stage, where the auditor will test and compare accounting tests. Fourth is the management survey meeting stage, where the discoveries are introduced by the auditors to the company's management team. This last step generally incorporates an audit report introduced to management. This report will incorporate errors found in the financial statements of the company.

## Special Considerations

Firms, particularly publicly traded firms, may utilize outside accounting firms to perform audits and approve the audited company's financial wellbeing. Firms that perform these services are firms like E&Y, KPMG, and PwC.

Having the option to deliver audited [financial statements](/financial-statements) is a large part of guaranteeing a publicly traded association's financial wellbeing and supporting financial backers' requirement for data in regards to the company's financials. Auditors assist with recognizing key areas of high risk by checking out at the internal controls system.

## Audit Cycle versus Accounting Cycle

The audit cycle is the most common way of guaranteeing financial statements are right. In the mean time, the accounting cycle is the definition of financial statements. Assembling the financial statements is the key step in the accounting cycle.

The steps in the accounting cycle leading up to this incorporate recording transactions by means of journal passages and [general ledgers](/generalledger). An accounting cycle starts when a transaction happens and closes when it's remembered for the financial statements.

The accounting cycle has rules to guarantee the financial statements are accurate. The audit is a check on financial statements. In the interim, the creation of automated accounting systems and uniform accounting rules have decreased mathematical errors. Most accounting software today completely mechanizes the accounting cycle, decreasing errors, and smoothing out the audit interaction.
