# Gann Fans
## What Are Gann Fans?

Gann fans are a form of [technical analysis](/technicalanalysis) in view of the possibility that the market is geometric and cyclical in nature. A Gann fan comprises of a series of lines called Gann angles. These angles are superimposed over a price chart to show possible support and resistance levels. The subsequent picture should assist technical analysts with foreseeing price changes.

## Step by step instructions to Calculate Gann Fans

Gann fans don't need a formula despite the fact that they truly do require a comprehension of slant degrees.

Think of a piece of graph paper with bunches of little squares or frameworks on it. On the off chance that the price climbs the level of the square, inside a one square time period, a line can be drawn from the base left to the upper right of the square. That line's slant degree will be 45.

In the event that it requires two investment boxes to climb the level of one box (2:1), the point of rising will be compliment than 45 degrees. Assuming the price rises two box levels inside the time period of one box (1:2), that point is more extreme than 45 degrees. The Gann fan incorporates angles in light of price-to-time moves in the following ratios: 1:8, 1:4, 1:3, 1:2, 1:1, 2:1, 3:1, 4:1, and 8:1.

## How Gann Fans Work

Calculated lines are drawn above and below a central 45-degree line to help determine [trend](/trend) course and strength. Gann fans are drawn from a central 45-degree point line that stretches out from a predefined trend reversal level. Traders will draw a Gann fan at a [reversal](/reversal) point to see support and resistance levels extended into what's to come.

The 45-degree line is known as the 1:1 line on the grounds that the price will rise or fall at a 45-degree point when the price climbs/down one unit for every unit of time. Any remaining lines in the Gann fan are drawn above and below the 1:1 line. Traders can utilize a changing number of lines above and below the 1:1 line in a Gann fan chart. Different angles are associated with 2:1, 3:1, 4:1, 8:1 and 1:8, 1:4, 1:3, and 1:2 chance to-price moves.

The 1:1 line is the primary indicator. Nonetheless, [chartists](/chartist) have options for adding extra lines at their tact. In both a [uptrend](/uptrend) and a downtrend, the 1:1 line can assist with recognizing a reversal. In a downtrend, a price that stays below the 1:1 line is viewed as bearish. In an uptrend, a price that stays over the 1:1 line is thought of as bullish. Consequently the 1:1 line can act as a resistance and support line.

Extra lines drawn in a Gann fan diagram are likewise utilized as resistance and support lines. That's what gann trusted assuming the price traveled through one point, it would almost certainly head to the next point. For instance, in the event that the price dropped below the 45-degree point (1:1), it would drop to the 26.25-degree point (2:1).

A price that drops below 1:1 doesn't be guaranteed to mean the overall uptrend is finished. The price might find support at 2:1 and afterward keep rising. All things considered, the fall below 1:1 could demonstrate to some extent short-term weakness assuming the price drops to the 2:1 line.

## Gann Fan versus Trendlines

The Gann fan is a series of lines drawn at specific angles. The 45-degree line ought to reach out 45-degrees from the starting point. A hand-drawn [trendline](/trendline) interfaces a [swing low](/swinglow) to a swing low, or a swing high to swing high, and afterward reaches out the right. The trendline is matched to recent price action and isn't drawn at a specific point.

A Gann point is in this way a diagonal line that moves at a uniform rate of speed. A trendline is made by interfacing [bottoms](/base) to bottoms, on account of an uptrend, and [tops](/on) to tops, on account of a [downtrend](/downtrend). The benefit of drawing a Gann point compared to a trendline is that it moves at a uniform rate of speed. This allows the analyst to forecast where the price will be on a specific date from here on out.

It is not necessarily the case that a Gann point generally predicts where the market will be. Rather, the analyst will know where the Gann point will be, which will assist with checking the strength and heading of the trend.

A trendline, then again, has some predictive value. In any case, on account of the steady changes that typically happen, it's untrustworthy for making long-term forecasts.

## Limitations of Using the Gann Fan

While some charting platforms might give the Gann fan, they may not give a point device to set the 45-degree line at a true 45-degree plot for that chart. Since various assets have various prices, they may not be scaled at 1:1 ($1 for one day, for instance). They could be scaled in an unexpected way.

After putting the Gann fan on various charts, it is clear that the Gann fan isn't valuable 100% of the time. The price might remain between the levels, yet not contact them, or the price might keep on rising even however it is below the 1:1 line, for instance. The lines may not mark important support or resistance areas, and the price may apparently disregard the fan levels.

The lines consistently spread out over the long haul, making the distance within incredibly large. The distance within may turn out to be huge to the point that the indicator doesn't function for trading since the price would have to move an impressive distance before arriving at the next level/trading signal.

Gann fans ought to be utilized related to other technical indicators, [price action](/price-action), and different forms of analysis.

## Highlights
- The Gann fan begins at a low or high point. The subsequent lines show areas of likely future support and resistance.
- The Gann fan, made by early market technician W.D. Gann, comprises of a series of calculated lines. The trader chooses the starting point and the lines reach out into what's to come.
- Gann accepted the 45-degree point to be most important, however the Gann fan additionally draws angles at 82.5, 75, 71.25, 63.75, 26.25, 18.75, 15, and 7.5 degrees.
