## What Is a Timeshare?

A timeshare is a shared ownership model of vacation real estate in which various purchasers own allotments of use, typically in one-week increments, in a similar property. The timeshare model can be applied to a wide range of types of properties, for example, vacation resorts, condominiums, apartments, and campsites.

Time-sharing is a form of [fractional ownership](/fractionalownership), where buyers purchase the right to involve a unit of real estate over indicated periods. For instance, purchasing multi week of a timeshare implies the buyer possesses 1/52 of the unit. Buying one month likens to one-twelfth ownership.

Time-sharing is famous within vacation districts where owners might need incidental control of a property. Timeshare property types include homes, condominiums, and resorts. The timeshare model can likewise apply to sporting vehicles and private planes.

## How a Timeshare Works

Timeshares present upon buyers the right to annual exclusive utilization of a vacation property for a defined period that is generally estimated in one-week increments. Timeshares typically utilize one of the following three systems:

### Fixed Week

A fixed week timeshare gives the buyer the right to exclusively involve the property for a specific week (or weeks) consistently. While the advantage of this structure is that the buyer can plan an annual vacation simultaneously consistently, the opposite side of the coin is that it could be exceedingly challenging to change the fixed week to another period whenever required.

### Floating Week

A floating week timeshare gives the buyer exclusive utilization of the property for a week or weeks during a predefined period or even consistently. While it is more flexible than the fixed week system, the "floating week" may not be accessible during the most active times of the year and may should be saved well in advance to guarantee availability.

### Points

The points system utilizes points to address timeshare ownership, in view of factors like resort location, size of the vacation property, and season of availability. Points are utilized by engineers to work with timeshare exchanges either within their own resorts (internal exchange) or with different resorts too (outer exchange). While the points system gives users increased vacation decisions, there is a wide disparity between the points allocated to different vacation resorts due to the previously mentioned factors involved.

## Types of Timeshare Ownership

Timeshares are typically structured as shared deeded ownership or shared leased ownership interest.

### Shared Deeded Ownership

Shared deeded ownership gives every buyer a percentage share of the physical property, corresponding to the time span purchased. A resort condominium unit that is sold in timeshare increments of multi week can technically have 52 total deeds. As such, buying multi week would present a one-fifty-second (1/52) ownership interest in the unit while two weeks would give a one-twenty-6th (1/26) interest, etc. Shared deeded ownership interest is much of the time held in perpetuity and can be resold to one more party or willed to one's estate.

### Shared Leased Ownership Interest

Shared leased ownership interest entitles the buyer to involve a specific property for a fixed or floating week (or weeks) every year for a certain number of years. In this structure, the timeshare designer retains the deeded title to the property, dissimilar to the shared deeded ownership structure where the owner holds the deed. Property transfers or resales are likewise more restrictive than with a deeded timeshare. Thus, a leased ownership interest might have a lower value than a deeded timeshare.

In view of the abovementioned, it is apparent that holding a leased timeshare interest doesn't be guaranteed to suggest "fractional ownership" of the underlying property. According to the American Resort Development Association (ARDA), the trade association for the timeshare industry, "fractional ownership" is usually associated with the luxury segment of vacation properties that offer more service and conveniences, and is sold in intervals of over multi week and not exactly full ownership. The concept of fractional ownership has additionally been extended to different assets, like private planes and sporting vehicles.

> According to ARDA, more than 205,000 timeshare units were sold in the United States in 2020. The industry produced $4.9 billion of sales from its 1,570 U.S. resorts with 7 million total evenings rented during the year.
