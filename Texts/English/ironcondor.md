# Iron Condor
## What Is an Iron Condor?

An iron condor is a [options](/option) strategy comprising of two puts (one long and one short) and two calls (one long and one short), and four [strike prices](/strikeprice), all with a similar expiration date. The iron condor acquires the maximum profit when the underlying asset closes between the middle strike prices at expiration. At the end of the day, the goal is to profit from low volatility in the underlying asset.

The iron condor has a comparative payoff as a customary [condor spread](/condorspread), yet utilizes the two calls and puts rather than just calls or just puts. Both the condor and the iron condor are extensions of the [butterfly spread](/butterflyspread) and iron butterfly, individually.

## Grasping an Iron Condor

The iron condor strategy has limited [upside](/upside) and [downside risk](/downsiderisk) on the grounds that the high and low strike options, the wings, safeguard against critical moves in one or the other course. As a result of this limited risk, its profit potential is likewise limited.

For this strategy, the trader in a perfect world would like the options to lapse worthlessly, which is all main conceivable if the [underlying asset](/underlying-asset) closes between the middle two strike prices at [expiration](/expirationdate). There will probably be a fee to close the trade in the event that it is fruitful. On the off chance that it isn't effective, the loss is as yet limited.

> The [commission](/commission) can be a prominent factor as there are four options included.

The construction of the strategy is as follows:

1. Buy one [out of the money](/outofthemoney) (OTM) put with a strike price below the current price of the underlying asset. This OTM [put option](/putoption) will safeguard against a critical downside move to the underlying asset.
1. Sell one OTM or [at the money](/atthemoney) (ATM) put with a strike price closer to the current price of the underlying asset.
1. Sell one OTM or ATM [call](/calloption) with a strike price over the current price of the underlying asset.
1. Buy one OTM call with a strike price further over the current price of the underlying asset. This OTM call option will safeguard against a significant upside move.

The options that are further OTM, called the wings, are both long positions. Since both of these options are further OTM, their [premiums](/premium) are lower than the two written options, so there is a net credit to the account while setting the trade.

By choosing different strike prices, it is feasible to make the strategy lean bullish or bearish. For instance, in the event that both the middle strike prices are over the current price of the underlying asset, the trader expects a small rise in its price by expiration. Regardless, the trade actually conveys a limited reward and limited risk.
