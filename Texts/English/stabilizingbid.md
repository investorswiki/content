# Stabilizing Bid
## What Is a Stabilizing Bid?

A stabilizing bid is a purchase of stock by underwriters to balance out or support the [secondary market](/secondarymarket) price of a security quickly following a [initial public offering](/ipo) (IPO). After an IPO, the price of the recently issued shares might waver or be unsteady in trading.

## How a Stabilizing Bid Works

After a company has settled on the choice to open up to the world and conduct an IPO, it will vet a number of underwriters for mastery in esteeming the company's equity, assisting with marketing and distribution, conducting [sell-side](/sellside) research support, and organizing trading capabilities. When the IPO price has been set by the underwriter, and the issuer's shares make their presentation in the public, it is to the greatest advantage of the issuer that the shares are generally welcomed. This means a higher stock price upon release into the market. The stabilization bid assists with ensuring that the trading price doesn't fall below the IPO price, which is pivotal for a company that would rather not risk a negative insight subsequent to opening up to the world.

To prepare for this risk, a company might grant the underwriters a [greenshoe option](/greenshoe)- otherwise called a [overallotment](/overallotment) option-that permits the underwriters to oversell or short sell up to 15% a bigger number of shares than initially offered by the company. On the off chance that the price falters shortly after the stocks are issued and demand is weak, the underwriters will step in and make a stabilizing bid. This includes buying back the shorted shares. Making this extra source of demand for the recently issued shares assists with stabilizing the stock price, keeping it above, or if nothing else around its issue price.

## Illustration of a Stabilizing Bid

In mid-2017, Blue Apron Holdings Inc. opened up to the world at a price of $10 per share. The [underwriters](/underwriter) had initially indicated a scope of $15 to $17 per share in the weeks leading up to the IPO. This was an obvious sign that demand wouldn't be pretty much as strong as the company had trusted. Blue Apron sold 30 million shares to the underwriters, yet with the 15% overallotment, the underwriters sold 34.5 million shares to investors. This left the underwriters short 4.5 million shares.

In spite of the fact that underwriters typically don't publicly declare when they are forced to make stabilizing bids, there is strong evidence that they did as such on account of Blue Apron. Eventually, the IPO price of the company ended up being $10. On the main day of trading, the stock was drifting around the $10 mark. Without the stabilizing bid, the stock might just have closed below the IPO price that day, bringing about awful optics for the company as well as the underwriters. Notwithstanding, stabilizing bids have a finite life expectancy. The next day, the stock closed at $9.34 and five trading days after the fact it closed at $7.73.
