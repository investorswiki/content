# Overnight Limit
## What Is the Overnight Limit?

The overnight limit is the maximum net position in at least one currencies or derivatives contracts that a trader is permitted to carry over starting with one trading day then onto the next — that is, overnight. In the [foreign exchange market](/foreign-exchange-markets), "overnight" technically starts after 5 p.m. ET.

Typically, traders need to hold trades overnight either to increase their profit or with the expectation that a losing trade will be diminished or transformed into a profit the next day. On account of the currency markets, they might try to benefit from a cash return, or [rollover](/rollover) rate, on the difference between the two interest rates of the currencies they're matching in their position.

## Seeing Overnight Limits

An overnight limit, or an overnight [position limit](/positionlimit), is a restriction on the number of currency positions a trader might carry over starting with one trading day then onto the next. It is likewise a restriction on the total size of a position or a set of positions a currency [dealer](/dealer) may carry over starting with one trading day then onto the next.

Position limits are put in place to keep anybody from utilizing their ownership control, straightforwardly or through derivatives, to exercise unilateral control over a market and its prices. For example, by buying [call options](/calloption) or [futures](/futures) contracts, large investors, or funds, can build controlling positions in certain stocks or commodities without purchasing genuine assets themselves. Assuming these positions are sufficiently large, the exercise of them can change the balance of power in corporate voting blocks or commodities markets, making increased volatility in those markets.

## Overnight Limits in Forex Markets

 An overnight position in the foreign exchange market is any position (whether long or short) that isn't closed (that is, settled) yet stays open toward the finish of official trading hours, which is after 5 p.m. ET. At 5 p.m., the trader's account either pays out or acquires interest on each vacant position contingent upon the underlying interest rates of the two currencies engaged with the currency trade.

This payout cycle — the interest paid, or earned, for holding the position overnight — is called the [rollover rate](/rollover-rate). The rollover rate changes over net currency interest rates, which are given as a percentage, into a cash return for the position. A rollover interest fee is calculated in light of the difference between the two interest rates of the traded currencies. On the off chance that the rollover rate is positive, it's a gain for the investor. In the event that the rollover rate is negative, it's a cost for the investor.

Thus, a rollover might show as either a credit or a debit on a trader's account.

### Ascertaining Rollover Payments

We should place that the interest rate set by the [Bank of Japan](/bankofjapan) (BOJ) is 1.25% and the federal funds rate set by the [Federal Reserve](/federalreservesystem) is 2.5%. You choose to open a short position JPY/USD for 100,000, regularly known as a great deal in the retail FX arena. Here, you are principally selling 100,000 JPY, borrowing at a rate of 1.25%.

In selling JPY/USD, you are buying [USD](/usd), which pays out at 2.5% interest, and selling [JPY](/jpy-japanese-yen), which costs 1.25%. At the point when the interest rate of the country whose currency you are buying is not exactly the interest rate of the country whose money you are selling, your account gets a credit for the difference, as in the model above. In the event that the interest rate is higher in the country whose currency you are selling, your account will show a derivation for the difference. Likewise, a forex broker may likewise charge fees while storage is added or deducted from your account.

## Explanations behind Overnight Limits

A [central bank](/centralbank), treasury, or forex broker might impose overnight limits on a trader or dealer of currencies. A [forex](/forex) (FX) trading business enterprise, for example, a [hedge fund](/hedgefund), may impose overnight position limits for its traders as a risk management strategy.

Overnight position limits fill various different needs:

- A financial regulator like a central bank, or the [U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission](/cftc) (CFTC), may impose them to advance the stability of the financial system.
- A central bank might institute asymmetric vacant position limits that separate among long and short currency positions.
- An administration's treasury or finance department might set limits among occupants and out-of-state people to assist with controlling the flow of capital all through the economy.
- A bank or other financial institution might impose limits on its customers or traders to oversee risk.

## Special Considerations

Not at all like the stock and bond markets, holding an overnight position is certainly not a major concern in the online, global forex market, which technically considers consistent 24-hour trading. Nonetheless, most currencies, and currency pairs, have a lot higher volume and stable moves when the European and U.S. markets are open. Lower volume during the off-hours can bring about unstable, random swings brought about by small gatherings of traders or large orders. In this way, on the off chance that a trader can't close a position before the day's end, they might like to hold overnight, waiting to resume trading during a more active time, as opposed to risk it during the quiet time.
