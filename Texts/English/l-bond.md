## GWG Holdings and the L Bond

The company purchases life insurance contracts from seniors at a discount to their benefit value. In a viatical settlement, for instance, the company could pay a senior $250,000 for their $1 million life insurance policy and assume control more than premium payments of $30,000 every year. At the point when the senior kicks the bucket, the insurance company pays GWG the $1 million benefit. The funds raised from the L bond were utilized to purchase and finance extra life insurance assets.

As of Sept. 30, 2020, the firm's portfolio held 1,081 insurance policies valued at $1.92 billion in benefits. Of that, generally half (46%) — $882 million — was in policies covering individuals 85 and more established.

GWG Holdings had been selling L Bonds starting around 2012. On June 3, 2020, GWG offered a $1 billion L [bond](/bond) issue, and afterward on July 1, 2020, announced a $2 billion offering. [Maturity terms](/maturity) of the new bonds ran somewhere in the range of two and seven years. Interest rates were 5.50%, 6.25%, 7.50%, and 8.50% for its two-, three-, five-, and seven-year bonds, individually.
