# Copay
## What is a copay?
Under [health insurance](/healthinsurance) policies, copay alludes to the portion of a bill that the insured person pays, normally at the hour of service. Frequently, it is communicated as a set fee for a specific service.
## More profound definition
A copay, short for "co-payment," is a fixed amount that you pay for medical services at doctors' offices and hospitals. The amount is due in full at the hour of service.
Copay is a set amount as opposed to a deductible or percentage of the wellbeing bill, which makes it simple to budget for wellbeing arrangements (with the exception of emergency care).
Knowing your copay amounts before picking one medical coverage plan over another might be an important factor while considering your health care coverage costs.
Copay amounts regularly fluctuate from one service to another and can apply to at least one of the accompanying medical care services:
- Doctor's arrangements.
- Dire care center visits.
- Emergency room visits.
- Physician endorsed drugs.

Copays for standard doctor visits are frequently **$**25 or more. Emergency services, for example, a dire care or emergency room visit, can cost many dollars, however the specific amounts can change essentially, contingent upon your medical coverage plan.
At long last, not all insurance companies offer copays for standard arrangements or hospital visits, and on second thought they bill by percentage of the total cost after the hour of service. For these health care coverage plans, no payment is transmitted at the hour of service, and individuals are sent a bill from the doctor or hospital after the insurance pays a portion of the fee.
## Copay model
A standard exam for your kid creates a $20 copay, which is due at the hour of service. Your plan might not have a copay amount for essential services, but rather may incorporate one for emergency and solution services. If you somehow managed to break your wrist, your emergency room visit could cause a copay of $150, and your solution for pain medicine could have a copay of $10. These copays would be transmitted to the hospital and drug store, separately, at the hour of service.

## Features
- Not all medical visits require copayments from patients.
- Out-of-network visits could have higher copayments or copays than in-network medical suppliers.
- Copays and coinsurance are not exactly the same things. Coinsurance is a percentage of the bill, a copay is a fixed amount.
- Deductibles are a lot bigger totals than copays.
