# Contraction
## What Is Contraction?

Contraction, in economics, alludes to a phase of the [business cycle](/businesscycle) in which the economy as a whole is in decline. A contraction generally happens after the business cycle tops, however before it turns into a trough. As per most financial experts, when a country's real [gross domestic product](/gdp) (GDP) — the most-watched indicator of economic movement — has declined for at least two consecutive quarters, then a recession has happened.

## More About Contraction

For a great many people, a contraction in the economy is an antecedent to economic hardship. As the economy dives into a contraction, unemployment increments. Albeit no economic contraction lasts perpetually, it is hard to evaluate just how long a downtrend will go on before it inverts. History has demonstrated the way that a contraction can last for a long time, for example, during the [Great Depression](/great_depression).

## The Business Cycle

A business cycle is made out of four discrete phases, through which the economy passes in a specific order: 1) expansion, 2) top, 3) contraction, and 4) trough. During economic expansion, GDP rises, [per capita income](/income-per-capita) develops, unemployment declines, and equity markets generally perform well. The pinnacle phase addresses the finish of an expansionary period after which contraction grabs hold. Then GDP and per capita income decline, unemployment ticks up, and stock market indexes trend descending.

## Effects of Contraction

Despite the fact that GDP is the primary measure used to survey the soundness of the economy and characterize the phase of a business cycle, the ancillary effects of contraction are what the public feels most. Diminished productivity quite often hastens higher unemployment and lower wages, on the grounds that less work is accessible when production is low. At the point when more individuals are jobless or have their incomes cut, then less money is spent in the economy, which can additionally worsen contraction.

## Real World Example — Famous Periods of Contraction

The longest and most excruciating period of contraction in modern American history was the Great Depression, from 1929 to 1933. All the more as of late, deep contraction happened during the mid 1980s when the Federal Reserve sent interest rates taking off to suppress inflation. This contractionary period, in any case, was fleeting and prevailed by a robust and supported period of expansion. [The Great Recession of 2007 to 2009](/great-recession) was a period of substantial contraction prodded by an impractical [bubble](/bubble) in real estate and the financial markets.
