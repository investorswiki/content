# Frequency-Severity Method
## What Is the Frequency-Severity Method?

Frequency-severity method is an actuarial method for deciding the expected number of claims that an insurer will receive during a given time span and how much the average claim will cost.

Frequency-severity method utilizes historical data to estimate the average number of claims and the average cost of each claim. The method duplicates the average number of claims by the average cost of a claim.

## Grasping the Frequency-Severity Method

In the frequency-severity method, frequency alludes to the number of claims that an insurer expects will happen over a given period of time. On the off chance that the frequency is high, it means that a large number of claims is expected to [occur](/occurrence rate).

Severity alludes to the cost of a claim. A high-severity claim is more costly than an average claim, and a low-severity claim is more affordable than the average claim. Average costs of claims are estimated in light of historical data.

For example, consider a prospective home buyer considering the purchase of an ocean side house in Miami. This part of the Florida coast averages one hurricane each year. With the potential for complete destruction so high thus incessant, the frequency-severity method would demonstrate that an insurance company ought to try not to guarantee a strategy for this ocean side house.

## Frequency-Severity Method and Other Risk Models

Insurers utilize sophisticated models to decide the probability that they should pay out a claim. In a perfect world, the insurer would favor getting [premiums](/premium) for [underwriting](/underwriting) new insurance policies while never paying out a claim, yet this is an impossible scenario.
