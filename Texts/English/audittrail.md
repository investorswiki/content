## What Is an Audit Trail?

An audit trail is a step-by-step record by which accounting, trade details, or other financial data can be traced to their source. Audit trails are used to verify and follow many types of transactions, remembering accounting transactions and trades for brokerage accounts.

## Understanding an Audit Trail

Audit trails can be used in accounting when an auditor or examiner needs to verify figures like revenue, net earnings, or [earnings per share (EPS)](/eps). Transactions that are involved in computing a company's revenue, net earnings, or earnings per share are reviewed and the computations might be redone assuming that figures were incorrectly classified.

The [cost of goods sold (COGS)](/cogs), for example, is an expense item subtracted from gross revenue that is used when working out net earnings. The COGS figure would be double-checked by verifying the transactions and data sources that went into working out the cost of goods sold. All elements of the last numbers are double-checked along the audit trail to verify the last figure.

All public companies undergo a financial audit as part of their reporting responsibilities.

## Types of Audit Trails

Audit trails, or rather the process of following an audit trail, are found in various areas of finance. When buying a home, for example, a mortgage lender might utilize an audit trail to determine the source of funds for a [down payment](/down_payment). They might ask to see a bank statement showing the deposit of funds into the account and ask for extra verification regarding the source of the deposit.

The [Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)](/sec) and [NYSE](/nyse) will use audit trails for the explicit reconstruction of trades when there are questions about the legitimacy or precision of trade data. This is done to ensure that the trades occurring on major exchanges are in compliance with current regulations.

Of course, audit trails can likewise be used to follow improper market activity. Assuming that it is believed, for example, that a particular entity is trading large volumes of a thinly traded stock to manipulate the share price, a regulator can utilize an audit trail to help identify the guilty party.

A regulator will then document and analyze all houses and brokers involved in specific trades for the offending security to determine whose activity is abnormal and who may be the controller. Depending on the complexity of the trading scheme being used, reconstructing the trade history might require [forensic accounting](/forensicaccounting) notwithstanding audit trail data.

## Advantages and Disadvantages of Audit Trails

While audit trails provide financial data that is absolutely necessary for the smooth flow of business, there are challenges to keeping up with and implementing the practice.

The biggest issue faced by corporations is the time and money it takes to keep a sufficiently consistent audit log, especially when the audit log is automated.

## Examples of an Audit Trail

The [Order Audit Trail System (OATS)](/order_audit_trail_system) is an automated trade entry system established by the [Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA)](/finra) that is used to record data relating to orders, quotes, and other trade-related data from all equities traded on the [National Market System (NMS)](/nms). This system simplifies an order's progression from its initial receipt to its eventual execution or cancellation, for easy tracking or auditing purposes.

One of the purposes of OATS is monitoring for suspicious behavior and giving an audit trail to investigators. Because of the data that is recorded, anyone involved in suspicious activity is easier to find.

A critical case occurred on May 6, 2010, when an informal investor "spoofed" the [S&P 500 E-mini market](/sp_500_mini). He used an automated program that started a cascading type of influence of sell orders which led to a [flash crash](/flash-crash) that day. The man responsible, a London resident, was gotten and arrested in 2015. In 2016 he pleaded liable to spoofing and wire fraud.

While a number of parties were involved in giving testimony and evidence, and this case involved [futures](/futures), not stocks, it shows the importance of order audit trails and financial oversight. The regulators were able to see that Navinder Singh Sarao, the man responsible, put out hundreds of huge orders without any intention of [filling](/fill) them, yet rather for the sole purpose of controlling the market in his preferred direction.

Another popular example of fraud discovered by auditing practices in recent years was the case of Enron. In the late 1990s, Enron was praised for its innovation and was one of the dears of Wall Street. However, the company had huge exposure to some of the hardest-hit sectors of the [dotcom bubble](/dotcom-bubble) crash in 2000. Instead of eating its losses and moving forward honestly, the company concealed its losses from investors and inflated profits in other sectors to appease shareholders.

The firm tasked with auditing the company, the now-defunct [Arthur Andersen](/anderseneffect), signed off on Enron's reports even however they knew the documents were fraudulent. Eventually, the losses were too big to hide and Enron was forced to file for bankruptcy.

Even however Arthur Andersen's CEO ordered auditors to destroy all Enron documents that revealed fraud, eventually the truth came out and employees at both Enron and Arthur Andersen were charged criminally.

The Enron case presents one of the most persuading arguments regarding the need for accurate and intensive audit logs.

> In response to the Enron scandal, President George W. Bush signed into law the [Sarbanes-Oxley Act](/sarbanesoxleyact). The Act heightened the consequences for destroying, altering, or manufacturing financial statements and attempting to defraud shareholders.
