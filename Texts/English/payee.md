## What Is a Payee?

A payee is a party in an exchange of goods or services who receives payment. The payee is paid with cash, check, or one more transfer medium by a payer.

The name of the payee is remembered for the [bill of exchange](/billofexchange) and it normally alludes to a natural person or an entity like a business, [trust](/trust), or custodian.

## Understanding a Payee

In a transaction, there will be a party that gives the goods or services and the party that receives the goods or services. To receive goods or services a payer must give an exchange of value, which is most frequently money, to the payee.

In a banking situation, the payee must have an active account that is on favorable terms through which funds can be sent by the payer. This is, of course, in the event that the transaction isn't finished in cash.

On account of a [promissory note](/promissorynote), through which one party vows to pay another party a foreordained sum, the party getting the payment is known as the payee. The party spreading the word about the payment is as the payer. For [coupon](/coupon) payments from bonds, the party getting the coupon is the payee and the bond [issuer](/issuer) is alluded to as the payer.

[Investment management](/investment-management) transactions regularly have payee accounts that receive payments for the benefit of a client's separate account. For instance, in adding to a [individual retirement account](/ira) (IRA), a customer (e.g., John Smith) may compose a check from their checking account to their [investment management company](/management-investment-company), with the payee being the company's name getting the funds "For the Benefit of" (FBO) the client. This would show up as "XYZ Management FBO John Smith." The funds will ultimately be saved into John Smith's account as the payee, with XYZ Management being the custodian.

Payees may likewise be more than one party. This normally occurs in electronic transfers when a person pulls out money from the payer's account and parts it into an assortment of payee allocations. Contingent upon the banking institution, these types of transactions might have endorsement requirements for numbers, rates, and types of accounts.

In some cases, the payee and payer might be a similar party. This can happen when a person composes checks, sets aside withdrawals and installments, or electronically transfers funds starting with one of their accounts then onto the next.

It is a decent practice to guarantee that the payer and the payee are in agreement on the amount being transferred between gatherings to stay away from debates.

## Special Considerations

[Social Security](/socialsecurity) and [Supplemental Security Income](/ssi) (SSI) benefit payments are much of the time payable to a "representative payee" as opposed to the ultimate beneficiary (the person qualified for receive benefits).

A representative payee has rights and powers like that of a conventional payee, however a representative payee must oversee money for the benefit of the genuine beneficiary. Funds must be spent on (or put something aside for) just in manners that help the beneficiary. In this perspective, the representative is going about as the [fiduciary](/fiduciary) to the genuine payee.

Representative payees exist to take the burden of money management off the beneficiary's plate. An effective representative payee ought to work on the beneficiary's life. In the event that a representative payee is accomplishing something that neutralizes a ultimate beneficiary, the Social Security Administration ought to be promptly informed.
