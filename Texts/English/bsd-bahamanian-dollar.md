## What Is the Bahamian Dollar (BSD)?

The Bahamian dollar (BSD) is the national currency of the Commonwealth of The Bahamas. The Bahamian dollar is comprised of 100 pennies and is much of the time signified by the symbol B$ to recognize it from different currencies named in dollars. The value of the BSD is pegged on a 1-to-1 basis to the [U.S. dollar (USD)](/usd), with organizations in the Bahamas generally accepting either BSD or USD as legal tender.

Banknotes are accessible in denominations of 1, 3, 5, 10, 20, 50, and 100 dollars, while coins are accessible in denominations going from 1 penny to 1 dollar. Regardless of being managed by the Bahamas' central bank, the BSD is additionally utilized in the Turks and Caicos Islands.

## Figuring out the BSD

The Commonwealth of The Bahamas is a group of 700 islands of differing size in the Atlantic Ocean, just north of Cuba. Due to their location along the rich trade courses of the eighteenth century, the area saw continuous use by pirates.

The BSD has been the official currency of the Bahamas beginning around 1966, when it replaced the British pound (GBP) at a rate of 7 shillings for each BSD. The GBP was recently utilized in the Bahamas on the grounds that the nation had been a British state somewhere in the range of 1718 and 1973. Despite the fact that they just officially accomplished independence in 1973, the Bahamas started operating as a self-overseeing nation inside the British Commonwealth in 1964.

The BSD's paper banknotes portray conspicuous figures and scenes from the history and culture of the Bahamas. These incorporate legislators like the independence leader Sir Lynden O. Pindling, as well as important places, for example, Nassau Harbor and the headquarters of the Central Bank of The Bahamas.
