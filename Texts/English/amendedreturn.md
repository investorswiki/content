# Amended Return
## What is an amended return?
The phrase amended return alludes to changes made to a tax return from prior years. On the off chance that you committed an error on your tax return, filing an amended return with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) revises the errors.
## More profound definition
Taxpayers have three years to correct any mix-ups made on a tax return. In the mean time, the IRS performs random reviews of tax returns returning six years. In the event that the IRS accepts a taxpayer purposely presented a fraudulent return, there is no statute of limitations on resuming a file for auditing. IRS form 1040X is utilized to file amended returns.
Presenting an amended return won't cross paths with the IRS. In actuality, they urge taxpayers to file amended returns assuming that errors should be fixed. Purposes behind filing an amended return incorporate expecting to address filing status, erroneous total income or number of dependents, or to claim [tax deductions](/tax-allowance) or credits that were not claimed when the original return was filed.
Remember about state taxes. On the off chance that the need emerges to revise a federal tax return, it's ordinarily important to file an amended state return too. Likewise with the federal return, do it when you understand there's a problem to limit interest and punishments.
## Amended return example
In the event that a taxpayer misreported how much money she made or neglected to claim a dependent or a tax credit, an amended return can fix the situation. One situation in which you don't have to file an amended return is assuming that you find you made mathematical errors. The IRS naturally looks for, and amends, such errors.
