Bank B presently claims a pay creating asset: the 5% mortgage interest paid by John. John keeps on paying his mortgage since home prices are rising and his mortgage is contracting. He's building up equity that he can tap into sometime not too far off. Everyone wins.

Then, at that point, home prices begin falling. It turns out John borrowed beyond what he could manage, and the house is worth short of what he owes on it. John defaults on his mortgage. Bank B no longer gets the payments to which it is entitled. The house can be sold at a loss if by any means. Bank B's mortgage-backed security has turned into a toxic asset.
