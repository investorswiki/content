## What Is an Indication of Interest (IOI)?

An indication of interest (IOI) is a [underwriting](/underwriting) articulation showing a conditional, non-binding interest in buying a security that is at present in registration â€” anticipating endorsement by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The investor's broker is required to give the investor a preliminary prospectus. Notwithstanding, IOIs in the mergers and acquisitions world have comparable intent yet are done any other way.

## How an Indication of Interest (IOI) Works

In the securities and investing world, an indication of interest (IOI) is typically communicated in advance of a [IPO](/ipo) (initial public offering). It exhibits a conditional, non-binding interest in buying a security that is as of now anticipating regulatory endorsement (securities in the U.S. must be cleared by the SEC). The IOI is non-binding since it against the law illegal to sell a security while still in the registration cycle. The investor's stockbroker is required to furnish the investor with a preliminary prospectus. The IOI stays unassuming and isn't a commitment to buy.

An IOI involves articulations of trading interest that contain at least one of the accompanying components: the security name, whether the participant is buying or selling, the number of shares, capacity, or potentially price of the purchase or sale. Firms and broker-dealers can electronically convey or promote proprietary or client trading interest as IOIs to the marketplace, either through their own systems or through dedicated trading platforms.

Indications of interest for IPOs are usually accepted on a first-come, first-served basis. Since the demand for securities might surpass the supply available to circulate, putting an indication of interest doesn't guarantee you'll have the option to buy into an IPO.

## Indication of Interest (IOI) versus Letter of Intent (LOI)

An indication of interest (IOI) is an informal notice of an investor's interest in purchasing or gaining an asset. It is non-binding and less definitive than a [letter of intent](/letterofintent) (LOI). The indication of interest incorporates value ranges and less specific subtleties of the transaction. The IOI, preceding the LOI, starts the negotiation interaction.

Toward the finish of negotiations, the formal Letter of Intent (LOI) is made, characterizing the specific subtleties of the transaction. Like the IOI, it's anything but a legally binding agreement; rather, it communicates the investor's commitment to purchase a security and fills in as the foundation for the formal contract.

Upon survey, in the event that the seller acknowledges the terms of the LOI, an agreement can be made. Upon execution, the seller enters an exclusive agreement with the buyer, restricting them from drawing in with different buyers for a period.
