# Cum Dividend
## What Is Cum Dividend?

A stock is cum dividend, and that means "with dividend," when a company has declared that there will be a dividend later on however has not yet paid it out. A stock will trade cum dividend until the ex-dividend date. From that point onward, the stock trades without its dividend rights. At the point when the buyer receives the next dividend scheduled for distribution, the share is cum dividend.

## How Cum Dividend Works

Before the announcement of year-end results for companies, dates are set out for closing the register for dividend payments and [scrips](/scrip). These dates will decide the qualification for dividends and scrips. A scrip is a document recognizing a debt. Companies short on cash frequently pay scrip dividends rather than cash dividends.

Cum dividend is the situation with a [security](/security) when a company is planning to pay out a [dividend](/dividend) sometime in the not too distant future. The seller of a stock cum dividend is selling the right to the share and the right to the next dividend distribution. This situation frequently results from the timing of the sale instead of the preference of the seller.

> Stock price developments in light of the expected eventual fate of the company generally influence investment returns more than dividends.

To buy a share cum dividend, the buyer must complete the purchase before a certain point in the dividend period, called the [record date](/recorddate). Frequently, companies will require the sale to be completed two business days before the end of the period. Notwithstanding, a few corporations will push the cutoff time to the last day of the period. Assuming that the buyer completes the recording of the transaction in time, they will receive the possible distribution. On the off chance that the buyer misses the cutoff time, the share is sold ex-dividend, or without the right to the next distribution. The dates are set in view of the declaration date and recording date picked by the company that issues the stock.

There is no specific schedule for the release of dividends, and the [payment dates](/paymentdate) can fluctuate from one company to another. A few companies offer quarterly dividends, while others might pay dividends just a single time or two times every year. While it isn't average, a few companies pay dividends month to month.

## Special Considerations
### Declared Dividends

Cum dividend rights incorporate those associated with the next declared dividend. A declared dividend is the amount the board of directors has agreed upon through a movement approving the payments. Whenever they are declared, dividends successfully function as liabilities for the company. As dividends are a portion of a firm's profits, these amounts can change.

A company declares the dividend on the [declaration date](/declarationdate). Next, it sets a recording date that the buyer must meet for it to transfer the dividend. Frequently, a buyer must purchase a share no less than two business days before the recording date to get the dividend. This cutoff date is the ex-dividend date or ex-date. In the event that a buyer purchases a share after the ex-date, the seller sells it ex-dividend rather than cum dividend. In this case, the buyer would get the stock yet wouldn't be qualified for the distribution.

### Dividend Rights and Purchase Price

The price of the stock will change depending on in the event that it is cum dividend or ex-dividend. Since data on dividends is publicly accessible, it is incorporated into the share price under the [efficient market hypothesis](/efficientmarkethypothesis). A strategy of buying at the last conceivable date, gathering the dividend, and afterward selling the stock is excessively guileless to succeed.

## Example of Cum Dividend

Suppose an investor possesses 100 shares of ecommerce firm PricedToSell, and the company's board of directors has declared a quarterly dividend of $0.10 per share. The ex-dividend date is ten days away. The investor is thinking about selling their shares to finance another purchase. Assuming that they sell cum dividend, the buyer would receive the 100 shares at the current price and would be qualified for the $10 in dividend payouts.

Assume the seller holds off on selling during the cum dividend period, waiting to check whether different investments pan out. Those investments don't end up panning out, and the seller is forced to sell the 100 shares of PricedToSell. Be that as it may, the cum dividend date has passed, and the shares are ex-dividend. To mirror the loss of the dividend, the market price of the shares will be $10 lower, any remaining things being equivalent. While the buyer will not receive that quarter's distribution, they will be qualified for future distributions assuming they keep on holding the shares.
