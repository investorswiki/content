# USD/CHF (U.S. Dollar/Swiss Franc)
## What Is USD/CHF (U.S. Dollar/Swiss Franc)?

USD/CHF is the currency pair of the U.S. dollar and Swiss franc. The currency pair shows the number of Swiss francs (the quote currency) are expected to purchase one U.S. dollar (the [base currency](/basecurrency)). Trading the USD/CHF currency pair is otherwise called trading the "Swissie."

## Figuring out USD/CHF (U.S. Dollar/Swiss Franc)

CHF is the unique [currency code](/isocurrencycode) for the Swiss franc, and USD is the currency code for the U.S. dollar. Currencies are quoted in pairs, uncovering the amount of one currency it costs to buy the other.

The value of the USD/CHF is the number of francs it that takes to buy one USD. For instance, assuming the pair is trading at 1.05 it means that it takes 1.05 Swiss francs to buy one U.S. dollar. Assuming the rate is 0.9850, that means it takes 0.9850 francs to buy one USD.

The USD/CHF is impacted by factors that influence the value of the U.S. dollar or the Swiss franc according to one another and different currencies. Employment data and [gross domestic product](/gdp) (GDP), from the two countries, are two or three the economic indicators that fundamentally affect the currency pair.

The interest rate differential between the [Federal Reserve (Fed)](/federalreservebank) and the [Swiss National Bank](/swiss-national-bank) (SNB) will likewise influence this currency pair. For instance, when the Fed mediates in [open market operations](/openmarketoperations) to make the U.S. dollar more grounded, the value of the USD/CHF could increase, due to a reinforcing of the U.S. dollar when compared to the Swiss franc.

Then again, assuming the Swiss National Bank raises interest rates, that could draw more investors to the franc and in this way increase its value. In this case, the USD/CHF rate would fall since it will take less francs to buy the USD.

The USD/CHF will in general have a negative [correlation](/correlation) with the EUR/USD (euro/USD) and GBP/USD (British pound/USD) currency pairs. This is due to the positive correlation of the [euro](/euro), Swiss franc, and the British pound.

## Recent Price History of USD/CHF

The Swiss franc is a safe haven currency, importance in times of global economic stress or high volatility the franc will frequently appreciate. The Swiss franc and [Japanese yen](/jpy-japanese-yen) are viewed as the two most famous safe-haven currency trades. This is on the grounds that Switzerland is generally viewed as stable financially and politically.

During the beginning phases of the [Great Recession](/great-recession), the Swiss franc appreciated against all major trading partners separated from the Japanese yen. Between the beginning of 2007 and mid-2008 the USD fell against the CHF, in spite of the fact that as the selling in the U.S. stock market escalated in late 2008, more investors began flowing once again into the USD, seeing it as a relatively safer bet than the CHF.

Once more after 2009, the USD declined against the CHF, with the pair continuing to drop into the 2011 low at 0.7066. From that point forward, the USD picked up upside speed and the pair has traded somewhere in the range of 0.83 and 1.0344 somewhere in the range of 2012 and 2021.

In 2015, the USD/CHF was trading close to 1.20 when the SNB pulled the floor they had set on theEUR/CHF pair. The EUR/CHF plunged, as did the USD/CHF to 0.83. The quick plunge created enormous disturbance in the currency markets as numerous global forex brokers failed or required a bailout as a result of trader losses. The occurrence caused far reaching reform, fundamentally the lowering of [leverage](/leverage) accessible in numerous countries.

## Deciphering USD/CHF Price Fluctuations

In the event that the rate of the USD/CHF is 0.90 and the rates climbs to 1.05, then the USD has appreciated against the CHF in light of the fact that it currently costs more CHF to buy one USD.

Then again, assuming the rate falls from 1.03 to 0.99, it currently costs less CHF to buy one USD, so the CHF has appreciated or the USD has fallen relative to the CHF.

The USD/CHF rate shows the number of CHF it takes to buy one USD, yet a traveler going to Switzerland might need to know the number of U.S. dollars it takes to buy one CHF. This requires knowing the CHF/USD rate (codes are flipped). To get the CHF/USD rate, partition one by the USD/CHF rate.

For instance, if the USD/CHF rate is 0.9350, to get the CHF/USD rate partition one by 0.9350. The outcome is a CHF/USD rate of 1.0695. This rate tells the traveler that it costs US$1.0695 to buy one CHF. This seems OK since we know from the USD/CHF rate that the CHF was more important than the USD on the grounds that it costs short of what one franc to buy a dollar.

Keep at the top of the priority list while voyaging or while getting physical currency, banks and [currency exchange](/currency-exchange) houses will commonly charge 3 to 5 percent and will work this into the price of the currency. Consequently, our traveler making a beeline for Switzerland probably will not get the real-time forex market rate of US$1.0695 for each CHF (equivalent to USD/CHF rate of 0.9350). All things considered, the currency exchange will probably charge an extra 4%, for instance, carrying the rate to US$1.1123 for each CHF rather than $1.0695.
