# Indirect Quote
## What Is an Indirect Quote?

The term indirect quote is a currency quotation in the [foreign exchange market](/foreign-exchange-markets) that expresses the variable amount of foreign currency required to buy or sell one unit of the domestic currency. An indirect quote is otherwise called a "quantity quotation," since it expresses the quantity of foreign currency required to buy units of the domestic currency. All in all, the domestic currency is the [base currency](/basecurrency) in an indirect quote, while the foreign currency is the [counter currency](/counter-currency).

## Figuring out Indirect Quotes

An indirect quote is the inverse, or reciprocal, of a [direct quote](/directquote), otherwise called a "price quotation," which expresses the price of one unit of a foreign currency in terms of a variable number of units of the domestic currency.

As the U.S. dollar ([USD](/usd-US dollar)) is the prevailing currency in global foreign exchange markets, the convention is to generally utilize direct quotes that have the U.S. dollar as the base currency and different currencies — like the Canadian dollar ([CAD](/cad-canadian-dollar)), Japanese yen ([JPY](/jpy-japanese-yen)) and Indian rupee ([INR](/inr)) — as the counter currency. Exemptions for this rule are the [euro](/euro) and Commonwealth currencies like the British pound (GBP), Australian dollar ([AUD](/aud-usd-australian-dollar-us-dollar-currency-pair)) and New Zealand dollar ([NZD](/nzd-new-zealand-dollar)), which are regularly quoted in indirect form (for instance [GBP](/gbp) 1 = USD 1.30).

Consider the case of the CAD, which we accept for a moment that is trading at 1.2500 to the U.S. dollar. In Canada, the indirect form of this quote would be C$1 = US$0.8000 (for example 1/1.2500). Nonetheless, the conventional quotation in [foreign exchange markets](/foreign-exchange-markets) is 1.2500, which is an indirect quote from the U.S. point of view since it shows the amount of a foreign currency (CAD) is required to get 1 USD. On the other hand, USD 0.8000 would be a direct quote.

In an indirect quote, a lower [exchange rate](/exchangerate) suggests that the domestic currency is deteriorating, or becoming more fragile. Continuing with the above model, if the USD/CAD quotation presently changes to US$1 = C$1.2300 (indirect quote), then, at that point, that means the USD (domestic currency) has gotten more fragile as less CAD would be expected to get 1 USD. The direct quote, which is 0.8130 (1/1.2300), shows that 1 CAD will get you USD 0.8130, instead of 0.8000.

## Currency Crosses

What might be said about cross-currency rates, which express the price of one currency in terms of a currency other than the U.S. dollar? A trader or investors ought to initially find out which type of quotation is being utilized — direct or indirect — to accurately price the cross-rate.

For instance, if USD/JPY is quoted at 100, and USD/CAD is quoted at 1.2700, what is the quotation of CAD/JPY from both the Canadian and Japanese points of view.

CAD/JPY (conventional quote) = USD/JPY \u00f7 USD/CAD

In this way, in the event that domestic currency is CAD,

1 CAD (indirect) = 100 \u00f7 1.2700 = 78.74 JPY

what's more,

in the event that domestic currency is JPY,

Along these lines, 1 JPY (indirect) = 1.2700 \u00f7 100 = 0.0127 CAD
