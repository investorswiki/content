# Manipulation
## What Is Manipulation?

Market manipulation is conduct intended to misdirect investors by controlling or misleadingly influencing the price of securities. Manipulation is illegal generally speaking, yet it tends to be hard for regulators and different specialists to recognize and demonstrate.

Market manipulation might include factually false statements also, yet it generally looks to influence prices to delude other market participants.

## Manipulation Methods

Manipulation is more challenging for the more [liquid](/liquidity), or widely traded securities. It is a lot simpler to control a [penny stock](/pennystock) with a small common daily trading volume than the share price of a [large-cap](/large-cap) company with daily turnover valued in billions of dollars.

The [pump-and-dump](/pumpanddump) is a market manipulation frequently used to misleadingly blow up the price of a microcap stock before selling it. More uncommon is the inverse [poop-and-scoop](/poopandscoop) scheme, in which false derogatory statements are made about a stock to buy it for as little as possible. There's likewise the short-and-mutilate assortment, basically a crap and-scoop executed by short-sellers all together o profit.

While such schemes depend essentially on promotion or factual misstatements they are much of the time enhanced by illegal trading tactics intended to hoodwink.

One common means is [order spoofing](/spoofy), which includes the setting of various buy or sell orders intended to move the price of the stock, then, at that point, dropping them once different traders have moved their own [bids](/bid) or [asks](/ask) in like manner. Order spoofing has enticed staff at large Wall Street firms alongside obscure daytraders, and can occur in the bond and metals markets as well as in the stock market.

## Currency Manipulation

Currency manipulation is an allegation frequently required in trade or [exchange rate](/exchangerate) questions, remarkably by the U.S. against trading partners who are at times claimed to set the exchange rate of their currency against the U.S. dollar misleadingly low to support [exports](/send out). Legislatures and [central banks](/centralbank) can be blamed for currency manipulation assuming they fix the exchange rate or look to influence it less transparently with market transactions every once in a while.

Currency manipulation is a political term as opposed to a legal one in light of the fact that foreign exchange policies are set by sovereign countries. Currencies are [fixed](/fixedexchangerate) or allowed to [float](/clean-float) for different internal and outer intentions, while currency manipulation claims are quite often the consequence of dissatisfaction with trade flows. Subsequently, regardless of whether a currency manipulation is occurring is much of the time a subjective judgment.

The U.S. Treasury makes a semiannual report to Congress on the macroeconomic and foreign exchange policies of major U.S. trading partners as per the Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act of 1988. The report utilizes evaluation criteria explained in the Trade Facilitation and Trade Enforcement Act of 2015. The December 2021 report finished up no major U.S. trading partner controlled its currency's exchange rate against the U.S. dollar to gain an unfair competitive advantage in international trade, while singling out Vietnam and Taiwan for extra examination.

## Illustration of Currency Manipulation Claim

On August 5, 2019, the [People's Bank of China](/people groups bank-china-pboc) (PBOC) set the Chinese yuan's daily reference rate over 7 yuan for every dollar without precedent for more than a decade, devaluing the Chinese currency against the dollar and making Chinese exports cheaper in dollar terms. The rate was set after the announcement by the Trump administration of new [tariffs](/tax) of 10% on $300 billion worth of Chinese imports, which became real Sept. 1, 2019.

That very day the yuan exchange rate bested 7 for every dollar, the Trump administration named China a currency controller, an assignment lifted a couple of months after the fact. The tariffs on Chinese exports, in any case, stayed in place as of January 2022.
