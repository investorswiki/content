## What Is Company-Owned Life Insurance (COLI)?

Company-owned life insurance (COLI) is a [life insurance](/lifeinsurance) policy that pays a benefit to the company assuming an insured employee bites the dust.

## Understanding Company-Owned Life Insurance (COLI)

Company-owned life insurance (COLI), likewise alluded to as corporate-owned life insurance, is a policy taken out on at least one critical employees. The company pays the insurance [premiums](/insurance-premium) and receives the [death benefit](/deathbenefit) in the event that a covered employee passes on.

COLI policies are a way for a company to limit its tax burden, increase after-tax net income, finance employee benefits, and assist with covering the expenses associated with supplanting an insured employee upon that employee's death. COLI policies normally keep on covering employees up to the year after they leave the company.

## COLI Requirements

Since certain companies utilized COLI policies to take advantage of tax provisos, the [Internal Revenue Service](/irs) (IRS) presently expects that they meet certain conditions to receive a tax-free death benefit. For instance, the company can purchase COLI policies for the top 35% of employees, positioned by their compensation. Furthermore, it must tell the employee recorded as a hard copy of the terms of the policy and get their written consent before purchasing.

## History of COLI

COLI first appeared as a way for companies to guarantee against the death of a [key employee](/key-employee), like a high level executive. Be that as it may, tax [loopholes](/proviso) made COLI exceptionally interesting to many companies. Companies endeavoring to take advantage of those escape clauses started purchasing policies on lower-positioning employees without telling them and kept on paying premiums even after they left the company.

The practice arrived at its top during the 1980s while decreasing regulation incited a few companies to protect a majority of their employees, borrow against the cash value of the policies, and deduct the interest on the loans.

In the late 1980s and 1990s, Congress answered by passing laws that require employee consent and an "insurable interest" with respect to the company. This implied that companies needed to show the potential for loss due to an employee's death to legitimize the purchase of a COLI policy. Simultaneously, the IRS decreased the ability of a company to deduct interest payments while borrowing against the policies.

Companies would frequently claim that they spent the payouts on employee benefits; in any case, there was no requirement to do as such. The companies didn't even have to uncover how they spent the money.

In the first decade of the 2000s, large corporations paid huge number of dollars to settle lawsuits from family individuals from deceased employees who contended that the practice was unlawful. Later, Congress passed the COLI Best Practices Provision, as part of the [Pension Protection Act of 2006](/pensionprotectionact2006), which presented conditions for tax-free benefits. Therefore, while COLI policies actually offer financial benefits to employers, they are subject to greater regulation.
