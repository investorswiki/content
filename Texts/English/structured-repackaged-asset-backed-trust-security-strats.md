## What Is a Structured Repackaged Asset-Backed Trust Security (STRATS)?

A structured repackaged asset-backed trust security (STRATS) is a derivative product that pays an income stream to the holder in view of a trust's interest in a [asset-backed security](/asset-backedsecurity) (ABS) and a connected derivative product.

Structured Repackaged Asset-Backed Trust Securities (STRATS) were developed by Wachovia Bank in 2005. Investors who purchase STRATS in fact buy shares of a [trust](/trust), which pays investors income in light of a combination of the trust's interest in a capital security and a derivative product. The complexity of the name offers an indication of the complexity of the underlying product.

The trust puts together its payments to investors with respect to the income streams derived from the two parts.

## Wells Fargo's Controversial STRATS Issue

Albeit the prospectus for the STRATS series contained a warning about substantial losses on the off chance that JPMorgan recovered the security early, the bank supposedly showcased the product as a conservative investment. After Wells Fargo retained a portion of JPMorgan's payoff as compensation for the early cancellation of the interest rate swap, in which JPMorgan likewise filled in as a counterparty, investors assumed a substantial loss on their shares.

While Wells Fargo demanded the prospectus for the product contained adequate warning for investors, FINRA decided the firm had failed to prepare its brokers about the risks inherent in the product. A few specialists contended at the time that Wells Fargo ought to have made its warnings about the risk more noticeable in its [prospectus](/prospectus). To stay away from such negative surprises, retail investors ought to continuously research investment products to guarantee they see every one of their components and read the prospectus carefully before focusing on an investment.
