# Judgmental Credit Analysis
## What Is Judgmental Credit Analysis?

Judgmental [credit analysis](/creditanalysis) is a method of supporting or turning down regarding credit in view of the moneylender's judgment as opposed to on a specific credit scoring model. Judgmental credit analysis involves assessing the borrower's application and utilizing prior experience dealing with comparative candidates to determine credit endorsement. This interaction tries not to utilize any [algorithms](/calculation) or empirical processes to determine endorsements.

## Breaking Down Judgmental Credit Analysis

Judgmental credit analysis is utilized generally by more modest banks. While large banks frequently have more automated credit processes, due to the volume of applications they receive, more modest banks will utilize judgmental credit analysis, as it isn't efficient for them to create a [credit scoring](/credit_scoring) system or hire an outsider to lay out credit scores. The judgmental credit analysis is unique in its approach and depends on traditional standards of credit analysis, for example, payment history, bank references, age, and different components. These are scored and weighted to give an overall credit score, which the credit issuer utilizes.

## Various Types of Credit Scores

However judgmental credit analysis functions admirably for more modest banks, the vast majority are more acquainted with the concept of a credit score, and most normally associate it with the [FICO](/fico-fair-isaac) or the Fair Isaac Corporation, which made the most regularly utilized credit score model. Larger scale banks and lenders use a credit score model that utilizes a statistical number to assess a shopper's creditworthiness. Lenders then use credit scores to assess the likelihood that an individual will repay their debts. A person's credit score goes from 300 to 850. The higher the score, the more monetarily reliable a person is viewed as. While there are other credit-scoring systems, the [FICO score](/ficoscore) is by a wide margin the most generally utilized.

A credit score assumes a key part in a bank's decision to offer credit. For instance, those with credit scores below 640 are generally viewed as [subprime borrowers](/subprime-borrower). Lending institutions frequently charge interest on [subprime mortgages](/subprime_mortgage) at a rate higher than a conventional mortgage to repay themselves for carrying more risk. They may likewise require a more limited repayment term or a co-underwriter for borrowers with a low credit score. On the other hand, a credit score of 700 or above is generally viewed as great and may bring about a borrower getting a lower interest rate, which brings about them paying less money in interest over the life of the loan.

Each creditor characterizes its own reaches for credit scores, however while computing a credit score, a [credit bureau](/creditbureau) utilizes five fundamental factors: payment history, total amount owed, length of credit history, types of credit, and new credit. Consumers can have high scores by keeping a long history of paying their bills on time and keeping their debt low.
