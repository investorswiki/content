## What Is Runoff?

In the past, the term "runoff" referred to the system of printing end-of-day prices for each stock on an exchange onto [ticker tape](/tickertape).

Since genuine ticker tape isn't utilized any longer, the runoff period is currently used to depict trades toward the finish of a session that may not be announced or reported until the beginning of the next session.

## Grasping Runoff

In the times of paper ticker tape, stock trades that occurred at the finish of the trading day — and in this manner which addressed the [closing price](/closingprice) of a stock for the afternoon — were inputted into a simple system and afterward fed to ticker tapes around the world for reporting. Newspapers, for instance, would depend on the runoff to print [stock quotes](/stockquote) in the next morning's newspaper. The runoff could last for several minutes or even hours and produce yards of physical paper documentation.

Ticker tape from the runoff was in many cases cut and saved to function as confetti, to be tossed from the windows above marches, principally in lower Manhattan. Ticker tape marches frequently praised some critical event, like the closures of World War I and World War II, or the safe return of one of the early space travelers or a triumphant host group's title.

## History of Ticker Tape and Runoff

Ticker tape itself was a paper strip that ran through a machine called a stock ticker, which printed abbreviated company names as alphabetic images followed by numeric stock transaction price and volume data. The term "ticker" came from the sound made by the machine as it printed.

More up to date and better tickers opened up during the 1930s, however they actually had a surmised 15-to-20-minute deferral. Ticker tape became obsolete during the 1960s, as TV and PCs were progressively used to transmit financial data. Despite the fact that paper ticker tape is not generally utilized, the concept of ticker tape lives on in the looking over electronic ticker sheets tracked down on the walls of numerous offices across the country.
