# Maximum Loan-To-Value Ratio
## What Is a Maximum Loan-To-Value Ratio?

A maximum loan-to-value ratio is the largest allowable ratio of a loan's size to the dollar value of the property. The higher the loan-to-value ratio, the bigger the portion of the purchase price of a house is financed. Since the house is [collateral](/collateral) for the loan, the [loan-to-value ratio](/loantovalue) is a measure of risk utilized by lenders. Different loan programs are seen to have different risk factors, and along these lines, have different maximum loan-to-value ratios.

## Figuring out a Maximum Loan-To-Value Ratio

A maximum loan-to-value ratio will be different for each type of business and each type of asset. While deciding a maximum loan-to-value ratio, a lender needs to guarantee that it can recover any losses on the off chance that the borrower defaults and it needs to sell the asset to cover the unpaid portion of the loan. The lower the maximum loan-to-value ratio is, the less risk the lender is taking on in light of the fact that they are putting up less money. Maximum loan-to-value ratios are much of the time utilized in home loans and auto loans.

Some home loan programs consider a high maximum loan-to-value ratio and are planned explicitly for low-to moderate-pay and [first-time home buyers](/firsttimehomebuyer). A significant number of these programs are sponsored by state and nearby legislatures, the [Federal Housing Administration](/federal-housing-administration) (FHA), and the Veterans Administration. It is shrewd for a borrower to investigate these options before choosing any one lender's high loan-to-value program.

The combination of a mortgage loan alongside a [down payment](/down_payment) is utilized to buy a permanent place to stay for most home buyers. The property fills in as collateral for the loan thus in the event the purchaser can never again make the loan payments, the lender claims the property. The lender can then sell the property and utilize the proceeds to repay themselves in the amount of the borrowed money. In the loan endorsement process, the lender puts a maximum allowable amount on the loan versus the property value since, in such a case that the loan is too big a portion of the property value, the bank will most likely be unable to get the whole value back in the event of a borrower [default](/default2).

## Deciding a Good Maximum Loan-To-Value Ratio

Working out a loan-to-value ratio is direct. You partition the amount of the loan by the purchase price of the asset. Deciding the maximum loan-to-value ratio is an exercise lenders choose in light of a number of factors, for example, the borrower's credit profile and the ability to sell the asset to recover the loan amount in case of a default.

Each asset will have an alternate maximum loan-to-value ratio. For homes in the U.S., it is standard for a home buyer to make a down payment of 20%, implying that they should borrow 80%. For instance, if a home costs $200,000, and the home buyer can make a downpayment of 20%, they put in $40,000 of their own money, and the remainder, $160,000, is borrowed through a lender as a [mortgage](/mortgage). In this case, the loan-to-value ratio is 0.80 (160,000/200,000), or 80%. This is generally viewed as the maximum loan-to-value ratio for a mortgage. The less the bank needs to loan means that in the event that the borrower defaults, there is a higher probability it will actually want to sell the asset at a cost that will cover the loan.

On the off chance that you ask for a higher loan amount for a mortgage, you might have to get private [mortgage insurance](/mortgage-insurance) (PMI) to safeguard the lender, which is an additional cost. Or on the other hand you might have a higher interest rate on your loan, likewise expanding the cost. In the event that a mortgage is gotten through the Federal Housing Administration (FHA), the maximum loan-to-value ratio is regularly 97%.
