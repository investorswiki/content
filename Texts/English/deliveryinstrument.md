## What Is a Delivery Instrument?

A delivery instrument is a contractual document that is traded as part of a [commodity futures](/commodityfuturescontract) contract. It qualifies the holder for physical delivery of a predetermined quantity of the commodity being referred to, for example, soybeans on account of soybean futures contracts.

Delivery instruments are an important part of the commodity futures trading system, since they can be handily transferred between various owners of the [futures contracts](/futures). This makes it feasible for traders to buy and sell futures effectively, without at any point essentially meaning to take physical possession of their [underlying](/underlying) commodities.

## How Delivery Instruments Work

The commodity futures markets today are a large and lively marketplace where industrial customers, examiners, and middle people consistently trade a wide assortment of physical commodities. Through organized exchanges like the [Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME)](/cme), market participants consistently trade billions of dollars' worth of energy products, agricultural commodities, and financial instruments, with new commodities being added on a continuous basis.

One of the key mainstays of these commodities markets is the participation of financial examiners. These traders consistently buy and sell futures contracts, expecting to profit from accurately foreseeing the future heading of commodity prices. Yet, not at all like industrial customers who depend on these commodities for their standard business operations, examiners have no aim of one or the other making or getting delivery of the commodities they trade.

In spite of the fact that their association might appear to be unusual from the outset, examiners are an important part of the financial-market ecosystem as a result of the [liquidity](/liquidity) they give. As a result of this liquidity, other market participants who really do deliver and receive the physical commodities can benefit from more [efficient pricing](/marketefficiency) for their trades.

Delivery instruments are key to participation of theorists. By permitting traders to effortlessly transfer the right to receive physical delivery, examiners can rapidly release themselves from the obligation to make or receive delivery by selling their futures contracts — and with it, the delivery instrument — to another buyer.

> Delivery instruments frequently appear as a shipping receipt or a receipt from a warehouse holding the commodity.

## Genuine Example of a Delivery Instrument

To outline, think about the case of soybean futures. Three of the key parties associated with the soybean futures market are the companies that need to buy physical soybeans for their business operations, the examiners who buy and sell soybean futures contracts without planning to take delivery of them, and the companies that store and ship the soybeans to whichever party at last takes delivery of them.

In the CME market for Soybean Futures, one contract qualifies the buyer for 5,000 bushels of soybeans. At a weight of around 136 metric tons, it isn't is business as usual that most examiners would be very hesitant to acknowledge physical delivery of these soybeans. Consequently, it is far from impossible that a group of examiners could exchange soybean futures contracts among themselves several times, with next to no of them truly taking delivery of the underlying commodity. In that situation, the warehouse company in which the soybeans are stored would leave the soybeans immaculate.

Thusly, it is not difficult to imagine for a batch of soybeans to legally change hands several times through examiners buying and selling its futures contracts before an industrial customer ultimately purchases them and has them delivered to its factory. In the meantime, the delivery instrument would be routinely changing hands yet would just be practiced toward the end by the customer taking delivery.
