# Emissions Reduction Purchase Agreement (ERPA)
## What Is an Emissions Reduction Purchase Agreement (ERPA)?

An Emissions Reduction Purchase Agreement (ERPA) is a legal contract between substances who buy and sell [carbon credits](/carbon_credit). A carbon credit is a permit or certificate that permits the holder to transmit carbon dioxide (CO~2~) or other ozone harming substances (GHG) into the environment.

In a type of trade-off, a buyer of carbon credits pays cash for the right to emanate more than the level of CO~2~ allocated by the [Kyoto Protocol](/kyoto), and the seller receives cash for the obligation to create less CO~2~. To execute this agreement, the two players must sign an ERPA document.

The Kyoto Protocol — endorsed in Kyoto, Japan, in 1997 by 192 industrialized countries — is the nearest thing we have to a working global agreement to fight climate change. Countries that sanction the Kyoto Protocol are assigned a maximum limit of CO~2~ emissions levels. Producing more than the assigned limit will bring about a penalty for the disregarding country as a lower emissions limit for the accompanying period. Nonetheless, if a country needs to discharge more GHG than its permitted limit (without penalty), then, at that point, it might take part in [carbon trading](/carbontrade) utilizing an ERPA.

## Understanding Emissions Reduction Purchase Agreements (ERPAs)

The Emissions Reduction Purchase Agreement between the buyer and seller of carbon credits is an essential document for designers of carbon-offset projects. It recognizes liabilities, rights, and obligations to oversee project risks. It additionally characterizes the commercial terms of the project including price, volume, and delivery schedule of emissions reductions.

The standards for ERPAs are illustrated by the International Emissions Trading Association (IETA), a nonprofit organization made in 1999 to serve organizations participated in trading carbon credits.

An ERPA generally includes two countries. Nonetheless, it likewise may happen between a country and a large corporation. Frequently, the seller has executed new technology or developed another project that he expects will bring down his ozone harming substance emissions, so the seller wouldn't require as numerous carbon credits and can profit by selling them.

ERPAs are frequently confirmed among buyers and middle people who address community gatherings. In these cases, albeit the ERPA is an official contract between the buyer and intermediary, the agreement between the seller and community individuals is many times less clear. Consequently it is important to guarantee that anything agreement is made between individual project participants and the intermediary is distinct and surely known by all gatherings.

> ERPA Agreements likewise assist emerging nations with building a history, like a credit score, of generating and selling carbon credits, or applying them to their own emanation reduction. ERPAs can assist with animating climate-cognizant activities in non-industrial nations by giving huge financial incentives to partake in emanation reductions.

- General obligations of seller: For instance, seller is responsible for satisfying verification and confirmation; executing a monitoring plan; general operations of the project; and delivering emissions reductions to buyer
- General obligations of buyer: For instance, buyer is responsible for laying out an account to receive delivery of emissions reductions; pay for the emissions reductions; and speak with applicable regulatory bodies

## The Market for Trading Carbon Credits

Buying and selling carbon credits is moderately direct and might be compared to buying and selling shares in a stock market.
