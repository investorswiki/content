## What Is Facultative Reinsurance?

Facultative [reinsurance](/reinsurance) is coverage purchased by a primary insurer to cover a single risk — or a block of risks — held in the primary insurer's book of business. Facultative reinsurance is one of two types of reinsurance (the other type of reinsurance is called treaty reinsurance). Facultative reinsurance is viewed as to a greater degree a one-time transactional deal, while treaty reinsurance is regularly part of a long-term arrangement of coverage between two parties.

## How Facultative Reinsurance Works

An insurance company that goes into a reinsurance contract with a reinsurance company — otherwise called a [ceding company](/ceding-company) — does as such to pass off a portion of their risk in exchange for a fee. This fee might be a portion of the premium the insurer gets for a policy. The primary insurer that surrenders risk to the reinsurer has the option of either ceding specific risks or a block of risks. Reinsurance contract types determine whether the [reinsurer](/reinsurer) can acknowledge or dismiss an individual risk, or on the other hand if the reinsurer must acknowledge every one of the predefined risks.

Facultative reinsurance permits the reinsurance company to audit individual risks and determine whether to acknowledge or dismiss them. The profitability of a reinsurance company relies on how shrewdly it picks its customers. In a facultative reinsurance arrangement, the ceding company and the reinsurer make a facultative certificate that demonstrates that the reinsurer is accepting a given risk.

Insurance companies hoping to surrender risk to a reinsurer may find that facultative reinsurance contracts are more costly than treaty reinsurance. This is on the grounds that [treaty reinsurance](/treaty-reinsurance) covers a "book" of risks. This is an indicator that the relationship between the ceding company and the reinsurer is expected to turn into a long-term relationship (versus if the reinsurer just needs to cover a single risk in a one-off transaction). While the increased cost is a burden, a facultative reinsurance arrangement might permit the ceding company to reinsure specific risks that it might somehow not have the option to take on.

## Treaty Reinsurance versus Facultative Reinsurance

Both treaty and facultative reinsurance contracts can be written on a proportional or overabundance of-misfortune basis (or a combination of both).

Treaty reinsurance is a broad agreement covering some portion of a particular class (or class of business), like an insurer's whole laborers' compensation or property business. Reinsurance settlements naturally cover all risks, written by the insured, that fall inside treaty terms — except if they specifically reject certain openings.

While treaty reinsurance doesn't need survey of individual risks by the reinsurer, it requests a careful survey of the underwriting philosophy, practice, and historical experience of the ceding insurer.

Facultative reinsurance contracts are considerably more engaged in nature. They cover individual underlying policies, and they are written on a policy-specific basis. A facultative agreement covers a specific risk of the ceding insurer. A reinsurer and ceding insurer must settle on terms and conditions for every individual contract. Facultative reinsurance agreements frequently cover catastrophic or unusual risk openings.

Since it is so specific, facultative reinsurance requires the utilization of substantial faculty and technical resources for underwriting activities.

## Benefits of Facultative Reinsurance

By covering itself against a single risk — or a block of risks — reinsurance gives the insurer greater security for its equity and [solvency](/solvency) (and greater stability when unusual or major events happen).

Reinsurance likewise permits an insurer to endorse policies, covering a larger volume of risks without unreasonably raising the costs of covering their solvency edges — the amount by which the assets of the insurance company, at fair values, are considered to surpass its liabilities and other comparable commitments. As a matter of fact, reinsurance makes substantial liquid assets available for insurers in case of uncommon losses.

## Illustration of Facultative Reinsurance

Assume a standard insurance provider issues a policy on major commercial real estate, for example, a large corporate office building. The policy is written for $35 million, meaning the original insurer faces a potential $35 million in liability on the off chance that the building is severely harmed. However, the insurer accepts it can't bear to pay out more than $25 million.

Thus, before even consenting to issue the policy, the insurer must search for facultative reinsurance and try the market until it gets takers for the excess $10 million. The insurer could get bits of the $10 million from 10 unique reinsurers. In any case, without that, it can't consent to issue the policy. When it has the agreement from the companies to cover the $10 million and is sure it might possibly cover the full amount should a claim come in, it can issue the policy.
