## What Is an Annual Clean-Up?

An annual clean-up is a banking practice that requires a borrower to pay off all balances of any renewable lines of credit and keep them at zero for 30 to 60 days or even 90 successive days during a year period. Albeit the annual clean-up is a long-time custom, it's turning out to be less considered normal these days. Clean-ups aren't typically required on [secured credit](/securedcard) cards or lines.

The clean-up shows that credit lines are being utilized exclusively during periods of pinnacle cash requirements and are not required for the normal financing of the business.

Clean-up requirements are not required by most lenders. A considerable lot of the present banking institutions don't ask customers to "clean up" lines of credit on the off chance that clients' accounts are up-to-date and [principal](/principal) and [interest](/interest) payments are paid on time.

There can be different expectations during an annual clean-up period, for example, not bringing about [overdrafts](/overdraft) for 30 or 60 days for every year that the customer utilizes their revolving credit extension.

Another requirement may be that an outstanding balance stays inside a predefined limit. For instance, a customer might be held under an imperative that for 60 days in a year period, their principal balance can't go past a set percentage of their full credit extension. These requirements would force the customer to one or the other pay down the balance or limit the utilization of their credit extension.
