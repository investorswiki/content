- Anything you spend for services your plan doesn't cover
- Out-of-network care and services

You ought to likewise be careful to use in-network healthcare providers to control the costs of your healthcare, on the grounds that out-of-network costs don't count toward your out-of-pocket maximum.

Likewise, costs that aren't viewed as covered expenses don't count toward the out-of-pocket maximum. For instance, if the insured pays $2,000 for an elective medical procedure that isn't covered, that amount won't count toward the maximum. This means that you could wind up paying more than the out-of-pocket limit in a given year.

### Out-of-pocket maximum limits

- For the 2022 plan year: The out-of-pocket limit for a Marketplace plan can't be more than $8,700 for an individual and $17,400 for a family.

For instance, [Health Insurance Marketplace](/medical coverage marketplace) Bronze and Silver [health plans](/wellbeing plan-classifications) generally have lower month to month premiums and higher out-of-pocket limits. The Gold and Platinum plans, which have higher month to month premiums, normally have lower out-of-pocket limits.

## Out-of-Pocket Maximum versus Deductible

An out-of-pocket maximum is not the same as a plan's [deductible](/deductible).

The money you pay for covered services goes toward your deductible first. The deductible is the amount you must pay before your insurance kicks in. Then, at that point, when you've met the deductible, you might be responsible for a percentage of covered costs (this is called coinsurance). These payments count toward your out-of-pocket maximum. At the point when you arrive at that amount, the insurance plan pays 100% of covered expenses.

## Out-of-Pocket Maximum Example

This is an illustration of the way out-of-pocket maximums work. Suppose your out-of-pocket maximum is $6,000, your deductible is $4,500, and your coinsurance is 40%.

In the event that you take care of a medical procedure that costs $10,000, you'll initially pay your $4,500 deductible, which then leaves a $5,500 bill. Since your coinsurance is 40%, you would owe another $2,200, and the insurance company would cover the leftover $3,300 — that is, in the event that you didn't have an out-of-pocket maximum.

Nonetheless, your annual expenses are capped at $6,000. You've proactively paid $4,500, so you pay just $1,500 of the $5,500 balance. The insurance company picks up the excess $4,000. Your total cost for the medical procedure is $6,000, and follow-up visits with your in-network doctor are paid by your insurance since you've previously met your out-of-pocket maximum for the year.
