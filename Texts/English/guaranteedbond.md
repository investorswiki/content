## What Is a Guaranteed Bond?

A guaranteed bond is a debt security that offers a secondary guarantee that interest and principal payments will be made by a third party, should the issuer default due to reasons like insolvency or bankruptcy. A guaranteed bond can be of either the municipal or corporate assortment. It very well may be backed by a bond insurance company, a fund or group entity, a government authority, or the corporate parents of auxiliaries or joint endeavors that are giving bonds.

## How a Guaranteed Bond Works

Corporate and [municipal bonds](/municipalbond) are financial instruments utilized by companies or government agencies to raise funds. In effect, they are loans: The responsible entity is borrowing money from investors who buy the bonds. This loan goes on for a certain period of time — however long the bond term is — after which the bondholders are reimbursed their principal (that is, the amount they . initially invested). During the life of the bond the responsible entity makes periodic interest payments, known as [coupons](/coupon), to bondholders as a return on their investment.

Nonetheless, bonds have an inherent risk of default, as the responsible corporation or municipality might have lacking cash flow to satisfy its interest and principal payment obligations. This means that a bondholder misses out on periodic interest payments, and — in the worst situation imaginable of the issuer defaulting — might very well never get their principal back, by the same token.

To relieve any default risk and give credit enhancement to its bonds, a responsible entity might search out an extra guarantee for the bond it plans to issue, consequently, making a guaranteed bond. A guaranteed bond is a bond that has its opportune interest and principal payments backed by a third party, for example, a bank or insurance company. The guarantee on the bond eliminates default risk by making a back-up payer if the issuer is unable to satisfy its obligation. In a situation by which the issuer can't follow through with its interest payments or potentially principal repayments, the [guarantor](/guarantor) would step in and make the essential payments sooner rather than later.

The issuer pays the guarantor a premium for its protection, generally going from 1% to 5% of the total issue.

## Benefits and Disadvantages of Guaranteed Bonds

Guaranteed bonds are viewed as extremely safe investments, as bond investors partake in the security of the issuer as well as of the backing company. Also, these types of bonds are mutually beneficial to the issuers and the guarantors. Guaranteed bonds enable elements with poor creditworthiness to issue debt when they in any case probably won't have the option to do as such, and for better terms. Issuers can frequently get a lower interest rate on debt assuming there is a third-party guarantor, and the third-party guarantor gets a fee for causing the risk that accompanies guaranteeing another entity's debt.

On the downside: Because of their brought down risk, guaranteed bonds generally pay a lower interest rate than a uninsured bond or bond without a guarantee. This lower rate likewise mirrors the premium the issuer needs to pay the guarantor. Getting an outside party's backing most certainly expands the cost of acquiring capital for the responsible entity. It can likewise stretch and convolute the whole giving cycle, as the guarantor normally directs due diligence on the issuer, checking its financials and creditworthiness.
