# Stratified Random Sampling
## What Is Stratified Random Sampling?

Stratified random sampling is a method of sampling that includes the division of a population into smaller sub-groups known as layers. In stratified random sampling, or delineation, the layers are formed based on members' shared traits or characteristics like income or instructive accomplishment.

Stratified random sampling is additionally called proportional random sampling or quota random sampling.

## How Stratified Random Sampling Works

While finishing analysis or research on a group of elements with comparable characteristics, a researcher might find that the [population size](/population) is too large for which to complete research. To set aside time and cash, an analyst might adopt on a more practical strategy by choosing a small group from the population. The small group is alluded to as a [sample size](/sample), which is a subset of the population that is utilized to address the whole population. A sample might be chosen from a population through a number of ways, one of which is the stratified random sampling method.

A stratified random sampling includes isolating the whole population into homogeneous groups called layers (plural for **stratum).** Random samples are then chosen from every layer. For instance, consider a scholarly researcher who might want to know the number of MBA understudies in 2007 who received a job offer in something like three months of graduation.

The researcher will before long observe that there were very nearly 200,000 MBA graduates for the year. They could choose to just take a [simple random sample](/simple-random-sample) of 50,000 graduates and run a survey. Even better, they could isolate the population into layers and take a random sample from the layers. To do this, they would make population groups based on orientation, age range, race, country of ethnicity, and career foundation. A random sample from every layer is taken in a number proportional to the layer's size when compared to the population. These subsets of the layers are then pooled to form a random sample.

## Illustration of Stratified Random Sampling

Assume a research team needs to decide the GPA of college understudies across the U.S. The research team experiences issues gathering data from every one of the 21 million college understudies; it chooses to take a random sample of the population by utilizing 4,000 understudies.

Presently expect that the team takes a gander at the various properties of the sample participants and contemplates whether there are any differences in GPAs and understudies' majors. Assume it observes that 560 understudies are English majors, 1,135 are science majors, 800 are computer science majors, 1,090 are engineering majors, and 415 are math majors. The team needs to utilize a proportional stratified random sample where the layer of the sample is proportional to the random sample in the population.

Accept the team researches the [demographics](/demographics) of college understudies in the U.S and finds the percentage of what understudies major in: 12% major in English, 28% major in science, 24% major in computer science, 21% major in engineering, and 15% major in mathematics. Subsequently, five layers are made from the stratified random sampling process.

The team then needs to affirm that the layer of the population is in relation to the layer in the sample; nonetheless, they find the extents are not equivalent. The team then needs to re-sample 4,000 understudies from the population and randomly select 480 English, 1,120 science, 960 computer science, 840 engineering, and 600 mathematics understudies.

With those, it has a proportionate stratified random sample of college understudies, which gives a better representation of understudies' college majors in the U.S. The researchers can then feature specific layer, notice the shifting studies of U.S. college understudies and notice the different grade point averages.

## Simple Random Versus Stratified Random Samples

[Simple random samples](/simple-random-sample) and stratified random samples are both statistical measurement tools. A simple random sample is utilized to address the whole data population. A stratified random sample partitions the population into smaller groups, or layers, based on shared characteristics.

The simple random sample is much of the time utilized when there is next to no information accessible about the data population, when the data population has extremely numerous differences to partition into different subsets, or when there is just a single distinct characteristic among the data population.

For example, a sweets company might need to study the buying habits of its customers to decide the fate of its product line. In the event that there are 10,000 customers, it might involve pick 100 of those customers as a random sample. It can then apply what it finds from those 100 customers to the remainder of its base. Dissimilar to delineation, it will sample 100 members absolutely at random with next to no respect for their individual characteristics.

### Proportionate and Disproportionate Stratification

Stratified random sampling guarantees that every subgroup of a given population is sufficiently addressed inside the whole sample population of a research study. Delineation can be proportionate or unbalanced. In a proportionate stratified method, the sample size of every layer is proportionate to the population size of the layer.

For instance, in the event that the researcher wanted a sample of 50,000 graduates utilizing age range, the proportionate stratified random sample will be gotten utilizing this formula: (sample size/population size) x layer size. The table below expects a population size of 180,000 MBA graduates each year.
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Age group</td><td>24-28</td><td>29-33</td><td>34-37</td><td>Total</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>Number of people in stratum</td><td>90,000</td><td>60,000</td><td>30,000</td><td>180,000</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>Strata sample size</td><td>25,000</td><td>16,667</td><td>8,333</td><td>50,000</td></tr>
</tbody>
</table>
The layers sample size for MBA graduates in the age scope of 24 to 28 years of age is calculated as (50,000/180,000) x 90,000 = 25,000. A similar method is utilized for the other age range groups. Now that the layers sample size is known, the researcher can perform simple random sampling in every layer to choose his survey participants. As such, 25,000 graduates from the 24-28 age group will be chosen randomly from the whole population, 16,667 graduates from the 29-33 age reach will be chosen from the population randomly, etc.

In a disproportional stratified sample, the size of every layer isn't proportional to its size in the population. The researcher might choose to sample 1/2 of the graduates inside the 34-37 age group and 1/3 of the graduates inside the 29-33 age group.

It is important to note that one person can't squeeze into different layers. Every entity must just fit in one layer. Having overlapping subgroups means that a few individuals will have higher possibilities being chosen for the survey, which completely nullifies the concept of stratified sampling as a type of likelihood sampling.

## Advantages of Stratified Random Sampling

The fundamental advantage of stratified random sampling is that it catches key population characteristics in the sample. Like a weighted average, this method of sampling produces characteristics in the sample that are proportional to the overall population. Stratified random sampling functions admirably for populations with various qualities however is generally incapable in the event that subgroups can't be formed.

Definition gives a smaller [error in estimation](/standard-blunder) and greater precision than the simple random sampling method. The greater the differences between the layers, the greater the gain in precision.

## Disadvantages of Stratified Random Sampling

Tragically, this method of research can't be utilized in each study. The method's disadvantage is that several conditions must be met for it to be utilized appropriately. Researchers must distinguish each member of a population being considered and characterize every one of them into one, and only one, subpopulation. Subsequently, stratified random sampling is disadvantageous when researchers can't certainly characterize each member of the population into a subgroup. Additionally, finding a comprehensive and definitive rundown of a whole [population](/population) can challenge.

Overlapping can be an issue assuming there are subjects that fall into numerous subgroups. At the point when simple random sampling is performed, the people who are in numerous subgroups are bound to be picked. The outcome could be a misrepresentation or wrong impression of the population.

The above models make it simple: undergraduate, graduate, male, and female are plainly defined groups. In different circumstances, notwithstanding, it very well may be undeniably more troublesome. Envision consolidating characteristics like race, identity, or religion. The arranging system turns out to be more troublesome, delivering stratified random sampling an ineffectual and not great method.

## Features
- Stratified random sampling varies from simple random sampling, which includes the random selection of data from a whole population, so every conceivable sample is similarly liable to happen.
- Stratified random sampling includes isolating the whole population into homogeneous groups called layers.
- Stratified random sampling permits researchers to get a sample population that best addresses the whole population being examined.
