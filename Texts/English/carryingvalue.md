# Carrying Value
## What Is Carrying Value?

Carrying value is an accounting measure of value in which the value of an asset or company is based on the figures in the separate company's balance sheet. For physical assets, for example, machinery or computer hardware, carrying cost is calculated as (original cost - accumulated depreciation). In the event that a company purchases a patent or some other intellectual property thing, the formula for carrying value is (original cost - amortization expense).

## How Carrying Value Works

Carrying amount, otherwise called carrying value, is the cost of an asset less accumulated depreciation. The carrying amount is generally excluded from the balance sheet, as it must be calculated. Notwithstanding, the carrying amount is generally consistently lower than the current market value.

Accounting practice states that original cost is utilized to record assets on the balance sheet, as opposed to [market value](/marketvalue), on the grounds that the original cost can be followed to a purchase document, like a receipt. Market value is more subjective. At the initial acquisition of an asset, the carrying value of that asset is the original cost of its purchase. Nonetheless, after some time, the value of an asset will change.

Both depreciation and amortization expenses are utilized to perceive the decline in value of an asset as the thing is utilized over the long run to create revenue. Note that, while structures deteriorate, the land is definitely not a depreciable asset. This is due to the way that land is frequently considered to have an unlimited helpful life, implying that the value of the land won't deteriorate over the long haul.

> Despite the fact that land is thought of as non-depreciable, factors, for example, improvements made to the land — as well as structures and equipment present on the land — implies that the overall carrying value of land can in any case devalue.

## Instance of Carrying Value

Expect ABC Plumbing purchases a $23,000 truck to aid the performing of residential pipes work, and the accounting department makes another pipes truck asset on the books with a value of $23,000. Due to factors, for example, the total mileage and service history, the truck is assigned a valuable life of five years. Salvage value is the excess value of the asset toward the finish of its helpful life.

ABC chooses to deteriorate the asset on a [straight-line basis](/straightlinebasis) with a $3,000 salvage value. The depreciable base is the $23,000 original cost minus the $3,000 salvage value, or $20,000. The annual depreciation is the $20,000 partitioned by five years, or $4,000 each year.

The carrying value of the truck changes every year due to the extra depreciation in value that is posted annually. Toward the finish of year one, the truck's carrying value is the $23,000 minus the $4,000 accumulated depreciation, or $19,000, and the carrying value toward the finish of year two is ($23,000 - $8,000), or $15,000.

In the fixed asset section of the balance sheet, each unmistakable asset is paired with an accumulated depreciation account. Toward the finish of year two, the balance sheet records a truck at $23,000 and an accumulated depreciation-truck account with a balance of - $8,000. A financial statement reader can see the carrying amount of the truck is $15,000.
