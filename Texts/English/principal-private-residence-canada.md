# Principal Private Residence (Canada)
## What Is a Principal Private Residence (Canada)?

A principal [private residence](/principalresidence) is a home a Canadian taxpayer or family keeps up with as its primary residence. A family unit can have one principal private residence at some random time. To qualify, the property must be owned by the [taxpayer](/taxpayer) or couple, or fall inside a personal trust.

## Figuring out Principal Private Residences (Canada)

In Canada, when you sell a house for more than you bought it for, the government expects you to pay taxes on half of that [profit](/profit). Those rules, in any case, don't matter on the off chance that the property is registered as your principal private residence.

A Canadian taxpayer may just assign one home as their principal private residence for a particular year. As per Canadian tax rules, a home can be designated as a principal private residence for every year in which a taxpayer, their spouse, precedent-based regulation partner, or their children were occupants in Canada. The [Canada Revenue Agency](/ccra) (CRA) has three different requirements for a principal private residence to qualify:

- The taxpayer must claim the property all alone, or jointly with their spouse or partner
- The property is "a housing unit, a [leasehold](/leasehold) interest in a housing unit, or a share of the capital stock of a co-employable housing partnership"
- The taxpayer assigns the property as a principal private residence

Basically any type of physical residence qualifies, including houses, apartments, duplexes, cottages, houseboats, trailers, or mobile homes. The land on which the dwelling sits additionally fits the bill for the exclusion inside certain limits — up to 1.24 acres, as indicated by the CRA. This limit might be extended in certain cases in the event that the region forces a base parcel size.

## Requirements for Principal Private Residences (Canada)

As of the 2016 tax year, Canadian taxpayer-mortgage holders were expected to report fundamental information on their principal private residences to meet all requirements for the [exemption](/exemption). That incorporates the date of acquisition, date of sale, proceeds of [disposition](/disposition), as well as a description of the property on their income tax and benefit return. This reporting requirement has applied to each property sold in Canada beginning around 2016, even on the off chance that the whole gain is completely protected by the principal private residence exemption.

The principal private residence is exempt from capital gains tax. Be that as it may, taxpayers who sell their principal residence must in any case report the sale. It must likewise be designated as a private residence on Schedule 3: Capital Gains (or Losses) of their tax return to fit the bill for the exemption, alongside Form T2091(IND): Designation of a Property as a Principal Residence by an Individual (Other Than a Personal Trust).

The federal government permits taxpayers to assign two properties as principal residences when they sell one and purchase one more during that very year. The taxpayer must assign and report both. This rule is called the "in addition to 1" rule.

## Special Considerations

In the event that somebody can't assign a home as their principal residence for every one of the years it is owned, a portion of any gain on its sale might be subject to tax as a [capital gain](/capital_gains_tax). The portion of the gain subject to tax is based on a formula that requires into account the number of years the house was owned by the taxpayer and the number of those years it was designated as a principal private residence.

For instance, assume a married couple claims two residences between them — a home in the city and a cottage in the open country. Only one of these homes can be designated as a principal residence for every year. Before 1982, every spouse could assign a separate property as a principal residence for a particular year, gave the property was not jointly owned. Notwithstanding, that [loophole](/loophole) was closed. Couples and their unmarried minor children can now just assign one home altogether as their principal private residence every year.

Taxpayers who use part of their residence for business purposes must sensibly split the selling price and the [adjusted cost base](/adjustedcostbase) (ACB) between the portions utilized as a residence and to create income. The CRA might think about the property as a residence in the event that the business is secondary to the utilization of the house as a principal residence, there are no structural changes to the property, and there is no [capital cost allowance](/cca) (CCA) guaranteed against the property. One model that fits this description is a home daycare facility.
