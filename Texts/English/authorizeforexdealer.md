# Authorized Forex Dealer
## What Is Authorized Forex Dealer?

An authorized forex dealer is a kind of financial institution that has received authorization from an important regulatory body to act as a [dealer](/dealer) engaged with the trading of foreign currencies.

## Understanding Authorized Forex Dealer

Dealing with authorized [forex](/forex) dealers guarantees that foreign exchange transactions are being executed by the ordered rules as set by a country's regulatory body. The [National Futures Association](/nfa) (NFA) and [Commodity Futures Trading Commission](/cftc) (CFTC) approve forex dealers in the United States.

The NFA, which is directed by the CFTC, guarantees that authorized forex dealers are subject to severe screening upon [registration](/registration) and strong enforcement of regulations upon endorsement.

U.S. investors hoping to transact in the [foreign exchange market](/foreign-exchange-markets) are urged to do as such through an authorized dealer. Thusly, the investors will realize they are dealing with an accomplished and very capable party and, would it be advisable for anything turn out badly, they will have the support of the NFA to investigate any issue that might emerge.

Forex dealers in countries outside the U.S. will be authorized by their own administering body. Now and again, the requirements are less severe than those required in the United States.

## Forex Trading

Forex trading includes the buying and selling of currencies. Authorized forex dealers work with the trading of currencies for retail clients or potentially organizations.

Retail forex trading clients are not commonly keen on claiming the currencies they buy, or [delivering](/delivery) the ones they sell. Rather, they buy and sell the currencies for [speculative](/hypothesis) reasons, endeavoring to profit as the prices of currencies change. Taking delivery of actual currency is called a currency exchange, and is given by [currency exchange houses](/currency-exchange) or banks. That is not the same as forex **trading** giving by authorized forex dealers. With forex trading, the client doesn't have to deliver or receive the underlying currencies.

Currencies trade in pairs, like the [USD/CAD](/usd-cad-us-dollar-canadian-dollar-currency-pair), which is the U.S. dollar (USD) versus the Canadian dollar (CAD). This is a [direct quote](/directquote) and the rate associated with the pair is the amount of the second currency it takes to buy one unit of the first. The rate is continuously changing, yet on the off chance that the current market price is 1.2667, that means that it costs 1.2667 CAD to buy 1 USD.

Forex trading is much of the time done on margin. This means that the trader just has to put up a fraction of the funds required for the trade. For instance, buying 100,000 worth of currency may just expect that the trader put up 5,000 of their own funds. This means they are utilizing 20:1 [leverage](/leverage), or a 5% margin. This is another explanation forex traders would normally prefer not to take or give delivery of currencies they buy or sell. Most retail clients use leverage and subsequently don't have the funds accessible to deliver 100,000 worth of currency, however they can guess on the price change of 100,000 by utilizing a fraction of that amount, 5,000 in this model.

A cycle called a [rollover](/rollover), done consequently by the authorized forex dealer every night, permits traders to conjecture without conveying or receive the actual underlying amounts of currencies they are trading.
