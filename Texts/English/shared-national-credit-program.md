# Shared National Credit Program
## What Is the Shared National Credit Program?

The Board of Governors of the U.S. Federal Reserve System, the [Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation](/fdic) (FDIC), and the [Office of the Comptroller of the Currency](/office-comptroller-currency-occ) (OCC) shaped the shared national credit program in 1977 to give an efficient and reliable survey and classification of large syndicated loans. A [syndicated loan](/syndicatedloan) is a loan that a group of lenders, working in tandem, accommodates a single borrower.

## Understanding the Shared National Credit Program

The shared national credit program looks to dissect [credit risks](/creditrisk), trends, and [risk management](/riskmanagement) strategies among the largest and most complicated loans that are issued jointly by different lending institutions. The objective is to guarantee that all syndicated loans are treated on a similar basis as well as to further develop effectiveness with regards to credit risk analysis and classification that is shared among financial institutions.

The agencies which oversee the program started a semiannual SNC examination schedule in 2016. These SNC surveys are scheduled for the first and third quarters of the year. Contingent upon the lending institution, a few banks will be looked into once every year, and others two times yearly.

The shared national credit program takes a gander at loans and any assets that are taken as [debts](/debt) that are valued at $100 million or higher. The debt must be issued by somewhere around three separate institutions and these institutions must be federally regulated.

## Shared National Credit Program and Syndicated Loans

These lenders can be banks or [institutional investors](/institutionalinvestor) (high net worth people, pension funds, and hedge funds). Since syndicated loans will generally be a lot larger than standard bank loans, the risk of even one borrower defaulting could injure a single lender.

To break down syndicated loans even further, these designs are additionally common in the [leveraged buyout](/leveragedbuyout) community. A leveraged buyout is the acquisition of another company, utilizing a lot of debt to meet the initial cost of acquisition. The assets of the company being acquired are frequently utilized as [collateral](/collateral) for the loans, alongside the assets of the gaining company. The goal of a leveraged buyout is to permit companies to make large acquisitions without committing a great deal of capital.

Due to the intricacies engaged with syndicated loans, the shared national credit program tries to guarantee best practices among institutions and to guarantee against any issues that could be hindering to the financial markets in general.
