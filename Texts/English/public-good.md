## What Is a Public Good?

The two principal criteria that separate a public decent are that it must be non-rivalrous and non-excludable. Non-rivalrous means that the goods don't wane in supply as additional individuals consume them; non-excludability means that the great is accessible to all residents.

An important issue that is connected with public goods is alluded to as the [free-rider problem](/freeriding).

A few countries likewise treat social services-like healthcare and public education-as a type of public great.
