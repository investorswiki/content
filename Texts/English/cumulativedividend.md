Cumulative dividends must be paid by the issuer of preferred stock either at the due date or sometime in the future, if essential. On the off chance that a company can't pay its cumulative dividend obligation when it is due, it is as yet responsible for paying it later on — potentially with extra interest — and it must satisfy this obligation before it can award ordinary dividends to [common shareholders](/common_shareholder).
