# Dow Divisor
## What Is the Dow Divisor?

The Dow divisor is a mathematical value used to work out the level of the [Dow Jones Industrial Average](/djia) (DJIA). The DJIA is calculated by adding up every one of the stock prices of its 30 parts and partitioning the sum by the divisor. Be that as it may, the divisor is consistently adjusted for corporate activities, for example, [dividend](/dividend) payments and stock splits.

[Index divisors](/indexdivisor) are generally utilized on account of a [price-weighted stock market index](/priceweightedindex), like the DJIA, to create a more sensible index value.

## How the Dow Divisor Works

The Dow divisor is utilized to keep up with the historical continuity of the DJIA index since there have been various stock splits, [spinoffs](/side project), and changes among the Dow constituents since the index was first presented in 1896. The Dow divisor keeps up with continuity by figuring in the many changes that happen inside the market, for example, stock splits and changes to — or payments of — dividends.

The Dow divisor is adjusted to guarantee that such events don't, all by themselves, modify the true mathematical value of the DJIA. Due to major changes that have occurred inside the market, the value of the Dow divisor has changed essentially throughout the long term. For instance, it was at 16.67 back in 1928 and as low as 0.147 as of Sept. 2019.

As of December 2021, the divisor for DJIA is 0.15172752595384, yet each Dow Jones index has its own divisor, like the Dow Jones 20 Transport and Dow Jones 15 Utilities.

The Dow is named after Charles Dow, an establishing proofreader of **The Wall Street Journal**, who, in 1896, joined forces with analyst Edward Jones to form the principal rendition of the DJIA. Since this time, **The Wall Street Journal** has been entrusted with guaranteeing that the Dow divisor is adjusted appropriately to keep up with the DJIA's historical exactness.

## Special Considerations

Events, for example, stock splits or changes in the rundown of the companies making the index can frequently adjust the sum of the part prices. In these cases, and to keep away from discontinuity in the index, the Dow divisor is refreshed with the goal that the citations right before and after the event correspond.

Most [corporate actions](/corporateaction), like stock splits and side projects, have effectively pushed the value of the Dow divisor lower. From the start, the Dow divisor was made out of the original number of DJIA companies, which made the DJIA a simple arithmetic average. In any case, as certain events have occurred to adjust the overall value of the market, the Dow divisor has been physically altered to guarantee that the DJIA is accurately valued.

The divisor fell below 1.0 in 1986 interestingly. The current divisor, after numerous changes, is short of what one, and that means the index is bigger than the sum of the prices of the parts. The way that the divisor is currently well below one means that the divisor presently works as a multiplier, as opposed to a divisor.

## Illustration of the Dow Divisor

Suppose you sum up the prices of the 30 constituents of the DJIA and show up at 5,498.07. Assume that the Dow divisor is set at 0.15172752595384: utilizing this divisor, each $1 change in price in a specific stock inside the average likens to a 6.59 (or 1 \u00f7 0.15172752595384) point movement.

Isolating the price total of 5,498.07 by the Dow divisor of 0.15172752595384 would give a level of 36,236.47 to the index. Note to partition the price total by the divisor and not the number 30, which is the number of names in the index.

## Features
- The Dow divisor presently is below one, which technically makes it a multiplier.
- For instance, the Dow divisor might be changed in response to stock splits, the modifying or payment of dividends, and different events.
- The Dow divisor is consistently refreshed to guarantee that structural changes to the market don't influence the DJIA's legitimacy as a benchmark index.
- The Dow divisor is a figure used to standardize the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) value given the prices of its 30 part stocks.
