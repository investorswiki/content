## What Is Underemployment?

Underemployment is a measure of employment and labor utilization in the economy that ganders at how well the labor force is being used in terms of skills, experience, and availability to work. Individuals who are classified as underemployed include workers who are profoundly skilled but working in low-paying or low-expertise jobs and part-time workers who would like to be full-time. This is not quite the same as [unemployment](/unemployment) in that the person is working but not at their full ability.

## Understanding Underemployment

Underemployment is calculated by partitioning the number of underemployed individuals by the total number of workers in a labor force.

There are two types of underemployment: **Visible underemployment** is underemployment in which an individual works less hours than is needed for a full-time frame job in their picked field. Due to the reduced hours, they might work at least two part-time jobs to earn a living wage.

The second type of underemployment is **invisible underemployment**. It alludes to the employment situation where an individual is unable to get a new line of work in their picked field. Consequently, they work in a job that isn't commensurate with their range of abilities and, by and large, pays much below their customary wage.

A third type of underemployment alludes to situations in which individuals who are unable to look for a decent job in their picked field quit the workforce by and large, meaning they haven't searched for a job in the last a month, per the [Bureau of Labor Statistics' (BLS)](/bls) definition of "not in the labor force." The number of these workers soar during the onset of the economic crisis and lockdown in mid 2020, which ultimately resulted in a substantial change in working conditions and harmonized with a crash in the markets. Estimating the third type of underemployment is measurably difficult.

## Causes of Underemployment

Underemployment can be caused due to several factors. The period during and after a recession, when companies scale back and lay off qualified workers, is portrayed by underemployment. Underemployment jumped to its highest levels in the recession resulting from the global outbreak crisis.

As per a BLS report, the number of underemployed individuals in the U.S. economy diminished from 9 million during the fourth quarter of 2018 to 8.2 million in a similar period a year after the fact. On an overall basis, the agency estimated that there were 95 million individuals not in the labor force (including [discouraged workers](/discouraged_worker) who had stopped searching for work) in Q4'19.

One more cause of underemployment is changes in the job market due to shifts in technology. As job depictions change or jobs are automated, laid-off workers can be retrained or retired from the workforce. The people who don't have the resources or means to retrain themselves are generally susceptible to underemployment.

## Shortcomings of the Unemployment Rate

The [unemployment rate](/unemploymentrate) counts those workers who are part of the labor force and actively seeking work but are currently without it. The unemployment rate gets the majority of the national spotlight, but that can be deceiving as the primary indicator of the job market's wellbeing, since it doesn't account for the full capability of the labor force.

The U.S. unemployment rate was 13.3% as of May 2020, but simultaneously, the U.S. underemployment rate was 22.8%. The unemployment rate is defined by the BLS as including "as a percentage of the labor force (the labor force is the sum of the employed and unemployed)." A measure of underemployment is expected to express the opportunity cost of advanced skills not being used or being underutilized.

Likewise, the unemployment rate is calculated founded exclusively on the labor force, which doesn't include persons who are not seeking a job. There are many cases in which a person can work but has become too discouraged with an unsuccessful job hunt to continue to look for a job actively. The labor force participation rate is used to measure the percentage of the civilian population beyond 16 years old who is working or seeking work.

The BLS accumulates six distinct unemployment rates marked U-1 through U-6. U-3 is the formally acknowledged unemployment rate, but U-6 is a better representation of the job market as it accounts for discouraged workers who have left the labor force, workers who are not utilizing their full range of abilities, and workers who have part-time employment but would prefer be employed full time.

## Illustration of Underemployment

For instance, an individual with an engineering degree working as a pizza delivery man as his primary source of income is viewed as underemployed. Additionally, an individual who is working part-time at an office job but would like to rather work full-time is thought of as underemployed. In the two cases, these individuals are underutilized by the economy as they, in theory, can give a greater benefit to the overall economy.
