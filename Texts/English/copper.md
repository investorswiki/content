## What Is Copper

Copper is a ruddy gold hued metal that is flexible, pliable, and an effective transmitter of intensity and power. Copper was the primary metal to be worked with by people and is among the most widely utilized metals today.

## Figuring out Copper

Copper consolidates well with different metals to form widely utilized compounds like metal and bronze. Copper is considered a [base metal](/base-metals), as it oxidizes generally without any problem. It has the symbol Cu and the atomic number of 29 on the periodic table. The name is derived from the Latin **aes Cyprium**, meaning metal from Cyprus. The discovery that copper could be alloyed with tin to form bronze led to the Bronze Age.

Copper was utilized to make coins alongside [silver](/silver) and gold. It is the most common of the three metals as is the least valued. All U.S. coins are currently copper combinations, and weapon metals additionally contain copper. Most copper is utilized in electrical equipment like wiring and motors. It additionally has involves in construction, for instance in plumbing, and industrial machinery like intensity exchangers.

## Copper price determinants

The price of copper is a decent barometer for the overall strength of the global economy. The best determinants of copper prices are [emerging markets](/emergingmarketeconomy), the U.S. housing market, supply interruptions, and substitution. Due to infrastructure demand, emerging markets are a key driver of copper prices. Emerging market countries have high growth rates for housing and transportation infrastructure and different types of construction. Subsequently, the price of copper is sensitive to growth rates in these countries.

In the U.S., the homebuilding industry drives copper demand, with the metal utilized in electrical wiring, material, plumbing fixtures, and protection. Economic indicators that influence U.S. housing demand — including nonfarm payrolls, mortgage rates, [GDP](/gdp) figures, and socioeconomics — additionally influence copper demand.

Political, environmental and labor issues can influence copper prices through supply and demand. Nationalization of copper mines or miner strikes can disturb production and pressure prices higher. Natural debacles or wars can slow mine output and increase copper prices. Assuming that copper prices rise, purchasers might look for substitutions. Less expensive metals, for example, aluminum can supplant copper in power links, electrical stuff, and refrigeration equipment. Nickel, lead, and iron additionally contend with copper as substitutes in certain industries.

In recent many years, China has driven demand for copper. Copper prices flooded during the late 1990s and mid 2000s as China's economy blast and the country started a construction binge. The U.S. economy, where real estate and housing markets took off, additionally contributed to the increase. The metal's prices lined in the fallout of the 2007-08 Financial Crisis, alongside the remainder of the commodity sector.

The Chinese economy revived demand for copper. India has likewise gotten the mantle. India's per capita copper consumption is guage to rise from 0.5 kg to 1 kg by 2025.

Growth possibilities for new industries, like renewable energy, is additionally expected to help demand. This is on the grounds that copper is utilized as a raw material to make machines and equipment, like windmills and sun based plants. Be that as it may, industry elements —, for example, longer lead times for mines to become operational and political precariousness in copper-creating districts — may impede gains for the metal.

## Copper Futures

Copper [futures contracts](/futurescontract) trade on exchanges around the world, including the [London Metal Exchange](/londonmetalexchange) (LME) and the [Commodity Exchange](/comex) (COMEX) under the [Chicago Mercantile Exchange](/cme) (CME). Copper futures contracts include the delivery of physical copper of specific amounts (framed in the contract) sometime not too far off.

For instance, the COMEX Copper Futures contract is a month to month futures contract with physical delivery of 25,000 pounds of copper on expiration. The delivered copper ought to conform to Grade 1 Electrolytic Copper Cathode as adopted by the American Society for Testing and Materials (B115-00). Different entertainers associated with the ecosystem, including miners and merchants, use futures contracts to hedge against price changes for the metal.

## Highlights
- Copper futures contracts are utilized by miners and wholesalers to hedge against losses and are listed on futures platforms all through the world.
- Copper still up in the air by a number of factors, including demand from emerging economies, for example, China and India alongside the U.S. housing market.
- Copper is a ruddy gold shaded metal that has applications in numerous sectors, like the housing and automotive industries.
