Futures can be utilized for [hedging](/hedging-exchange) or trade speculation.

## Grasping Futures

Futures — likewise called futures contracts — permit traders to lock in the price of the underlying asset or [commodity](/commodityfuturescontract). These contracts have expiration dates and set prices that are known upfront. Futures are recognized by their expiration month. For instance, a December gold futures contract terminates in December.

Traders and investors utilize the term futures in reference to the overall asset class. In any case, there are many types of futures contracts accessible for trading including:

## Utilizing Futures

The futures markets typically utilize high [leverage](/leverage). Leverage means that the trader doesn't have to put up 100% of the contract's value amount while going into a trade. All things being equal, the broker would require a [initial margin amount](/initialmargin), which comprises of a negligible portion of the total contract value.

> The amount required by the broker for a margin account can fluctuate depending on the size of the futures contract, the creditworthiness of the investor, and the broker's terms and conditions.

The exchange where the futures contract trades will determine assuming that the contract is for [physical delivery](/physicaldelivery) or on the other hand on the off chance that it very well may be cash-settled. A corporation might go into a physical delivery contract to lock in the price of a commodity it needs for production. Nonetheless, numerous futures contracts include traders who conjecture on the trade. These contracts are closed out or netted — the difference in the original trade and closing trade price — and have a [cash settlement](/cashsettlement).

### Futures for Speculation

A futures contract permits a trader to estimate on the heading of a commodity's price. On the off chance that a trader bought a futures contract and the price of the commodity transcended the original contract price at expiration, then, at that point, they would have a profit. Before expiration, the futures contract — the [long position](/long) — would be sold at the current price, closing the long position.

The difference between the prices would be cash-settled in the investor's brokerage account, and no physical product would change hands. Be that as it may, the trader could likewise lose on the off chance that the commodity's price was lower than the purchase price determined in the futures contract.

Examiners can likewise take a [short speculative position](/short) in the event that they foresee the price of the underlying asset will fall.

It's important to note that trading on margin takes into consideration a lot bigger position than the amount held by the brokerage account. Subsequently, margin investing can intensify gains, however it can likewise amplify losses.

Envision a trader who has a $5,000 brokerage account balance and has a $50,000 position in crude oil. Assuming the price of oil moves against the trade, it can mean losses that far surpass the account's $5,000 initial margin amount. In this case, the broker would make a [margin call](/margincall) expecting that extra funds be deposited to cover the market losses.

### Futures for Hedging

Futures can be utilized to [hedge](/hedge) the price movement of the underlying asset. Here, the goal is to keep losses from possibly unfavorable price changes as opposed to guess. Many companies that enter hedges are utilizing — or by and large delivering — the underlying asset.

For instance, corn farmers can utilize futures to lock in a specific price for selling their corn crop. Thusly, they reduce their risk and guarantee they will receive the fixed price. In the event that the price of corn diminished, the rancher would have a gain on the hedge to offset losses from selling the corn at the market. With such a gain and loss offsetting one another, the hedging successfully locks in an acceptable [market price](/market-price).

> ### Regulation of Futures
> The futures markets are regulated by the [Commodity Futures Trading Commission](/cftc) (CFTC). The CFTC is a federal agency made by Congress in 1974 to guarantee the integrity of futures market pricing, including forestalling abusive trading practices, fraud, and directing brokerage firms participated in futures trading.

## Illustration of Futures

Since oil is traded in augmentations of 1,000 barrels, the investor presently has a position worth $50,000 of crude oil (1,000 x $50 = $50,000). Notwithstanding, the trader will just have to pay a negligible portion of that amount front and center — the initial margin that they deposit with the broker.

From May to December, the price of oil varies as does the value of the futures contract. Assuming oil's price gets too unstable, the broker might have to ask that extra funds to be deposited into the margin account. This is called [maintenance margin](/maintenancemargin).

In December, the end date of the contract is drawing closer (the third Friday of the month). The price of crude oil has ascended to $65. The trader sells the original contract to exit the position. The net difference is cash-settled. They earn $15,000, less any fees and commissions owed the broker ($65 - $50 = $15 x 1000 = $15,000).

In any case, on the off chance that the price oil had fallen to $40 all things being equal, the investor would have lost $10,000 ($50 - $40 = a loss of $10 x 1000 = a loss of $10,000).
