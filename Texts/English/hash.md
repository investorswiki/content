# Hash

In [cryptography](/cryptography), the word hash alludes to the output delivered by a hash function after a piece of data is submitted (planned) through it. Other than just hash, the output created by hash functions may likewise be alluded to as hash value, hash code, or summary.
To better comprehend what a hash is, it's worth examining what are hash functions and how they work.
Hash functions are mathematical [algorithms](/calculation) that convert an information value of any size into an output (hash) of fixed size. As a rule, the output comprises of a hexadecimal number. This means the hash is much of the time signified as a combination of numbers (0 to 9) and letters (a to f).
For example, on the off chance that we utilize "Binance" as the information value, and guide it through a SHA-256 hash function, the output value (or hash) returned will be:
f1624fcc63b615ac0e95daf9ab78434ec2e8ffe402144dc631b055f711225191
Note that it doesn't make any difference how frequently we perform this action, the output will constantly be equivalent to (long as the info doesn't change).
Then again, any minor change to the info will make the hash function return something else entirely as the output. For instance, on the off chance that we present "binance" rather than "Binance" we would have the accompanying hash subsequently:
59bba357145ca539dcd1ac957abc1ec5833319ddcae7f5e8b5da0c36624784b2
Hashes are valuable for checking the legitimacy of certain data, without uncovering what the data is. In practice, hash functions might be applied to different situations. A couple of purpose cases incorporate database queries, large records examinations, and data management.
When combined with cryptographic methods, we have the supposed cryptographic hash functions. These are widely utilized in data security and are an essential part of most blockchain networks.
For example, the Bitcoin blockchain has numerous operations that include hashing, and these are essential during the time spent mining.

## Features
- A hash is a function that fulfills the scrambled needs expected to settle for a blockchain calculation.
- A hash, similar to a nonce or a solution, is the foundation of the blockchain network.
- A hash is developed in light of the data present in the block header.
- Hashes are of a fixed length since it makes it almost difficult to figure the length of the hash in the event that somebody was attempting to crack the blockchain.
- Similar data will constantly create a similar hashed value.
## FAQ
### How Is a Hash Value Calculated?
A hash function uses complex mathematical calculations that convert data of arbitrary length to data of fixed length (for example, 256 characters). Assuming that you change the slightest bit anyplace in the original data, the whole hash value changes, making it helpful for confirming the fidelity of digital records and different data.
### What Are Hashes Used for in Blockchains?
Hashes are utilized in several parts of a blockchain system. In the first place, each block contains the hash of the [block header](/block-header-cryptocurrency) of the previous block, guaranteeing that nothing has been messed with as new blocks are added. Cryptocurrency mining utilizing [proof-of-work](/evidence work) (PoW), besides, uses hashing of haphazardly created numbers to show up at a specific hashed value containing a series of leading zeroes. This arbitrary function is asset concentrated, making it hard for a troublemaker to surpass the network.
### What Is a Hash Function?
Hash functions are mathematical functions that transform or "map" a given set of data into a bit string of fixed size, otherwise called the "hash value."
