## Understanding Core Deposits

Core deposits are insured by the [Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation](/fdic) (FDIC) to the amount of up to $250,000. Notwithstanding the previously mentioned benefits, core deposits are generally less defenseless against changes in short-term interest rates than certificates of deposit (CDs) or [money market accounts](/moneymarketaccount). Financial institutions commonly raise their CD rates in response to an increase in interest rates by the U.S. [Federal Reserve](/federalreservebank). Consumers will search for higher rates in CDs, since this might empower them to ratchet up their savings quickly. Assuming a few banks raise CD rates as per the Federal policy, others might become inspired to follow suit, and in like manner raise their own CD rates.

Presently accounts can be a method for developing core deposits.

Financial institutions are banned from paying interest on demand deposits, due to Regulation Q, a 1933 Federal Reserve Board law that limits checking account interest payments. All things being equal, a bank might offer an account holder cash or credit payments, alongside merchandise, when a benefactor opens an account. For a demand deposit, an account holder may not receive greater than two payments every year.
