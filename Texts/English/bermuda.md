# Bermuda Option
## What Is a Bermuda Option?

A Bermuda option is a type of [exotic options](/exoticoption) contract that must be exercised on foreordained dates — frequently on one day every month.

A twist on [American-style options](/americanoption), which permit holders to exercise right on time whenever, Bermudian options permit investors to buy or sell a security or [underlying asset](/underlying-asset) at a preset price on a set of specific dates as well as the option's expiration date.

## Figuring out Bermuda Options

Options contracts are financial [derivatives](/subsidiary) that give the buyer the right — however not the commitment — to execute in an underlying asset, like shares of stock, at a distinct price — the [strike price](/strikeprice) — at the latest a predefined future date.

An option to buy an underlying asset is a [call option](/calloption). An option to sell an underlying asset is a [put option](/putoption). At the option's expiration, the contracts can be switched over completely to shares, known as [exercising](/exercise), of the asset at the foreordained price.

There are two primary types or styles of options, American and European options. American options are exercisable whenever between the purchase date and the date of expiration. [European options](/europeanoption), in any case, are exercised exclusively at the date of expiration. Bermuda options are a restricted form of the American option that considers early exercise however just at set dates.

The early exercise feature of Bermuda options takes into account an investor to utilize the option and convert it to shares on specific dates before [expiry](/expirationdate). The dates — contained in the contract's terms — are known upfront during the purchasing of the option.

## Special Considerations

Some Bermuda options could permit an investor to exercise the option on the principal business day of the month. In this way, assuming that an investor's call option's strike price is lower than the underlying stock's market price on the first of the month, the investor can exercise and buy shares for the lower strike price. Alternately, assuming the investor's put option strike price is higher than the market price of the stock, the investor can sell at the strike and get the shares at the lower market price. Most times, the net difference is [cash-settled](/cash-settled-options).

Be that as it may, some Bermuda options have early expiration date limitations. For instance, a Bermuda option could have the features of an European option where it can't be exercised until the early exercise date. Following the early exercise date, the option converts to American-style options and can be exercised whenever.

The ability to exercise an option early is a benefit to the holder, and this feature increases the value of the contract. The [premium](/option-premium) (price) on a Bermuda option will frequently be higher than a [European](/europeanoption) option with similar terms, and lower than an American option due to its limitations on early exercise.

## Bermuda Options: Advantages and Disadvantages

There are several benefits and hindrances to Bermuda options. Dissimilar to American and European options, Bermuda options empower investors to make and purchase a hybrid contract. All in all, investors are given more control over when the options can be exercised.

Premiums for Bermuda options are typically lower than those of American options. Nonetheless, Bermuda options don't have the flexibility of practicing whenever. Thus, American options are the most costly, while European options are the cheapest since they offer the least flexibility. The cost of Bermuda options falls some in the middle of between their American and European partners.

A potential drawback to a Bermuda option can occur in the event that an investor doesn't exercise until the option's expiration date. In this case, the investor would have been better off buying the less expensive European option all things being equal. Likewise, the extra exercise dates of a Bermuda option may not be guaranteed to address the best times to exercise.

## Illustration of a Bermuda Option

Suppose an investor possesses stock in Tesla Inc. The investor purchased the stock at $250 per share and needs insurance against a drop in the organization's stock price.

The investor buys a Bermuda-style put option that terminates in six months, with a strike price of $245. The option costs $3 — or $300 since every option contract addresses 100 shares. The option safeguards the position from a decline in price below $245 for the next six months. Nonetheless, the Bermuda feature permits the investor to exercise almost immediately the first of every month beginning in month four.

The stock price tumbles to $200, and by the principal day of the option's fourth month, the investor exercises the put option. The stock position has declined and is sold at $200 while the strike price of $245 gives a profit of $45 from the put option. The investor is successfully out of the position at $245 minus the $300 cost of the premium and any extra broker commissions.

Nonetheless, assuming the stock price rose significantly after the option was exercised, say to $300 by the option's expiry, the investor would pass up any of those gains. Despite the fact that Bermuda options give flexibility to exercise early, that doesn't be guaranteed to mean the investor's decision to exercise will be the right or profitable one.
