# Positive Economics
## What Is Positive Economics?

The term positive economics alludes to the objective analysis in the study of economics. Most economists see what has occurred and what is currently occurring in a given economy to form their basis of predictions for what's in store. This insightful interaction is positive economics. On the other hand, a [normative economic](/normativeeconomics) study puts together future predictions with respect to value judgments.

## Figuring out Positive Economics

The foundation of positive economic practice is to see truth based [behavioral finance](/behavioralfinance) or economic relationships and the circumstances and logical results collaboration to foster economic hypotheses. Behavioral economics follows a brain research based premise that individuals will settle on rational financial decisions based on the information they find around them.

Many will allude to this study as "what is" economics due to its utilization of reality based determination of thought. [Normative economics](/normativeeconomics), then, at that point, is called the "what ought to have been" or "what should be" study.

## History of Positive Economics

The history of positive economics traces all the way back to the nineteenth century. It was during this time that "what is" and "what ought to be" were first recognized by early economists like John Neville Keynes and [John Stuart Mill](/john-stuart-mill).

Keynes accepted that logic and methodology were basic in the study of economics while Mill was an economist who blended economics with philosophy. Mill approached economics from data, for example, the relationship among [supply and demand](/law-of-supply-demand), as opposed to from an approach of value point of view.

These early economists developed speculations to back up their economic perceptions. They utilized real evidence from the economic conditions to validate these speculations.

These thoughts were subsequently adjusted by contemporary economists, like [Milton Friedman](/milton-friedman). Friedman is viewed as one of the most compelling economists of the twentieth century. He held a firm faith in the [free market](/freemarket) free enterprise system, and his hypotheses became known as monetarism. Friedman was a strong rival of [monetary policy](/monetarypolicy), saying that it played a big job in the Great Depression.

## Testing Positive Economic Theories

Ends drawn from positive economics examinations can be confirmed and supported by data. For instance, the prediction that more individuals will set aside cash assuming interest rates rise would be based on positive economics since past behaviors support that theory.

This analysis is objective in nature, rather than normative statements and hypotheses, which are subjective. The vast majority of the information given by the news media is a combination of positive and normative economic statements or suppositions.

Positive economic theory can assist policymakers with executing normative value judgments. For instance, it can portray what the government can mean for inflation by printing more money, and it can support that statement with realities and analysis of behavioral relationships among inflation and growth in the [money supply](/moneysupply). Yet, it doesn't express how to appropriately authorize and follow specific policies with respect to inflation and money printing.

Both positive and normative economics give an unmistakable comprehension of public policies when concentrated together. These speculations cover both the genuine and real realities and statements combined with an assessment based analysis. While going with policy choices, it is best to comprehend the positive economic foundation of behavioral finance and the reasons for occasions as you remember normative value judgments for why things occur.

## Benefits and Disadvantages of Positive Economics

There are distinct benefits and downsides that are associated with positive economics. Here we show a portion of the principal benefits and hindrances of this flood of economics.

### Benefits

Positive economics is based on objective data as opposed to suppositions and value judgments. There are realities we have at our disposal to back up any of our claims. For example, we can utilize historical data to determine the relationship between interest rates and consumer behavior. Higher interest rates lead consumers to stop borrowing since it means they need to spend more on interest.

Since it's based exclusively on realities and data, there are no value judgments in positive economics. This allows policymakers to formulate the proper measures important to handle any economic conditions to move the economy in a certain bearing. For instance, the Federal Reserve can lower interest rates to forestall a [recession](/recession).

Individual sentiments and feelings can hugely affect economic policies and procedures. For example, individuals frequently go with choices in their personal financial lives based on feelings as opposed to realities. This can lead individuals to settle on a few terrible decisions. Yet, assuming that they follow the data, they might have the option to pursue savvier choices with their personal economic choices.

### Impediments

Not every person is worried about current realities, and certain economic conditions are based on feelings. As in the model above, individuals frequently decide to neglect data when they pursue certain decisions. Specialists might propose saving during times of economic weakness yet individuals might conclude they need to make a big purchase all things being equal. Fundamentally, it's difficult to remove the feeling from economics.

Just in light of the fact that you have a history of data, it doesn't mean that you can accompany up an idiot proof solution or end. That is on the grounds that economics, whether positive or normative, is definitely not a precise science. What's more, there are different contemplations that frequently become possibly the most important factor that can change the outcome.

Essentially, positive economics may not be a one-size-fits-all approach. For example, policymakers frequently utilize the data to diversely concoct a policy or solution that influences everybody. What works for one segment of the population doesn't influence others the same way. Raising interest rates might be important to assist with slowing growth and is a boon for lenders yet it doesn't look good for borrowers, particularly the individuals who are as of now stone cold broke.

## Real-World Examples of Positive Economics

Battle for 15 is a cross country movement to push for a $15 [minimum wage](/minimum_wage) on what might be viewed as normative economics. The position on a $15 the lowest pay permitted by law is a value judgment. defenders contend that raising the lowest pay permitted by law would be great while adversaries contend that it would be destructive.

There has been a ton of research about the lowest pay permitted by law increases, however there are no definitive findings that offer broad, clearing decisions about whether higher least wages are fortunate or unfortunate. However, there are subtleties from certain studies that could be viewed as instances of positive economics.

### The Seattle Ordinance

In 2015, Seattle passed a local ordinance to increase the lowest pay permitted by law for workers in the city progressively. The move meant that all workers would earn somewhere around $15 each hour by 2021 or sooner, contingent upon specific employment subtleties. Since that time, there have been two major studies on the impact of the law.

A study by researchers from the University of California-Berkeley centers specifically around restaurant employees. As per Cal Berkeley's study, unemployment in Seattle went from 5.7% in 2012 to 3.6% in 2016. Median annual earnings for employees increased by 13.4% over those years.

As per these researchers, employees of drive-thru eateries saw an increase in their earnings on account of an increase in Seattle's lowest pay permitted by law. This specific data is an illustration of positive economics, however the researchers' decision that the higher the lowest pay permitted by law was a triumph isn't positive economics in light of the fact that the focal point of the study was not broad or thorough enough to make such a finding.

Meanwhile, researchers at the University of Washington inferred that the lowest pay permitted by law increase was not fruitful. Yet, that end isn't an illustration of positive economics. Notwithstanding, a portion of the specific data they collected would be an illustration of positive economics.

For instance, they discovered that when the lowest pay permitted by law increased, the hours worked by low-wage employees diminished. Hence, the total payroll for low-income employees fell by generally $125 each month following the lowest pay permitted by law increase. The number of low-wage workers diminished by 1%, hours for those actually employed diminished somewhat too.

While that specific data addresses positive economics, the researchers' decision actually can be questioned in light of the fact that different factors not tended to in the study — like an expected increase in higher-paying position — may have impacted the data.

## Positive Economics FAQs
### What Is Positive Economics and Examples?

Positive economics is the objective analysis of the economic study. This includes examining what's happened versus what's going on, allowing economists to anticipate what will occur from now on. Positive economics is unmistakable, anything to such an extent that can be validated with a reality, for example, the inflation rate, the unemployment rate, housing market statistics, and consumer spending are instances of positive economics.

### What Are the Differences Between Positive and Normative Economics?

While positive economics is a branch of economics that depends on objective data, normative economics is based on subjective information. The last option is based on value judgments that stem from conclusions and personal sentiments as opposed to analysis. Positive economics bargains in what is compared to normative economics, which depends on what economic behavior ought to be.

### What Is a Positive and Normative Statement?

There are big distinctions among positive and normative statements. Positive statements are objective speculations that can be tried. Normative statements, then again, are subjective. They include the utilization of feelings and value judgments and are many times based on personal assessments.

### What Are Examples of Normative Economics?

Normative economics is addressed by whatever is subjective and value-based. This means we can utilize the information we have at our disposal to express out loud whatever ought to be from here on out. For example, we can utilize data from earnings to say that corporations ought to pay more in taxes. What's more, we can utilize the cost of living with current wages to make suppositions on the lowest pay permitted by law.

The branch of economic theory called welfare economics is the study of normative economics. The leading scholars in this area almost immediately were Abram Bergson and Nobel Prize-winning economist Kenneth Arrow.

## The Bottom Line

Economics is viewed as an art and a science. That is on the grounds that it joins the utilization of reality with value judgments. In any case, there are floods of economics that separate what's going on now from what ought to be from here on out. Positive economics is an objective branch of study that allows ends to be made utilizing verifiable realities.

Normative economics, then again, manages suppositions based on those realities. Despite the fact that it might seem like the best option, no society really works on a positive economic position. Truth be told, joining both positive and normative economics might be the best approach when policymakers foster new solutions.
