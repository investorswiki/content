# Cash Flow Underwriting
## What Is Cash Flow Underwriting?

Insurance companies might utilize cash flow underwriting as a pricing strategy when they price an insurance product below the rate of [premium](/insurance-premium) required to accept the cost of expected losses.

The purpose of this strategy is to generate substantial investment capital from the increased business, which comes from the lower pricing. Cash flow underwriting is a risky pricing strategy.

## Understanding Cash Flow Underwriting

Cash flow underwriting is more normal in a soft market when a weak economy makes it hard to draw in insurance customers. To contend, an insurance company might bring down its premiums. Be that as it may, eventually, the premium will never again cover the anticipated risk of underwriting the policy.

For instance, a homeowner with a home that has obsolete pipes and wiring wishes to get [homeowners insurance](/homeowners-insurance). The house is at an increased risk of fire or water damage. Typically, taking everything into account, the annual premium for such a structure would be higher than an equivalent home with refreshed systems. In any case, in a highly competitive market, an insurer could charge a more modest premium and face the higher challenge, as opposed to lose the customer to a contender.

## Gambling With Loss Ratio in Cash Flow Underwriting

An insurer who participates in cash flow underwriting is betting that [losses incurred](/losses-incurred) from the high number of policies it composes will slow in emerge. Insurance companies set to the side a reserve to cover liabilities from policy claims. The amount of reserves depends on a forecast of losses an insurer might face throughout some undefined time frame. The reserves could be adequate or may fall short of covering its liabilities.

Losses incurred to premiums earned is known as the [loss ratio](/loss-ratio), a key statistic for surveying the wellbeing and profitability of an insurance company. On the off chance that a company pays $80 in claims for each $160 in collected premiums, the loss ratio is half.

Generally, the insurer is going for customer quantity over customer quality. Rather than less, higher premiums which offer a more secure risk, the company wagers on many lower-priced premiums at higher risk. It will then, at that point, invest the increased cash flow in securities that pay higher rates of return.

The bet is the higher investment returns will compensate for the difference in pricing, and probably cover the unavoidable claims coming about because of the higher risk. The hope is to generate capital rapidly in a market where short-term interest rates are rising.

While insurance customers deal with insurance brokers and agents, the insurance company's [underwriters](/insurance-financier) work in the background. They are experts in assessing the risk of any potential policy the company might sell, and subsequently the premium paid. A few risks are actuarial, importance in light of statistics and demographics.

For instance, underwriters know a 21-year-old single man is statistically bound to have an auto accident than a 34-year-old married lady. His vehicle insurance will cost more. Nonetheless, the more established lady is bound to become pregnant, foster bosom disease, or experience different sicknesses. Accordingly, her medical coverage will cost more.
