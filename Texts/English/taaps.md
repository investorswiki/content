Treasury securities exchange through an auction cycle in the primary market. TAAPS gets tenders from brokers wishing to purchase marketable securities. Each bid is handled and looked into naturally by TAAPS to guarantee it conforms to the Treasury's Uniform Offering Circular.

The Treasury Automated Auction Processing System (TAAPS) was developed to turn into the core of the operational interaction for the auctioning of Treasury securities. The U.S. Government sells securities through the [Treasury Department](/ustreasury) and Federal Reserve Bank to fund-raise to fund the national public debt.

The Treasury Department approves Federal Reserve Banks to act as fiscal agents of the United States so they can carry out the announcement of the auction, the sale of the securities, and any applicable regulations. The auction is a bidding cycle in which the Treasury department sells debt securities. The auction's offering amount is the value of the Treasury, which is additionally called the bond's [par value](/parvalue) or face value.

The bidder is the person or party offering to buy the securities either without help from anyone else or through a financial institution. Ordinarily, [institutional investors](/institutionalinvestor), including banks, brokers, dealers, investment funds, retirement funds, and pensions, foreign accounts, and insurance companies might bid on Treasury securities through TAAPS.

From 1973 through 1976 the auction system expanded to incorporate bills, notes, bonds, [Treasury Inflation Protected Securities (TIPS](/tips)), and [Floating Rate Notes (FRNs](/frn)). Until 1993, bids were received in paper form and handled physically, which was a very tedious and inefficient cycle. The TAAPS system made the streamlined and efficient cycle expected to handle the developing volume of Treasury securities trades.
