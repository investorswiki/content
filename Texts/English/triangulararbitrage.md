# Triangular Arbitrage
## What Is Triangular Arbitrage?

Triangular arbitrage is the consequence of an error between three foreign currencies that happens when the currency's exchange rates don't exactly match up. These opportunities are rare and traders who make the most of them normally have advanced computer equipment or potentially programs to mechanize the cycle.

A trader utilizing triangular arbitrage, for instance, would exchange an amount at one rate (EUR/USD), convert it once more (EUR/GBP), and afterward convert it at last back to the original (USD/GBP), and expecting low [transaction costs](/transactioncosts), net a profit.

## Figuring out Triangular Arbitrage

This type of [arbitrage](/arbitrage) can result in a "riskless" profit on the off chance that quoted currency exchange rates don't rise to the market's [cross-exchange rate](/crossrate). At the end of the day, in the event that two currencies likewise trade against some third currency, the exchange rates of each of the three ought to be synchronized, in any case, a profit opportunity exists.

International banks, who make markets in currencies, exploit a failure in the market where one market is overvalued and another is undervalued. Price differences between exchange rates are just fractions of a penny, and for this form of arbitrage to be profitable, a trader must trade a large amount of capital.

## Automated Trading Platforms and Triangular Arbitrage

Automated trading platforms have streamlined how trades are executed, as an algorithm is made in which a trade is naturally conducted once certain criteria are met. Automated trading platforms allow a trader to set rules for entering and leaving a trade, and the computer will naturally conduct the trade as per the rules. While there are many benefits to automated trading, for example, the ability to test a set of rules on historical data before risking capital, the ability to take part in triangular arbitrage is just doable utilizing an automated trading platform.

Since the market is basically a self-revising entity, trades occur at such a fast pace that an arbitrage opportunity evaporates seconds after it shows up. An automated trading platform can be set to distinguish an opportunity and act on it before it vanishes.

All things considered, the speed of algorithmic trading platforms and markets can likewise neutralize traders. For instance, there might be an execution risk in which traders can't lock in a profitable price before it moves past them like a flash.

## Illustration of Triangular Arbitrage

For instance, assume you have $1 million and you are given the following exchange rates: EUR/USD = 1.1586, EUR/GBP = 1.4600, and USD/GBP = 1.6939.

With these exchange rates there is an arbitrage opportunity:

1. Sell dollars to buy euros: $1 million \u00f7 1.1586 = \u20ac863,110
1. Sell euros for pounds: \u20ac863,100 \u00f7 1.4600 = \u00a3591,171
1. Sell pounds for dollars: \u00a3591,171 x 1.6939 = $1,001,384
1. Subtract the initial investment from the last amount: $1,001,384 - $1,000,000 = $1,384

From these transactions, you would receive an arbitrage profit of $1,384 (expecting no transaction costs or taxes).

## Features
- Triangular arbitrage is a form of low-risk profit-production by currency traders that exploits exchange rate disparities through algorithmic trades.
- To guarantee profits, such trades ought to be performed rapidly and ought to be large in size.
- Since triangular arbitrage opportunities are routinely taken advantage of, currency markets become more efficient.
