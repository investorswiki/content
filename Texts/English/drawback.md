# Drawback
## What Is a Drawback?

A drawback is a rebate on taxes or [tariffs](/tax) paid by businesses on goods that were imported into the United States and afterward exported out once more, for example, on [raw materials](/rawmaterials) being imported for use in production, and the last goods then being exported. This decreases the tax burden on companies assisting with working on their profitability.

## Figuring out a Drawback

A drawback is a refund on specific duties, fees, and taxes, collected from U.S. companies for importing goods as indicated by the [U.S. Customs and Border Protection Agency](/drawback). Regularly, [imports](/import) and [exports](/export) are taxed. Drawbacks help to reduce the tax burden for U.S. exporters.

Drawbacks apply to companies that have materials imported into the U.S. where they stay for a period before they're exported to their next objective outside of the country. Albeit the laws have been modified throughout the long term, drawbacks were initially established by the Continental Congress in 1789 with an end goal to make occupations, help manufacturing, and energize exports.

The taxable goods that are eligible for the drawback whenever they have been exported needn't bother with to be in a similar condition as when they showed up in the country. The rebate is applicable to materials that are utilized in the manufacturing of different products too. When the manufactured product has been exported, the rebate would apply. Nonetheless, a drawback doesn't matter to goods that have been harmed or ruined prior to being exported.

The types of imports, as indicated by cbp.gov, that may be eligible for drawbacks include:

- Salt imported and used to arrange meat or fish that is eventually exported
- Construction materials imported for the utilization of building a ship or vessel that is exported
- Repair materials that are utilized to fix fly aircraft, which are ultimately exported
- Bundling material that has been imported and utilized for a product that is exported
- Imported petroleum products for utilization

The objective of the drawback is to permit U.S. manufacturers to have a competitive edge with different countries where labor or goods might be more affordable and to offset a portion of these costs.

## Illustration of a Drawback

Suppose, for instance, L&B Manufacturing makes youngsters' furniture in the United States. Be that as it may, the wood they use to build their table and chair sets is imported from Norway. Additionally, the majority of their customers that buy their products are situated in Ireland.

At the point when L&B receives another furniture order, they contact their provider in Norway who ships them the materials they need. The materials enter the U.S. as raw timber, and it is taxed as an import. The carpenters at L&B take the raw materials and produce the completed product, which is a table with two matching chairs.

L&B ships the order to Ireland and the U.S. manufacturer is charged an export tax. In any case, L&B is eligible to file for a drawback and receive a rebate on the taxes paid on the exported products.

Albeit the exported timber, or the completed product, seems to be the raw materials that were initially imported, L&B actually gets the [tax rebate](/tax-refund). The drawback or rebate is conceded in light of the fact that the company had previously paid taxes on the imported raw materials.

Had that timber been harmed in a fire, or had the carpenters committed an error and cut the pieces too small to be utilized in the creation of the table, L&B would have been not able to receive the drawback on the taxes paid.

The course of the drawback permits L&B to try not to pay taxes two times on the various parts of their business, which for certain produces, could be a critical financial burden; the difference between a profitable company and one causing losses.
