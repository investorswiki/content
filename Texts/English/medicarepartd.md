Part D is an optional benefit that is administered by private insurance companies and available to any individual who has Medicare.

## How Medicare Part D Works

Medicare offers two methods for getting professionally prescribed drug coverage — Part D and [Medicare Advantage](/medicare-advantage). Medicare Part D is one part of the overall Medicare program, which is a national health care coverage program that starting around 2020 insured an estimated 62.6 million people. While Medicare reaches out to a wide variety of medical therapies, Part D is centered explicitly around making drug prices more affordable for Americans 65 years and more established.

## Special Considerations

Medicare physician recommended drug plans have a coverage gap — a transitory limit on what the medication plan will cover. The coverage gap is often called the "doughnut hole." It kicks in after you and your insurer have spent a certain amount on drugs in combined costs.

Whenever that sum's been surpassed, you need to pay essentially a portion of your medications out of pocket. In any case, most plans have limits on the amount you need to pay on your own in a given year, called the out-of-pocket threshold. Whenever you've surpassed **that** sum, your coverage kicks in once more. Consequently, the name "doughnut hole."

In the event that it sounds a bit counter-intuitive — it is. What's more, lawmakers have been attempting to fix it. Under the [Affordable Care Act (ACA)](/affordable-care-act), the doughnut hole has been closing every year, except it's not totally gone yet. At a certain level — $4,330 in 2022 — you enter the famous coverage gap that expects you to pay up to 25% of covered professionally prescribed drug costs. Then, at that point, when costs go above $7,050, you go through the doughnut hole and owe just 5% of the cost of medications.
