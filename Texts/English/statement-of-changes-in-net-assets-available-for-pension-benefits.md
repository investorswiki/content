# Statement of Changes in Net Assets Available for Pension Benefits
## What Is a Statement of Changes in Net Assets Available for Pension Benefits?

A statement of changes in net assets accessible for pension benefits is a report on the financial status of a retirement fund that is given periodically to participants in the plan. It gives plan individuals a normal accounting of all transactions that influence the total accessible in the fund.

The purpose of the statement is to give current employees and retired people a feeling of a company's ability to meet its retirement funding commitments.

## Grasping the Statement of Changes

While the organizations and subtleties of pension fund statements shift, the statement of changes in net assets accessible for pension benefits must continuously list all augmentations and deductions from the accessible [asset list](/currentassets) for the pension fund.

Commonly, the largest changes will include increases or deductions to the value of investments made by the fund managers.

Increments to the accessible benefits will incorporate employer contributions to the plan. Deductions will incorporate administrative expenses and tax payments as well as pension benefits and death benefits paid out.

## Significance of the Statement to Participants

The statement of changes in net assets for some random period might demonstrate massive changes in the value of the assets in the fund. This is of interest to any fund participant, however it is generally pertinent to the individuals who have a defined-contribution plan as opposed to the people who have a defined-benefit plan.

- Participants in a [defined-contribution plan](/definedcontributionplan) contribute a set amount of money from every paycheck to a retirement fund. The employer might match part of that contribution. The performance of the fund after some time determines the amount that the participant will have for retirement income.
- Participants in a [defined-benefit plan](/definedbenefitpensionplan), then again, have a pre-defined pension payout amount that won't change with the high points and low points of the plan's assets. The amount depends on the employee's salary and length of service. That means the company, not the employee, accepts the risk of the investments made for the fund.

## About Pension Plans

Defined benefit plans are as yet common for employees of state and neighborhood legislatures yet have become moderately rare in the private sector. They are basically a type of life-time pension.

The defined contribution plan, including tax-advantaged assortments, for example, the 401(k), has supplanted the defined benefit plan as the decision of private companies.

Pension funds address large, long-term liabilities and require convoluted [accrual accounting](/accrualaccounting). Several common factors play into the complexities of pension fund accounting, all of which will impact the statement of changes in net assets. These factors incorporate the need to make evaluations of the size of payments to future retired people and the value of investment returns from one year to another.

## Features

- In the event that you have a defined-benefit plan, the company is committed to a set pension amount regardless of how the fund performs.
