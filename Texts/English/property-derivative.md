# Property Derivative
## What Is a Property Derivative?

A property derivative is a financial product that varies in value contingent upon the changes in the value of an underlying [real estate](/realestate) asset, typically a [index](/marketindex). Property derivatives furnish investors with exposure to a specific real estate market without purchasing and sell substantial properties.

## Figuring out a Property Derivative

Property derivatives are various financial derivatives. A financial derivative is a structure that takes its value from an underlying entity like an asset, an index, or an interest rate. Instances of derivatives incorporate [futures](/futures), options, swaps, and property index notes. Derivatives are financial contracts that are habitually used to [hedge](/hedge) against price developments, to guess on price developments utilizing leverage, or to gain access to assets or markets that are generally difficult to trade.

Property derivatives normally supplant a real property with the performance of a real estate return index, for example, the National Council of Real Estate Investment Fiduciaries Property Index (NPI). The NPI is the accepted index made to check the investment performance of the commercial real estate market and incorporates more than 9,000 properties. As of the second from last quarter of 2020, the index is worth around $703 billion, across all U.S. locales and real estate land utilizes. The index went down 1.7%.

An index is utilized in light of the fact that individual real estate assets can be difficult to price accurately and proficiently. A real estate index accumulates data across the broad real estate market trying to rough the value of underlying assets accurately.

## How Property Derivatives Work

Utilizing property derivatives, investors can move all through each of the four quadrants of the real estate market: private equity, public equity, private debt, and public debt. Doing so permits them to oversee risk and possibly increase returns to their existing real estate asset allocation.

An active derivatives market empowers an investor to reduce upfront capital requirements and to shelter real estate portfolios on the downside while giving risk management strategies.

## Utilizations of Property Derivatives

One method of utilizing property derivatives is to make a [total return swap](/totalreturnswap) of the National Council of Real Estate Investment Fiduciaries Index, broken down as per every property sector. The swap permits investors to take a position in an alternate property sector in which they may not currently own properties.

Investors can then swap the returns from various sub-sectors, for example, trading office-related real estate for retail real estate. Swaps permit investors to strategically change or rebalance their portfolios for a specific period, for the most part as long as three years. Extra methods incorporate "[going long](/long)," or reproducing the exposure of buying properties, and "[going short](/short)," or repeating the exposure of selling properties.
