# Not-Held Order
## What Is a Not-Held Order?

A not-held order gives a broker the time and price watchfulness to look for the best price that anyone could hope to find. The broker isn't held responsible for any likely losses or botched opportunities that outcome from their best efforts. A [held order](/held-order), conversely, requires immediate execution.

The not-held order is generally a [market](/marketorder) or [limit order](/limitorder).

## Grasping the Not-Held Order

An investor submitting a not-held request is believing that the broker can get a better [market price](/market-price) than the investor can get by getting to the market straightforwardly. The broker has price and time [discretion](/discretionaryorder), yet may not be held responsible for any losses due to a botched opportunity.

This order is otherwise called a discretionary or "with watchfulness" order.

The broker is "not held" responsible for neglecting to execute a trade above or below a joined limit price. For instance, a [broker](/broker) may have received a with carefulness order to buy 1,000 shares of ABC with an upper limit of $16. The broker could think the market is going to fall and won't buy the stock when it is trading below $16. All things being equal, the market rallies and the broker can't [execute](/execution) the order below $16. Since it was a not-held order, the investor has no recourse or grounds to whine.

Not-held orders are most common while trading international [equities](/value).

The orders that most investors place more often than not are held orders. That is, they require immediate execution at the current market price.

## When to Use Not-Held Orders

Not-held orders are not widely utilized in [liquid](/liquidity) markets since the volume of activity offers the investor more than adequate chance to get in and out of a position effortlessly.

At the point when a market or security is illiquid or moves whimsically, a not-held order might give the investor more peace of psyche.

- **Illiquid Stocks:** A not-held order permits a broker to try at a better cost than may be accomplished when forced to place an immediate order and pay a wide [bid-ask](/bid-and-ask) spread. For instance, on the off chance that the best bid in XYZ is $0.20 and the most minimal offer is $0.30, the broker could initially sit at the highest point of the bid at $0.21 and gradually increase the order's price with the hope of not addressing the a lot higher offer cost.
- **Periods of Increased Volatility:** An investor might opt for a not-held order during a period of high [volatility](/volatility), like after an earnings announcement, a broker downgrade, or a macroeconomic release, like the U.S. occupations report. Brokers utilize their judgment in view of comparative events in the past to decide the best time and price to execute the order.

## Types of Not-Held Orders
- **Market Not-Held Order**: This is a market order that lapses toward the finish of the trading day. An investor could give the broker a market not-held order to buy 1,000 Apple (AAPL) with a guidance to execute the order at the best price that anyone could hope to find before the market closes.
- **Limit Not-Held Order**: An upper or lower limit is appended to the not-held order, however the broker is given tact in executing it even assuming the market trades at the limit price. For example, a broker might receive a limit not-held order to buy 1,000 AAPL with an upper limit price of $200. This means that the investor would, in a perfect world, as to buy AAPL at $200, however would rather not pay more than that. The broker, however, may not take care of the request at $200 assuming that price appears to be too high at that point. The broker isn't held responsible on the off chance that the order doesn't get executed or gets executed at a price other than whatever the investor indicated.

## Benefits of Not-Held Orders

Brokers have the benefit of seeing order flows and trading designs, which frequently gives them an edge while deciding the best price and time to execute a client's order. For instance, a broker might notice a recurring spike in volume on the buy-side of the [order book](/order-book) that recommends a stock's price is probably going to rise. This would bring about the broker executing a client's not-held order as soon as possible.

## Limitations of Not-Held Orders

The investor who provides a not-held order to a broker is setting full confidence in that broker to execute the trade at the best conceivable price. The investor cannot dispute the trade [execution](/execution), gave that the broker met every single regulatory necessity.

For example, on the off chance that an investor thinks the broker shouldn't have executed the not-held order before a FOMC interest rate announcement, the investor cannot look for a rebooking.
