# Privatizing Profits and Socializing Losses
## What Is Privatizing Profits and Socializing Losses?

Privatizing profits and socializing losses alludes to the practice of treating company [earnings](/earnings) as the legitimate property of shareholders and company losses as a responsibility that society must shoulder. As such, the profitability of corporations is stringently for the benefit of their [shareholders](/shareholder). Be that as it may, when the companies fail, the aftermath — the losses and recuperation — is the responsibility of the overall population.

## Understanding Privatizing Profits and Socializing Losses

The basis of this concept is that profits and losses are dealt with in an unexpected way. At the point when companies, even those that are [publicly traded](/publiccompany), are profitable, the shareholders receive the benefits. In this manner, just a certain group of individuals benefit. However, when the losses these companies experience are steep, [taxpayers](/taxpayer) must bear the brunt.

Privatizing profits and socializing losses generally comes as an intervention from governments of some sort or another. This might be through [bailouts](/bailout) or quite a few [subsidies](/sponsorship).

Large corporations, their executives, and their shareholders are able to benefit from government appropriations and salvages to a great extent as a result of their ability to develop or buy influence through lobbyists. Simultaneously, protectors of disputable appropriations and bailouts battle that a few firms are [too big to fail](/too-big-to-fail).

This reasoning depends on the assumption that permitting them to collapse would cause economic slumps and affect the working and working class population than salvages do. This was the basis for the bailouts given to the big banks and automakers following the [economic crisis of 2007](/incredible downturn).

The phrase privatizing profits and socializing losses has a number of equivalent words, including socialism for the rich, capitalism for the poor, and lemon socialism. The last option was begat in a 1974 **New York Times** commentary about New York State's decision to buy two half-completed power plants from the striving electric utility ConEd for $500 million.

## Instance of Privatizing Profits and Socializing Losses: TARP

One of the latest instances of privatizing profits and socializing losses is the post-monetary crisis bailout of banks, insurers, and car manufacturers.

The [Troubled Asset Relief Program](/troubled-asset-relief-program-tarp) (TARP) of 2008 authorized the United States Treasury under President Barack Obama's administration to spend $700 billion of taxpayer money to safeguard these organizations, a considerable lot of which contributed to the crisis through foolish — and for some time, hugely profitable — interests in hazardous [mortgage-backed derivatives](/mbs). In reality, however, just $426.4 billion was really utilized.

A portion of the failing firms' employees were granted extravagant bonuses, in spite of accepting money from TARP and the [Federal Reserve](/federalreservesystem) (Fed). On the other hand, 861,664 families lost their homes to [foreclosure](/foreclosure) in 2008. The media and public widely perceived this differentiation as representing the support rich individuals receive from the government to the detriment of ordinary residents.
