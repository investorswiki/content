# Credit Scoring
## What is a credit scoring system?
Lenders utilize a credit scoring system, or a mathematical system, to measure how likely it is that a borrower will make payments on the money the individual in question borrows. It is made by allocating scores to different traits associated with the candidate's creditworthiness.
## More profound definition
A credit scoring system allows lenders and other financial institutions to decide the creditworthiness of an individual. A few financial organizations lay out their own credit scoring method.
Most will utilize a third-party professional service, for example, the Fair Isaac Corp's. credit scoring system. This system, otherwise called FICO, is the most widely utilized model accessible. FICO's scoring system relegates a mathematical representation of creditworthiness that reaches from 300 to 850. The higher the number, the higher the individual's credit score.
Many factors add to credit scores assigned through the systems. Factors incorporate payment interest, time span utilizing credit, amount of debt a person has and the types of debt that person has.
Lenders utilize these methods to decide how much risk a specific borrower puts on them assuming they choose to loan to that person. These figures are risk-based.
On the off chance that an individual has a low credit score, the person is probably going to pay more to borrow money to buy a home or finance a vehicle acquisition than somebody with a higher credit score. While credit scoring systems lay out a guideline, individual lenders figure out which level is acceptable and the amount to charge in interest.
