# Political Action Committee (PAC)
## What Is a Political Action Committee (PAC)?

In the U.S., a political action committee (PAC) is a political committee that pools campaign contributions from individuals and gives those funds to campaigns possibly in support of candidates, ballot drives, or legislation. PACs are commonly shaped to address business, labor, or philosophical interests by individuals who wish to privately fund-raise to give to a political campaign.

The primary PAC was framed in 1944 to fund-raise for the re-appointment of then-President Franklin D. Roosevelt.

## How a Political Action Committee Works

At the federal level, an organization is viewed as a PAC when it receives or spends more than $1,000 to influence a federal election.

There are many types of limitations that guide how PACs are able to raise money for and give their contributions to political campaigns or potentially causes. They can contribute $5,000 to a candidate committee for every election (primary, general, or special). They can likewise surrender to $15,000 yearly to any national party committee, and $5,000 yearly to some other PAC. PACs might receive up to $5,000 from any one individual, PAC, or party committee each calendar year.

A PAC must register with the U.S. Federal Election Committee in no less than 10 days of its formation, and it must give the name and address to the PAC, its treasurer, and any affiliated organizations. With the end goal of contribution limits, all affiliated PACs are treated as one contributor.

PACs are additionally required to reveal information pretty much all individuals who add to them. Nonetheless, at times these names are not revealed until after the election (when votes have been projected).

## Types of Political Action Committees (PACs)

There are numerous categories of PACs, including separate segregated funds (SSFs), nonconnected committees, Super PACs, and Leadership PACs.

### Separate Segregated Funds (SSFs)

Corporations, labor unions, enrollment organizations, or trade associations can lay out separate segregated funds (SSFs). When laid out, these committees can receive contributions from individuals that are associated with that associated or supporting organization.

### Nonconnected Committees

In contrast to SSFs, nonconnected committees are not sponsored by a specific entity or organization. Accordingly, they can acknowledge contributions from the overall population.

### Super PACs

Super PACs can receive unlimited contributions from individuals, corporations, labor unions, and different PACs.

### Hybrid PACs

A hybid PAC can act as both a PAC and a Super PAC. Hybrid PACs must keep up with segregated bank accounts for their unlimited Super PAC activities and their normal PAC gathering pledges and contributions, which are subject to similar statutory limitations as a standard PAC.

### Leadership PACs

A leadership PAC is a PAC that is laid out by a candidate or an individual holding federal office. It is common for individuals from Congress and other political leaders to lay out leadership PACs to support candidates for different chosen offices. Leadership PACs can contribute up to $5,000 per election to a federal candidate committee.

## PACs versus Super PACs

Super PACs were made in 2010 after the U.S. Court of Appeals' decision in SpeechNow.org v. Federal Election Committee. This decision considered a greater level of deregulation concerning how political funds are raised and distributed. While Super PAC funds can't be given straightforwardly to a campaign, Super PAC managers and political candidates are permitted to collaborate and examine strategy.

Starting from the commencement of Super PACs, they have in short order become a colossally powerful force in American politics. In fact, it is estimated that during the 2012 Republican primaries, Super PACs spent more money during the election cycle than the individual candidates' campaigns. The majority of this money was given by individuals instead of businesses.

## Special Considerations

Corporations can't contribute straightforwardly to a campaign; nonetheless, a 2010 Supreme Court decision-Citizens United v. Federal Election Committee-made it legal for corporations to support a PAC. The decision overruled the 2002 Campaign Reform Act, which prevented corporations, unions, and different elements from giving money to political campaigns.

The new laws permit these elements to contribute a limited amount of money to a PAC, which can, thus, be given to a campaign. On account of Super PACs, a corporation can contribute an unlimited amount of money. Even however this money can't be straightforwardly given to a campaign, it tends to be spent to influence an election in a roundabout way.
