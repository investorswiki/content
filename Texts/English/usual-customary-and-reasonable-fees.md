# Common, Customary and Reasonable Fees
## What are 'Common, Customary and Reasonable (UCR) Fees'?

Regular, customary and reasonable (UCR) fees are out-of-pocket fees that a medical coverage policyholder must pay for services. UCR fees depend on the services gave to policyholders, as well as the area of the country where the services are being given.

## Figuring out Usual, Customary and Reasonable Fees

A fee is considered common, customary and reasonable if:

1. It is a fee normally charged for a doctor for a service, and
1. It falls inside a price range that different doctors in the area charge, and
1. It is for a service considered significant under the current conditions.

UCR fees are checked by the insurance company, which decides if they seem OK when compared to what doctors in the area are charging. In the event that a doctor charges more than whatever the insurance company decides to be normal, customary and reasonable, the policyholder might be responsible for the difference between the amount charged for the service and the amount covered by the insurance company.

The amount of regular, customary and reasonable fees that are charged for services relies upon various factors, and the conditions under which a UCR fee is charged are outlined in the policy. Numerous medical insurance policies, for instance, break providers into "[network](/favored provider-association)" and "out of network" groupings. Utilizing an in-network provider might bring about no UCR fees being charged, yet utilizing an out-of-network doctor might bring about the policyholder is responsible for some or even all of the service costs.

Numerous policyholders just think about the cost of medical services after the service is given, and can be surprised when their insurance doesn't cover all expenses. To moderate the possibility of a big bill, policyholders ought to check whether a doctor is in the insurer's network, talk to the doctor about the cost of any service before the service is given, and ask the insurer the amount of the fee will be covered.

## Common, Customary and Reasonable Fees and Medicare

Medicare UCR charges are not regulated by state or federal agencies, but rather Medicare distributes its UCR fee schedule. This is commonly alluded to as "Medicare Allowable" charges. Providers who take an interest with [Medicare](/medicare) consent to acknowledge the Medicare passable charge as full payment. Patients are as yet responsible for their co-insurance and deductible.

 Medicare providers might decide not to bill the patient for amounts over the Medicare reasonable fee schedule. Checking that a provider "Acknowledges Medicare Assignment" or is a "Medicare Provider" to keep away from surprising and possibly large out-of-pocket expenses is important.""
