# Valued Policy Law (VPL)
## What Is Valued Policy Law?

Valued policy law (VPL) is a legal statute that requires insurance companies to pay the [full value](/full-value) of a policy to the insured in the event of a [total loss](/genuine total-loss). Valued policy law doesn't consider the real cash value of the insured property at the hour of the loss; all things considered, the law orders total payment.

A valued policy varies from an unvalued, or open, insurance policy, in which the value of the property would should be proven subsequent to a loss through the production of solicitations, gauges, claims agents, or other evidence.

## Figuring out Valued Policy Law

A total loss is a loss that happens when a [insured](/insurance) property is obliterated or damaged so much that it very well may be neither recovered nor repaired for additional utilization. Frequently, a total loss sets off the maximum settlement conceivable as per the terms of the insurance policy.

Insurance policies generally utilize one of two methods to decide the value of a loss: genuine cash value or [replacement cost.](/replacementcost)

- [Genuine cash value](/real cash-value) is the most common standard for deciding the amount of insurance required, the amount of loss to be paid, and the amount whereupon any coinsurance or comparable requirement will be based. Genuine cash value is defined as replacement cost at the hour of loss, less depreciation. Notwithstanding, this definition is being reworked through case law and state legislation by the [broad evidence rule](/broad-evidence-rule), which states that the determination of the genuine cash value of a loss ought to incorporate all important evidence an expert would use to set the value of the property, including replacement cost less depreciation and fair market value.
- **Replacement cost** means that the company will pay the cost to repair or supplant, after application of the deductible and with next to no depreciation.

As a general rule, valued policy laws expect that the amount stated in policy declarations will be dollar amount paid to the insured at the hour of loss. Assuming the value of an insured thing at the hour of loss is not exactly the amount of insurance, the insurer has no recourse to challenge payment in full. Also, in most valued policy states, any policy provision conflicting with the valued policy law is viewed as void.

Not all states inside the United States have these laws. States that really do have valued policy laws incorporate Arkansas, California, Florida, Georgia, Kansas, Louisiana, Minnesota, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, New Hampshire, North Dakota, Ohio, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, West Virginia, and Wisconsin.

## Valued Policy Law Controversy

Storm Katrina forced the insurance industry in Louisiana to look at the Valued Policy Law; not many policyholders were paid their whole coverage amount in view of understandings of the valued policy law. A few insurers claim that the law doesn't make a difference on the grounds that certain losses were a consequence of a non-covered peril (flood), that certain losses were an aftereffect of "blended causation" - a combination of a covered peril (wind) and a non-covered peril (flood) - and that the total loss was offset by different sources including the National Federal [Flood Insurance](/flood-insurance) Program and FEMA awards.
