# Short Sell Against the Box
## What Is a Short Sell Against the Box?

A short sell against the container is the act of [short selling](/shortselling) securities that you currently own, yet without [closing out](/selltoclose) the existing long position. This outcomes in a neutral position where all gains in a stock are equivalent to the losses and net to zero. The purpose is to try not to acknowledge capital gains from a sale to close, thus it has been restricted by regulators in practice.

For instance, in the event that you own 100 shares of ABC and you tell your [broker](/broker) to sell short 100 shares of ABC without selling your long position, you led a short sale against the container - with the long position in one account and the short position in another.

## Grasping a Short Sell Against the Box

A short sell against the case, otherwise called "shorting against the container," is a tax-minimization or [avoidance](/tax_avoidance) technique utilized by traders when they would actually prefer not to close out their long position on a stock. By selling short in an alternate account and keeping up with the long position, no capital gains are realized and any new gains delivered by one account will be similarly offset by losses in the other.

The strategy is likewise used by investors who accept that a stock they own is due for a fall in price, however don't wish to sell since they accept the fall is brief and the stock will rebound rapidly.

## Limitations and Tax Avoidance

Preceding 1997, the principal reasoning for shorting against the case was to postpone a [taxable event](/taxableevent). As per tax laws that went before that year, claiming both long and short positions in a stock implied that any paper gains from the [long position](/long) would be eliminated briefly due to the offsetting [short position](/short). The net effect of the two positions was zero, implying that no taxes must be paid.

The [Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997](/taxpayer-relief-act-of-1997) (TRA 97) presently not permitted short selling against the crate as a substantial tax deferral practice. Under TRA97, capital gains or [losses incurred](/losses-incurred) from short selling against the container are not deferred. The tax suggestion is that any related [capital gains taxes](/capital_gains_tax) will be owed in the current year.

The [Securities and Exchange Commission](/sec) (SEC) and the [Financial Industry Regulatory Authority](/finra) (FINRA) further regulated when sellers are permitted to sell short. For example, in February 2010, the SEC adopted the alternative uptick rule, which limits short selling when a stock drops over 10% in one day. In that situation, those participating in a short sale (even in the event that the shares are now owned) normally must open a margin account.

A feasible alternative strategy is rather buying a [put option](/putoption), which gives investors the right, however not the obligation, to sell the shares. Buying a put option has a per-share cost associated with it, which is comparable to a [short sale](/shortsale) transaction. Nonetheless, similar to all strategies that utilization options, put options are subject to the effects of [time decay](/timedecay). This addresses a cost that must be managed for options strategies to effectively work.

## Instance of Shorting Against the Box

For instance, say you have a big paper gain on shares of ABC in your principal brokerage account, which isn't a margin account. You think that ABC has arrived at its pinnacle and you need to sell. Notwithstanding, there will be a tax on the [capital gain](/capitalgain). Perhaps the next year you hope to get significantly less cash-flow, putting you in a lower bracket. It is more beneficial to take the gain once you enter a lower tax bracket.

To lock in your gains this year, you short the ABC's shares in your margin account. As is customary, you borrow shares from a broker. At the point when your bet (hopefully) works out as expected, you return the shares that you previously owned before the short to the broker, consequently avoiding the taxable event.
