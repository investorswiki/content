# Odd Lot
## What Is an Odd Lot?

An odd parcel is an order amount for a security that is not exactly the normal unit of trading for that particular asset. Odd parts are viewed as anything short of the standard 100 shares for stocks. Trading commissions for odd parts are generally higher on a percentage basis than those for standard parcels since most brokerage firms have a fixed least commission level for undertaking such transactions.

## Figuring out Odd Lots

Odd parcels may unintentionally emerge in an investor's portfolio through [reverse splits](/reversesplit) or [dividend reinvestment plans](/dividendreinvestmentplan). For instance, a one-for-eight reverse split of a security, of which the investor holds 200 shares, will bring about a post-split amount of 25 shares. While trading commissions for odd parts might in any case be higher than for [standard lots](/standard-parcel) on a percentage basis, the fame of online trading platforms and the resulting plunge in brokerage commissions means that it is at this point not as troublesome or costly for investors to discard odd parcels as it used to be in the past.

## Odd Lots, Round Lots, and Mixed Lots

While odd parcels can incorporate quite a few shares somewhere in the range of one and 100, a [round lot](/roundlot) is any part of shares that can be equally separated by 100. For instance, 75 shares would be an odd parcel since it is below 100 shares, while 300 shares would be considered a round part since it tends to be uniformly separated by 100.

While round parcels are posted on the associated exchange, odd parcels are not posted as part of the bid/ask data. Further, the execution of odd-part trades doesn't display on different data reporting sources. Due to the extraordinary number of shares associated with the trade, odd-parcel transactions frequently take more time to complete than those associated with round parts.

[Mixed lots](/mixedlot) incorporate parcels with north of 100 shares, however that can't be equitably isolated by 100. For instance, 147 or 2,999 would both be mixed parts. Reporting on mixed parts, including bid/ask data, generally just displays the portion that comprises a round parcel. For instance, utilizing the previously mentioned mixed-part estimates, the 147 shares would report as 100 and the 2,999 shares would report as 2,900.

## Giving Company Actions on Odd Lots

Since an odd parcel is thought of as genuinely inconsequential to larger institutions, a company might decide to wipe out any odd holdings from the marketplace. This can incorporate buying out the associated shareholder at a premium, offering extra shares to the shareholder to make a round parcel, or participating in a reverse split intended to bring about the odd part becoming equivalent to short of what one share to pay the investor cash for a residual holding.
