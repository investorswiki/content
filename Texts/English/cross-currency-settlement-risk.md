## What Is Cross-Currency Settlement Risk?

Cross-currency settlement risk is a type of [settlement risk](/settlementrisk) in which a party engaged with a [foreign exchange](/foreign-exchange) transaction sends the currency it has sold however doesn't receive the currency it has bought. In cross-currency settlement risk, the full amount of the currency purchased is at risk. This risk exists from the time that an irrevocable payment guidance has been made by the [financial institution](/financialinstitution) for the sale currency, to the time that the purchase currency has been received in the account of the institution or its agent.

Cross-currency settlement risk is likewise called Herstatt risk, after the small German bank whose disappointment in June 1974 featured this risk.

## Understanding Cross-Currency Settlement Risk

One explanation that cross-currency settlement risk is a concern is just due to the difference in time regions around the world. Foreign exchange trades are directed globally around the clock and time differences mean that the two legs of a currency transaction will generally not be settled all the while.

To act as an illustration of cross-currency settlement risk, think about a U.S. bank that purchases 10 million euros in the [spot market](/spotmarket) at the [exchange rate](/exchangerate) of EUR 1 = USD 1.12. This means that at settlement, the U.S. bank will dispatch US$11.2 million and, in exchange, will receive 10 million euros from the [counterparty](/counterparty) to this trade. Cross-currency settlement risk will emerge if the U.S. bank makes an irrevocable payment guidance for US$11.2 million a couple of hours before it receives the EUR10 million in its [nostro account](/nostroaccount) in full settlement of the trade.

The [2007-2008 Global Financial Crisis](/financial-crisis) and the Greek debt crisis raised concerns about cross-currency settlement risk. Given how monetarily harming the two incidents were in alternate ways, the concerns over currency settlement risk ended up being nearly exaggerated.
