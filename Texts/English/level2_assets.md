# Level 2 Assets
## What Is a Level 2 Asset?

Level 2 assets are [financial assets](/financialasset) and [liabilities](/liability) that are hard to value. Albeit a fair value can be resolved in light of other data values or market prices, these assets don't have customary market pricing. Level 2 asset values, in some cases called "[mark-to-model](/mark_to_model)" assets, can be closely approximated utilizing simple models and extrapolation methods. These methods utilize known, discernible prices as boundaries.

## Figuring out Level 2 Assets

[Publicly traded companies](/publiccompany) are committed to lay out fair values for the assets they carry on their books. Investors depend on these fair value assessments to break down the association's current condition and future possibilities. As indicated by [generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP)](/gaap), certain assets must be recorded at their current value, not historical cost. Publicly traded companies must likewise characterize each of their assets in view of the straightforwardness with which they can be valued in compliance with the accounting standard Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) [157](/fasb_157).

Three distinct asset levels were presented by the U.S. [FASB](/fasb) to carry clearness to partnerships' [balance sheets](/balancesheet). Level 2 assets are the middle classification in light of how dependably their fair market value can be calculated. [Level 1 assets](/level1_assets), like stocks and bonds, are the least demanding to value, while [Level 3 assets](/level3_assets) must be valued in light of internal models or "approximates" and have no discernible market prices.

Level 2 assets must be valued utilizing market data got from outside, independent sources. The data involved could remember quoted prices for comparable assets and liabilities for active markets, prices for indistinguishable or comparative assets and liabilities in inactive markets, or models with perceptible sources of info, for example, [interest rates](/interestrate), [default rates](/defaultrate), and [yield curves](/yieldcurve).

An illustration of a Level 2 asset is a [interest rate swap](/interestrateswap). Here, the asset value can be resolved in view of the noticed values for underlying interest rates and market-decided [risk premiums](/riskpremium). Level 2 assets are usually held by [private equity firms](/privateequity), insurance companies, and other financial institutions that have investment arms.

## Real World Example of Level 2 Assets

The Blackstone Group L.P. (BX) breaks down its Level 2 assets in the association's [10-K](/10-k) and [10-Q](/10q) filings for shareholders. The asset manager disclosed the accompanying data in the filings:

"Fair not set in stone using models or other valuation strategies. Financial instruments which are generally remembered for this category incorporate corporate bonds and loans, including corporate bonds and loans held inside [CLO](/clo) vehicles, government and agency securities, less liquid and restricted equity securities, and certain over-the-counter derivatives where the fair value depends on perceptible information sources. Senior and subordinated notes issued by CLO vehicles are classified inside Level II of the fair value hierarchy."

### Discernible versus Imperceptible Inputs

Investors and analysts some of the time battle to distinguish the difference between Level 2 and Level 3 assets. In any case, the difference is important, especially as GAAP requires extra disclosures for Level 3 assets and liabilities.

Whether an asset or liability is Level 2 or Level 3 is dependent on the valuation sources of info and whether the market data utilized is accessible to the public. Think about the accompanying points:

- Is the value upheld by real market transactions?
- Is a price gotten from outside the organization and promptly accessible to the public?
- Is the valuation distributed at standard spans?

In the event that the response to any of these questions is no, the info might be viewed as undetectable and, subsequently, Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy.
