# Contingent Immunization
## What Is Contingent Immunization?

Contingent immunization is an investment approach where a fund manager changes to a defensive strategy in the event that the portfolio return drops below a predetermined point. Contingent immunization regularly alludes to a contingency plan utilized in some [fixed-income](/fixedincome) portfolios. It is a strategy where a fund manager utilizes a [active management](/activemanagement) approach to separately choose securities in order to outperform a [benchmark](/benchmark). Notwithstanding, a contingency plan is set off once certain predetermined losses have accumulated. The thought is that the contingency plan will vaccinate assets against additional losses.

Contingent immunization is an extension of [classic immunization](/immunization), mixing the last option with an active management approach, ideally catching the advantages of both. Classic immunization can be defined as the creation of a fixed-income portfolio that delivers a guaranteed return for a set period, paying little mind to parallel changes in the [yield curve](/yieldcurve).

## How Contingent Immunization Works

At the point when an investment portfolio's returns drop to a predetermined level, the portfolio manager swears off the run of the mill active management approach and executes a contingency plan. This plan is expected to inoculate the assets against additional losses. Excellent assets with a low, yet stable, income stream are purchased to safeguard the excess assets and lock in a base return. Preferably, the assets purchased match up with any liabilities, leaving the underlying assets unchanged in the event of interest-rate changes.

Contingent immunization is a form of [dedicated portfolio](/dedicatedportfolio) theory. It includes developing a dedicated portfolio constructed utilizing securities with an anticipated income stream, like excellent bonds. Assets are frequently held to maturity to generate an anticipated income to pay liabilities. One approach is to make long-term and short-term positions along the yield curve. This strategy is helpful for a portfolio of a single asset type, for example, government bonds.

The least complex form of an immunization strategy is cash [matching](/matchingstrategy), where an investor purchases zero-coupon bonds matching the amount and length of its liabilities. A more pragmatic application would be a [duration](/duration)- matching strategy. In this scenario, the duration of assets is matched to the duration of liabilities.

A severe risk-minimization approach might be too restrictive to make an adequate return in certain situations. In the event that a substantial increase to the expected return can be achieved with little effect on immunization risk, the higher-yielding portfolio is frequently preferred. The difference between the base acceptable performance and the higher conceivable inoculated rate is known as the cushion spread.

## Advantages of Contingent Immunization

The primary advantage of contingent immunization is that it limits [tracking risk](/trackingerror). For instance, a bond fund manager might can invest in [junk bonds](/junkbond) or take a [overweight](/overweight) position in long-term government bonds. That empowers the fund to beat the bond market, however it can likewise lead to underperformance. Each manager has great years and awful years. Contingent immunization limits the losses from terrible years by driving the manager to return to a safer position after losses.

In theory, contingent immunization allows the great times to roll while cutting losses. In the event that a fund manager just continues to win, investors in the fund can substantially beat the market. Then again, contingent immunization acts to some degree like a [stop-loss order](/stop-lossorder) when the manager is underperforming.

## Disadvantages of Contingent Immunization

It very well may be contended that contingent immunization is just one more form of [market timing](/markettiming), and it experiences similar downsides. As opposed to restricting losses, contingent immunization can lock them in.

Assume that a fund manager guesses that the [Federal Reserve](/federalreservesystem) (Fed) will end a round of interest rate hikes. The manager then takes up a substantial position in long-term government bonds trying to profit. Assuming the Fed raises rates just once again, long-term Treasury prices will go down rather than up. The fund manager could be pushed out of the position in long-term government bonds by contingent immunization. Since it was the last interest rate increase, Treasury prices will begin going up not long after that. Contingent immunization will then, at that point, force the appalling fund manager to sit uninvolved.
