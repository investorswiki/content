# Qualifying Disposition
## What Is a Qualifying Disposition?

Qualifying disposition alludes to a sale, transfer, or exchange of stock that meets all requirements for good tax treatment. People normally gain this type of stock through an incentive stock option (ISO), or through a qualified [employee stock purchase plan (ESPP)](/espp). A qualified ESPP requires shareholder endorsement before it is carried out. Moreover, all plan individuals must have equivalent rights in the plan.

## How Qualifying Disposition Works

To be a qualifying disposition, the employee must sell their position no less than one year in the wake of practicing the stock, and two years after the [incentive stock option (ISO)](/iso) was granted, or two years after the beginning of the ESPP offering period.

For instance, assume Cathy's ISO options were granted September 20, 2018, and she exercises them September 20, 2019. In this scenario, Cathy must hold on until September 20, 2020, before she might report a long-term capital gain.

The capital gains treatment for a qualifying disposition applies to the amount of the sale addressed by the difference between the exercise price of the option's stock, and the market price at which the stock sold. For instance, on the off chance that Tim exercises 1,000 ISO options at $10 per share, and sells them for $30 per share, he thusly will report a capital gain of $20,000 ($20 x 1000 shares).

Non-legal stock options (NSOs) don't meet all requirements for capital gains tax treatment and are taxed at ordinary income rates. Giving a compensation package that incorporates ISOs and a qualified ESPP helps companies draw in and hold top-level work force. It likewise adjusts a company's management and key employees with its shareholders, as they all maintain that the company should succeed and increase its share price.

A few companies don't offer ISOs, in light of the fact that as opposed to non-legal (or non-qualified) option plans there is no tax deduction for the company when the options are exercised.

## Special Considerations

"Bargain element" alludes to an option that can be exercised below the current market price, which furnishes the employee with an immediate profit. An employee who exercises a non-legal option must report the bargain element as earned income, which is subject to income tax. It ought to be noticed that employees who hold ISOs are not ordered to report the bargain element, until after they sell their shares.

The bargain element is reported as ordinary income on the off chance that the shares were immediately sold after they were exercised (a disqualifying disposition). On the other hand, the bargain element is reported as a long-term capital gain in the event that the sale was executed one year in the wake of practicing the options, and two years after the grant date (qualifying disposition).

> The bargain element for NSOs is added to a singular's alternative least taxable income, which has a flat tax intended to guarantee everybody pays their fair share of taxes notwithstanding tax minimization strategies.

## Qualifying Distribution versus Disqualifying Distribution

A disqualifying distribution is the sale or exchange of shares received from an ISO or ESPP before the holding period has been met. The ISO holding period is one year from the exercise date and two years from the grant date or two years from the ESPP offering date. Gains or losses realized in a disqualifying disposition are taxed at a higher rate.

On the off chance that ESPP or ISO shares are sold in a qualifying disposition, the bargain amount is taxed at the capital gains rate. Disqualifying dispositions are recorded at the [income tax](/incometax) rate, which is generally higher than the capital gains tax.
