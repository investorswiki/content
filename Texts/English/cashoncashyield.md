# Cash-on-Cash Yield
## What Is Cash-on-Cash Yield?

Cash-on-cash yield is a fundamental calculation used to estimate the return from an asset that creates income. Cash-on-cash yield likewise alludes to the total amount of distributions paid annually by a [income trust](/incometrust) as a percentage of its current price. The cash-on-cash yield is a measurement technique that can be utilized to look at changed [unit trusts](/unittrust).

This term is likewise alluded to as "cash-on-cash return."

## Understanding Cash-on-Cash Yield

Cash-on-cash yield is helpful as an initial estimate of the return from an investment and can be calculated as follows:

>
> Cash-on-Cash Yield = Annual Net Cash Flow/Invested Equity

Cash-on-cash yield has number of limitations. The measurement might exaggerate yield on the off chance that part of the distribution consists of a "[return of capital (ROC)](/returnofcapital)," as opposed to a "[return on invested capital (ROIC)](/returnoninvestmentcapital)," as is much of the time the case with income trusts. Likewise, as a pre-charge measure of return, it doesn't think about taxes.

For instance, in the event that an apartment priced at $200,000 produces monthly rental income of $1,000, the cash-on-cash yield on an annualized basis would be: 6% ($1,000 * 12/$200,000 = 0.06).

In the context of income trusts, expect a trust with a current [market price](/market-price) of $20 pays out $2 in annual distributions, consisting of $1.50 in income and 50 pennies in ROC. The cash-on-cash yield in this case is 10%; be that as it may, since part of the distribution consists of return of ROC, the genuine yield is 7.5%. The cash-on-cash yield measure exaggerates the return in this case.

## Cash-on-Cash Yield and Real Estate Value Calculations

While cash-on-cash yield can be utilized in a number of conditions; the measurement is many times utilized in the real estate market while esteeming commercial properties - particularly ones that include long-term debt borrowing. Cash-on-cash yield can likewise be utilized while determining in the event that a property is undervalued. At the point when debt is noted in a real estate transaction (as is normally the case), the genuine cash return of the investment contrasts from the standard [return on investment (ROI)](/returnoninvestment).

Cash-on-cash yield remembers no appreciation or depreciation for the investment. Calculations in view of standard ROI will consolidate the total return of an investment; on the other hand, cash-on-cash yield essentially measures the return on the genuine cash invested.

In contrast with a monthly coupon distribution, cash-on-cash yield is certainly not a completely guaranteed outlay. While forecasting, a cash-on-cash yield must be utilized as an estimate to evaluate future potential.

## Illustration of Cash-on-Cash Yield

Assume a real estate company purchases a building for $500,000. It spends a further $100,000 on repairs to the building. To finance its purchase, the company makes a down payment of $100,000 and applies for a new line of credit of $400,000 with yearly mortgage payments of $20,000. The company procures $50,000 in rental income during the primary year.

The calculation for its cash-on-cash yield starts with cash flow. The cash flow for the company is $50,000 - $20,000 = $30,000. The total amount invested in the building is $220,000 = $100,000 (down payment) + $100,000 (repairs to the building) + $20,000 (mortgage payment). The building's cash-on-cash yield is 13.6% ($30,000/$220,000).

## Features
