The MUR (Mauritius Rupee) is the national currency of the Republic of Mauritius. It is partitioned into 100 pennies and issued by the Bank of Mauritius.

## Grasping the MUR (Mauritius Rupee)

       The MUR (Mauritius Rupee) is one of several currencies which carry the rupee designation. Different currencies incorporate those of India, Pakistan, and Indonesia.

Beginning around 1994, the Bank of Mauritius has utilized a [dirty float](/dirtyfloat) to set the value of MUR against different currencies. Under this system, the Bank of Mauritius deals with the exchange rate by mediating in [foreign exchange markets](/foreign-exchange-markets), utilizing the country's [reserves](/monetary-hold) to balance out the value of its currency in times of volatility.

In 1820, at the settlement's request, Britain presented the Mauritius dollar at [par](/parvalue) with the Spanish dollar, however Indian rupees (INR) and British pounds kept on coursing alongside the dollar. A deluge of Indian migration into Mauritius during the 1800s caused a gigantic inflow of Indian rupees into the country.

This deluge prompted the foundation of the Mauritius rupee, which supplanted the Indian rupee, the Mauritius dollar, and the British pound ([GBP](/gbp)) as legal tender in the country in 1877. The new currency, presented at par with the Indian rupee, was equivalent to 0.5 Mauritius dollars. At that point, 10.25 Mauritius rupees rose to 1 British pound.

In 1934, the government changed pegs from the Indian rupee to the British pound, utilizing a rate of 13.3 MUR to 1 GBP. The Bank of Mauritius appeared in late 1967, supplanting the Board of Commissioners of Currency ahead of the country's independence from Britain.

The country canceled its peg to the British pound in 1972, laying out a [exchange rate](/exchangerate) that practically followed the U.S. dollar ([USD](/usd)) through a [crawling band](/crawlingpeg) or peg. In 1979, a fall in global sugar prices and a rise in oil prices put pressure on Mauritius' economy.

As part of the agreement to receive aid from the [International Monetary Fund](/imf) (IMF), the country agreed to a 22.9% devaluation of the rupee in October of that year. One more sizable depreciation of 16.7% continued in September 1981, leading to political commotion and a continuous discussion about the social and political fallout from currency devaluation.

In 1982, the bank re-pegged the currency to a basket of currencies weighted to mirror its major trading partners. This situation, too, ended up following developments of the U.S. dollar with a marginally more extensive crawling band than seen beforehand. Independence matched with the abolishment of limitations on foreign exchange inside the country and a change in policy that really restricted the crawling peg around the U.S. dollar.

Further liberalization of fiscal policy brought about a transition to a [managed float](/dirtyfloat) policy, which the central bank has utilized starting around 1994.
