# Herbert A. Simon
## Who Was Herbert A. Simon?

Herbert A. Simon (1916-2001) was an American economist and political scientist who won the [Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences](/nobel-memorial-prize-in-economic-sciences) in 1978 for his contributions to modern business economics and administrative research. He is widely associated with the theory of limited rationality, which states that individuals don't pursue entirely rational choices due to both cognitive limits (the difficulty in getting and processing all the data required) and social limits (personal and social ties among individuals).

Simon earned his Ph.D. from the University of Chicago in 1943. Subsequent to graduating, he worked in research and held showing posts at a small bunch of universities before joining the Carnegie Mellon University personnel in 1949. He showed there for over 50 years, as a teacher of administration, psychology, and computer science. He likewise played a part in the foundation of several of Carnegie Mellon's specialties and schools, including the Graduate School of Industrial Administration, which is presently known as the Tepper School of Business.

Notwithstanding the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economics, Simon received the A.M. Turing Award in 1975 for his work in computer science, including his contributions to the area of artificial intelligence. He additionally won the U.S. National Medal of Science in 1986.

Simon created many journal articles and 27 books during his lifetime, including "Administrative Behavior" (1947), "The Sciences of the Artificial" (1968), and "Models of Bounded Rationality" (1982).

## Herbert A. Simon and Bounded Rationality

Herbert A. Simon and his speculations on economic dynamic challenged classical economic reasoning, including the thoughts of [rational behavior](/rational-behavior) and the atomistic individualism of [economic man](/economic-man). Instead of buying into the possibility that economic behavior was rational and in light of all available data to secure the best conceivable outcome for an individual ("advancing"), Simon accepted navigation was tied in with achieving outcomes that were "sufficient" for the individual in view of their limited data and adjusting the interests of others. Simon called this "[satisficing](/satisficing)." His term was a combination of the words "fulfill" and "do the trick."

As per Simon, since humans couldn't in any way, shape or form get or handle all the data expected to pursue completely rational choices, they rather try to utilize the data they really do need to create a palatable outcome, or one that is "sufficient." He portrayed humans as being limited by their own "cognitive limits."

Notwithstanding cognitive limits, Simon likewise expounded on how personal relations and social organizations compel navigation. This means that individuals frequently don't settle on choices considering just their own interests or the individual's [utility](/utility) maximization, however must arrange, apply power over, or in any case explore the interests of others and the rules of the institutional setting inside which they operate.

Together these cognitive and social limits and the manner in which they shape direction are regularly known as the theory of limited rationality. Under limited rationality, leaders must agree to finding palatable answers for the problem or problems in front of them, while being aware of how other chiefs in the company are taking care of their own problems. Inside these limits, navigation can in any case be rational in that it comprises of looking at the relative costs, benefits, and risks to accomplish an ideal outcome. Limited rationality would likewise proceed to turn into a primary element in [behavioral economics](/behavioraleconomics), which on occasion additionally questions whether human navigation is truly rational by any stretch of the imagination.

At the point when the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences awarded Simon the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economics for his work around here, it noticed that a lot of modern business economics and administrative research depend on his thoughts. Simon supplanted the concept of the omniscient, benefit expanding entrepreneur with participating chiefs an instructive, personal, inside a company face enlightening, personal, and social limitations.

## Herbert A. Simon and Artificial Intelligence

Herbert A. Simon is viewed as a trailblazer in the underpinnings of artificial intelligence. During the 1950s, Simon and Allen Newell of the Rand Corporation endeavored to reproduce human dynamic on computers. In 1955, they composed a computer program that had the option to demonstrate mathematical hypotheses. The pair called it their "machine that thinks."
