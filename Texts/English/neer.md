# Nominal Effective Exchange Rate (NEER)
## What Is the Nominal Effective Exchange Rate (NEER)?

The nominal effective exchange rate (NEER) is an unadjusted [weighted average](/weightedaverage) rate at which one country's currency exchanges for a basket of different foreign currencies. The nominal exchange rate is the amount of domestic currency expected to purchase foreign currency.

In economics, the NEER is an indicator of a country's international competitiveness in terms of the foreign exchange (forex) market. Forex traders at times allude to the NEER as the trade-weighted currency index.

The NEER might be adjusted to compensate for the inflation rate of the nation of origin relative to the inflation rate of its trading partners. The subsequent figure is the real effective exchange rate (REER). Dissimilar to the connections in a nominal exchange rate, not entirely settled for every currency separately. All things considered, one individual number, commonly an index, communicates how a domestic currency's value compares against numerous foreign currencies immediately.

In the event that a domestic currency increments against a [basket ](/basket)of different currencies inside a floating exchange rate system, NEER is said to appreciate. Assuming the domestic currency falls against the basket, the NEER deteriorates.

## What Does the Nominal Effective Exchange Rate (NEER) Tell You?

The NEER just portrays relative value; it can't conclusively show whether a currency is strong or acquiring strength in real terms. It just portrays whether a currency is weak or strong, or weakening or strengthening, compared to foreign currencies. Similarly as with all exchange rates, the NEER can assist with recognizing which currencies store value pretty much effectively. Exchange rates influence where international entertainers buy or sell goods.

NEER is utilized in economic studies and for policy analysis on international trade. Likewise utilized by forex traders take part in currency arbitrage. The Federal Reserve computes three unique NEER indices for the United States: the broad index, the Advanced Foreign Economies (AFE) and the Emerging Market Economies (EME).

### The Basket of Foreign Currencies

Each NEER compares one individual currency against a basket of foreign currencies. This basket is picked in light of the domestic country's most important trading partners as well as other major currencies. The world's major currencies are the U.S. dollar, the Euro, the British pound, the Japanese yen, the Australian dollar, the Swiss franc, and the Canadian dollar.

The value of foreign currencies in a basket are weighted according to the value of trade with the domestic country. This could be export or import value, the total value of exports and imports combined or another measure. The loads frequently connect with the assets and [liabilities](/responsibility) of various countries.

A higher NEER coefficient (over 1) means that the nation of origin's currency is generally worth in excess of an imported currency, and a lower coefficient (below 1) means that the home currency is typically worth not exactly the imported currency.

There is no international standard for choosing a basket of currencies. The Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) basket is not quite the same as the basket for the International Monetary Fund (IMF) or the Federal Reserve or Bank of Japan. Be that as it may, various institutions depend on the International Financial Statistics (IFS) distributed by the IMF.
