# Underwriting Spread
## What Is Underwriting Spread?

An underwriting spread is the difference between the dollar amount that [underwriters](/underwriter, for example, investment banks, pay a responsible company for its securities and the dollar amount that underwriters receive from selling the securities in a public offering. The underwriting spread is basically the investment bank's [gross profit margin](/gross_profit_margin), regularly unveiled as a percentage or in focuses per-unit-of-offer.

## Understanding Underwriting Spread

The size of underwriting not set in stone on a deal-by-deal basis and is impacted for the most part by the underwriter's perceived risk in the deal. This will likewise be affected by expectations for the demand of the securities in the market.

The size of the [underwriting](/underwriting) spread relies upon the exchanges and competitive bidding among members of a [underwriter syndicate](/underwriter-syndicate) and the responsible company itself. The spread increases as the risks implied with the issuance increase.

The underwriting spread for a [initial public offering (IPO)](/ipo) ordinarily incorporates the accompanying parts:

- The manager's fee (earned by the lead)
- The [underwriting fee](/underwriting-fees) (earned by syndicate members)
- The [concession](/concession) (given to the [broker-dealer](/broker-dealer) marketing the shares)

The manager is generally qualified for the whole underwriting spread. Every member of the underwriting syndicate then, at that point, gets a (not be guaranteed to rise to) share of the underwriting fee and a portion of the concession. Moreover, a broker-dealer, which isn't itself a member of the underwriter syndicate, procures a share of the concession in light of how well it does selling the issue.

Proportionately, the concession increases as total underwriting fees rise. In the interim, the management and underwriting fees decline with gross underwriting fees. The effect of size on the division of fees is normally due to differential economies of scale. The degree of investment banker work, for instance, recorded as a hard copy the [prospectus](/prospectus) and setting up the roadshow, is fairly fixed, while the amount of sales work isn't. Bigger deals won't include dramatically greater investment banker work.

Notwithstanding, it could include considerably more sales exertion, requiring an increase in the proportion of the selling concession. On the other hand, junior banks might join a syndicate, even on the off chance that they receive a more modest share of the fees as a lower selling concession.

To represent an underwriting spread, consider a company that receives $36 per share from the underwriter for its shares. In the event that the underwriters pivot and sell the stock to the public at $38 per share, the underwriting spread would be $2 per share.
