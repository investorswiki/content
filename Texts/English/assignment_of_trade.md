# Assignment of Trade (AOT)
## What Is Assignment of Trade (AOT)?

Assignment of trade (AOT) is a [transaction](/transaction) utilized fundamentally in the [mortgage-backed securities (MBSs)](/mbs) [to be announced (TBA)](/tba) market, where the obligation to satisfy an existing forward trade is assigned by one of the [counterparties](/counterparty) to a [third party](/third-party).

AOTs are habitually used to try not to need to make delivery of [securities](/security) into, or receive delivery of securities from, a TBA trade â€” a contract to purchase or sell a MBS, a [bond](/bond) that is secured by [mortgage](/mortgage) [loans](/loan), on a specific date.

## How Assignment of Trade (AOT) Works

AOT is essentially a three-party agreement between a [assignor](/assignor) (typically the originator of the underlying mortgages), a [assignee](/assignee) (the [investor](/investor)), and a [dealer](/dealer) or [broker](/broker). The assignor is anxious to get the mortgages under the table to eliminate the threat of factors, for example, [interest rate risk](/interestraterisk), [prepayment risk](/prepaymentrisk), and [default risk](/defaultrisk).

The assignor needs this risk gone as soon as possible, so a [hedge](/hedge) is sold as a MBS on the TBA market. Notwithstanding, the MBS actually must be delivered and the AOT can be the most savvy approach to getting that going.

Mortgage originators use AOT to work with the pricing and purchase of whole loans by the third party to which the TBA trade is assigned, with the agreement that the third party will then make delivery of a MBS into the original TBA trade, which was taken out by the mortgage originator as a hedge.

All in all, an AOT permits a mortgage originator to unwind its hedge position by relegating it to the third party and at the same time consenting to sell an equivalent amount of loans to that third party. The price at which the whole loans are sold to the third party is laid out by the price of the trade being assigned.

## Illustration of Assignment of Trade (AOT)

The assignor sells a MBS to the dealer for future delivery, making a hedge against a portion of the risks that accompany the loans it has issued. As of now, the dealer is waiting for the pooled security, and the assignor is committed to deliver it.

Enter the third-party assignee who will assume the loans right away, gathering the [income](/income) streams from them, and afterward delivering the MBS to the dealer and satisfying the obligations of the assignor. The assignee currently holds the loans, and the dealer has the MBS that the underlying loans feed into.

The assignee faces default risks yet can in any case benefit from [interest rate](/interestrate) shifts that increase the [profits](/benefit) from variable loans. The dealer holds the MBS and the prepayment risks that accompany them as well as the settled upon floods of [interest](/interest) and [principal](/principal). In the mean time, the assignor, as the loan originator, has new space on the books to issue new loans.

This approach can reduce a portion of the expenses that could somehow come as fees, [buybacks](/buyback), and transfers.
