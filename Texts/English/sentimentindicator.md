# Sentiment Indicator
## What Is a Sentiment Indicator?

 A sentiment indicator is intended to address how a group feels about the market or economy. These [market psychology](/marketpsychology)- based indicators endeavor to evaluate sentiment, as figures or graphically, to anticipate what current convictions and positions might mean for future market behavior

Sentiment indicators take a gander at how [bullish](/bull) or [bearish](/bear) market entertainers and what they are thinking and feeling, which might assist with forecasting investors' future behavior. At the point when sentiment readings are strangely high or low, they might start acting in a contrarian way. For instance, when investors are extremely bearish, that is frequently a [contrary signal](/contrarian) to sentiment indicator traders that market prices could begin heading higher soon.

## What Do Sentiment Indicators Tell You?

Sentiment indicators can be utilized by investors to perceive how hopeful or cynical individuals are about the current market or economic conditions. For instance, a [consumer sentiment](/consumer-sentiment) indicator, for example, the Michigan Consumer Sentiment report, shows cynicism might make companies less inclined to stock up on inventory, since they might fear that consumers won't spend.

The data is subject to interpretation. A high perusing shows consumers are cheery. Yet from a high perusing, some vibe it will probably head lower over the long haul. A low perusing shows consumers are downtrodden, yet from that point, things are probably going to get to the next level.

Sentiment indicators are just one piece of data and are not meant to be a timing signal for making a move. For instance, if a sentiment indicator, like the put/call ratio, has an extremely high perusing (relative to historical values) that demonstrates investors are anticipating that stock market prices should decline. The opposite viewpoint shows that prices will probably rise since there are not many individuals passed on to keep pushing prices lower. Everything the indicator doesn't say to us is the point at which that will occur. All things considered, traders utilize the data to look for defining moments in price when sentiment levels hit extremes.

At the point when sentiment indicators aren't close to extremes, they can assist with affirming the current trend. For instance, a rising put/call ratio signals investors are skeptical, which would help affirm a downtrend in price. Likewise, a falling put/call ratio would assist with affirming a rising price.

Policymakers may likewise utilize sentiment indicators with other economic data to assist with determining the future course of interest rates, for instance.

## Types of Market Sentiment Indicators

Investors can utilize sentiment indicators to gain understanding into the stock market's temperament. Extreme readings given by these indicators can demonstrate looming reversals. Here is a small sample of the sentiment indicators that traders and analysts could utilize:

### CBOE Volatility Index (VIX)

Investors frequently view this indicator as the "fear index" since it spikes when investors purchase a lot of [put options](/put) to safeguard their portfolios. Investors who buy put options accept the price of the underlying stock will fall. If the [VIX](/vix) spikes, it demonstrates fear inside the market.

### New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) High/Low Indicator

Investors can keep track of this indicator to compare stocks making new [52-week highs](/52weekhighlow) relative to stocks making new 52-week lows. Spikes in either course frequently show extreme bullish or bearish sentiment. Contrarian investors could utilize this sentiment indicator to buy quality stocks during periods of extreme cynicism.

### NYSE 200-day Moving Average

This indicator shows the number of stocks that are trading over their long-term moving average and is communicated as a percentage. For instance, in the event that the indicator is rising and shows that more than 60% of stocks are trading over their 200-day moving averages, it demonstrates a broad bullish sentiment. A perusing 80% proposes stocks might be [overbought](/overbought).

### Odd-Lot Trading Statistics

This indicator measures the number of shares being bought and sold in [odd lots](/oddlot), which is under 100 shares for most stocks. The theory behind this sentiment indicator is that [retail investors](/retailinvestor), who ordinarily have the least amount of money are probably going to buy and sell odd parts, buy when bullish sentiment has crested, and sell when bearish sentiment arrives at a climax. Hence, when odd-parcel trading increments during market extremes, clever investors might steer a position the other way.

### The Commitment of Traders Report

This weekly report shows the aggregate positioning of various groups of traders in the [futures](/futures) markets. A rising speculative position shows a rise in that asset's price. At the point when speculative interest hits an extreme, however, it shows prices could head the alternate way.

## Sentiment Indicators versus Technical Indicators

While some sentiment indicators will likewise fall under the heading of a [technical indicator](/technicalindicator), or vice versa, sentiment indicators are meant to show how consumers or investors have positioned themselves â€” or what their current convictions are about the economy or market.

A technical indicator is a broad term used to portray formulas that control the price or volume data (and at times different types of data) of an asset to give an alternate point of view on what's going on a price/volume chart.

## Limitations of Using a Sentiment Indicator

Sentiment indicators are not [timing](/markettiming) signals. An extreme perusing on the Commitment of Traders report doesn't mean the price of the asset will quickly reverse. Extreme perusing can stay in place for quite a while, or the price might remain where it is while traders unwind their positions and the extreme perusing vanishes without a critical price reversal.

Sentiment indicators are best utilized related to different forms of technical and [fundamental analysis](/fundamentalanalysis) to assist with affirming market or economic defining moments. For instance, an extremely bullish sentiment perusing, combined with an extremely high [price/earnings ratio](/price-earningsratio) (or disintegrating fundamentals), as well as a breakdown in price, gives more convincing evidence of a looming downtrend than following up on sentiment alone.

## Highlights
