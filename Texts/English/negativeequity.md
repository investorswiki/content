# Negative Equity
## What Is Negative Equity?

Negative equity happens when the value of real estate property falls below the outstanding balance on the mortgage used to purchase that property. Negative [equity](/equity) is calculated just by taking the current market value of the property and deducting the amount staying on the mortgage.

## How Negative Equity Works

To comprehend negative equity, we must initially figure out "positive equity" or rather as it is commonly referred to, [home equity](/home_equity).

Home equity is the value of a homeowner's interest in their home. It is the real property's current [market value](/marketvalue) less any liens or encumbrances that are appended to that property. This value vacillates over the long haul as payments are made on the mortgage and market powers play on the current value of that property.

If some or a house is all purchased through a [mortgage](/mortgage), the lending institution has an interest in the home until the loan obligation has been met. Home equity is the portion of a home's current value that the owner has free and clear.

Home equity can be accumulated by one or the other a down payment made during the initial purchase of the property or with mortgage payments, as a contracted portion of that payment will be assigned to cut down the outstanding principal actually owed. Owners can benefit from property value appreciation as it will make their equity value increase.

At the point when the inverse occurs — when current market value of a home falls roars the amount the property owner owes on their mortgage — that owner is then classified as

having negative equity in the home. The sale of a home with negative equity turns into a debt to the seller, as they would be at risk to their lending institution for the difference between the connected mortgage and the sale of the home.

## Negative Equity's Economic Implications

Negative equity can happen when a homeowner purchases a house utilizing a

mortgage before either a collapse of a housing bubble, a recession, or a

gloom — anything that makes real estate values fall. For example, say a buyer financed the purchase a $400,000 home with a mortgage of $350,000. Assuming the market value of that home the next year tumbles to $275,000, the owner has negative equity in the home on the grounds that the mortgage connected to the property is $75,000 greater than whatever it would sell for in the current market.

> In real estate jargon, If the outstanding dollar amount staying on mortgage is bigger than whatever the house is worth, the property, the mortgage, and the homeowner are supposed to be [underwater](/underwater).

Underwater mortgages were a common problem among homeowners around the level of the financial crisis of 2007 - 2008 which, in addition to other things, involved a substantial deflation in housing prices. As the subsequent beginning of the Great Recession proved, the far and wide scourge of negative equity across the housing market can have extensive ramifications for the economy as a whole. Homeowners with negative equity found it more hard to actively seek after work in different areas or states due to the potential losses incurred from the sale of their homes.

## Special Considerations

Negative equity isn't to be mistaken for [mortgage equity withdrawal (MEW) ](/mortgage-equity-withdrawal-mew)is the removal of equity from the value of a home using a loan against the [market value](/marketvalue) of the property. A mortgage equity withdrawal reduces the real value of a property by the number of new liabilities against it — yet it doesn't mean the owner has gone into the red, equity-wise.
