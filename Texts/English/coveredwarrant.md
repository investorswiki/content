# Covered Warrant
## What Is Covered Warrant?

A covered warrant is a type of warrant where the issuer is a financial institution as opposed to an individual company and offers the right, yet not obligation, to buy or sell an asset at a predefined price prior to a predetermined date.

## Grasping Covered Warrants

A warrant is a type of investment security that gives the holder the right, however not obligation, to buy or sell an underlying asset at a predefined price prior to a predetermined date. Covered warrants can have single stocks, baskets of stocks (as in sectors or subjects), indexes, commodities, or currencies as their [underlying assets](/underlying-asset).

Covered warrants are listed on major international exchanges in London, Hong Kong, and Singapore. The warrant is "covered"' on the grounds that when the issuer (a financial institution) sells a warrant to an investor, it will typically [hedge](/hedge) (cover) its exposure by buying the underlying asset in the market. An ordinary warrant, then again, is issued by the company that likewise issued the underlying shares.

A covered warrant bears numerous likenesses to an option. It gives the investor the right to buy an underlying asset, similar to a [call option](/calloption) (call warrant), or sell, similar to a [put option](/putoption) (put warrant). Each warrant has a strike price and expiration date. Furthermore, both covered warrants and options are made out of intrinsic value and [time value](/extrinsicvalue).

A covered warrant can be either European style or American style, the former demonstrating that exercise of the right can happen on the expiration date, and the last option meaning that an investor can [exercise](/exercise) the right whenever between purchase date and expiration date.

Covered warrants contrast from options in that they must be purchased though options can be "composed".

Then again, composing a put is selling a put option, which will commit the seller to buy shares if the buyer of the put exercises the right to sell at a set [strike price](/strikeprice).

One more difference between a covered warrant and option is that the normal life of a covered warrant is six to nine months, though options can have [expiration terms](/expirationdate) going from multi week to two years.

The [FTSE 100 Index](/ftse) is a benchmark for 100 of the leading names with shares on the[ London Stock Exchange](/lse) (LSE). It has among the most well known covered warrants. An investor could buy call warrants when they anticipate stocks in the U.K. to advance or buy put warrants when worried that prices will fall.

## Covered Warrant Example

An illustration of a strategy utilizing covered warrants is called stock replacement or cash extraction. Say, for instance, that the FTSE 100 Index has advanced significantly throughout recent months and a [portfolio manager](/portfoliomanager) holding a basket of comparative stocks is worried about a market decline. In any case, they likewise need to partake assuming the market advances further.

In this scenario, a strategy may be to sell their shares and invest a portion of the cash into FTSE 100 call warrants. Holding the warrants permits the portfolio manager to book gains in the event that the market advances further, yet with less capital than holding the underlying shares of the FTSE 100. On the off chance that the market doesn't advance, nonetheless, the [premium paid for the warrants](/warrantpremium) will probably be lost.
