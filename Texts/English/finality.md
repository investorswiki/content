# Finality
Finality is the assurance or guarantee that cryptocurrency transactions can't be altered, turned around, or canceled after they are completed. The [latency](/latency) level of a [blockchain](/blockchain) will at last influence the chain's finality rate.
Thus, finality is utilized to measure the amount of time one needs to sit tight for a reasonable guarantee that crypto transactions executed on the blockchain won't be switched or changed. At the end of the day, they won't be lost.
Finality is an essential feature for adventures accepting [cryptocurrencies](/cryptocurrency) since waiting interminably on a blockchain network can have a high adverse effect for organizations or undertakings that acknowledge crypto for the purpose of payment. While making a payment system, to be effective, having low latency is vital.
To put this in context, if you somehow happened to need to sit tight for 10 minutes each time you wished to purchase anything, it would immediately turn out to be exceptionally awkward to go out to shop. Additionally, in the financial sector, companies need to be aware, inside the briefest conceivable time period on the off chance that they own certain assets.
Thus, with regards to blockchain technology, transactions are named immutable due to its finality nature. In any case, most blockchain conventions just show a probabilistic transaction finality â€” implying that transactions are not consequently or immediately last however become "increasingly last" over the long run (as additional blocks are confirmed).
Subsequently, the amount of time it takes a blockchain network to affirm a transaction (latency) decides the idea of the chain's finality rate. Below is a table that shows different blockchain networks and the average duration it takes for every one of them to arrive at finality.
