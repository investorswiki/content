# Macroprudential Analysis
## What Is Macroprudential Analysis?

Macroprudential analysis is a method of economic analysis that assesses the wellbeing, sufficiency, and weaknesses of a [financial system](/financial-system).

## Grasping Macroprudential Analysis

Macroprudential analysis takes a gander at the wellbeing of the underlying financial institutions in the system and performs stress tests and [scenario analysis](/scenario_analysis) to assist with deciding the system's sensitivity to economic shocks. Macroeconomic and market data are likewise assessed to decide the soundness of the current system. The analysis likewise centers around qualitative data connected with financial institutions' structures and the regulatory environment to get an extra feeling of the strength and weaknesses in the system.

While taking a gander at the wellbeing of the underlying financial institutions in the system, macroprudential analysis utilizes indicators that give data on the strength of these institutions as a whole including capital adequacy, asset quality, management performance, profitability, liquidity, and sensitivity to [systematic risks](/systematicrisk).

Macroeconomic data utilized incorporate [gross domestic product](/gdp) (GDP) growth, inflation, interest rates, balance of payments, exchange rates, asset prices, and the correlation of markets inside the system.

Scenario analysis and stress tests are major parts of this analysis. For instance, the analysis might take a gander at how the system would cope with a consistently declining currency value and its impact on GDP, interest rates, and underlying institution profitability.

At last, macroprudential analysis takes a gander at key parts of the financial markets, including winning credit ratings and the yields and market prices of financial instruments.

## Purpose of Macroprudential Analysis

Macroprudential analysis is intended to recognize, well in advance, the risks to an activity or structure of financial institutions or markets. These risks are called systemic risks. To say the least, the realization of such a risk could prompt [financial crises](/financial-emergency) and escalate the macroeconomic impact of such emergencies.

Risk might emerge from [credit cycles](/credit-cycle), worked in structural highlights, and weaknesses of the financial system, or from individual issues of explicit financial institutions. Effective identification of risks requires continuous development of the macroprudential tool stash.

Notwithstanding the identification of risks, a macroprudential analysis surveys the flexibility of domestic and international financial institutions and financial market infrastructures to serious disturbances. The interconnectedness of different financial system participants is likewise a major target of such evaluations, as the level of flexibility a financial system has against the risks sent through these linkages.

## Leading Macroprudential Analyses

Normally, financial institutions will participate on executing an extensive macroprudential analysis. The Bank of Finland, for instance, cooperates closely with the Finnish Financial Supervisory Authority and the country's Ministry of Finance in macroprudential risk examinations to lay out the interlinkages between the real economy and the financial markets. It has profound experience and broad skill in this type of research and cooperates closely with a number of other financial experts on their macroprudential examinations, including the European Systemic Risk Board (ESRB).
