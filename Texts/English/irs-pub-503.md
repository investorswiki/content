## What Is IRS Publication 503: Child and Dependent Care Expenses?

IRS Publication 503 is a document distributed consistently by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) spreading out the criteria that must be met for an American taxpayer to claim the Child and Dependent Care Credit. A child and dependent care expense could be anything paid to a daycare center or sitter, or day camp or other provider costs.

## Understanding IRS Publication 503

The [Internal Revenue Service (IRS)](/irs), the agency in charge of gathering federal taxes, presents Publication 503 on its website. The document spreads out the conditions under which a taxpayer can claim the nonrefundable [Child and Dependent Care Credit](/childanddependentcarecredit). Since the cost of really focusing on a child or dependent is frequently greater than a subsequent income, there can be an incentive for second earners to stop working and care for children or dependents.

The credit is intended to neutralize that incentive and permit a taxpayer or their spouse to be gainfully employed while giving care. The credit isn't simply accessible to couples, be that as it may, and can be claimed by single filers.

To claim the credit, certain criteria must be met: the persons claimed must be qualified, the taxpayer must have [earned income](/earnedincome), expenses must be incurred so the taxpayer could work or search for work, and care payments must be made to a non-dependent.

Up to 35% of expenses connected with the care of children and dependents can be claimed by a taxpayer. Also, expenses connected with the care of children apply just to children younger than 13.

### Child and Dependent Care Credit

To receive the credit, the IRS specifies that the taxpayer, the care provider, and the dependent(s) must all meet certain requirements for the taxpayer to fit the bill for the credit. The Child and Dependent Care Credit is limited to a scope of 20% to 35% of $3,000 for one qualifying child or dependent under age 13 or $6,000 for at least two qualifying persons, contingent upon the taxpayer's [adjusted gross income](/agi).

The Child and Dependent Care Credit is pointed toward giving tax breaks to many parents who claim responsibility for the cost of childcare, including daycare center fees, sitters, non-short-term day camps, and other care providers, who either care for qualifying children younger than 13 or, or tend to disabled dependents of any age.

The cost of a cook, servant, house keeper, or cleaning person, who gives ancillary care to a child or dependent, is likewise viewed as a childcare expense. What's more, albeit the credit is geared toward working parents and additionally gatekeepers, taxpayers who were either full-time understudies or were unemployed for part of the year may likewise fit the bill for the credit.
