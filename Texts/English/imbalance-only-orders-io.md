# Imbalance Only (IO) Orders
## What Are Imbalance Only (IO) Orders?

Imbalance just (IO) orders are limit orders that give liquidity during the [opening](/opening-cross) and closing rotation on the Nasdaq stock exchange. These can be arranged as "imbalance just open orders" or "imbalance just closing orders".

IO orders are in this manner placed to offset a [order imbalance](/order-imbalance) in the opening or closing cross.

## Understanding Imbalance Only (IO) Orders

Imbalance just (IO) orders will execute just on the opening cross or closing cross contingent upon which order type is placed (opening or closing). IO orders can be to buy or sell. IO buy orders just execute at or over the 9:30 a.m. or then again 4 p.m. [bid](/bid) price, while IO sell orders just execute at or below the offer or [ask price](/ask).

Before opening and closing crosses are executed, buy or sell IO orders are re-priced to the best bid and ask price, separately, on the Nasdaq book. IO orders must fundamentally be limit orders; [market](/marketorder) IO orders are not permitted.

The orders offset [on-close](/limitoncloseorder) and on-open orders. Since IO orders are just executable during the opening cross or closing cross, they are not at risk of being executed prior to the market open or close. Along these lines, they are unique in relation to commonplace [limit orders](/limitorder).

## Imbalance Only Orders Timing and Considerations

Imbalance reports are distributed at certain points in the trading day. These reports give refreshes on-open or on-close buy and sell orders that have previously been put in place. A buy imbalance demonstrates an excess of buy orders linked to a certain price as compared to the important sell orders. In this scenario, the stock price might rise until the buy and sell orders balance out.

IO (and other) orders are accepted on the Nasdaq starting from 4 a.m. Imbalance information is first delivered for the day at 9:28 a.m., shortly before the opening cross at 9:30.

Market participants can't refresh or cancel IO orders for the opening cross after 9:28 a.m., or update or cancel IO orders for the closing cross after 3:58 p.m. Be that as it may, in the two cases, new IO orders can in any case be placed after those cutoff times.

For the closing cross, the Nasdaq spreads imbalance information somewhere in the range of 3:55 and 4:00 p.m. Closing orders can be placed whenever during the day.

> Note that IO orders can sell short. Short sale IO orders and sell IO orders priced at or below the best bid price are re-priced to the best offer price at 4 p.m. During the closing cross, short sale IO orders are executed on a downtick provided that the closing price is better than the best bid; these orders won't partake in the event that the closing price is at or below the best bid.

## Instance of Using an Imbalance Order on the Closing (or Opening) Auction

Expect an informal investor or somebody who as of now possesses Apple Inc. is keen on selling on the closing cross.

At 3:55 p.m. the imbalance information will be spread for Nasdaq stocks, including AAPL. The imbalance information might influence how the stock trades throughout the course of recent minutes of trading, since the price might move to offset the imbalance. For instance, in the event that there is a large buy imbalance, traders might purchase the stock anticipating that the price should climb into the close as a result of the buy imbalance.

Expect there is a buy imbalance of 2,000,000 shares. The price will probably climb to draw in an adequate number of sellers to sell 2,000,000 shares and offset the imbalance. Albeit, this isn't generally the case. The imbalance could flip, and become a sell imbalance as additional orders come in for the cross. Other market powers may likewise drive the stock somewhere new than expected, or the stock may not move much by any stretch of the imagination.

The trader chooses to enter an imbalance in particular (IO) sell order for 100 shares with a limit price of $220. The stock is at present trading at $220 with around brief left (3:59 p.m.) until the market closes.

The IO order is a limit order, so it will not [fill](/fill) except if the stock price is over the limit at the hour of execution. Assuming the price is below $220, the sell order will not execute. On the off chance that the closing cross price is above $220, the order will execute at the cross-price.
