# On-the-Run Treasuries
## What Are On-the-Run Treasuries?

On-the-run Treasuries are the most recently issued U.S. [Treasury bonds](/treasurybond) or notes of a particular maturity. On-the-run Treasuries are something contrary to "off-the-run" Treasuries, which allude to Treasury securities that have been issued before the latest issue and are as yet outstanding. Media mentions about [Treasury yields](/treasury-yield) and prices generally reference on-the-run Treasuries.

## How On-the-Run Treasuries Work

The on-the-run bond or note is the most often traded Treasury security of its maturity. Since on-the-run issues are the most liquid, they regularly trade at a slight premium and consequently yield somewhat less than their off-the-run counterparts. A few traders effectively exploit this price differential through a [arbitrage](/arbitrage) strategy that includes selling, or going short, on-the-run Treasuries, and buying [off-the-run Treasuries](/off-the-runtreasuries).

Treasuries are considered to be a lower risk than some other investment options, as they are obligations owed by the Federal Government. The Treasury issues them to raise revenue for government expenses. As Treasuries are made and sold, the most current batch turns into the on-the-run Treasuries.

## On-the-Run versus Off-the-Run Treasuries

A Treasury transitions from on-the-run to off-the-run once a fresher set of Treasuries is delivered available to be purchased. For instance, if one-year Treasury notes are issued today, those future the current on-the-run Treasuries.

In the event that another set of Treasury notes get issued in the next month, those become the new on-the-run Treasuries, and the recently issued Treasuries are considered off-the-run. This cycle continues as each new batch is made, with each group other than the most current run considered off-the-run until the end of its associated time, until it is traded out upon arriving at maturity.

The most actively traded Treasuries anytime are those that are considered on-the-run. Due to the increased activity, they will quite often have a higher initial cost and lower yield than off-the-run notes. This makes on-the-run Treasuries be more liquid, as finding a buyer will in general be less complex than off-the-run options. This prompts a greater number of investments connecting with hedging than to longer-term investments.

Long-term investors don't have to purchase on-the-run Treasuries at a higher price since the included return or interest rates will quite often be comparable. The price difference between on-the-run and off-the-run Treasuries is frequently alluded to as the liquidity premium, as the more liquid Treasuries are gotten at a higher cost. In the event that liquidity isn't a concern, the investor will probably search for additional cost-powerful options.

## Benefits and Disadvantages of On-the Run Treasuries

On-the-run Treasuries are more scant than off-the-run Treasuries. There are a lot of off-the-run treasuries, yet, there are a limited amount of on-the-run securities â€” that is, new issues are a small part of the Treasury universe. In this way, on-the-run securities will more often than not have higher prices and lower yields.

On-the-run securities will quite often be profoundly liquid, as they trade intensely on the secondary market. In the mean time, the liquidity for off-the-run Treasuries is less, where they've previously been bought and are held by investors. In this manner, on-the-run Treasuries trade with that liquidity premium, however on the off chance that investors don't require the freshest issue, they will probably track down a better deal with off-the-run Treasuries.
