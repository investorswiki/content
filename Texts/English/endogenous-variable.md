# Endogenous Variable
## What Is an Endogenous Variable?

An endogenous variable is a variable in a statistical model that is still up in the air by its relationship with different variables inside the model. All in all, an endogenous variable is inseparable from a dependent variable, meaning it [correlates](/correlation) with different factors inside the system being examined. Subsequently, its values not set in stone by different variables.

Endogenous variables are something contrary to exogenous variables, which are independent variables or outside powers. Exogenous variables can affect endogenous factors, in any case.

## Figuring out Endogenous Variables

Endogenous variables are important in [econometrics](/econometrics) and economic modeling since they show whether a variable causes a particular effect. Financial experts utilize causal modeling to make sense of results by investigating dependent variables in view of various factors. For instance, in a model research [supply and demand](/law-of-supply-demand), the price of a decent is an endogenous factor on the grounds that the price can be changed by the producer (provider) in response to consumer demand.

Financial experts likewise incorporate independent variables to help decide to which degree an outcome can be credited to an exogenous or endogenous reason. Endogenous variables have values that shift as part of a functional relationship between different variables inside the model. The relationship is additionally alluded to as dependent and is viewed as unsurprising in nature.

The variables normally relate so that a movement in one variable ought to bring about a move in the other variable. As such, the variables ought to connect with one another. Nonetheless, they don't be guaranteed to have to move in a similar direction, meaning a rise in one factor could cause a fall in another. However long the change in the variables is [correlating](/correlation), it's thought of as endogenous — whether or not it's a positive or negative correlation.

Outside of [economics](/economics), different fields use models with endogenous variables including meteorology and agriculture. Sometimes, the relationship in these models is just endogenous in one direction. For instance, while lovely weather conditions might lead to a higher rate of the travel industry, higher the travel industry rates don't influence the climate.

## Endogenous versus Exogenous Variables

Rather than endogenous variables, exogenous variables are viewed as independent. As such, one variable inside the formula doesn't direct or directly relate to a change in another. Exogenous variables have no direct or formulaic relationship. For instance, personal income and variety preference, rainfall and gas prices, education got and most loved flower would be in every way thought to be exogenous factors.

## Instances of Endogenous Variables

For instance, expect a model is looking at the relationship between employee drive times and fuel consumption. As the drive time rises inside the model, fuel consumption additionally increments. The relationship checks out since the longer an individual's drive, the more fuel it takes to arrive at the objective. For instance, a 30-mile drive requires more fuel than a 20-mile drive. Different relationships that might be endogenous include:

- Personal income to personal consumption, since a higher income regularly leads to expansions in consumer spending.
- Rainfall to plant growth is corresponded and concentrated by market analysts since the amount of rainfall is important to commodity yields like corn and wheat.
- Education got to future income levels since there's a correlation among education and higher salaries or wages.

## Features
- Endogenous variables are variables in a statistical model that are not entirely set in stone by their relationship with different variables.
- Endogenous variables are dependent variables, meaning they relate with different factors — despite the fact that it very well may be a positive or negative correlation.
- Endogenous variables are important in economic modeling since they show whether a variable causes a particular effect.
