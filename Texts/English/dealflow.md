# Deal Flow
## What Is Deal Flow

Deal flow is a term utilized by investment bankers and [venture capitalists](/venturecapitalist) to portray the rate at which business recommendations and investment pitches are being received.

As opposed to an inflexible quantitative measure, the rate of deal flow is to some degree qualitative and is intended to demonstrate whether business is positive or negative. The state of the economy impacts the level of deal flow. Economic expansion and robust equity markets will normally generate solid deal flow for most lenders, while a recession and sluggish equity markets might generate some deal flow for just the most settled players.

## Understanding Deal Flow

Deal flow can be made out of a wide range of types of recommendations: venture funding, private situations, syndication, initial public offerings (IPO), mergers, and acquisitions. While large investment banks can handle the vast majority of these activities, specialist agents, for example, venture entrepreneurs and angel investors will generally zero in on deal flow just in their area of mastery.

While deal flow can be generated from several sources, the proposition that are probably going to earn the most consideration are the ones from companies or [entrepreneurs](/business person) where a previous investment has been fruitful, or where there is a strong existing relationship. Then again, unsolicited recommendations from untried elements are probably going to be given short confession by most settled lenders.
