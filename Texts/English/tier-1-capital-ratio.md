# Tier 1 Capital Ratio
## What Is the Tier 1 Capital Ratio?

The tier 1 capital ratio is the ratio of a bank's core [tier 1 capital](/tier1capital) — that is, its equity capital and unveiled reserves — to its total risk-weighted assets. It is a key measure of a bank's financial strength that has been adopted as part of the [Basel III Accord](/basel_accord) on bank regulation.

The tier 1 capital ratio measures a bank's core equity capital against its total risk-weighted assets — which incorporate every one of the assets the bank holds that are efficiently weighted for credit risk. For instance, a bank's cash close by and government securities would receive a weighting of 0%, while its mortgage loans would be assigned a half weighting.

Tier 1 capital is core capital and is included a bank's common stock, retained earnings, [accumulated other far reaching income](/accumulatedother) (AOCI), noncumulative perpetual preferred stock and any regulatory acclimations to those accounts.

## What Does the Tier 1 Capital Ratio Tell You?

The tier 1 capital ratio is the basis for the Basel III international capital and liquidity standards concocted after the financial crisis, in 2010. The crisis showed that many banks had too minimal capital to ingest losses or stay liquid, and were funded with too much debt and insufficient equity.

To force banks to increase [capital buffers](/capital-support), and guarantee they can endure financial distress before they become wiped out, Basel III rules would fix both tier 1 capital and [risk-weighted assets](/riskweightedassets) (RWAs). The equity part of tier-1 capital must have somewhere around 4.5% of RWAs. The tier 1 capital ratio must be somewhere around 6%.

Basel III likewise presented a base leverage ratio — with tier 1 capital, it must be no less than 3% of the total assets — and something else for global systemically important banks that are too big to fail. The Basel III rules still can't seem to be concluded due to a stalemate between the U.S. furthermore, Europe.

A firm's risk-weighted assets incorporate all assets that the firm holds that are methodicallly weighted for credit risk. Central banks normally foster the weighting scale for various resource classes; cash and government securities carry zero risk, while a [mortgage loan](/first_mortgage) or vehicle loan would carry more risk. The risk-weighted assets would be assigned a rising weight according to their credit risk. Cash would have a weight of 0%, while loans of expanding credit risk would carry weights of 20%, half or 100%.

The tier 1 capital ratio varies marginally from the [tier 1 common capital ratio](/tier-1-common-capital-ratio). Tier 1 capital incorporates the sum of a bank's equity capital, its revealed reserves, and non-redeemable, non-total [preferred stock](/preferredstock). Tier 1 common capital, notwithstanding, bars a wide range of preferred stock as well as non-controlling interests. Tier 1 common capital incorporates the firm's common stock, retained earnings and other exhaustive income.

## Illustration of the Tier 1 Capital Ratio

For instance, assume that bank ABC has [shareholders' equity](/shareholdersequity) of $3 million and retained earnings of $2 million, so its tier 1 capital is $5 million. Bank ABC has risk-weighted assets of $50 million. Thusly, its tier 1 capital ratio is 10% ($5 million/$50 million), and it is viewed as very much capitalized compared to the base requirement.

Then again, bank DEF has retained earnings of $600,000 and stockholders' equity of $400,000. In this way, its tier 1 capital is $1 million. Bank DEF has risk-weighted assets of $25 million. In this way, bank DEF's tier 1 capital ratio is 4% ($1 million/$25 million), which is undercapitalized on the grounds that it is below the base tier 1 capital ratio under Basel III.

Bank GHI has tier 1 capital of $5 million and risk-weighted assets of $83.33 million. Thusly, bank GHI's tier 1 capital ratio is 6% ($5 million/$83.33 million), which is viewed as sufficiently capitalized on the grounds that it is equivalent to the base tier 1 capital ratio.

## The Difference Between the Tier 1 Capital Ratio and the Tier 1 Leverage Ratio

The [tier 1 leverage ratio](/tier-1-leverage-ratio) is the relationship between a banking association's core capital and its total assets. The tier 1 leverage ratio is calculated by separating tier 1 capital by a bank's average total consolidated assets and sure cockeyed sheet openings. Correspondingly to the tier 1 capital ratio, the tier 1 leverage ratio is utilized as a tool by central monetary specialists to guarantee the capital adequacy of banks and to place limitations on the degree to which a financial company can leverage its capital base however doesn't utilize risk-weighted assets in the denominator.

## Features
- It is a key measure of a bank's financial strength that has been adopted as part of the Basel III Accord on bank regulation.
- To force banks to increase capital cushions and guarantee they can endure financial distress before they become indebted, Basel III rules would fix both tier-1 capital and risk-weighted assets (RWAs).
- The tier 1 capital ratio is the ratio of a bank's core tier 1 capital — that is, its equity capital and unveiled reserves — to its total risk-weighted assets.
