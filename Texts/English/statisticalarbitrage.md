# Statistical Arbitrage
## What Is Statistical Arbitrage?

In the world of finance, statistical arbitrage (or detail arb) alludes to a group of trading strategies that use mean reversion examinations to invest in different portfolios of up to huge number of securities for an extremely short period of time, frequently a couple of moments yet up to numerous days.

Known as a profoundly quantitative, logical approach to trading, detail arb means to reduce exposure to beta however much as could be expected across two phases: "scoring" gives a positioning to each accessible stock as indicated by investment desirability, and "risk decrease" joins helpful stocks into an explicitly planned portfolio intending to bring down risk. Investors ordinarily distinguish [arbitrage](/arbitrage) situations through mathematical modeling procedures.

## Figuring out Statistical Arbitrage

Statistical arbitrage strategies are market neutral since they include opening both a long position and [short position](/short) at the same time to exploit inefficient pricing in connected securities. For instance, in the event that a fund manager accepts Coca-Cola is undervalued and Pepsi is overvalued, they would open a long position in Coca-Cola, and simultaneously, open a short position in Pepsi. Investors frequently allude to statistical arbitrage as "[pairs trading](/pairstrade)."

Likewise, just in light of the fact that two stocks operate in various industries doesn't mean they can't be corresponded. For instance, Citigroup, a banking stock, and Harley Davidson, a consumer cyclical stock, frequently have periods of high correlation.

## Risks of Statistical Arbitrage

Statistical arbitrage isn't without risk. It relies intensely upon the ability of market prices to return to a historical or anticipated normal, regularly alluded to as [mean reversion](/meanreversion). Nonetheless, two stocks that operate in a similar industry can stay uncorrelated for a lot of time due to both micro and macro factors.

Therefore, most statistical arbitrage strategies exploit [high-frequency trading](/high-frequency-trading) (HFT) calculations to take advantage of little failures that frequently last for a question of milliseconds. Large positions in the two stocks are expected to produce adequate profits from such microscopic price developments. This adds extra risk to statistical arbitrage strategies, despite the fact that options can be utilized to assist with moderating a portion of the risk.

Investors can find two securities that are customarily [correlated](/correlation), like General Motors (GM) and Ford Motor Company (F), and afterward compare the two stocks by overlaying them on a price chart.

The chart below compares these two automakers. Investors can enter a trade when the two stocks get substantially in conflict with one another, like in mid-February and toward the beginning of May. For example, traders would consider buying Ford in February and selling it in May in anticipation of its share price realigning with General Motor's share price. In any case, there is no guarantee of when the two prices will re-join; accordingly, investors ought to continuously consider utilizing [stop-loss orders](/stop-lossorder) while utilizing this strategy.
