# Reverse Convertible Bond (RCB)
## What Is a Reverse Convertible Bond (RCB)?

A reverse convertible bond (RCB) is a bond that can be changed over completely to cash, debt, or equity at the prudence of the issuer at a set date. The issuer has an option on the maturity date to either recover the bonds in cash or to deliver a predetermined number of shares.

## Understanding Reverse Convertible Bonds (RCBs)

A [convertible bond](/convertiblebond) has a [embedded call option](/embeddedoption) that gives bondholders the right to change over their bonds into equity at a given time for a preset number of shares in the issuing company. The yield on a convertible bond is typically lower than the yield on a comparable bond without the convertible option in light of the fact that the embedded option gives the bondholder extra upside. One more type of bond with an embedded convertible option is the reverse convertible bond.

The reverse convertible bond (RCB) has an embedded [put option](/putoption) that gives the borrower or bond issuer the right to change over the bond's principal into shares of equity at a set date. The option, whenever exercised, permits the issuer to "put" the bond to bondholders at a set date for existing debt or shares of an underlying company. The underlying company need not be connected at all to the issuer's business. As a matter of fact, there might be more than one underlying stock tied to a reverse convertible bond.

> Investing in a reverse convertible bond is more similar to selling a [naked put](/nakedput) on the underlying assets than buying an ordinary bond.

## Maturity and Yield Considerations

RCB securities normally have more limited terms to maturity and higher yields than most different bonds in light of the risks involved for investors. Investors might be forced to reclaim their bonds for securities in a company that has diminished substantially in value. The above-market [coupon](/coupon) is paid either month to month or quarterly. Notwithstanding interest payments, the investor receives either 100% of the initial investment [principal](/principal) in cash or a prespecified number of shares of the underlying stock at maturity.

RCB investors don't get to take part in any upside appreciation of the underlying assets. Instead, the bondholders successfully give the issuer a put option on the underlying assets. Investors acknowledge this risk in exchange for higher coupon payments during the life of the bond. Assume that the price of the underlying asset linked to the bond diminishes below a predetermined amount, which is likewise called the [knock-in level](/knock-inoption). Then, it's a good idea for the bond issuer to exercise its right to repay the principal with shares instead of cash. Since a RCB leaves the conversion at the carefulness of the issuer, the value of the shares will be not exactly the amount initially invested.

Assuming the underlying asset price stays over the knock-in level, the bondholders receive the high coupon payment for the life of the bond. At the point when the bond develops, they receive their full principal back in cash. That is typically the most ideal situation for reverse convertible bond investors.

## Benefits of Reverse Convertible Bonds (RCBs)

The main advantage of RCBs is their high coupon rates. Reverse convertible bonds have high yields of between 7% to 30%, according to FINRA. That brings up the issue of why companies would need to pay such high rates. Frequently, they anticipate that the underlying assets should decline in price. Simultaneously, different investors are willing to buy the underlying assets and hold them. Stockholders typically receive definitely less compensation from dividends than RCB investors get in interest. Buying a reverse convertible bond can be a productive alternative to purchasing the company's stock.

## Analysis of Reverse Convertible Bonds (RCBs)

Reverse convertible bonds experience the ill effects of imperfections like the problems with [callable bonds](/callablebond) yet with far higher downside risk. Similarly as with callable bonds, RCBs have confounded highlights that safeguard sophisticated bond issuers to the detriment of less-informed investors.

It is simple for investors to overlook the escape provisions and be drawn in by bonds promising high interest rates. In the case of callable bonds, the issuer can help out of paying high rates through [refinancing](/refinance) in the event that business and credit ratings move along. With reverse convertible bonds, an issuer can escape from repaying the full principal by exercising the equity conversion option. With RCBs, business and stock prices must decline for the issuer to benefit to the detriment of bondholders.

The most horrendously terrible problem with reverse convertible bonds is that investors at times think they are buying an asset like a standard bond. What RCB buyers are truly doing is selling a naked put on the underlying assets. When in doubt, investors shouldn't buy reverse convertible bonds except if they would be happy with owning the underlying assets.
