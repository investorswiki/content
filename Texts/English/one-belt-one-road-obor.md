## Special Considerations: OBOR's Importance to China

OBOR is of prime significance to China as it plans to support its domestic growth and is likewise a part of the country's strategy for economic tact. By associating the less-created border regions like Xinjiang with adjoining nations, China hopes to bump up economic activity. OBOR is expected to open up and make new markets for Chinese products. It would likewise empower the manufacturing powerhouse to gain control of cost-viable routes to effectively export materials.

Any excess capacity in terms of production can be channelized actually to regions along OBOR routes. China has announced investments of more than $1 trillion in the different infrastructure projects and is funding them by offering low-cost loans to the participating countries.

Many participating countries, similar to Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan, support the OBOR due to huge investments by China in neighborhood transmission projects in these nations. Landlocked Nepal has as of late joined OBOR by signing a deal that will assist it further develop cross-border network with China, and Pakistan is set to benefit from the $46 billion China Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) that will interface southwestern China to and through Pakistan, allowing access to Arabian Sea routes.

While China keeps on pitching OBOR as an all-inclusive project for regional development, different nations see it as a strategic move by the Asian powerhouse to achieve significance and control at a regional level and to play a bigger job at the global level by building and controlling a China-centered trading network.

China considers this venture to be an opportunity to arise as a regional leader. Later on, we might see a lift in the [Chinese yuan](/cny-china-yuan-renminbi), with increased utilization in the OBOR region.
