# Transaction Date
## What Is a Transaction Date?

A transaction date is a date whereupon a trade takes place for a [security](/security) or other financial instrument. The transaction date represents the time at which ownership officially transfers. In banking, the date a transaction shows up in the account is likewise alluded to as the transaction date, although it isn't really the date on which the bank clears the transaction and deposits or withdraws funds.

## Understanding a Transaction Date

In the financial world, there are a wide range of dates to know about as they play a different job in the ownership cycle. The date at which a trade happens is constantly known as the transaction date. It is the date at which ownership changes hands. Nonetheless, the transaction date isn't really the date at which the seller gets payment. That date is known as the [settlement date](/settlementdate) and typically happens a couple of days after the transaction date.

The transaction date is a date that is prevalent in regular models. Such models that incorporate a transaction date in the banking world include:

- Deposits or withdrawals from a personal account (through automated teller machine or [ATM](/atm))
- The withdrawal of funds by means of a paper check
- Recording a purchase on a credit card or debit card
- Recording a [point-of-sale](/point-of-sale) (POS)
- Depositing, withdrawing, or transferring funds among accounts in [online banking](/onlinebanking)

The investing world likewise incorporates transaction dates on a variety of financial products and procedures. Instances of transactions, which incorporate a transaction date in [investing](/investing), include:

- Buying (purchasing shares of a security)
- Buy-to-open (like a traditional buy and can incorporate [options](/option) contracts, along with opening a more normal long position)
- Buy-to-close (the act of closing a [short position](/short) by means of a withdrawal of cash to buy back security shares or potentially options contracts)
- Getting cash [dividend](/dividend) payments or potentially reinvesting the distributions
- Depositing cash received as a return in a capital [distribution](/distribution)
- Depositing cash received as a capital gain (often from the sale of long-term or short-term shares of a security by means of a [hedge fund](/hedgefund), partnership, or in a mutual fund account)
- Depositing interest income from preferred shares or a debt instrument, like a bond
- Moving shares among accounts
- Gifting stocks
- Selling shares
- Offer to-close (exiting from a long position)
- Recording a [stock split](/stocksplit)

## Transaction Date versus Settlement Date

As financial transactions have multiple steps, they have multiple dates that mark the interaction. [Clearing](/clearing) is the full course of a transaction, from the moment parties commit to a transaction through [settlement](/settlement_period). The transaction date isn't really a similar date as the settlement date, which can happen several days after the transaction happens. The seller is paid upon settlement, since the details about the transaction have been all finished, and on the grounds that the buyer is certain that what has been guaranteed has actually been delivered.

Normal way transactions settle on the second business day after the trade date, which is alluded to as T+2. Most securities, including stocks and corporate bonds, settle this way. In any case, U.S. government securities have an ordinary way settlement of T+1. With certain transactions, it is possible to determine a craving to settle around the same time as the trade. These are alluded to as cash trades.

## Highlights
- The transaction date is the date whereupon any financial dealing happens.
- The date when the change in ownership happens in any financial dealing happens on the transaction date.
- The transaction date is different from the settlement date, which is the date on which the seller gets payment after the transaction has happened.
- Contingent upon the type of asset, normal way transactions have a settlement date of either a couple of days after the transaction date.
