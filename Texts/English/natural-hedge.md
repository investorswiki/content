# Natural Hedge
## What Is a Natural Hedge?

A natural [hedge](/hedge) is a management strategy that tries to relieve risk by investing in assets whose performances are intrinsically negatively [correlated](/correlation). For example, a natural hedge against possessing financial stocks is to hold bonds, since interest rate changes will more often than not influence each in inverse fashion,

A natural hedge can likewise be executed when institutions exploit their normal operating procedures. For instance, assuming they bring about [expenses](/cost) in the very currency that their [revenues](/revenue) are generated they will really reduce their [exchange rate](/exchangerate) risk exposure, naturally.

## Figuring out Natural Hedges

A natural hedge involves utilizing asset classes, that have generally displayed differentiating performance in a given economic climate, to reduce a portfolio's or alternately company's overall risk. The key concept is that by apportioning resources to two unique asset classes, the risk exuding from one asset ought to be offset by the return from the other and vice versa.

Basically, the cash flow from one ought to cancel out the cash flow from the other, consequently satisfying the concept of a hedge.

A company with critical sales in a single country is presented to currency risk when they need to localize that revenue. They can reduce this risk in the event that they can shift operations to where they can cause expenses likewise in that foreign currency, which would qualify as a natural hedge.

A generally utilized model is that of an oil producer with refining operations in the US that is (unquestionably somewhat) naturally hedged against the cost of crude oil, which is designated in U.S. dollars. While a company can modify its operational behavior to exploit a natural hedge, such hedges are less flexible than financial hedges.

## Special Considerations

Not at all like other conventional hedging methods, a natural hedge doesn't need the utilization of sophisticated financial products, for example, [forwards](/forwardcontract) or [derivatives](/subsidiary). All things considered, companies can in any case utilize financial instruments, for example, [futures](/futures), to supplement their natural hedges.

For instance, a [commodity](/commodity) company could shift as a lot of their operations to the country where they intend to sell their product, which is a natural hedge against [currency risk](/currencyrisk), then use futures contracts to lock in the price to sell (revenue) that product sometime in the not too distant future.

Most hedges (natural etc.) are imperfect, and as a rule don't kill risk totally, in any case, they are as yet sent and are viewed as fruitful in the event that they can reduce an immense portion of likely risk.

## Different Examples of Natural Hedges

Natural hedges likewise happen when a business' structure shields it from exchange rate developments. For instance, when providers, production, and customers are operating in similar currency, large companies might hope to source [raw materials](/rawmaterials), parts, and other production inputs in the last purchaser's country. The business can then set costs and prices in a similar currency.

For [mutual fund](/mutualfund) managers, [treasury bonds](/treasurybond) and [treasury notes](/treasurynote) can be a natural hedge against stock price developments. This is on the grounds that bonds will generally perform well when stocks are performing inadequately and vice versa.

Bonds are viewed as "[risk-off](/risk-on-risk-off)" or safety assets while stocks are viewed as 'risk-on' or aggressive assets. This is a relationship that has been generally substantial more often than not, however not consistently. In the years after the 2008 financial crisis, this negative correlation among bonds and stocks decoupled as both moved in tandem (e.g., strong [bull markets](/bullmarket)), so this natural hedge could never have been fruitful.

[Pairs trading](/pairstrade) is one more type of natural hedge. This includes buying long and [short positions](/short) in profoundly [correlated](/correlation) stocks in light of the fact that the performance of one will offset the performance of the other.
