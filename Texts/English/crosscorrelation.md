# Cross-Correlation
## What Is Cross-Correlation?

Cross-correlation is a measurement that tracks the movements of at least two arrangements of [time series](/timeseries) data relative to each other. It is utilized to compare various time series and impartially decide how well they match up with one another and, specifically, when the best match happens.

Cross-correlation may likewise uncover any periodicities in the data.

## Grasping Cross-Correlation

Cross-correlation is generally utilized while measuring data between two different time series. The conceivable reach for the [correlation coefficient](/correlationcoefficient) of the time series data is from - 1.0 to +1.0. The nearer the cross-correlation value is to 1, the more closely the sets are indistinguishable.

Investors and analysts utilize cross-correlation to figure out how the prices of at least two stocks — or different assets — perform against each other. This is especially important for correlation trades, for example, [dispersion](/dispersion) strategies and [pairs trading](/pairstrade).

Most importantly, cross-correlation is utilized in [portfolio management ](/portfoliomanagement)to measure the degree of diversification among the assets contained in a portfolio. Investors increase the [diversification](/diversification) of their assets to reduce the risk of big losses. That is, the prices of two technology stocks could move in a similar course more often than not, while a technology stock and an oil stock could move in inverse headings. Cross-correlation assists the investor with pinning down their examples of movement all the more unequivocally.

## Formula for Cross-Correlation

In its easiest form, it tends to be portrayed in terms of an independent variable, X, and two dependent variables, Y and Z. On the off chance that independent variable X impacts variable Y and the two are [positively correlated](/positive-correlation), then as the value of X ascents so will the value of Y.

In the event that the equivalent is true of the relationship among X and Z, as the value of X ascents, so will the value of Z. Variables Y and Z can be supposed to be cross-connected in light of the fact that their behavior is emphatically corresponded because of every one of their individual relationships to variable X.

## How Cross-Correlation Is Used
### Stock Markets

Cross-correlation can be utilized to gain viewpoint on the overall idea of the bigger [market](/market). For instance, back in 2011, different sectors inside the [S&P 500](/sp500) displayed a 95% degree of correlation.

That means that all of the [sectors](/area) moved basically in lockstep with one another. Picking stocks that outflanked the more extensive market during that period was troublesome. It was likewise difficult to choose stocks in various sectors to increase the diversification of a portfolio. Investors needed to take a gander at different types of [assets](/resource) for assist with dealing with their portfolio risk.

Then again, the high market correlation implied that investors could buy shares in [index funds](/indexfund) to gain exposure to the market, as opposed to attempting to pick individual stocks.

### Portfolio Management

Cross-correlation is utilized in portfolio management to measure the degree of diversification among the assets contained in a portfolio. [Modern portfolio theory](/modernportfoliotheory) (MPT) utilizes a measure of the correlation of the relative multitude of assets in a portfolio to assist with deciding the most efficient frontier. This concept assists with upgrading expected [returns](/return) against a certain level of risk.

Counting assets that have a low correlation to one another assists with decreasing the overall [risk](/risk) in a portfolio. All things considered, cross-correlation can change after some time. It can likewise just be measured historically. Two assets that have had a high degree of correlation in the past can become uncorrelated and start to separately move. This is, as a matter of fact, one weakness of MPT. It accepts stable correlations among assets.

## Highlights
- Cross-correlation is utilized to follow the likenesses in the movement of two factors over the long run.
- Portfolio diversification requires choosing stocks and different assets that move in inverse headings to hedge losses.
- Stock investors use it to decide the degree to which two stocks move in tandem.
