# Pension Risk Transfer
## What Is a Pension Risk Transfer?

A pension risk transfer happens when a [defined benefit pension](/definedbenefitpensionplan) provider offloads some or the plan's all's risk (e.g., retirement income liabilities to former employee beneficiaries). The plan sponsor can do this by offering vested plan participants a lump-sum payment to intentionally leave the plan early (buying out employees' pensions) or by haggling with an insurance company to get a sense of ownership with paying those guaranteed benefits.

## How Pension Risk Transfer Works

Companies transfer pension risk to stay away from earnings volatility and empower themselves to concentrate on their core organizations. The total annual cost of a [pension](/pensionplan) plan can be difficult to foresee due to factors in investment returns, interest rates, and the longevity of participants.

Large companies had been holdouts on the pattern of transferring pension planning responsibility to employees, yet that started to change in 2012 when a scope of Fortune 500 players tried to transfer pension risk. They included Ford Motor Co., Sears, Roebuck and Co., J.C. Penney Co. Inc., and PepsiCo Inc. (which offered former employees a discretionary lump-sum payment), as well as General Motors Co. what's more, Verizon Communications Inc., which purchased annuities for retired folks.

Types of risks tended to in risk transfer exchanges incorporate the accompanying:

- The risk that participants will live longer than current annuity mortality tables would show (longevity risk)
- The risk that funds set to the side for paying retirement benefits will fail to accomplish expected rates of investment return (investment risk)
- The risk that changes in the interest rate environment will cause critical and capricious variances in balance sheet obligations, net periodic cost, and required contributions (interest rate risk)
- The risks of a plan sponsor's pension liabilities becoming lopsidedly large relative to the excess assets and liabilities of the sponsor

Companies have generally adopted pension plans for various reasons, like fascination and retention of qualified employees, labor force management, paternalism, employee expectations, and great tax policies.

Considering the voluntary idea of sponsorship, plan sponsors generally trust that the ability to close a plan to new participants, reduce or freeze benefits, or completely end a plan (subsequent to accommodating every single accrued benefit) has been and stays important to encourage adoption and continuation of plans.

## Types of Pension Risk Transfers

There are several different ways that a pension provider can approach transferring the risk it has incurred through its obligations to pay guaranteed retirement income to employees:

- The purchase of annuities from an insurance company that transfers liabilities for some or all plan participants (eliminating the risks refered to above concerning that liability from the plan sponsor)
- The payment of [lump sums](/lump-sum-payment) (buyouts) to pension plan participants that fulfill the liability of the plan for those participants
- The restructuring of plan investments to reduce risk to the plan sponsor

## Features
- All pension risk transfer is the point at which a defined-benefit (DB) pension provider looks to eliminate some or its obligations to pay out guaranteed retirement income to plan participants.
- Defined pension obligations address a gigantic liability to companies that have guaranteed retirement income to its current and past employees.
- The pension provider may on the other hand try to transfer a risk to insurance companies by means of annuity contracts or through exchanges with unions to rebuild the terms of the pension.
