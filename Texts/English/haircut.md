## What Is a Haircut?

In finance, a haircut has two implications. A haircut is most normally utilized while referring to the percentage difference between an asset's market value and the amount that can be utilized as [collateral](/collateral) for a loan. There is a difference between these values since market prices change over the long haul, and the lender factors this fluctuation into their valuation and analysis for risk mitigation.

For instance, if a person needs a $10,000 loan and needs to utilize their $10,000 stock portfolio as collateral, the bank is bound to perceive the $10,000 portfolio as worth just $5,000 in collateral. The $5,000 or half reduction in the asset's value, for collateral designs, is called the haircut. Should the person's stock portfolio decline in value, they might in any case have adequate collateral for the amount of debt issued.

The term haircut is less ordinarily utilized as the market maker's [spread](/bid-askspread). The term haircut is utilized since the market maker's spreads are so thin. A market maker may "trim" a tiny fee off of proceeds collected as part of giving liquidity in markets or facilitating trades.

## Figuring out Collateral Haircut

A haircut alludes to the lower-than-market value put on an asset being utilized as collateral for a loan. The haircut is communicated as a percentage of the markdown between the two values. At the point when they are utilized as collateral, securities are generally devalued, since a cushion is required by the lending parties in case the [market value](/marketvalue) falls.

At the point when collateral is being pledged, the degree of the haircut is determined by the amount of associated risk to the lender. These risks incorporate any factors that might influence the value of the collateral if the lender needs to sell the security due to a loan [default](/default2) by the borrower. Factors that might influence that amount of a haircut incorporate price, volatility, credit quality of the asset's issuer (if applicable), and [liquidity risks](/liquidityrisk) of the collateral.

## Determining Haircut Amount

Generally talking, price consistency and lower associated risks bring about packed haircuts, as the lender has a high degree of certainty that the full amount of the loan can be covered in the event that the collateral must be liquidated. For instance, [Treasury bills](/treasurybill) are in many cases utilized as collateral for overnight borrowing arrangements between government securities dealers, which are alluded to as [repurchase agreements](/repurchaseagreement) (repos). In these arrangements, haircuts are unimportant due to the high degree of certainty on the value, credit quality, and liquidity of the security.

Securities that are described by [volatility](/volatility) and price uncertainty have bigger haircuts when utilized as collateral. For instance, an investor seeking to borrow funds from a brokerage by posting equity positions to a [margin account](/marginaccount) as collateral can borrow half of the value of the account due to the lack of price consistency, which is a haircut of half.

While a half haircut is standard for margin accounts, a risk-based haircut can be increased in the event that the deposited securities present liquidity or volatility risks. For instance, the haircut on a portfolio of leveraged [exchange-traded funds](/etf) (ETFs), which are highly volatile, might be basically as high as 90%. [Penny stocks](/pennystock), which present expected price, volatility, and liquidity risks, ordinarily can't be utilized as collateral in margin accounts.

> Various lenders will have different haircut valuations. On the off chance that you're not satisfied with how much value your collateral is being assigned, consider evaluating the terms of other financial institutions.

## Haircut Market Maker Spreads

A haircut is likewise sometimes alluded to as the [market maker's](/marketmaker) spread. Since market makers can execute with razor-thin spreads and low transaction costs they can take small fragments or haircuts of profits (or losses) continually over the course of the day.

With advances in technology and markets turning out to be more efficient, spreads in numerous assets have dropped to haircut levels. Retail traders can execute at similar spreads market makers do, albeit retail traders' costs are as yet higher which might make trading the spread inadequate.

In a stock, both retail traders and market makers can buy and sell for a $0.01 spread in an active and liquid stock, however buying and selling 500 shares to make $5 (500 * $0.01) when each trade ordinarily costs $5 to $10 (differs by broker) is certainly not a profitable strategy for the retail trader.

## Long-Term Capital Management's (LTCM) Failure and Collateral Haircuts Example

[LTCM](/longtermcapital) was a hedge fund began in 1993. By 1998 it had amassed monstrous losses, almost bringing about a collapse of the financial system. The basis of LTCM's profit model, which functioned admirably for some time, was to suck up small profits from market shortcomings. This is regularly called [arbitrage](/arbitrage). The firm utilized historical models to highlight opportunities and afterward sent capital to profit from them.

Every opportunity commonly just created a small amount of profit, so the firm used [leverage](/leverage) — or borrowed money — to increase the gains. The firm had $5 billion in assets, yet controlled more than $1 trillion worth of positions.

> In the fall of 2018, 14 banks and brokerage firms invested $3.6 billion in LTCM to prevent the unavoidable collapse of the hedge fund.
>

Banks and different institutions allowed LTCM to borrow or leverage so a lot, with minimal collateral, for the most part since they saw the firm and their situations as non-risky. Ultimately, however, the firm's model failed to foresee shortcomings accurately, and those greatly estimated positions started to lose definitely more money than the firm really had — and more money than a considerable lot of the banks and institutions that loaned to them or allow them to purchase assets had.

The disappointment of LTCM, which required a [bailout](/bailout) of the financial system, brought about a lot higher haircut rules in terms of what can be posted as collateral, and the amount of the haircut possesses to be. LTCM had essentially no haircuts, yet today an average investor buying customary stocks is subject to a half haircut while involving those stocks as collateral against the amount borrowed on a margin trading account.

## Market Maker Haircut Example

In many markets, the market maker's spread is equivalent to the retail trader's spread, albeit the trading costs for the retail trader make attempting to profit from a haircut spread ineffectual.

One market where retail traders frequently **cannot** trade at similar spreads as the market makers is the [forex market](/forex). This is on the grounds that forex brokers frequently mark up the spread, which is the way they bring in money. In the [EUR/USD](/eur-usd-euro-us-dollar-money pair) forex pair the raw spread accessible to market makers is 0.00001, yet retail traders might be paying a spread of 0.00005 to 0.00015 (or even higher), a mark-up of five to 15 times the raw spread.

Forex brokers that give raw spreads to their clients charge a [commission](/commission) on each trade. They bring in their money off of trading fees as opposed to marking up the spread.
