# Section 1256 Contract
## What Is a Section 1256 Contract?

A Section 1256 contract is a type of investment defined by the [Internal Revenue Code (IRC)](/internal-revenue-code) as a regulated futures contract, foreign currency contract, non-equity option, dealer equity option, or dealer securities futures contract. What makes a Section 1256 contract unique is that each contract held by a taxpayer toward the end of the tax year is treated as though it was sold for its fair market value, and gains or losses are treated as either short-term or long-term capital gains.

## Figuring out Section 1256 Contracts

Here is an instructive model utilizing options trading: A [straddle](/straddle) is a strategy that includes holding contracts that offset the risk of loss from one another. For instance, in the event that a trader purchases both a [call option](/calloption) and a [put option](/putoption) for similar investment asset simultaneously, his investment is known as a straddle.

Section 1256 contracts prevent tax-motivated straddles that would concede income and convert [short-term capital gains](/short-term-gain) into [long-term capital gains](/long-term_capital_gain_loss). More specific information about Section 1256 contracts can be found in Subtitle A (Income Taxes), Chapter 1 (Normal Taxes and Surtaxes), Subchapter P (Capital Gains and Losses), Part IV (Special Rules for Determining Capital Gains and Losses) of the IRC.

The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) is responsible for carrying out the IRC.

## Mark-to-Market

Traders that trade [futures](/futures), [futures options](/options-on-futures), and broad-based index options should know about Section 1256 contracts. These contracts, as defined above, must be [marked-to-market](/marktomarket) whenever held through the end of the tax year. A profit or loss on the [fair market value](/fairmarketvalue) of the contracts ought to be calculated whether or not they were really sold for a [capital gain](/capitalgain) or loss. The mark-to-market profit/loss is really unrealized however must be reported on the trader's tax return. After the position is closed out in reality for a [realized gain](/realizedprofit)/loss, the amount previously reported on a prior tax return is factored in to stay away from excess report.

[Wash sales](/washsale) don't matter to Section 1256 contracts since they are marked-to-market.

## Form 6781

Investors reports gains and losses for Section 1256 contract investments by utilizing [Form 6781](/form-6781), however hedging transactions are dealt with in an unexpected way. Since these contracts are viewed as sold consistently, the [holding period](/holdingperiod) of the underlying asset doesn't determine whether the gain or loss is short term or long term, rather all gains and losses on these contracts are viewed as 60% long term and 40% short term. At the end of the day, Section 1256 contracts permits an investor or trader take 60% of the profit at the more great long-term tax rate even on the off chance that the contract was just held for a year or less.

For instance, expect a trader bought a regulated futures contract on May 5, 2017, for $25,000. Toward the end of the tax year, Dec. 31, he actually has the contract in his portfolio and it is valued at $29,000. His mark-to-market profit is $4,000 and he reports this on Form 6781, treated as 60% long-term and 40% short-term capital gain. On Jan. 30, 2018, he sells his long position for $28,000. Since he has proactively recognized a $4,000 gain on his 2017 tax return, he will record a $1,000 loss (calculated as $28,000 minus $29,000) on his 2018 tax return, treated as 60% long-term and 40% short-term [capital loss](/capitalloss).

Form 6781 has separate sections for straddles and Section 1256 Contracts, implying that investors need to recognize the specific type of investment utilized. Part I of the form requires Section 1256 investment gains and losses be reported at either the genuine price the investment was sold for or the mark-to-market price laid out on Dec. 31. Part II of the form requires the losses on the trader's straddles be reported in Section An and gains calculated in Section B. Part III is accommodated any unrecognized gains on positions held toward the end of the tax year, however it possibly must be completed on the off chance that a loss is recognized on a position.
