# Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF)
## What Is the Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF)?

The term Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) alludes to an organization that plans to give assistance and improvements to the financial reporting system. The EITF was made by the [Financial Accounting Standards Board](/fasb) (FASB) in 1984. The organization is responsible for creating and carrying out a streamlined set of [accounting principles](/accounting-principles) to keep various practices from becoming accepted. The task force is comprised of an assortment of industry experts.

## Understanding the Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF)

The Financial Accounting Standards Board was laid out in 1973 as an independent nonprofit organization. It creates and lays out accounting standards for corporations that stick to [generally accepted accounting principles](/gaap) (GAAP), including publicly traded and private companies as well as nonprofits. Thusly, the board is viewed as the authority for accounting standards by the [Securities and Exchange Commission](/sec) (SEC) and different organizations, for example, the [American Institute of CPAs](/american-institute-of-ensured public-accountants) (AICPA) and the Boards of Accountancy.

In 1984, the FASB task force made suggestions to think of a method for giving [accounting](/accounting) reporting guidance. This was the point at which the Emerging Issues Task Force was made. The EITF was intended to limit the requirement for the FASB to spend time and exertion tending to the narrow implementation, application, or other emerging issues that can be dissected inside existing GAAP.

It holds public gatherings, which are scheduled several times every year. These gatherings permit the board to recognize emerging accounting issues and resolve them with a uniform set of practices before different methods emerge and become broad. The EITF comprises basically of accountants from the [private](/private-sector) and public [sectors](/sector), as well as the chief accountant of the SEC. FASB Board individuals additionally go to EITF gatherings and partake in conversations.

## Special Considerations

The task force must have the option to arrive at a consensus on the issues examined and any goals when it meets consistently. To arrive at a consensus, there can be something like three voting individuals who can have a problem with a proposition. These recommendations must be put forward for public comment.

On the off chance that the task force arrives at a consensus on an emerging issue, it will distribute an EITF Issue. This means that the FASB makes no further move. On the off chance that the task force can't arrive at a decision, the FASB must step in and make a move. As indicated by the board's website, the FASB doesn't vote on issues examined at EITF gatherings. Be that as it may, a majority of board individuals from the FASB must endorse all possible goals before they are sanctioned.
