# 5/6 Hybrid Adjustable-Rate Mortgage (5/6 Hybrid ARM)

A 5/6 hybrid adjustable-rate mortgage (5/6 hybrid ARM) is a [adjustable-rate mortgage (ARM)](/arm) that has a fixed interest rate for the initial five years, after which the interest rate can change at regular intervals.

## How a 5/6 Hybrid ARM Works

As the name shows, a 5/6 hybrid ARM consolidates the qualities of a traditional [fixed-rate mortgage](/fixed-rate_mortgage) with those of an adjustable-rate mortgage. It begins with a fixed interest rate for quite some time. Then, at that point, the interest rate becomes adjustable for the leftover long periods of the mortgage.

The adjustable rate depends on a benchmark index, like the prime rate. What's more, the lender will add extra percentage points, known as a [margin](/armmargin). For instance, assuming the index is at present at 4% and the lender's margin is 3%, then your [fully indexed interest rate](/fullyindexedinterestrate) (the rate that you would really pay) will be 7%. While the index is variable, the margin is fixed for the life of the loan.

A 5/6 hybrid ARM ought to have [caps](/periodiccap) on how much the interest rate can rise in some random half year period, as well as over the life of the loan. This offers some protection against rising interest rates that could make the month to month mortgage payments unmanageable.

## How Are 5/6 Mortgages Indexed?

Lenders can utilize various indexes to set the interest rates on their 5/6 hybrid ARMs. Two commonly utilized indexes today are the U.S. [prime rate](/primerate) and the [Constant Maturity Treasury (CMT)](/constantmaturity) rate. The [London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR)](/libor) index was once in wide use also, however it is presently being phased out.

While interest rates can be difficult to foresee, it's worth noticing that in a rising-interest-rate environment, the longer the time span between interest rate reset dates, the better it will be for the borrower. For instance, a [5/1 hybrid ARM](/5-1_arm), which has a fixed five-year period and afterward changes on an annual basis, would be better than a 5/6 ARM on the grounds that its interest rate wouldn't rise as fast. The inverse would be true in a falling-interest-rate environment.
