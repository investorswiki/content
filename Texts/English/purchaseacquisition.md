# Purchase Acquisition Accounting
## What Is Purchase Acquisition Accounting?

Purchase acquisition accounting is a method of reporting the purchase of a company on the balance sheet of the company that gets it. It treats the target firm as an investment. There is no pooling of assets. Rather, the assets of the target firm are added to the balance sheet of the acquirer at a price that mirrors their fair market value. This, thus, builds the acquirer's fair market value. Liabilities of the target are deducted from the fair value of the assets.

The amount paid by the acquirer over the net value of the target's assets and liabilities is viewed as goodwill, which is kept on the balance sheet and amortized yearly.

This method has turned into the accepted standard for purchase accounting. The acquisition accounting method is now and again alluded to as business combination accounting.

No goodwill results from the purchase transaction. Since there is no goodwill to [write off](/discount), this can bring about higher future earnings for the recently shaped entity.

At the point when the acquirer utilizes the acquisition accounting method, the target is treated as an investment.
