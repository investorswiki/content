## How a Cover Note Works

How long the cover note stays legitimate really relies on how rapidly the insurance company can make another policy, and whether the insurer generally disapproves of the policy in the middle between selling the policy and giving the policy document. Assuming the cover note terminates before the permanent policy documentation has been received, the insured individual will either receive an automatic extension of the cover note, or they can demand one be sent.

Insurance companies might permit somebody who has as of late purchased an insurance policy (however doesn't yet have a conventional policy) to cancel the purchase. This permits somebody who just holds a cover note to receive a [refund](/refund), gave that a claim on the policy has not been made during the cancellation period.
