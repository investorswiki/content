# Open-End Credit
## What is open-end credit?
Open-end credit is a credit extension that might be utilized something like a specific preset limit. It is at times alluded to as revolving credit. There are several types of open-end credit.
## More profound definition
To better comprehend open-end credit, it assists with understanding what closed-end credit means. With a closed-end loan, you borrow a specific amount of money for a set period of time. For instance, you might borrow $20,000 for quite some time to buy a vehicle. The total amount due plus interest is amortized north of 60 months to decide your regularly scheduled payments. Whenever you have made every one of your payments, the vehicle loan is paid in full.
Open-end credit works in an unexpected way. You meet all requirements for a particular amount of money and can borrow as close to nothing or as quite a bit of that money as you like. As a matter of fact, whenever you have paid your balance back (in part or in full) you can re-borrow the money, without reworking the terms of your loan.
For instance, assuming you have a credit limit of $20,000 at 5 percent interest, you can borrow and once again borrow money up to that $20,000 loan limit and never worry about the interest rate going up. Two expected traps of open-end credit are:
- You might be charged a month to month or annual fee for keeping the account open.
- You might be enticed to spend the money on things you don't actually require.

## Open-end credit models
Coming up next are a wide range of open-end credit:

TransUnion proposes that you read the fine print before signing an open-end credit agreement. Make certain to ask the accompanying inquiries:
1. What is the interest rate?
1. Is there an annual or month to month fee?
1. Will the interest rate be higher in the event that I take a cash advance on this account?
1. Might I at any point pay off the balance without a penalty?

## Features
