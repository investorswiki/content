# Paradox of Thrift
## What Is the Paradox of Thrift?

The paradox of thrift, or paradox of savings, is an economic theory that posits that personal savings are a net drag on the economy during a [recession](/recession). This theory depends on the assumption that prices don't clear or that producers fail to conform to evolving conditions, as opposed to the expectations of [classical](/classicaleconomics) [microeconomics](/microeconomics). The paradox of thrift was advocated by British economist John Maynard Keynes.

## Grasping the Paradox of Thrift

As indicated by [Keynesian theory](/keynesianeconomics), the legitimate response to an economic recession is really spending, more gamble taking, and less savings. Keynesians accept a recessed economy doesn't create at full capacity since a portion of its factors of production (land, labor, and capital) are jobless.

Keynesians likewise contend that consumption, or spending, drives economic growth. Subsequently, even however it's a good idea for individuals and households to reduce consumption during difficult stretches, this is some unacceptable remedy for the bigger economy.

A pullback in aggregate [consumer spending](/consumer-spending) could force businesses to deliver even less, extending the recession. This distinction among individual and group rationality is the basis of the savings paradox. An illustration of this was seen during the [Great Recession](/great-recession) that followed the financial crisis of 2008. During that time, the savings rate for the average American household increased from 2.9 % to 5%. The [Federal Reserve](/federalreservesystem) sliced interest rates to support spending in the American economy.

The main conceptual description of the paradox of thrift might have been written in Bernard Mandeville's "The Fable of the Bees" (1714). Mandeville contended for increased expenditure as the key to thriving, as opposed to savings. Keynes credited Mandeville for the concept in his book "The General Theory of Employment, Interest, and Money" (1936).

## Circular Flow Economic Model

Keynes restored the [circular flow model](/circular-flow-of-income) of the economy. This theory states that an increase in current spending drives future spending. Current spending, all things considered, brings about more income for current producers. Those producers objectively convey their new income, sometimes extending business and hiring new workers; these new workers earn new income, which then, at that point, might be spent.

To help current spending, Keynes contended for lower interest rates to lower current [savings rates](/savings-rate). In the event that low interest rates don't make really borrowing and spending, Keynes said, the government could take part in [deficit spending](/deficit-spending) to fill the gap.

## Limitations of the Paradox of Thrift

The circular flow model overlooks the illustration of [Say's law](/says-law), which states goods must be created before they can be traded. Capital machines, which drive higher levels of production, require extra savings and investment. The circular flow model just works in a system without capital goods.

Likewise, the theory overlooks the potential for [inflation](/inflation) or [deflation](/deflation). On the off chance that higher current spending makes future prices rise concordantly, future production and employment will stay unchanged. Essentially, if current [thrift](/thrift) during a recession forces future prices to fall, future production and employment need not decline as Keynes anticipated.

At long last, the paradox of thrift overlooks the potential for saved income to be loaned out by banks. At the point when a few individuals increase their savings, interest rates will generally fall, and banks make extra loans.

Keynes met these complaints by contending Say's law was off-base and prices are too inflexible to productively change. Economists stay partitioned about [sticky prices](/price_stickiness). It is widely accepted that Keynes distorted Say's law in his nullification.

## Instances of the Paradox of Thrift

Ivan claims a factory that produces part parts for PCs. The factory is among town XYZ's greatest employers. He has been planning to grow his production capacity by introducing more machines and hiring new workers.

Be that as it may, a recession strikes and Ivan returns to savings mode. He [lays off](/cutback) workers and stops operating the machines at night time. Jobless factory workers, who don't have income to spend, additionally start saving, diminishing [demand](/demand) for goods delivered by Ivan's factory. The jobless factory workers likewise add to the town's overall spending on social benefits and its economy becomes weak.

A real world illustration of the savings paradox during the Great Recession was the case of 25-to 29-year-olds who moved in with their parents. The percentage of such individuals increased from 14% in 2005 to 19% in 2011. While the move assisted families with saving money on rent and different expenses, it caused estimated damages of as much as $25 billion every year to the economy.

## Features
- It calls for a lowering of interest rates to support spending levels during an economic recession.
- The paradox of thrift is an economic theory that contends that personal savings can be impeding to overall economic growth. It depends on a circular flow of the economy in which current spending drives future spending.
- Pundits of the theory state that it disregards Say's law, which calls for investment in capital goods before any level of spending can be accomplished, and doesn't consider inflation or deflation in prices.
