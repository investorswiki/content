## What Are Decentralized Dark Pool Trading Platforms?

Decentralized dark pool trading platforms are trading settings for anonymously trading [cryptocurrencies](/cryptocurrency). Exchanges, for example, Kraken had offered dark pools for cryptocurrency trading. Singapore-based Republic Protocol sent off the principal decentralized platform for dark pool trading in 2018.

## How Decentralized Dark Pool Trading Platforms Work

The advantage of dark pool trading inside cryptocurrency markets is that transactions are anonymous and decentralized. This means the exchange happens straightforwardly between two gatherings, is anonymous in nature, and isn't worked with by a third-party. Not exclusively is the identity of the traders managing the transaction not revealed, critical data connecting with the exchange — like the price and volume at certain positions — isn't unveiled.

In trades including different cryptocurrencies, atomic cross-chain swaps are performed between currency pairs upheld by the platform.

[Dark pool](/dark-pool) trades affect equity markets since there are covers administering the number of such trades. The cryptocurrency ecosystem is as yet developing and the deficiency of large institutional investors and liquidity in the space means that decentralized dark pool trades limitedly affect prices and trading in mainstream crypto markets.

## How Do Decentralized Dark Pool Trades Work?

After an order is received by the platform, it is broken down into parts. The subsequent interaction is like the [Bitcoin](/bitcoin) mining process. Hubs run multiparty calculations and rival each other to match the most orders and are compensated with a portion of the overall fee for each match. A zero-knowledge proof is utilized to check integrity of the transaction. Order sections that are matched are kept in the system and a warning is shipped off different hubs in regards to the match. Unmatched parts are reused in matching the next set of orders.
