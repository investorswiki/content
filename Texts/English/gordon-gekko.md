## Impacts for the Character of Gordon Gekko

The character of Gordon Gekko was not in light of any one person, yet rather on a composite of real-life lenders. Stanley Weiser, who co-composed the screenplay with Oliver Stone, asserted that Gekko was partially founded on corporate raider Carl Icahn, shamed stock trader Ivan Boesky, and investor Michael Ovitz.

The popular Gekko quote "Greed is great" repeats a discourse Boesky gave in 1985 at the University of California Berkeley School of Business Administration, when he said, "I think greed is solid. You can be greedy regardless warm hearted about yourself."

Gekko's penthouse office and exquisite suits were modeled after those of art collector Asher Edelman. Weiser adds that a portion of Gekko's unpolished, compulsive worker discourse is lifted from the calls and work meetings of the movie's director and co-essayist Oliver Stone.

The film's producer, Ed Pressman, stated that one of the motivations for Gordon Gekko was [Michael Milken](/michaelmilken). During the 1980s, Milken acquired a reputation as the "Garbage Bond King," however he was captured in 1989 and sentenced for different counts of fraud and [racketeering](/racketeering). Oliver Stone focuses on his dad as the motivation for the overall film of "Wall Street," as his dad was a broker and much of the time deplored the lack of good films on business.
