## What Is a Subprime Auto Loan?

A [subprime](/subprime) vehicle loan is a type of loan used to finance a vehicle acquisition that is offered to individuals with low credit scores or limited [credit histories](/credit-history). Subprime loans carry higher interest rates than comparable prime loans and may likewise accompany [prepayment](/prepayment) punishments assuming that the borrower decides to pay off the loan early; in any case, supposed subprime borrowers might have no other road for purchasing an automobile, so they are many times ready to pay the higher fees and rates associated with these types of loans.

Subprime car loans turned out to be big business following the monetary expansion of 2001-2004, alongside subprime mortgages and different forms of lending to higher-risk people or businesses. Financial institutions were so loaded that they searched out the higher returns that could be had from charging higher interest rates to subprime borrowers.

The term "subprime" really was promoted by the media somewhat later, however, during the subprime mortgage crisis or "credit mash" of 2007 and 2008. The positions of subprime lenders dispersed after the Great Recession, however they have been getting back in the game.

## How a Subprime Auto Loan Works

There is no official cutoff score for subprime (versus prime) status, however generally, the borrower has a [credit score](/credit_score) somewhere in the range of 580 and 619 to be considered subprime. (FICO credit scores range somewhere in the range of 300 and 850.)

In assessing a borrower, a vehicle loan lender might ask to see pay stubs or W-2 or 1099 forms to demonstrate income. Assuming a borrower is in a profession in which it's difficult to demonstrate income — a restaurant waiter who has a ton of income in cash tips, for instance — they might have to get bank statements that show a history of reliable cash deposits to their account. A few lenders will acknowledge bank statements in place of, or notwithstanding, standard pay nails.

As a rule, it's best to shop around for rates whenever forced to go with a subprime loan. Not all lenders utilize similar criteria and some charge bigger fees than others. The interest rates can be very steep compared to a standard vehicle loan in light of the fact that the lender needs to guarantee it can recover costs should the borrower default on the payments.

On the other hand, borrowers could try to further develop their credit scores before they try to get financing for an automobile purchase. Like that, they could meet all requirements for a loan with much better terms.
