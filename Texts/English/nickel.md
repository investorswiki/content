For instance, assume the trader wishes to trade the USD/EUR currency pair. On the off chance that the USD/EUR exchange rate is $1.30 and the trader needs to invest $100,000, then, at that point, a one-nickel move would be worth $38.46. This type of quick calculation can assist traders with understanding the scope of possible profits or losses that they would hope to support contingent upon how prices advance.
