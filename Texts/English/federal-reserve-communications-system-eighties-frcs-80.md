# Federal Reserve Communications System For The Eighties (FRCS-80)
## What Is the Federal Reserve Communications System For The Eighties?

The Federal Reserve Communications System For The Eighties (FRCS-80) was a communications network plan sent off in 1981 by the [Federal Reserve Bank](/federalreservebank) to connect their different offices across the U.S. furthermore, work with transfers of securities and electronic funds transfers.

## Grasping the Federal Reserve Communications System For The Eighties (FRCS-80)

The Federal Reserve Communications System For The Eighties was an intricate communications network plan intended to interface the different U.S. offices of the Federal Reserve Bank and give a means of starting trades and electronic funds transfers.

Sent off in 1981, FCRS-80 was intended to be a universally useful data communications network for the Federal Reserve. It was planned to work on both the capacity and dependability of communications inside the Federal Reserve, reduce the overall cost of communications, and increase the security of the data moving through the system.

An extra feature of FCRS-80 was to shift the system away from a modernized hub and to disperse and decentralize the computing power of the Federal Reserve communications system with the goal that the system was not as helpless against margin time or different trade offs.

To this end, FCRS-80 was directed by the Federal Reserve's rigid internal requirements for giving data to the [financial industry](/financial_sector) as well as other administrative agencies, including the [U.S. Treasury](/ustreasury).

## A Brief History of FCRS-80

As per a 1981 statement by Federal Reserve Staff Director Theodore Allison, FRCS-80 was initiated as a natural movement of the business practices of the Federal Reserve.

The [Fedwire](/fedwire) system was initially sent off in the mid twentieth century as a telecommunication based primary communications network for the Federal Reserve and the U.S. Treasury. This system, as indicated by Allison, looked for periodic improvements as technology advanced. As the 1970s showed up and more efficient and secure electronic communications started to come to fruition, the Federal Reserve recognized the need to shift away from telecommunication into fresher methods of communication.

Planning for FRCS-80 started in 1975, and development of the plan was driven by cutoff times outside the control of the Federal Reserve. In the mid 1970s, the Federal Reserve started to perceive the requirement for improvements to its Electronic Funds Transfer Services, as mechanical improvements, for example, bundle switching opened up, facilitating quicker and more solid electronic communications. Furthermore, services which the Federal Reserve depended upon for their communications started to give indications of age, including an AT&T service which was scheduled for retirement in 1983.

Furthermore, the passage of Depository Institutions Deregulation and the [Monetary Control Act of 1980](/monetary-control-act) gave the Federal Reserve greater powers over U.S. banks, adding extra desperation to the changes guaranteed by FCRS-80.
