## What Is a Tax Expense?

A tax expense is a liability owed to federal, state/common, or potentially municipal governments inside a given period, regularly throughout the span of a year.

Tax expenses are calculated by duplicating the proper tax rate of an individual or business by the income received or generated before taxes, subsequent to considering in such factors as non-deductible things, tax assets, and tax liabilities.

Tax Expense = Effective Tax Rate x Taxable Income

## Understanding Tax Expense

Ascertaining tax expense can be complex given that various types of income are subject to certain levels of taxes. For example, a business must pay [payroll tax](/payrolltax) on wages paid to employees, [sales tax](/salestax) on certain asset purchases, and [excise tax](/excisetax) on certain goods.

Notwithstanding the scope of tax rates applicable to different levels of income, the different tax rates in various locales and the numerous layers of tax on income likewise add to the complexity of deciding an entity's tax expense. Deciding the fitting tax rate and distinguishing the right accounting methods for things influencing one's tax expense are carefully portrayed by tax specialists, for example, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and GAAP/IFRS.

[Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP)](/gaap) and the [International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS)](/ifrs) accommodate a certain treatment of things of income and expenses which might contrast from the provision permitted under the applicable government tax code.

This means that the amount of tax expense recognized is probably not going to precisely match the standard income tax percentage that is applied to business income. At the end of the day, the differences in financial accounting and the tax code might bring about a tax expense that varies from the genuine tax bill.

For instance, many companies use [straight-line depreciation](/straightlinebasis) to work out the depreciation reported in their financial statements, yet are permitted to utilize a [accelerated form of depreciation](/accelerateddepreciation) to determine their taxable benefit; the outcome is a taxable income figure that is lower than the reported income figure.

Tax expense influences a company's net earnings given that a liability must be paid to a federal or state government. The expense reduces the amount of profits to be distributed to shareholders as dividends.

This is even more disadvantageous to shareholders of [C corporations](/c-corporation) who must pay taxes again on the dividend received. Nonetheless, a tax expense is possibly recognized when a company has taxable income. If a loss is recognized, the business can carry its losses forward to future years to offset or reduce future tax expenses.

## Tax Expense versus Tax Payable

The tax expense is what an entity has decided is owed in taxes in light of standard business accounting rules. This charge is reported on the [income statement](/incomestatement). The [tax payable](/incometaxpayable) is the genuine amount owed in taxes in light of the rules of the tax code. The payable amount is recognized on the balance sheet as a liability until the company settles the tax bill.

In the event that the tax expense is higher than the tax liability, the difference makes another liability, called a [deferred tax liability](/deferredtaxliability), which must be paid sooner or later. Then again, assuming that the tax payable is higher than the tax expense, the difference makes an asset category, called the [deferred tax asset,](/deferredtaxasset) which can be utilized to settle any tax expense from here on out.
