## Understanding the EAFE Index

The EAFE Index was made to mirror the performance of mid-and huge cap stocks across 21 developed market countries — the [Europe, Australasia, and the Far East](/eafe) (EAFE). The index was developed by Morgan Stanley Capital International (MSCI) in 1969 and records in excess of 874 stocks from 21 countries in the EAFE. As of June 30, 2021, the rundown of countries by region are given in the table below:

The EAFE Index is a [market-capitalization-weighted index](/capitalizationweightedindex); its individual parts are weighted by their market capitalization. This means that countries with the biggest stock markets, for example, Japan and the United Kingdom, will have the biggest relative weighting in the index. Moreover, changes in the market value of bigger securities will bring about a greater move in the index than changes in the market value of smaller stocks. The biggest 70% securities in the MSCI EAFE Index comprise the index' huge cap stocks, the 71st to 85th percentiles are the EAFE Mid-Cap, and the 85th to 99th percentiles address the EAFE Small Cap.
