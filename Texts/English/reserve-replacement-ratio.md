# Reserve-Replacement Ratio
## What Is the Reserve-Replacement Ratio?

The reserve-replacement ratio (RRR) is the amount of oil added to a company's reserves separated by the amount extricated for production. This calculation is a measurement utilized by [investors](/financial backer) to judge an oil company's operating performance.

## Figuring out the Reserve-Replacement Ratio

The reserve-replacement ratio measures the amount of [proved reserves](/proved-reserves) added to a company's reserve base during the year, relative to the amount of oil and gas that the company has created.

As per conventional market wisdom, when demand is stable, a company's reserve-replacement ratio must be something like 100% for the company to support current production levels. Any figure greater than 100% likely demonstrates that the company has room for growth. On the other hand, any number under 100% messages a reason to worry that the company may before long run out of oil.

The reserve replacement ratio is many times calculated on national or global conditions, commonly with regards to long-term broad industry forecasting and macroeconomic analysis. Due to the way that national numbers for reserves are inclined to be controlled, these numbers ought to be taken with a grain of certifiable salt.

Truth be told, shortsighted translations of the reserve-replacement ratio have generally caused undue panic that the oil supply would run dry, dating as far back as the 1800s. From 1980 through 2020, the ratio of proved reserves to production in North America has gone from 19 to 47 years. In any case, history has shown that these were false presumptions since this scientific data failed to think about future reserve growth.

### Matching Reserve-Replacement Ratio With Other Data

Albeit the reserve-replacement ratio can without a doubt be a significant indicator that investors ought to depend on to measure how well an oil company is playing out, this measurement alone doesn't offer a complete and accurate image of a given oil company's wellness.

Hence, the reserve-replacement ratio ought to be mulled over working together with several other operating [metrics](/metrics). These may incorporate the reserve-life index, enterprise value to debt-adjusted cash flow ratio, enterprise value to daily production ratio, and total [capital expenditure](/capitalexpenditure) (CAPEX) spending.

CAPEX spending alludes to funds an oil company exhausts to source and foster extra reserves. This figure might shift from one period to another and can be impacted by new advances, changes to supply and demand dynamics, and fluctuating oil prices. A high reserve-replacement ratio accomplished through organic replacement is viewed as better than a high reserve-replacement ratio accomplished through purchasing proved reserves.

> Since oil production gauges change from one year to another, it is insightful to work out the reserve-replacement ratio over numerous years, to gather more accurate long-term projections.
