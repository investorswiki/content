# Fractal Markets Hypothesis (FMH)
## What Is Fractal Markets Hypothesis (FMH)?

The fractal markets hypothesis (FMH) affirms that time series data of stock [market](/market) prices shows properties like fractals and qualities these properties to changing time horizons and information among investors.

## Understanding Fractal Markets Hypothesis

As indicated by the fractal markets hypothesis (FMH), convergence of time horizons and information sets toward the short-term during times of increased market vulnerability can be demonstrated as a collapse of the fractal structure of market prices. This can create sudden spikes in market volatility and lack of market liquidity saw during [crashes](/crash) and [crises](/financial-crisis). The FMH is an extension of the widely used [efficient market hypothesis (EMH)](/efficientmarkethypothesis).

The FMH was developed by Ed Peters in his 1994 book, **Fractal Market Analysis: Applying Chaos Theory to Investment and Economics**. Fractal patterns overall display the property that the give off an impression of being comparable or self-repeating when seen at various scales. Peters contended that time series of [stock market](/stockmarket) prices don't simple look like a random walk (as portrayed by the EMH), however display fractal properties in that they have a comparative structure when examined at various time stretches.

This fractal pattern in [financial markets](/financial-market) makes a differentiation between long-term investors who might zero in on market fundamentals and short-term investors who might zero in more on [technical analysis](/technicalanalysis). Since the various gatherings of investors operate over various [investment horizons](/investment_horizon) with various arrangements of information they can assist with giving market liquidity to each other which can assist with settling the long run in spite of everyday volatility. Trades by [long-term](/longterm) investors balance the trades of [short-term](/shortterm) investors — guaranteeing [securities](/security) can undoubtedly be [traded](/exchange) without emphatically impacting valuations.

Notwithstanding, that changes in [bearish markets](/bearmarket). Problems can happen when a sudden shock leads to uplifted vulnerability among long-term investors making them shift their emphasis on to a short time horizon and information pertinent to short-term variances. This outcomes in a market where all or most investors are short-term investors, with few long-term counterparts to supply liquidity for short-term trades.

Suddenly, all investors act like short-term investors, reacting to short-term price developments and information. This shift makes markets become less [liquid](/liquidity) and more [inefficient](/inefficientmarket). The withdrawal of liquidity from the market can deliver extreme short-term swings in [market prices](/market-price) that characterize sudden market declines.

2008 financial crisis drove numerous spectators to address predominant economic hypotheses and viewpoints on markets. EMH sets that investors act [rationally](/sane behavior) and markets are [efficient](/productivity), significance prices ought to continuously mirror a [asset's](/resource) true value. That perspective was questioned by and by in the wake of the [Great Recession](/great-recession).

Alternative speculations, like uproarious market hypothesis, [adaptive market hypothesis](/adaptive-market-hypothesis), and FMH, that look at investor behavior all through a [market cycle](/market_cycles), including [booms](/win) and [busts](/fail), acquired unmistakable quality.

## Chaos Theory, Fractals, and Markets

Falling into the system of [chaos theory](/chaostheory), the FMH makes sense of markets utilizing the concept of fractals — divided geometric shapes that can be broken down into parts that recreate the state of the whole.

With respect to markets, promoters of this theory claim that stock prices move in fractals. They utilize this as the basis for a form of technical analysis; similarly that the patterns of fractals repeat themselves along all time spans, stock prices likewise seem to move in recreating geometric patterns through time.

That analysis centers around the price developments of assets in view of the conviction that the history of stock prices repeats itself at various scales. Following this system, the FMH studies investor horizons, the job of liquidity, and the impact of information through the [business cycle](/businesscycle).

## Limitations of Fractal Market Hypothesis

Maybe the most incredibly obvious problem with evaluating and using the FMH is choosing the timeframe that the "fractal" pattern ought to be repeated in attempting to project market course. A pattern could be repeated on a daily, week after week, month to month, or even longer basis. Be that as it may, since fractals are intrinsically recursive in a limitless cycle, a trader may not know when to begin or at which scale to operate.

It is, in this way, extremely hard to precisely project the time span of redundancy, in spite of it probably being closely connected with the investment horizon. It is likewise worth taking note of that the pattern would likely not be indistinguishably repeated.

## Features
- FMH contends that market prices show fractal properties over the long haul, which can be upset when the information sets and time horizons of investors change.
- The fractal markets hypothesis (FMH) is a theory about how increased market vulnerability can lead to sudden market emergencies and accidents.
- FMH, developed by Ed Peters in his 1994 book, Fractal Market Analysis: Applying Chaos Theory to Investment and Economics, is an extension of the widely used efficient market hypothesis (EMH).
- The most ridiculously obvious problem with measuring and using the FMH is choosing the time allotment that the "fractal" pattern ought to be repeated in attempting to project market course.
