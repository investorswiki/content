# Least-Preferred Coworker Scale
## What Is the Least-Preferred Coworker Scale?

The least-preferred coworker scale, developed by American researcher Fred Fiedler, distinguishes whether an individual's leadership style is either relationship-arranged or task-situated.

The least preferred coworker (LPC) scale requires a person to rate the one individual they would least need to work with — the least-preferred coworker — utilizing a scope of 18 to 25 bipolar (positive or negative) descriptive words, with [ratings](/rating) from 1 to 8. The LPC score is then registered by adding up to every one of the ratings. A high LPC score shows that the individual is a relationship-situated leader, while a low LPC score recommends a task-arranged leader.

## How the Least-Preferred Coworker Scale Works

A regular set of bipolar descriptive words utilized in the LPC scale would incorporate wonderful or terrible, friendly or unfriendly, steady or hostile, etc. The reactions are graded from 1 for the least good attribute (for instance, undesirable or unfriendly), to 8 for the most ideal one (wonderful or friendly).

The LPC scale expects that individuals whose [leadership](/leadership) style is relationship-situated will quite often depict their least preferred coworkers in a more positive way, while those whose style is task-arranged rate them all the more negatively.

## Applying the Least Preferred Coworker Scale

The model introduced by the scale presents the thought that no single leadership style is perfect or ideal, as the necessities change contingent upon conditions and setting. For example, a team that is contained veteran experts who are knowledgeable in their tasks might be served best by a relationship-situated style of leadership. The team doesn't need the cumbersome approach that a less experienced team may, which could remember severe rules for order to guarantee the task is achieved.

Essentially, a veteran team could require task-situated leadership assuming there is a short cutoff time to complete the objectives or on the other hand assuming that the objectives incorporate sensitive milestones that will be challenging to accomplish. Assuming the team is comprised of both veteran experts and undeveloped staff, the situational needs of the objective and could mean leadership styles might change in light of the moment or the individuals who need [guidance](/guidance).

## Special Considerations

Situational positivity likewise assumes a part in the leadership style adopted. The leadership-part relationship is a barometer of how much influence and trust exists between the team and its leader. On the off chance that this bond is weak, the leader can be said to hold a weak position in such manner. This can be influenced by the leader's position of power in the organization.

The amount of power and authority a leader needs to direct the team who works for them may be portrayed as strong, meaning they have clear control to see their commands are followed. Assuming that power is weak, they have less control over the team to guarantee the action that is taken.
