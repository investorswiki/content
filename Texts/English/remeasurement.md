# Remeasurement
## What Is Remeasurement?

Remeasurement is the re-evaluation of the value of a long-term asset or foreign currency on a company's [financial statements](/financial-statements). Remeasurement is frequently involved by companies that conduct business in numerous currencies.

## Grasping Remeasurement

Remeasurement is the course of restoring the value of a thing or asset to give a more accurate financial record of its value. Companies use remeasurement when [translating](/currency-translation) the value of incomes and assets from a foreign [subsidiary](/subsidiary) that is designated in another currency. Remeasurement is additionally important on the grounds that it can assist companies with revaluing [fixed assets](/fixedasset) (physical, [long-term](/longtermassets) assets) as well as [intangible](/intangibleasset) assets, for example, [goodwill](/goodwill).

## Types of Remeasurement
### Remeasurement Due to Foreign Currency Translation

Remeasurement is common for companies that carry on with work in another country, where the nearby currency might be not the same as the company's [reporting currency](/reportingcurrency). Any gains or losses are reported in the company's income statement.

Remeasurement may likewise be utilized when there is [hyperinflation](/hyperinflation) or large and successive swings in the currency exchange rate. Hyperinflation is the point at which a country is encountering quick and extreme expansions in the prices of goods. Remeasurement, in this specific situation, is otherwise called the [temporal method](/temporalmethod), which utilizes historical exchange rates in view of when the assets were acquired.

Foreign currency remeasurement could become possibly the most important factor for a U.K.- based company that carries on with work in the European Union. Albeit the company could keep up with some bank accounts and different assets named in euros, they would need to be remeasured into the functional currency for the parent company's financial statements.

> ### Remeasurement versus Translation
> Remeasurement changes over financial outcomes into a company's reporting currency, giving data about how future cash flows could change due to changes in exchange rates. Translation communicates the financial consequences of a separate entity, whose functional currency is not quite the same as that of the parent company. Remeasurement results are reported under net income, while translation results are reported under equity.

Gains or losses from remeasurement are generally reported under net income, while foreign currency translation is recorded in "other thorough income." [Accumulated other exhaustive income](/accumulatedother) incorporates unrealized gains and losses from different sources that don't influence net income on the [income statement](/incomestatement) straightforwardly. These gains and losses are rather reported separately, below [retained earnings](/retainedearnings), in the equity section of the [balance sheet](/balancesheet).

### Remeasurement Due to Impairment

Remeasurement is employed during a situation when the value of a physical, long-term asset, like land, has definitely diminished and can't be recuperated. A company holds the value of the land it claims on the balance sheet at [historical cost](/historical-cost) â€” the price initially paid to procure the land. [Generally accepted accounting principles](/gaap) (GAAP) require the utilization of historical cost while reporting fixed asset value in light of the fact that the amount is effectively irrefutable and ordinarily [conservative](/accounting-traditionalism), as property will in general value in value over the long haul. Subsequently, an appreciation in value may not be remeasured to a higher value on the balance sheet.

In any case, on the off chance that the value of the land diminishes fundamentally and permanently, a remeasurement might be suitable. Remeasuring the asset permits the company to all the more accurately record the value of the [impaired asset](/impairedasset) and may permit a deductible loss to be taken. To determine whether an impairment exists, a company needs to determine on the off chance that the market value of an asset has dipped under its [carrying value](/carryingvalue).

An impairment loss ought to possibly be recorded if the anticipated future [cash flows](/cashflow) are unrecoverable. In this manner, on account of land impairment, a company would regularly have to expect a sale soon to record a remeasurement to the lower value. On the off chance that its sale isn't up and coming, the value of the land could sensibly be expected to recuperate over the long haul. At the point when an impaired asset's carrying value is written down to market value, the loss is recognized on the company's income statement in the equivalent [accounting period](/accountingperiod).

## Illustration of Remeasurement

In the wake of the COVID-19 flare-up, the U.S. economy experienced major interruptions and certain accounting issues emerged therefore. One of these issues emerged around the identification and valuation of [goodwill impairment](/goodwill-impairment). Goodwill is ordinarily broke down and tried for impairment on an annual basis. Be that as it may, if a "setting off occasion" happens, for example, the extraordinary downturn in the economy because of the COVID-19 flare-up, companies are encouraged to test their goodwill for impairment outside of the annual basis. An extra and immediate audit might be fundamental to remeasure the value of the goodwill accurately.

While testing for goodwill impairment, a company can browse one of two methods. The income approach utilizes [discounted future cash flows](/dcf) to distinguish the value of goodwill. The market approach uses fair market valuations to determine the value of goodwill in light of comparative transactions inside a similar sector or industry. Both of these remeasurement methods are made more troublesome in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic.

The income approach to remeasuring goodwill is confounded by challenges encompassing the projection of future cash flows. With an uncertain future, as well as expanding government contribution in business relief, it is more hard for companies to accurately project their cash flows. Furthermore, there are more immediate issues influencing a company's ability to project future cash flows due to business terminations, shortened operations, uncertain employee sick leave, and diminished productivity due to telecommute arrangements. The market approach is correspondingly jumbled on the grounds that accurate market analysis and [comparable transaction](/comparable-transaction) selection are risky also.
