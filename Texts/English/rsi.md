# Relative Strength Index (RSI)
## What Is the Relative Strength Index (RSI)?
The relative strength index (RSI) demonstrates whether a [security](/security), like a stock, is overbought or oversold. A technical indicator is a part of a group of measures known as momentum oscillators, which determine whether a stock's movement signals an opportunity to buy or sell. One more well known oscillator utilized by investors and analysts is the [moving average](/movingaverage).
Technical indicators, on account of stock prices with RSI, have next to no to do with a company's fundamentals ([earnings](/netincome), [revenue](/revenue), and so forth) and on second thought center exclusively around stock price movement.
RSI can be utilized really on any security or commodity that has a price and is traded daily. It's generally utilized when markets are either in a downturn or upswing and are moving rapidly in one or the other course. Investors utilize the indicator on a stock that has been taking sharp up or down actions in a short period and need to be aware from that technical analysis whether to buy or sell. Well known instruments and commodities to follow by means of relative strength index incorporate bitcoin, gold, and silver.

## Relative Strength Index Formula
RSI = 100 - (100/[1 + {14-Day Average Gain/14-Day Average Loss} ] )
## The most effective method to Calculate a Stock's Relative Strength Index
The indicator involves 14 days as a benchmark, and that addresses approximately three weeks of data, on the reason that trading is directed exclusively during work days (Monday to Friday). A few investors and analysts, however, utilize different periods, like 20 or 30 days.
Over that 14-day period, determine the stock's average gain in price on days when it ascends from the previous day, and the average loss for a really long time when it is down from the previous day. The relative strength is calculated by separating the average gain by the average loss.
From that point, input the data into the RSI formula above. The indicator must be somewhere in the range of 0 and 100. On the off chance that the RSI is lower than 30, it recommends the stock has fallen more than it ought to have (i.e., is oversold) and signals a buying opportunity. Assuming it is higher than 70, this recommends that the stock has risen more than it ought to have (i.e., is overbought) and signals a selling opportunity.
All in all, in the event that the stock is trending at 30 or lower, the indicator recommends a reversal at the cost to go higher. A similar applies for the stock trending at 70 or higher; this is an indication of reversal at the cost to go lower. A RSI at around 50 recommends no immediate price action to drop either up or down.
## Step by step instructions to Calculate RSI on a Spreadsheet (Example: Netflix)
**Step 1**: Gather data, somewhere around 15 days' worth of prices. In this model, the closing stock price of Netflix is collected north of a 1-year period.
**Step 2**: Calculate daily percentage change. (**Note**: The formulas for every cell are displayed in the cell and on the top left field area of the screen capture of the calculation sheet.)
**Step 3**: Create separate columns for daily gains and losses. The cells for one or the other gain or loss are featured in various varieties, and this can be customized through conditional formatting. The loss column must be an absolute value.
**Step 4**: Calculate the 14-day average for gain and loss from the separate gain and loss columns, and rundown the 14-day average on the line of the 14th day of the average.
**Step 5**: Calculate relative strength by separating the 14-day average gain by the 14-day average loss. (Note: If the number is negative, that means the data in the average loss column aren't communicated in absolute value terms.)
**Step 6**: Calculate the relative strength index by contributing the relative strength data into the formula. As another trading day come in, the RSI recalculates 14 days of data to incorporate the most recent closing price.
**Step 7**: Graph the data of the relative strength index.
## Step by step instructions to Interpret the Relative Strength Index
In the graph above for Netflix, the 1-year data show that there were around five examples in which the stock was viewed as oversold and indicated a reversal at the cost to turn higher, and four times when the stock was seen as overbought and indicated a reversal to go lower. Every one of these cases shows a reversal in bearing after prices proposed one of the levels.
The RSI in data table format is adequate to tell whether a security is oversold, overbought, or not one or the other. Yet, showing the data graphically gives opportunities to involve different measures in deciphering relative strength.
In the event that the RSI mirrors the price movement of a security, it's known as convergence. On the other hand, divergence shows that a security is moving the other way of what the RSI demonstrates, and that could mean a reversal in price.
A [head and shoulders pattern](/head-shoulders) may form, and that would likewise show a reversal toward price and whether to buy or sell. Inside RSI, denoting the tops over 70 and box below 30 could give trendlines on the heading of the security.
## What Are the Limitations of the Relative Strength Index?
Technical indicators, for example, the relative strength index measure a stock price's performance however have close to nothing to do with the fundamentals of a company. In any case, utilized with different measures or metrics, for example, the [price-to-earnings ratio](/price-earningsratio), RSI could be a complementary tool in investing and breaking down companies.

## Features
- An asset is generally considered overbought when the RSI is above 70% and oversold when it is below 30%.
- The relative strength index (RSI) is a well known momentum oscillator developed in 1978.
- The RSI furnishes technical traders with signals about bullish and bearish price momentum, and it is in many cases plotted underneath the graph of an asset's price.
## FAQ
### What Is a RSI Buy Signal?
A few traders will look at it as a "buy signal" assuming that a security's RSI perusing moves below 30, based on the possibility that the security has been oversold and is in this manner ready for a rebound. Be that as it may, the unwavering quality of this signal will depend in part on the overall setting. On the off chance that the security is trapped in a huge downtrend, it could keep trading at an oversold level for a long while. Traders in that situation could postpone buying until they see other confirmatory signals.
### What Does the Relative Strength Index (RSI) Measure?
The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is a measurement utilized by traders to survey the price momentum of a stock or other security. The essential thought behind the RSI is to measure how rapidly traders are bidding the price of the security up or down. The RSI plots this outcome on a scale of 0 to 100. Readings below 30 generally demonstrate that the stock is oversold, while readings over 70 show that it is overbought. Traders will frequently place this RSI chart below the price chart for the security, so they can compare its recent momentum against its market price.
### What Is the Difference Between the RSI and Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD)?
RSI and moving average convergence divergence (MACD) are the two measurements that look to assist traders with figuring out a security's recent trading activity, however they achieve this goal in various ways. Fundamentally, the MACD works by smoothing out the security's recent price movements and contrasting that medium-term trend line with another trend line showing its later price changes. Traders can then base their buy and sell choices on whether the short-term trend line transcends or below the medium-term trend line.
