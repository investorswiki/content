### Perils Insurance

A named perils insurance contract just covers the perils specifically stipulated in the policy. For instance, an insurance contract could determine that losses brought about by fire or vandalism will be covered. Subsequently, an insured who encounters a loss or damage brought about by a flood can't file a claim to their insurance provider, as a flood isn't named as a peril under the insurance coverage. Under a named perils policy, the [burden of proof](/burden-proof) is on the insured.

### All Risks

Paradoxically, an all risks policy covers the insured from all perils, with the exception of those specifically excluded from the rundown. In opposition to a named perils contract, an all-risks policy doesn't name the risks covered, yet all things being equal, names the risks not covered. In this manner, any peril not named in the policy is automatically covered.

## Special Considerations

The most common types of perils excluded from all risks incorporate tremor, war, government seizure or destruction, wear and tear, pervasion, pollution, nuclear hazard, market loss, and so on.

An individual or business who requires coverage for any excluded event under all risks might have the option to pay an extra premium, known as a rider or floater, to have the peril remembered for the contract.
