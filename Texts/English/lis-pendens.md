## What Is a Lis Pendens?

A lis pendens is an official notice to the public that a claim including a claim on a property has been filed. Lis pendens is associated with the concept that a buyer of a property must expect any litigation that exists relating to the property. On the off chance that a bank is suing the owner of a great deal and another buyer purchases the parcel, then, at that point, the new owner must face the claim; sale of the property doesn't keep the offended party from seeking change by means of litigation. It can address a [contingent liability](/contingentliability).

## How Lis Pendens Work

Lis pendens is in a real sense deciphered from Latin as "a suit pending." This condition can adversely influence the sale price or possibility of a sale since any pending litigations are regularly unfavorable for the owner. The term is commonly abbreviated "lis pend."

Lis pendens must be filed in the event that a claim is connected explicitly to the property. By filing a lis pendens, an individual or entity is protecting its claim to the title pending the outcome of the claim. A lis pendens is just lifted once the claim has been settled. Since pending litigation can require months and now and again years, buyers are frequently instructed to remain clear regarding these properties.

## At the point when a Lis Pendens Is Used

Lis pendens is many times filed in divorce situations where the distribution of [real estate](/realestate) properties has not been settled. It is especially considered normal in situations where a property is listed for the sake of one spouse, and the other spouse looks for a portion of the asset. The spouse whose name is on the title would struggle with selling the property under pending litigation.

Lis pendens is quite often utilized by lenders who have filed a [notice of default](/notice-of-default) on a delinquent borrower.

For instance, on the off chance that buyer An and a seller go into a contract for the sale of a home and the seller chooses to sell the home to buyer B, buyer A may sue the seller to uphold the sale. The buyer can file a lis pendens, making it challenging for the seller to sell the house as a matter of fact. Assuming buyer B proceeds with the purchase and the courts determine that buyer An is entitled to implement the sale, buyer B loses the property to buyer An and must go to the seller to get their money back.
