# Non-Renounceable Rights
## What Are Non-Renounceable Rights?

A non-renounceable rights issue alludes to an offer issued by a corporation to shareholders to purchase more shares of the corporation (normally at a discount).

Dissimilar to a [renounceable right](/renounceablerights), a non-renounceable right isn't transferable, and in this way can't be bought or sold.

## Figuring out Non-Renounceable Rights

Giving more shares weakens the value of outstanding stock. But since the rights issue permits existing shareholders to buy the recently issued stock at a discount, they are compensated for the looming share [dilution](/dilution). The compensation the rights issue gives them is equivalent to the cost of share dilution. Be that as it may, shareholders who don't take exercise the rights by buying the discounted stock will lose money as their existing holdings will experience the ill effects of the dilution.

### Renounceable Rights

A renounceable right is likewise an invitation to a company's existing shareholders to buy extra new [shares](/shares) in the company. While shareholders have the authority to buy more shares, they can revoke that privilege and trade their rights on the open market.

## Why Companies Offer Non-Renounceable Rights

Notwithstanding what action the existing shareholders take, the company will continue with giving more stock.

A company could offer non-renounceable rights on shares on the off chance that there's a time span and capital objective the business needs to meet. It might have to raise funds for an acquisition, extend its operations through hiring or adding new areas, paying back obligations, or quite a few things. The company may be facing bankruptcy in the event that it doesn't address its capital conditions.

In the event that the company must raise capital to keep up with its possibilities as a going concern, it very well may be important to issue shares no matter what the expected dilution to existing shares. Non-renounceable rights are a way for the company to allow existing shareholders the opportunity to keep up with their stake in the business while controlling the space accessible to them to make the most of the discounts. For shareholders, this should be visible as a not exactly helpful option than being offered rights they might possibly sell on the market and see returns for themselves.
