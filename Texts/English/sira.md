# Securities Industry Regulatory Authority (SIRA)
## What Was the Securities Industry Regulatory Authority (SIRA)?

The Securities Industry Regulatory Authority (SIRA), presently called the [Financial Industry Regulatory Authority](/finra) (FINRA), was the name of a body that combined the regulatory units of the [National Association of Securities Dealers](/nasd) (NASD) and New York Stock Exchange (NYSE). The SIRA was shaped to oversee business rehearses between securities brokers and the investing public, directing the two its individuals and the affiliated market.

## How the SIRA Worked

SIRA's foundations as a [self-regulatory organization](/sro) (SRO) should be visible in the regulatory auxiliaries of both the NASD and the NYSE. The aim of combining the two independent regulators was to dispose of duplicative capabilities and rule irregularities, as well as to reduce the cost failures of the two independent SROs. The SIRA was dropped for FINRA in 2007.

However the regulatory oversight job of SIRA proceeds right up 'til now under the name FINRA, the SIRA name was especially brief â€” around three weeks altogether. After the new name was publicized in sneak peaks, the regulatory authority was made mindful that the name "SIRA" could "make confusion, or could even be viewed as offensive by some, in light of its similitude to an Arabic term used to allude to the traditional life stories of Muhammad," as per an announcement made by then-NASD Chair and CEO Mary Schapiro.

"Sirah," which alludes to historical texts about Muhammad, provoked the NASD and NYSE to rethink the name over worries that it very well may be perceived as socially unfeeling.

## Special Considerations

The NASD had its beginning in 1939 in response to the presentation of [Securities and Exchange Commission](/sec) (SEC) rules that considered the creation of self-regulatory organizations. The rise of modern self-regulatory organizations like SIRA (and FINRA) should be visible in the adoption of electronic trading systems like the NASD's send off of the National Association of Securities Dealers Automated Quotations (NASDAQ) stock market in 1971.

In 1998, the NASD and AMEX stock markets merged, trailed by the NASDAQ splitting off from the NASD in 2000. In 2007, the SEC backed another SRO to succeed the NASD. SIRA/FINRA was made with the converging of the NASD's regulatory arm with the enforcement, arbitration, and part regulation units of the NYSE. FINRA announced the initiation of operations on July 30, 2007. It is the biggest non-governmental regulatory organization for securities brokers and dealers in the United States.

SIRA presently alludes to the Government of Dubai's security industry regulator, the Security Industry Regulatory Agency, which was sent off in 2017 to administer cybersecurity and other safety issues.
