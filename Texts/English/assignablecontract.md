## What Is an Assignable Contract?

An assignable contract is a provision permitting the holder of a contract to transfer or offer the obligations and rights of the contract to one more party or person before the contract's expiration date. The assignee would be qualified for take delivery of the [underlying asset](/underlying-asset) and receive the benefits of that contract before its all expiry. Be that as it may, the assignee must likewise satisfy any obligations or requirements of the contract.

Assignability might be found in certain options and futures contracts. There are likewise assignable contracts in the real estate market that permit the transfer of property.

## Grasping Assignable Contracts

Assignable contracts give a way to current contract holders to close out their position, securing in profits or cutting losses, before the expiration date of the contract. Holders might assign their contracts on the off chance that the current market price for the underlying asset permits them to realize a profit.

As referenced before, not all contracts have an assignment provision, which is contained in the contract's terms. Likewise, an assignment doesn't generally remove the assignor's risk and [liability](/liability), on the grounds that the original contract could require a guarantee that — regardless of whether assigned — the performance of all terms of the contract must be completed as required.

## Assignment of a Futures Contract

Proprietors of assignable [futures contracts](/futurescontract) may opt to assign their holdings as opposed to selling them in the open market through an exchange. A futures contract is an obligation expressing a buyer must purchase an asset, or a seller must sell an asset at a preset price and a foreordained date from now on.

Futures are normalized contracts with fixed prices, amounts, and expiration dates. Investors can utilize futures to conjecture on the price of an asset like crude oil. At expiration, examiners will book an offsetting trade and realize a gain or loss from the difference in the two contract amounts.

Assuming an investor holds a futures contract and the holder finds that the security has valued by 1% prior to the closing of the contract, then the contract holder might choose to assign the contract to a [third party](/outsider) for the valued amount. The initial holder would be paid in cash, realizing the profit from the contract before its expiration date. Notwithstanding, a buyer of an assigned contract can assume a loss by paying an above-market price and risk overpaying for the asset.

Most futures contracts don't have an assignment provision. In the event that you are interested in buying or selling a contract, make a point to carefully check its terms and conditions to check whether it is assignable or not. A few contracts might forbid assignment while different contracts might require the other party in the contract to consent to the assignment.

> It's important to note that an assignment might be void assuming the terms of the contract change substantially or disregard any laws or public policy.

## Factors in the Futures Market

A futures contract may be assigned on the off chance that there was an above-market offer from the outsider in a [illiquid](/illiquid) market where bid and ask spreads were wide. The bid-ask spread is the difference between the buy and sell prices. The spreads can be wide significance there's an extra cost being added to the prices since there's insufficient product to fulfill the order at a reasonable price.

Liquidity exists when there are an adequate number of buyers and sellers in the market to execute business. In the event that the market is illiquid, a holder probably won't have the option to track down a buyer for the contract, or there may be a postpone in unwinding the position.

An investor hoping to buy the futures contract could offer an amount higher than the current market price in an illiquid environment. Thus, the current contract holder can assign the contract and realize a profit, and the two players benefit. Nonetheless, unwinding or selling the contract outright is the cleaner solution, and it likewise guarantees that all liabilities concerning the contract's obligations are released.

## Unwinding Futures Contracts

In any case, holders of futures contracts don't have to assign the contract to another investor when they can unwind or close the position through a futures exchange. The exchange, or its [clearing](/clearing) agent, would handle the clearing and payment capabilities. All in all, the futures contract can be closed before its expiration. The holder would bring about any gains or loss depending on the difference between the purchase and sale prices.

By August, the price of crude oil has risen to $60, and the investor chooses to assign the contract to another buyer in light of the fact that the buyer was able to pay $65 or $5 above market. The contract is assigned to the second buyer for $65, and the original buyer procures a profit of $25,000 (($65-$40) x 1000).

The new holder takes on all obligations of the contract and can profit assuming that crude oil is trading above $65 by year-end, yet additionally can lose assuming that the oil trades below $65 by year-end.
