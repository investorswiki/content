# Fibonacci Channel
## What Is a Fibonacci Channel?

The Fibonacci channel is a technical analysis device that is utilized to estimate support and resistance levels in view of the [Fibonacci numbers](/fibonaccilines). It is a variation of the [Fibonacci retracement](/fibonacciretracement) device, besides with the channel the lines run diagonally as opposed to on a level plane.

## Figuring out Fibonacci Channels

To draw a Fibonacci channel, the trader must initially determine the [trend](/trend) course. The Fibonacci channel can be applied to both short-term and long-term trends, as well as to uptrends and downtrends. Lines are drawn at 23.6%, 38.2%, half, 61.8%, 78.6%, 100%, and the [extension levels](/fibonacciextensions) of 161.8%, 200%, 261.8%, 361.8%, and 423.6%, at the watchfulness of the trader.

A Fibonacci channel doesn't need a formula. The channels are drawn at certain percentages of the price move chosen by the trader.

1. In a [uptrend](/uptrend), select a starting point (a low) and afterward another higher swing low. These make the zero-line, since this is where the channels start from. This line makes the point of the channels. Any remaining lines are drawn parallel to this line.
1. Likewise, select the swing in the middle of between the two lows.
1. The distance between the low point and high point is 100%. The 100% line will reach out to the right at a similar point as the drawn zero-line.
1. The distance between the starting point and the high is utilized to make the extra percentage levels. On the off chance that the distance is $1, the 161.8% level will begin at $1.62 over the starting point, and afterward start calculating vertical at a similar point as the drawn zero-line. A similar concept applies to the wide range of various percentages.

Similar concepts apply to a [downtrend](/downtrend).

1. Select a starting point (a high) and afterward another lower swing high. These make the zero-line.
1. Select the swing in the middle of between the two highs.
1. The distance between the high point and low point is 100%. The 100% line will stretch out to the right at a similar point as the drawn zero-line.
1. The distance between the starting point and the low is utilized to make the extra percentage levels. In the event that the distance is one $1, the 38.2% level will begin at $0.38 below the starting point, and afterward start calculating lower at a similar point as the drawn zero-line. A similar concept applies to the wide range of various percentages.

Traders can make Fibonacci channels on most major charting software platforms, albeit the implementation of them is subjective since traders have prudence on which highs and lows to use for drawing their Fibonacci channels.

### How the Tool Is Used

The apparatus is utilized to aid in distinguishing where support and resistance might foster from here on out. If the uptrend is expected to proceed, the 100%, 161.8%, and other higher levels are potential [price targets](/pricetarget). A similar concept applies to downtrends if a downtrend is expected to proceed.

In an uptrend, the zero-line resembles a normal [trendline](/trendline), assisting with surveying the overall trend heading. Assuming the price falls below it, it might should be adjusted in light of later price action, or it could signal that the uptrend is finished and that the price is breaking lower.

In a downtrend, the zero-line likewise acts like a trendline. At the point when the price is below it, it affirms the downtrend. In the event that the price moves above it, the indicator might should be redrawn or the price is moving higher out of its downtrend.

A price that moves to the 161.8% level, or greater, is showing that the current trend is speeding up, as it is taking greater actions than it did when the indicator was drawn. In the event that the price action is generally contained between the zero-line and the 100% level, the trend has about a similar strength as it did when the indicator was drawn. Assuming the price begins neglecting to arrive at the 100% line, and travels through the zero-line, these are the two indications that the current trend has slowed and might be turning around.

## Fibonacci Channel versus Andrew's Pitchfork

Both these indicators endeavor to foresee future support and resistance levels in view of price levels from the past. Fibonacci channels endeavor to do this with percentages of a chose price move. Those percentages are then projected out into what's in store. [Andrew's Pitchfork](/andrewspitchfork) is easier somehow or another as the calculated lines depend on three price levels chosen by the trader and afterward extended out into what's to come.

## Limitations of Using Fibonacci Channels

While different Fibonacci levels and indicators can be added to a chart, they can rapidly mess it. As each price wave forms, another Fibonacci channel will give new data..

Fibonacci channels are highly subjective. The trader picks three points they consider to be critical, yet the market may not see these points as huge and consequently may not respect or respond true to form to the drawn levels.

One of the grievances with Fibonacci analysis, as a rule, particularly on short-term charts, is that there are such countless levels that the price is probably going to reverse at or arrive at one of the levels. The problem is realizing which level will be important in advance.

Therefore, traders are urged to utilize different forms of analysis, for example, [price action](/price-action) and other technical or [fundamental](/fundamentalanalysis) indicators, to aid in their trading choices.

## Highlights
- When the Fibonacci channel has been recognized, the diagonal lines demonstrate future areas of support and resistance.
- A Fibonacci channel gives a similar retracement and extension levels as the Fibonacci retracement and extension instruments.
- With a Fibonacci channel, the lines are diagonal and run parallel to two chose highs in a downtrend, or two chose lows in an uptrend.
