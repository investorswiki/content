# Qualified Production Activities Income (QPAI)
## What Is the Qualified Production Activities Income?

Qualified Production Activities Income (QPAI) is the portion of income derived from domestic manufacturing and production that fits the bill for reduced taxation. All the more explicitly, qualified production activities income is the difference between the producer's domestic gross receipts and aggregate cost of goods and services connected with creating domestic goods. The tax-deductibility of QPAI is planned to reward manufacturers for creating goods domestically rather than overseas.

## Figuring out Qualified Production Activities Income (QPAI)

Section 199 of the Internal Revenue Code (IRC) commands that Qualified Production Activities Income (QPAI) be taxed at a lower rate. QPAI alludes to certain income connected with manufacturing that is equivalent to the excess of the business taxpayer's domestic production [gross receipts](/gross-receipts) (DPGR) over the sum of the cost of goods that are allocable to such receipts, and different expenses, losses, or [deductions](/deduction) which are appropriately allocable to such receipts. Domestic production gross receipts (DPGR) are gross receipts from the assembling, production, growth, or extraction of qualifying production property. A company that generates QPAI in a qualifying tax year meets all requirements for the [domestic production activities deduction](/domestic-production-activities-deduction) (DPAD).

U.S.- based business' allowable DPAD generally can't be over 9% of its QPAI. A taxpayer with oil-related QPAI likewise must reduce the DPAD by 3% of the least of the following sums - Oil-related QPAI, QPAI, and [adjusted gross income](/agi) for an individual, estate, or trust (taxable income for any remaining taxpayers) figured without DPAD. Likewise, the deduction is limited to half of the [W-2 wages](/w2form) paid by the taxpayer during the calendar year that closures with (or within) the tax year. An employer that paid no Form W-2 wages (or have Form W-2 wages allocated to him/her on a [Schedule K-1](/schedule-k-1)), can't claim a DPAD. The DPAD was in effect for small and large U.S.- based business activities between 2005 and 2017 and expired on December 31, 2017.

IRC Section 199 characterizes qualified production activities to include:

- Manufacturing conducted in the U.S.
- Selling, leasing, or licensing films that have been created somewhere around half in the U.S.
- Construction projects in the U.S., including building and renovation of residential and commercial properties
- Engineering and compositional services connecting with a U.S.- based construction project
- Software development in the U.S., including the development of video games

QPAI will be equivalent to [gross income](/grossincome) for a business that participates in just a single line of business, yet businesses with different lines of businesses must distribute their incomes.

Individuals, corporations, cooperatives, estates, and trusts use IRS Form 8903 to figure their allowable qualified production activities income. QPAI and Form W-2 wages are figured by just taking into account things that are inferable from the genuine conduct of a trade or business. QPAI does exclude revenue generated from the restaurant industry, power or natural gas distribution, or real estate transactions.
