# Greenspan Put
## What Is Greenspan Put?

Greenspan put was the moniker given to the policies executed by [Alan Greenspan](/alangreenspan) during his tenure as Federal Reserve (Fed) Chair. The Greenspan-drove Fed was very proactive in stopping extreme stock market declines, going about as a form of insurance against losses, like a customary [put option](/putoption).

## Grasping Greenspan Put

Greenspan was chair of the [Federal Reserve](/federalreservebank) (Fed) from 1987 to 2006. All through his tenure, he tried to support the U.S. economy by actively utilizing the [federal funds rate](/federalfundsrate) and different policies in the Fed's weapons store to float the markets, particularly stock markets.

Basically, the Greenspan put is a type of a Fed put. The term "Fed put," a play on the option term "put," is the market conviction that the Fed would step in and execute policies to limit the [stock market's](/stockmarket) decline past a certain threshold. During Greenspan's tenure, it was widely accepted that a stock market decline of more than 20%, which commonly indicates a [bear market](/bearmarket), would incite the Fed to bring down the fed funds rate. This was viewed as insurance and mollified the feelings of dread of investors that an extended, and expensive, market decline would happen.

An outcome of Greenspan's policies was that investors were more inclined to extreme risk-taking in stock markets, leading to market [bubbles](/bubble), which, on occasion, brought about more market volatility. Experienced investors, expecting to buy protection from the actions of [short-sellers](/shortselling), examiners, etc, depended on the reliable trading strategy of buying put options to safeguard their portfolios from exorbitant market declines encouraged by the inevitable blasting of these market bubbles.

### Put Protection

A put can be used in a trading strategy of hedging against price risk and has been utilized by traders to offset unwanted market volatility that could adversely influence their [portfolios](/portfolio). This strategy could assist investors with moderating losses and possibly profit, while as yet holding on to their stock positions.

For instance, as internet stocks fell definitely in price from 2000 to 2002, a few investors profited powerfully by conveying this strategy. In practice, the thought could have pushed the idea that in the event that you bought an internet stock, and it decisively rose in price north of a couple of months, then, at that point, to preserve your gains, you would buy a put option with several months' duration to safeguard those shares.

In any case, the moniker Greenspan put contrasts from the traditional put option strategy in that there is definitely not a specific investing or trading methodology. Rather, it is the generalized idea of a commitment, that has never been formally confirmed, that the Greenspan-drove Fed would be very proactive in stopping unnecessary stock market declines.

Some have suggested that a potentially negative side-effect of Greenspan put was to make put option derivative strategies profitable, particularly in times encompassing a crisis. The chart below appears to give some historical support for why investors held that thought.

This chart shows how, beginning in 1997, average [implied volatility](/iv) started to rise and stayed raised through 2004. Since the phrase Greenspan put was all the more vigorously referred to in the late 1990s, it appears to be rational that investors and traders would hold this discernment from that time forward. Nonetheless, the fundamental factors that relate to Greenspan's philosophy for how the Fed ought to achieve its stated objectives similarly add to the utilization of this phrase.

## Greenspan's Actions

One of Greenspan's most memorable significant acts as chair happened following the 1987 stock market crash. He promptly brought rates down to assist companies with recuperating from the crisis and set a precedent that the Fed would mediate in times of crisis.

This assumption of intervention and support from the Fed induced risk-taking that made trading and investing, by and large, more alluring. As [valuations](/valuation) rose past conspicuously acceptable reaches, professional investors were less able to rationalize whether it was a steady decision to take part in certain stocks â€” particularly internet-related stocks, which were blasting.

In this environment, stock prices could make wild changes, making put options an always famous insurance to investors. The inflated valuations and rising prices made it hard for seasoned investors to buy stocks disregarding [put-option protection](/defensive put).

In the mid 1990s, Greenspan established a series of rate diminishes going on until roughly 1993. Through Greenspan's tenure, there were likewise several examples where the Fed mediated to support excessive risk-taking in the stock market, including market-moving occasions, for example, the savings and loan crisis, Gulf War, Mexican crisis, Asian financial crisis, [Long-Term Capital Management](/longtermcapital) (LTCM) crisis, [Y2K](/y2k), and, particularly, the blasting of the [dotcom bubble](/dotcom-bubble) following the market's top in 2000.

Generally speaking, the Greenspan put introduced a time that empowered risk-taking since it was expected that the Fed would be implicitly giving insurance against inordinate market declines, similar as a customary put option would do.

Greenspan most frequently involved a reduction in [interest rates](/interestrate) to stem market declines. The chart above shows the general downward trend of the federal funds target rate through Greenspan's experience as chair. The effects of the Fed's rate reductions helped and urged investors to borrow funds all the more efficiently to invest in the securities market, which added to an environment of risk-taking.

## 'Fed Puts' Post Greenspan

On February 1, 2006, [Ben Bernanke](/benbernanke) supplanted Greenspan as the [Federal Reserve Board](/frb) (FRB) Chair. Bernanke followed a comparable strategy to Greenspan in 2007 and 2008. The combination of rate reduction timing carried out by Greenspan and Bernanke has been generally credited to supporting over the top risk-taking in the financial markets, which many accept to have been a catalyst adding to the conditions of the 2008 financial crisis.

Nonetheless, as the chart below shows, in the decade that followed the financial crisis, the consequences of such policies are not so clearly seen as empowering unnecessary risk. Similar policies executed by Greenspan and Bernanke proceeded, in measured degree, with subsequent chairs Janet Yellen and Jerome Powell. As the chart shows, the historical outcomes after 2008 demonstrated, on average, substantially less volatility in both stock and option prices than the decade that went before it.
