# Kanban
## What Is Kanban?

Kanban is an inventory control system utilized in [just-in-time](/jit) (JIT) manufacturing. It was developed by Taiichi Ohno, an industrial engineer at Toyota, and takes its name from the hued cards that track production and order new shipments of parts or materials as they run out. Kanban is the Japanese word for sign, so the kanban system basically means to utilize visual prompts to incite the action expected to keep a cycle flowing.

## Understanding Kanban

The kanban system can be considered a signal and response system. At the point when a thing is running low at an operational station, there will be a visual signal specifying the amount to order from the supply. The person using the parts makes the order for the quantity indicated by the kanban and the provider gives the specific amount mentioned.

For instance, on the off chance that a worker is bagging product on a transport line, a kanban might be set in the stack over the last 10 bags. At the point when the worker gets to the card, he gives the floor runner the card to bring more bags. A station further from the supply room could have the kanban set at 15 bags and a nearer one at five. The flow of bags and the placement of cards are adjusted to ensure no station is left sack less while the belt is running.

The kanban system can be utilized effectively within a factory, yet it can likewise be applied to purchasing [inventory](/inventory) from outer providers. The kanban system makes extraordinary visibility to the two providers and purchasers. One of its main objectives is to limit the development of excess inventory anytime on the production line. Limits on the number of things waiting at supply points are laid out and afterward diminished as inefficiencies are recognized and eliminated. Whenever a limit of inventory is surpassed, it points to an inefficiency that should be tended to.

As containers of parts or materials are exhausted, cards show up, variety coded in order of priority, allowing the production and delivery of more before a hold-up or shortage creates. A two-card system is frequently utilized. T-kanban transportation cards approve the movement of containers to the next workstation on the production line, while P-kanban production cards approve the workstation to deliver a fixed amount of products and order parts or materials whenever they have been sold or utilized.

## Electronic Kanban Systems

To empower real-time demand signaling across the [supply chain](/supplychain), electronic kanban systems have become far and wide. These e-kanban systems can be integrated into [enterprise resource planning](/erp) (ERP) systems.

Toyota, Ford Motor Company and Bombardier Aerospace are among the manufacturers that utilization e-kanban systems. These electronic systems actually give visual signals, however the systems are additionally typically empowered to robotize parts of the interaction, for example, transport through the factory or even filing purchase orders.
