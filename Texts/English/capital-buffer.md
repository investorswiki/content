# Capital Buffer
## What Is a Capital Buffer?

A capital buffer is mandatory capital that financial institutions are required to hold notwithstanding other least [capital requirements](/capitalrequirement). Regulations targeting the creation of adequate capital buffers are intended to reduce the procyclical idea of lending by advancing the creation of countercyclical buffers as set forward in the [Basel III](/basell-iii) regulatory changes made by the [Basel Committee on Banking Supervision](/baselcommittee).

Note that capital buffers vary from, and may surpass the [reserve requirements](/requiredreserves) set by the central bank.

## How a Capital Buffer Works

In December 2010, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision delivered official regulatory standards to make a stronger global banking system, especially while resolving issues of [liquidity](/liquidity). Capital buffers distinguished in Basel III changes incorporate **countercyclical capital buffers**, not entirely settled by Basel Committee member wards and differ as per a percentage of [risk-weighted assets](/riskweightedassets), and **capital preservation buffers**, which are developed outside periods of [financial stress](/financial_distress).

Banks extend their lending activities during periods of [economic growth](/economicgrowth) and contract lending when the economy eases back. At the point when banks without adequate capital run into inconvenience, they can either raise more capital or cut back on lending. Assuming they cut back on lending, organizations might find financing more costly to get or not accessible.

## History of Capital Buffers

The 2007-2008 financial crisis uncovered shortcomings yet to be determined sheets of numerous financial institutions across the globe. Bank lending rehearses were risky, for example, with the issue of [subprime mortgage loans](/subprime_mortgage), while bank capital was not generally to the point of covering losses. A few financial institutions became known as[ too big to fail](/too-big-to-fail) in light of the fact that they were systemically important to the global economy.

> ### Fast Fact
> To give banks time to make adequate capital buffers, Basel Committee member wards report arranged increments 12 months ahead of time; assuming conditions permit capital buffer abatements, they occur on the double.

Failure of these key institutions would be viewed as catastrophic. This was demonstrated during the bankruptcy of [Lehman Brothers](/lehman-brothers), bringing about a 350-point drop in the [Dow Jones industrial average (DJIA)](/djia) by the Monday after the announcement. To reduce the probability of banks running into inconvenience during economic downturns, regulators started expecting banks to build up capital buffers outside periods of stress.

## Special Considerations

The countercyclical capital buffer (CCyB) structure states that foreign institutions ought to match the CCyB rate of domestic institutions while lending happens across international boundaries. This considers a cycle alluded to as recognition or response concerning the foreign openings of domestic institutions.
