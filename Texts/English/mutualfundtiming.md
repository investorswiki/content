## What Is Mutual Fund Timing?

Mutual fund timing is a legal yet frequently discouraged practice by which traders endeavor to profit from short-term differences between the price of [mutual funds](/mutualfund) and the individual securities in those funds. This is conceivable on the grounds that mutual fund prices just change one time each day.

Mutual fund timing is frequently associated with [late-day trading](/latedaytrading), when traders buy mutual fund shares at a more seasoned price after the fund's [net asset value](/nav) (NAV) has previously been recalculated. Dissimilar to late-day trading, mutual fund timing isn't really illegal, however it can hurt long-term investors by expanding the mutual fund's management costs.

## How Mutual Fund Timing Works

Mutual fund timing works in light of a key difference between mutual funds and stocks. While stock and bond prices vacillate throughout a trading day, mutual funds just update their prices one time each day, after the close of the stock market. In the United States, this is ordinarily between 4 pm and 6 pm EST.

This lag permits short-term traders to profit from swings in the stock market before they are reflected in mutual fund NAVs. Assuming a stock encounters a sharp price rise at the opening of a trading day, traders will have several hours to set buy orders for mutual funds that invest in those stocks, realizing that the funds won't recalculate their NAV until market close.

Mutual funds tend to deter timing since it builds their management costs, to the drawback of long-term investors. Most funds have rules to limit short-term trading, for example, extra redemption fees and limitations on [round-trip trading](/round-triptrades).

Rather than an investor buying into a stock straightforwardly for immediate ownership, mutual fund managers must scatter invested capital across a portfolio of investments. In similar respect, mutual fund managers must sell against the fund to accommodate [redemptions](/redemption) in cash to shareholders.

Mutual fund timing, consequently, adversely affects a fund's long-term investors, since the processing of short-term transactions increments transaction costs, causing higher operational expenses.

To moderate mutual fund timing and its additional costs, most mutual funds impose a short-term trading penalty, known as a [redemption fee](/redemptionfee). Redemption fees are charged upon the sale of shares that are not held for a base period of time, which can go from 30 days to six months. They may likewise charge a short-term trading fee for selling shares too soon.
