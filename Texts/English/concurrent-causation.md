# Concurrent Causation
## What Is Concurrent Causation?

Concurrent causation is a method utilized in insurance claims for dealing with losses or damages that happen from more than one reason. The underlying foundations of concurrent causation stem from court rulings and feelings, which form a collection of legal precedent, which becomes helpful when parties in a dispute require the decision of a court.

In insurance, concurrent causation happens when a property encounters a loss from two separate causes when one has policy coverage, and different doesn't. Contingent upon the specific circumstances, the type of policy in effect, and the state court in which conflicts will be heard, the damages from the two causes are probably going to be covered. Concurrent causation may likewise be a factor in liability insurance policies.

## Grasping Concurrent Causation

With a concurrent causation loss, the events that cause the loss might happen in a steady progression or be simultaneous events. Today, most insurance policies will incorporate an enemy of concurrent causation (ACC) provision.

Concurrent causation legal precedents came about because of California's lower court decisions during the 1980s. These courts decided that claims for damages from concurrent events were substantial. The judgment said in the event that a covered hazard added to the losses from an excluded risk, the whole loss is claimable by the policyholder. For instance, an earthquake causes a split in the foundation of a home, and a fire starts from a candle that fell onto the floor during the shaking. The property has a policy covering fire damage yet prohibits damage from an earthquake. As per the court's ruling, the whole claim is legitimate.

## Model

A concurrent causation model could be the point at which a typhoon hits a commercial warehouse. Strong breezes make damage structures while the heavy rain causes flooding. The door leading into the warehouse lobby is blown open by high breezes. Floodwaters further damaged the floor of the front lobby.

It is difficult to separate the damage brought about by the flood from the damage brought about by wind. The building has a [commercial property policy](/commercial-property-insurance) which covers damage from twist yet prohibits damage from floodwaters. Under concurrent causation, coverage benefits will be due to the policyholder.

## Insurance Policies Adapt to Concurrent Causation

Insurance providers couldn't help contradicting this view, claiming the ruling increased their liability and cost. Likewise, they contended, the decision overlooked the existing exclusion provisions. In response, the Insurance Services Office (ISO) and commercial insurers modified the phrasing in homeowners and commercial property policies, adding hostile to concurrent causation.

The additional enemy of concurrent causation phrasing would bar damages from listed perils even on the off chance that a second, covered peril contributed to the damages. Likewise, the exclusion applies whether the two hazards occur simultaneously or one happened in sequence. Numerous commercial property policies accordingly apply against concurrent causation language to specific exclusions, including law and ordinance, earth movement, government action, nuclear hazard, utility services, water, flood, organism, and shape.

Not all state courts will apply concurrent causation. All things considered, they figure out which peril was the general or transcendent reason for a loss. Getting back to our warehouse model, on the off chance that the court concludes the general reason was the breeze, the damage ought to be covered.

The doctrine of concurrent causation applies principally to a [all-risk policy](/all-risks-coverage), which covers a more extensive scope of perils than a [named perils policy](/named_perils). Named perils policy covers losses from just those perils listed in the policy. In any case, a named perils policy might in any case contain phrasing for hostile to concurrent causation.

## Concurrent Causation and Liability Insurance

[Liability insurance](/liability_insurance) safeguards against claims coming about because of wounds and damage to individuals and property and pays legal costs and pronounced payouts for events where the policyholder is found legally responsible. A few grumblings might have at least two actions by the policyholder, which, without anyone else, make them at risk. Even on the off chance that the insurance policy does exclude coverage for the policyholder's all's actions, the insurance provider must in any case safeguard the whole claim.

## Highlights
- Concurrent causation alludes to distinguishing a loss that outcomes from various causes; for example, a windstorm that causes rooftop damage that likewise prompts rainwater damage, which thusly, causes shape.
- Numerous insurance policies today contain against concurrent causation (ACC) provisions that safeguard an insurer from paying out a similar claim at least a couple of times, however which can be unfavorable to certain policyholders.
- While common in property and casualty policies, ACC provisos are likewise found in liability insurance policies.
