# Labor Productivity
## What Is Labor Productivity?

Labor productivity measures the hourly output of a country's economy. In particular, it charts the amount of real gross domestic product (GDP) created by an hour of labor. Growth in labor productivity relies upon three primary factors: saving and investment in [physical capital,](/physical-capital) new technology, and human capital.

## Figuring out Labor Productivity

Labor productivity, otherwise called workforce productivity, is defined as real economic output each labor hour. Growth in labor productivity is measured by the change in economic output each labor hour over a defined period. Labor productivity ought not be mistaken for employee productivity, which is a measure of an individual worker's output.

## Step by step instructions to Calculate Labor Productivity

To compute a country's labor productivity, you would separate the total output by the total number of labor hours.

For instance, assume the real GDP of an economy is $10 trillion and the aggregate hours of labor in the country is 300 billion. The labor productivity would be $10 trillion isolated by 300 billion, approaching about $33 each labor hour. Assuming the real GDP of a similar economy develops to $20 trillion the next year and its labor hours increase to 350 billion, the economy's growth in labor productivity would be 72 percent.

The growth number is derived by partitioning the new real GDP of $57 by the previous real GDP of $33. Growth in this labor productivity number can at times be deciphered as improved [standards of living](/way of life) in the country, expecting it stays up with labor's share of total income.

## The Importance of Measuring Labor Productivity

Labor productivity is directly linked to further developed standards of living as higher consumption. As an economy's labor productivity develops, it delivers more goods and services for a similar amount of relative work. This increase in output makes it conceivable to consume a greater amount of the goods and services at an undeniably reasonable cost.

Growth in labor productivity is directly owing to changes in physical capital, new technology, and human capital. Assuming labor productivity is developing, it can for the most part be followed back to growth in one of these three areas. Physical capital is the instruments, equipment, and facilities that workers have accessible to use to create goods. New advancements are new methods to join contributions to deliver more output, for example, assembly lines or automation. Human capital addresses the increase in education and [specialization](/specialization) of the workforce. Measuring labor productivity gives an estimate of the combined effects of these underlying trends.

Labor productivity can likewise demonstrate short-term and cyclical changes in an economy, conceivably even [turnaround](/turnaround). Assuming the output is expanding while labor hours stays static, it flags that the labor force has become more productive. Notwithstanding the three traditional factors framed over, this is additionally seen during economic [recessions](/downturn), as workers increase their labor exertion when unemployment rises and the threat of lay-offs weavers try not to lose their positions.

## Policies to Improve Labor Productivity

There are a number of ways that governments and companies can further develop labor productivity.

- **Investment in physical capital**: Increasing the investment in capital goods including [infrastructure](/infrastructure) from governments and the private sector can help productivity while bringing down the cost of carrying on with work.
- **Nature of education and training**: Offering opportunities for workers to upgrade their skills, and offering education and training at an affordable cost, assist with raising a company's and an economy's productivity.
- **Mechanical progress**: Developing new advances, including hard technology like computerization or advanced mechanics and soft advances like new methods of coordinating a business or supportive of [free market](/freemarket) reforms in government policy can improve worker productivity.

## Features
- Labor productivity measures output each labor hour.
- Labor productivity is generally driven by investment in capital, mechanical progress, and human capital development.
- Business and government can increase labor productivity of workers by direct investing in or making incentives for increases in technology and human or physical capital.
