## What Is For Valuation Only (FVO)

For Valuation Only (FVO) is a documentation remembered for a [nominal quotation](/nominalquotation) for a security. Market makers use FVO quotes to assist with laying out the value of a security. At the point when a FVO documentation shows up in front of a price quote, it means the quote is only for educational purposes, and not an offer from the responsible party.

## Figuring out For Valuation Only (FVO)

For Valuation Only (FVO) will show up as a documentation in a nominal security price quote as a kindness to investors, demonstrating that it's anything but an invitation to trade. Such nominal quotations will incorporate either FVO or FYI.

The purpose of a nominal quote is to permit a trader to value a current holding where it could be generally hard to lay out a current benchmark, and to show a price for enlightening purposes without committing a broker to enter a trade. Such quotes are useful in deciding a margin position, giving data important to decide the current value of a specific asset, yet don't act as invitations to trade. Nominal quotes contrast from [firm quotes](/firmquote), which are invitations to trade at firm prices and are not subject to cancellation.

## How Nominal Quotes and Firm Quotes Differ

Both nominal quotes and firm quotes are key apparatuses of market makers, both brokerage houses and individual delegates, whose purpose is to empower the smooth flow of financial markets. Since broker-sellers and market makers handle orders for their customers as well concerning their own accounts, they should follow [Securities and Exchange Commission](/sec) rules about distributing quotes and dealing with customer orders, under the [Securities Exchange Act of 1934](/seact1934).

Under these rules, when a broker distributes a firm quote, it is non-negotiable, and the broker is obliged to execute orders at the distributed price. Any broker who neglects to respect the quoted bid is in violation of industry regulations. This violation is known as [backing away](/backingaway).

The FVO documentation permits a trader to give valuation data in a nominal quote while abiding by SEC rules. Brokers commenting on a securities price with FVO guarantee that all gatherings comprehend the quote has been given out of kindness and doesn't address an invitation to trade.

For instance, a FVO nominal quote might be introduced when a trader considers purchasing a contract on a futures exchange, just to find that no market maker has put out a firm bid and consequently a price for the contract has not been laid out for a long period of time. In that case, the trader could request a nominal quotation to get a sense for what market makers could offer under current conditions before choosing whether or not to seek after an actual contract. Such a quotation would fundamentally be commented on FVO or FYI.

With regards to a nominal quote, FVO ought not be mistaken for Fair Value Option, which alludes to an accounting device for surveying the values of the financial instruments of a business.
