## What Is Ba3/BB-?

Ba3/BB-is the bond rate given to debt instruments that are generally viewed as speculative in nature. Ba3 is a long-term bond rating given by the [Moody's](/moodys) credit rating service, while BB-is the parallel rating gave by both the [Standard and Poor's](/sp) and [Fitch](/fitch-ratings) rating services.

## Ba3/BB-Explained

The [credit rating](/creditrating) given to fixed income securities gives a measure of the riskiness of the security and the probability of the issuer defaulting on the debt. The bond credit rating addresses the creditworthiness of corporate or government bonds. Risk-unwilling investors searching for safe bond investments to stay away from the risk of losing their principal investments might opt for government bonds or for investment grade corporate bonds with AAA to Baa3/BBB-ratings.

Bonds that carry a higher risk than investment grade bonds are alluded to as [junk bonds](/junkbond). Investors demand a higher yield for purchasing these bonds as compensation for taking on a high level of risk. Subsequently, these bonds are likewise alluded to as [high yield bonds](/high_yield_bond). Non-investment grade bonds that are towards the more stable finish of the [junk-bond](/junkbond) rating range, are ordinarily given a credit rating of Ba3/BB-by credit rating agencies Moody's, Standard and Poor's, and Fitch Ratings. Albeit this is the highest rating tier inside the high yield bond category, a Ba3/BB-rating shows a higher level of concern that deteriorating economic conditions as well as company-explicit improvements could upset the issuer's ability to meet its obligations. Ba2/BB is the rating that falls straight above Ba3/BB-, while B1/B+ falls straightforwardly below.

## Junk Bond Ratings

A Ba3/BB-credit rating shows that the bond is to some degree [speculative](/hypothesis) in nature with an exposure to risk. Bonds rated Ba3/BB-give a [yield-to-maturity](/yieldtomaturity) (YTM) or [yield-to-call](/yieldtocall) rate that is well above bonds with higher ratings, particularly those issued by the U.S. government, regions, and the biggest global corporations. In any case, investors genuinely should understand that this higher rate fills in as compensation for investing money in a company or government that may not be financially solid and may bring about the loss of one's investment.

The Ba3/BB-rating is typically settled on in the wake of breaking down certain factors at play with the responsible entity, for example, the strength of the issuer's balance sheet, ability to [service its debt](/debtservice), current business and economic conditions, and outlook on the responsible company's growth. It is possible for a corporation to be rated as investment grade quality and, after the company's statistics have been looked into after a period of time, downgraded to non-investment grade quality. In like manner, a company with a Ba3/BB-rating might be upgraded to investment grade on the off chance that the business outlook and financial statements reflect strong growth and lower risk.
