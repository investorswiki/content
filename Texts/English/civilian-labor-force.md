# Civilian Labor Force
## What Is the Civilian Labor Force?

Civilian labor force is a term used by the [Bureau of Labor Statistics](/bls) (BLS) to order the portion of the U.S. civilian population that it thinks about either employed or unemployed. Military personnel, federal government employees, retired people, debilitated or [discouraged workers](/discouraged_worker), and agricultural workers are not part of the civilian labor force.

## Understanding the Civilian Labor Force

As indicated by the BLS, the civilian labor force is comprised of two parts:

1. **Civilian workers:** This category includes all private sector, state, and nearby government workers. Workers — or "employed persons" in the language of the [Current Population Survey](/currentpopulationsurvey) — are defined as individuals 16 years of age or more seasoned who did no less than one hour of paid work (or unpaid work in their own business) in the survey's reference week, or who did no less than 15 hours of unpaid work in a family business. Active-duty military personnel, institutionalized individuals, agricultural workers, and federal government employees are excluded.
1. **Unemployed people:** This category doesn't just include any individual who lacks a job. An unemployed person must have been accessible for work during the survey's reference week (discounting transitory illness) and made "explicit endeavors" to get a new line of work during the previous a month. Individuals who might want to work but have given up due to lack of opportunities, an injury, or illness are viewed as outside the labor force.

## Unemployment Rate and Participation Rate

This definition of the labor force is in many cases in conflict with colloquial usage, leading non-specialists to feel misdirected when they understand that huge number of discouraged and crippled workers are excluded from the [unemployment rate](/unemploymentrate) — defined as the unemployed population partitioned by the civilian labor force.

The BLS offers different indicators of joblessness, the most complete being the [U-6 rate](/u6-rate), which includes individuals who are employed part-time but would incline toward full-time work, as well as discouraged and other "possibly connected" workers who have searched for a job inside the past 12 months, but not the past about a month. Pundits of the standard U-3 measure of unemployment call U-6 the "genuine unemployment rate."

The BLS likewise calculates the civilian labor force as a share of the whole civilian population (everybody 16 or more established who isn't institutionalized or on active duty). This measure, called the civilian labor force [participation rate](/participationrate), rose reliably from 58.6% toward the beginning of 1965 to a pinnacle of 67.3% toward the beginning of 2000. From that point forward it has been consistently falling, with a particularly striking drop recorded toward the beginning of 2020 — the period when lockdown measures were introduced to handle the COVID-19 outbreak.

Retirements adversely affect labor force participation rates. In recent times, the [baby boomer](/baby_boomer) generation, which fueled America's productivity during much of the 1970s and 1980s, has begun resigning, causing a drop in the labor force participation rate. Downturns and the automation of jobs likewise adversely impact the labor force participation rate.

## Features
- The civilian labor force alludes to employed or unemployed individuals, who are not active-duty military personnel, institutionalized individuals, agricultural workers, and federal government employees.
- Retired people, incapacitated and discouraged workers are likewise not part of the civilian labor force.
- The civilian labor force is viewed as misleading by certain specialists because it excludes discouraged and disabled workers.
