# Accumulation Bond
## What Is an Accumulation Bond?

An accumulation bond is a type of security that is sold at a discount, known as a [original issue discount](/oid) (OID). An OID is a discount from [par value](/parvalue) (otherwise called "face value") at the time the bond is issued. The bond will slowly return to that value over a given period of time. At the end of the day, the bondholder is only giving the responsible company less money than it has legally borrowed. In exchange, the bondholder will swear off the interest income since the bond issuer isn't required to make interest payments, which is to be expected.

An accumulation bond is so named on the grounds that the value of the bond collects over the long haul. They are otherwise called [zero-coupon bonds](/zero-couponbond) since the payment of interest (in this case, none) is known as a [coupon](/coupon).

## Understanding Accumulation Bonds

Accumulation bonds are sold for not exactly the face value of the bond, yet will eventually return to the original face value throughout some undefined time frame that is indicated at the hour of purchase. Generally, the additional time before the bond matures, the greater the discount.

A few investors like to utilize accumulation bonds in their financial plans, as they can permit them to mature before eventually cashing them, and they know the specific amount they will receive at a future moment that the bond matures.

Accumulation bonds mature in a reasonable amount of time, and they might yield more earned interest than other investment options. Accumulation bonds are viewed as a safe investment, yet have as a main priority that they won't pay off until arriving at maturity. As such, they are a way for saving for the future, not a method for making a consistent revenue stream.

## Advantages and Disadvantages of Accumulation Bonds
### Masters

The primary advantage of accumulation bonds is that they frequently accompany higher interest yields than traditional bonds.

### Cons

Investors with accumulation bonds ought to know that they are unstable or exceptionally sensitive to swings in [interest rates](/interestrate). Accumulation bonds carry the risk of experiencing steep price declines when interest rates rise. A few bondholders would rather not hold on until maturity to get their payout and they sell their accumulation bonds early, however the price around then will be subject to interest rate vacillations.

Additionally, with accumulations bonds, investors need to pay taxes on income they don't get. Even however you're not really getting any interest payments, and will not understand the profit until the bond pays out at maturity, the IRS acts as though you are. All in all, the interest must be reported as interest income on the bondholder's tax return every year. This is sometimes alluded to as "apparition income".
