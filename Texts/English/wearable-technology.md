## What Is Wearable Technology?

Wearable technology, otherwise called "wearables," is a category of electronic gadgets that can be worn as embellishments, embedded in dress, embedded in the client's body, or even tattooed on the skin. The gadgets are sans hands devices with commonsense purposes, controlled by microchips and enhanced with the ability to send and receive data by means of the Internet.

The fast adoption of such gadgets has put wearable technology at the cutting edge of the [Internet of things (IoT)](/internet-things).

## How Wearable Technology Works

Wearable technology can be said to have existed since eyeglasses were first developed in the thirteenth century. Watches sufficiently small to be worn have been around since around 1500. Yet, modern wearable technology is defined as consolidating a chip and an internet association.

The growth of mobile organizations empowered the development of wearable technology. Wellness activity trackers were the principal big wave of wearable technology to get on with consumers. Then, at that point, the wristwatch turned into a screen and more robust mobile applications were added. Bluetooth headsets, smartwatches, and web-empowered glasses all permit individuals to receive data from Wi-Fi organizations. The gaming industry adds more wearables, with virtual reality and augmented reality headsets.

## Particular and Practical Applications

There have been a few lemon, too, prominently Google Glass. The Internet-associated eyeglasses may yet reappear for specific purposes however they most certainly didn't make it as a fashion accessory.

The concentration in the development of wearable technology currently gives off an impression of being moving from consumer assistants to additional particular and commonsense applications. Micro processor inserts are presently being utilized to supplant keys and passwords. Embedded in a fingertip, the chips use near-field communication (NFC) or radio-recurrence identification (RFID) and are like the chips used to follow lost pets.

The real life changing applications in wearable technology, nonetheless, can be found in medical gadgets.

## Instances of Wearable Technology

The past couple of years have seen quick development and presentation of wearable technology products adjusted for medical and healthcare utilizes. These include:

- In Louisville, Kentucky, wearable gadgets made via AIR Louisville are being utilized to monitor neighborhood air quality, measure contaminations, and recognize focal points for occupants with respiratory issues.
- Cyrcadia Health has developed Cyrcadia Breast Monitor, an intelligent patch that can distinguish early indications of bosom disease and communicate the data to a lab for analysis.
- Wearable medical alert monitors are stretching out greater mobility and independence to the elderly and impaired.
- Smart tattoos that contain flexible electronic sensors are being developed to monitor heart and brain activity, rest issues, and muscle function. While these are impermanent, even inks are being investigated!
- A smartwatch for individuals with Parkinson's disease tracks side effects and sends the data so that more customized treatment plans can be developed.

## Highlights
- Wearable technology is advancing into an important category of the Internet of things, with extraordinary applications in medication and different fields.
- These advancements might be worn, embedded in fabric or extras, or tattooed straightforwardly onto the skin.
- Otherwise called wearables, the growth of mobile organizations, high-speed data transfer, and scaled down chip have empowered the development of this technology.
