# Preferred Dividends
## What Is a Preferred Dividend?

A preferred dividend is a [dividend](/dividend) that is allocated to and paid on a company's [preferred shares](/preferredstock). On the off chance that a company can't pay all dividends, claims to preferred dividends overshadow claims to dividends that are paid on [common shares](/commonstock).

## Grasping Preferred Dividends

The boards of directors of public companies determine whether to pay a dividend to holders of its common stock and the amount to payout. The dividend is a reward to stockholders. It addresses their share of the company's profits and is an incentive for them to hold onto the stock as long as possible. The board might raise, reduce, or kill its dividend in view of the recent outcome of the business and contingent upon what different needs it sees for the money.

Preferred dividends are issued in view of the [par value](/parvalue) and dividend rate of the preferred stock. While preferred dividends are issued at a fixed rate in view of their par value, this might be unfavorable in high inflation periods. This is on the grounds that the fixed payment depends on a real rate of interest and is typically unadjusted for inflation.

The dividends for preferred stocks are by definition determined in advance and paid out before any dividend for the company's common stock is determined. The dividend might be a set percentage or might be tied to a particular benchmark interest rate. The dividend is generally paid on a quarterly or annual basis.

### Instructions to Calculate Preferred Dividend

All issuances of preferred stock contain the [equity](/equity's) dividend rate and par value in the preferred stock [prospectus](/prospectus). The dividend rate duplicated by the par value compares to the total annual preferred dividend. In the event that the total dividend to be received is paid out in installments, like in quarters, the [issuer](/issuer) separates the total preferred dividend by the number of periods to get a rough installment payment.

The [preferred dividend coverage ratio](/preferreddividendcoverageratio) is a measure of a company's ability to pay the required amount that will be due to the owners of its preferred stock shares. Preferred stock shares accompany a dividend that is set in advance and can't be changed. A solid company will have a high preferred dividend coverage ratio, showing that it will have little difficulty in paying the preferred dividends it owes.

## Dividends financially past due

A business might choose to swear off payment of dividends. Since preferred stockholders have priority over common stockholders with respect to dividends, these renounced dividends collect and must ultimately be paid to preferred shareholders. Thusly, preferred stock dividends in [arrears](/arrears) are legal obligations to be paid to preferred shareholders before any common stock shareholder receives any dividend. All recently discarded dividends must be paid before any current year dividends might be paid.

Preferred dividends collect and must be reported in a company's financial statement. [Noncumulative](/noncumulative) preferred stock doesn't have this feature, and all preferred dividends financially past due might be ignored.

## Other Preferred Dividend Features

Preferred stockholders typically receive the right to special treatment with respect to dividends, in exchange for the right to share in earnings in excess of issued dividend amounts. A few preferred stockholders might receive the right of participation, wherein their dividends are not restricted to the fixed rate of interest. Notwithstanding, a majority of preferred stock issuances are nonparticipating.

[Callable preferred stock](/callablepreferredstock) brings about higher preferred dividends, as investors are forfeiting long-term security. In the event that the preferred stock is retired at the [call price](/callprice), future preferred dividends might be remembered for the repurchase. [Convertible preferred stock](/convertiblepreferredstock) has lower preferred dividends, as the investor receives the extra of switching the preferred stock over completely to common stock.
