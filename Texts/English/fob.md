## What Is Free ready (FOB)?

Free ready (FOB) is a shipment term used to demonstrate whether the seller or the buyer is responsible for goods that are harmed or obliterated during shipping. "FOB shipping point" or "FOB beginning" means the buyer is at risk once the seller ships the product. The purchaser pays the shipping cost from the factory and is responsible on the off chance that the goods are harmed while in transit. "FOB objective" means the [seller](/seller) holds the risk of loss until the goods arrive at the buyer.

## Seeing Free ready (FOB)

By and large, FOB was utilized exclusively to allude to goods moved by ship — in the U.S., the term has since been expanded to incorporate a wide range of transportation. Policies including international transportation frequently contain abbreviated trade terms that depict matters like the general setting of delivery, payment, when the risk of loss shifts from the seller to the buyer, and who pays the costs of freight and insurance.

The most common international trade terms are [Incoterms](/incoterms), which the International Chamber of Commerce (ICC) distributes, yet firms that ship goods inside the U.S. must likewise stick to the [Uniform Commercial Code (UCC)](/uniform-commercial-code). Since there is more than one set of rules, and legal definitions of FOB might contrast starting with one country then onto the next, the gatherings to a contract must show which overseeing laws are being utilized for a shipment.

Any vendor-client transaction necessities to clarify FOB terms in the purchase order as these terms determine which party will pay for shipping and insurance costs. Nonetheless, worth taking note of FOB status doesn't determine ownership — ownership is determined in the bill of sale or agreement between the buyer and seller.

Assuming that the terms incorporate the phrase "FOB objective, freight collect," the seller is responsible for the goods until they are delivered, and the buyer is responsible for freight charges. Assuming the terms incorporate "FOB objective, freight prepaid," the seller is responsible for goods until delivered, if there are no insurance claims.

Essentially, when Old Navy causes different costs connected with inventory, like renting a warehouse, paying for utilities, and getting the warehouse, those costs are likewise added to inventory. This accounting treatment is important in light of the fact that adding costs to inventory means the buyer doesn't quickly expense the costs and this postpone in perceiving the cost as an expense influences net income.

This turns out to be especially important in the event that a transaction happens close to the transition starting with one accounting period then onto the next, like the finish of a calendar or [fiscal year](/fiscalyear).

Accountants need to know whether to remember the freight for the company's balance sheet when the goods are shipped or when they are delivered. FOB objective would mean the seller conveys the inventory on their balance sheet until it's delivered. FOB shipping point means the buyer records merchandise when it's shipped.
