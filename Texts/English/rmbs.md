# Residential Mortgage-Backed Security (RMBS)
## What is a Residential Mortgage-Backed Security (RMBS)?

Residential mortgage-backed securities (RMBS) are a debt-based security (like a bond), backed by the interest paid on loans for residences. The interest on loans like mortgages, [home-value loans](/homeequityloan) and [subprime](/subprime) mortgages is viewed as something with a nearly low rate of default and a similarly high rate of interest, since there is a high demand for the ownership of a personal or family residence. Investors are drawn to this sort of security likewise need to be protected from the risk of default inherent with individual loans of this sort. This risk is alleviated by pooling many such loans to limit the risk of an individual default.

## How a Residential Mortgage-Backed Security (RMBS) works

A residential [mortgage-backed security](/mbs) is built by one of two sources: a government agency like the Federal National Mortgage Association (Fannie Mae) and the[ Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation](/freddiemac) (Freddie Mac), or by a non-agency investment-banking firm. First these elements sell or control a large number of residential loans. Next they package a large number of them together into a single pool of loans. At last these elements basically sell bonds backed by this pool of loans.

The payments on these loans flow through to the investors who bought into this pool, and the interest rates they receive are better than run of the mill U.S. government-backed bonds. The responsible institutions keep a fee for the management of the pool, and the risks of default on these mortgages are shared by both the responsible elements and the investors. Since every one of these loans is a small part of the larger, collected pool of loans, the default of any of these loans lessly affects the investors than if they somehow happened to individually invest in any of these loans.

## Advantages and Disadvantages of a RMBS

The construction of a RMBS enjoys the benefit of giving less risk and greater profitability to the investors. It additionally allows the responsible substances to raise more cash for reserves, against which they can make more loans. This thusly makes seriously investing capital accessible to business owners and entrepreneurs.

As an indicator of their proficiency and benefit, it very well may be noticed that the greatest single category of RMBS investors is life insurance companies. These institutions benefit from having an efficient method for investing billions of dollars in higher-interest rate investments than government bonds, while yet as yet facing acceptable challenge.

A RMBS can contain a large number of different types of mortgages. The securities can contain every one of one type of mortgage or a mix of various types. They might contain mortgages with fixed rates, floating rates, adjustable rates and mortgages of shifting credit quality including prime and subprime. This assortment mollifies the risk of default.

The complexity of all RMBS, as an investment type, makes some hard to-measure disadvantages. The first is systemic risk, or the risk that financial system stress could consistently influence all investments inside the pool that underlies the RMBS. This risk was clear in the 2008 financial crisis. The second is that since investors are more separated from individual mortgage holders, they have less stake in their prosperity. While historical default rates floated around two percent, during 2009 this rate was close to five percent. After a decade this risk appears of little concern to investors since the default rate fell below one percent.

## Investing in Residential Mortgage-Backed Securities

Investing in a residential-mortgage backed security can open the investor to [prepayment](/prepayment) risk and [credit risk](/creditrisk). Prepayment risk is the risk that the mortgage holder will pay back the mortgage before its [maturity date](/maturitydate), which lessens the amount of interest the investor would have in any case received. Prepayment, in this sense, is a payment in excess of the scheduled principal payment. This situation might emerge on the off chance that the current market interest rate falls below the interest rate of the mortgage, since the homeowner is bound to refinance the mortgage. Credit risk for RMBS investors emerges when the borrower stops making payments on his mortgage

Residential mortgage-backed securities are used by financial institutions like insurance companies on account of their cash flow attributes and their somewhat long lives, which can offset long-term liabilities taken on by insurance companies. Also, purchasers of residential mortgage-backed securities frequently have input into how they are built, so they can be exceptionally tailored to offset a liability or to fit other investor inclinations for risk, return and timing of cash flows, for instance.
