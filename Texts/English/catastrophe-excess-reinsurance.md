## What Is Catastrophe Excess Reinsurance?

Catastrophe excess reinsurance safeguards catastrophe insurers from financial ruin in the event of a large-scale natural disaster.

For example, in the event that a regional insurer covers 60% of the properties along a shoreline impacted by a tempest flood, it very well may be out of nowhere hit with different claims that must be paid out as one, which could somehow bankrupt an insurer.

## Figuring out Catastrophe Excess Reinsurance

Catastrophe excess reinsurance safeguards insurance companies from the financial risks implied in large-scale catastrophic events. The size and unpredictability of catastrophes force insurers to take on a colossal amount of risk. Albeit catastrophic events inconsistently occur, when they do occur, they will generally cover wide geographic regions and cause large amounts of damage. At the point when an insurer experiences a large number of claims at the same time, the losses possibly could make it confine new business or influence it to decline to restore existing policies, limiting its ability to recover.

Insurance companies use [reinsurance](/reinsurance) to transfer a portion of their risk to an outsider in exchange for a portion of the premiums the insurer gets. Reinsurance policies arrive in a number of forms. [Excess-of-misfortune reinsurance](/excess-misfortune reinsurance), for example, lays out a limit to the amount the insurer will pay following a catastrophe, fairly like a deductible in a standard insurance policy. Given no catastrophes happen that makes an insurer surpass their limit over the duration of a contract, the reinsurer basically pockets the premiums.

To the degree reinsurance gives a financial backstop to an insurer's likely losses, its presence permits insurers themselves to [underwrite](/endorsing) more policies, making the coverage all the more widely and moderately accessible.

## Illustration of Catastrophe Excess Reinsurance

Companies that buy reinsurance policies [cede](/ceding-company) their premiums to the reinsurer. On account of catastrophe excess reinsurance, the insurer exchanges premiums for coverage of some percentage of claims over a defined threshold. For instance, an insurance company could set a threshold of $1 million for a natural disaster like a hurricane or seismic tremor. Assume a disaster incurred $2 million in claims. A reinsurance contract covering all claims over the threshold would pay out $1 million. A reinsurance contract for 50 percent of claims over the threshold would pay $1.5 million. While reinsurance can cover a percentage of claims over a threshold, it doesn't comprise proportional coverage, which expects reinsurers to pay a percentage of claims in exchange for the proportion of premiums ceded to them. Getting back to our model, a disaster that incurred $800,000 worth of claim would cost the reinsurer nothing.

Note that, not at all like different types of reinsurance, catastrophe excess reinsurance policies might not have a hard cap on the amount the reinsurance company must pay out in excess claims, and consequently may offer more downside risk to a reinsurance company than different types of arrangements.
