A Mello-Roos is an impromptu California tax district made to finance an infrastructure project. A district might be made exclusively with the endorsement of 66% of citizens and permits a special tax to be assessed on its inhabitants. The state law permitting such districts was carried out in 1982 as a manner for nearby governments to sidestep the state's 1978 cap on property tax increases.

## Grasping Mello-Roos

A Mello-Roos Community Facilities District (CFD) might be made by a city, region, or school district.
