## What Is Accelerated Vesting?

Accelerated vesting permits an employee to speed up the schedule for accessing [restricted company stock](/restrictedstock) or [stock options](/eso) issued as an incentive. The rate normally is quicker than the initial or standard vesting schedule. In this manner, the employee gets the monetary benefit from the stock or options a whole lot earlier.

On the off chance that a company chooses to embrace accelerated vesting, it might [expense](/expense) the costs associated with the stock options sooner.

## How Accelerated Vesting Works

Employees stock or stock option plans give incentives to employees to perform at a higher level and stay with the company longer. These rewards [vest](/vesting) over the long haul, meaning the amount really accessible for the employee to pull out increments on a set schedule.

For profoundly valued employees, companies might decide to accelerate the normal vesting schedule, which makes a higher [present value](/presentvalue) for the employees. The benefit to the employees makes expected issues for the company, including the risk that the employee will take the money and leave the company soon after that.

Changes in vesting have tax ramifications for both the company and the employee.

Single-trigger, as examined above, gives that at a sale or change of control, some or all of the restricted stock will quickly become vested.

A twofold trigger normally begins with the sale or change of control yet doesn't cause acceleration until a subsequent event happens. This subsequent event could incorporate the [termination](/termination-business) of the pioneer without cause or on the other hand assuming they leave the company inside a set time span (commonly six months to one year following the sale or change of control). The company can incorporate any triggering events as long as they explain them plainly in the employee compensation plan.
