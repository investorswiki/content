The cash book is set up in columns. There are three common adaptations of the cash book: single column, double column, and triple column. The single-column cash book shows just receipts and payments of cash. The double-column cash book shows cash receipts and payments as well as insights concerning bank transactions. The triple column cash book shows all of the above plus data about purchase or sales discounts.

A run of the mill single column cash book will have these four column headers: "date," "description," "reference" (or "[folio number](/folio-number)"), and "amount." These headers are available for both the left side appearance receipts and the right side appearance payments. The date column is the date of the transaction.

Since the cash book is refreshed continuously, it will be in sequential order by transaction. In the description column, the accountant composes a short description or portrayal of the transaction. In the reference or ledger folio column, the accountant inputs the account number for the connected general ledger account. The amount of the transaction is recorded in the last column.
