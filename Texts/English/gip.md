The Gibraltar pound is issued by the government of Gibraltar under the terms of the 1934 Currency Note Act.

It prints banknotes in denominations of \u00a35, \u00a310, \u00a320, \u00a350, and \u00a3100.

The notes and coins in circulation utilize British names however have various designs. They are just accepted in Gibraltar. The GIP isn't recognized in the United Kingdom, despite the fact that it tends to be exchanged for [British pound sterling](/gbp) notes, at a balanced ratio.

## Gibraltar's Economy

Situated in the south of the Iberian Peninsula, Gibraltar is an officially a British overseas area.

The British military has overwhelmed the economy of Gibraltar, and its maritime dockyard was generally the center of economic activity. Be that as it may, military activities and business have declined throughout recent decades: from 60% in 1984 to an estimated 7% right now.

Gibraltar's economy is presently founded on monetary services, online gaming, route, and the travel industry. The country stays a huge port in the Mediterranean Sea, with bunkering — the providing of fuel to ships — another important industry.

## History of the Gibraltar Pound

From 1825 to 1872, the currency situation in Gibraltar was muddled, with a system in light of the Spanish **real de plata** yet enveloping British, Spanish, and Gibraltarian coins. The **real** was tied to the pound at the rate of one Spanish dollar to four shillings, four pence (equivalent to 21.67 pence today). In 1872, be that as it may, the Spanish currency turned into the sole [legal tender](/legal-tender) of the country.

Then, at that point, in 1898, the Spanish-American War made the Spanish currency drop decisively in value. Thus, the pound was presented as the official coin of the realm — at first as British coins and banknotes, however Spanish money went on in circulation.

Gibraltar started giving its own banknotes in 1927 — the official birth of the Gibraltar pound — and its own coins in 1988. The coins were in denominations of 1, 2, 5, 10, 20, and 50 pence and 1 pound coins with unique designs and the country's name.

In 2011 the Gibraltar government assumed sole responsibility for the design, printing, and production of banknotes, assuming control over liabilities that up to that point had been the protect of the British government.
