# Invested Capital
## What Is Invested Capital?

Invested capital is the total amount of money raised by a company by issuing securities to equity shareholders and debt to [bondholders](/bondholder), where the total debt and capital [lease](/lease) obligations are added to the amount of equity issued to investors. Invested capital isn't a line thing in the company's financial statement since debt, capital leases, and stockholder's equity are each listed separately in the balance sheet.

## Understanding Invested Capital

Companies must generate more in earnings than the cost to raise the capital given by bondholders, shareholders, and other financing sources, or, in all likelihood the firm doesn't earn a [economic profit](/economicprofit). Businesses utilize several metrics to survey how well the company utilizes capital, including [return on invested capital](/returnoninvestmentcapital), [economic value added](/eva), and [return on capital employed](/roce).

A firm's total capitalization is the sum total of [debt](/debt), including capital leases, issued plus [equity](/equity) sold to investors, and the two types of capital are reported in various sections of the balance sheet. Assume, for instance, that IBM issues 1,000 shares of $10 par value stock, and each share is sold for a total of $30 per share. In the stockholder's equity section of the balance sheet, IBM increases the common stock balance for the total par value of $10,000, and the remaining $20,000 received increases the extra paid-in capital account. Then again, in the event that IBM issues $50,000 in corporate bond debt, the long-term debt section of the balance sheet increases by $50,000. In total, IBM's capitalization increases by $80,000, due to issuing both new stock and new debt.

## How Issuers Earn a Return on Capital

A fruitful company expands the [rate of return](/rateofreturn) it earns on the capital it raises, and investors take a gander at how businesses utilize the proceeds received from issuing stock and debt. Assume, for instance, that a plumbing company issues $60,000 in extra shares of stock and uses the sales proceeds to buy additional plumbing trucks and equipment. In the event that the plumbing firm can utilize the new assets to perform more residential plumbing work, the company's earnings increase and business can pay a dividend to shareholders. The dividend increases every investor's rate of return on a stock investment, and investors likewise profit from stock price increases, which are driven by increasing company earnings and sales.

Companies may likewise utilize a portion of earnings to buy back stock recently issued to investors and retire the stock, and a stock repurchase plan decreases the number of shares outstanding and brings down the equity balance. Analysts likewise take a gander at a firm's earnings for each share ([EPS](/eps)), or the net income earned per share of stock. Assuming the business repurchases shares, the number of outstanding shares diminishes, and that means that the EPS increases, which makes the stock more alluring to investors.

## Return on Invested Capital (ROIC)

Return on invested capital (ROIC) is a calculation used to survey a company's productivity at allocating the capital under its influence to profitable investments.

The return on invested capital proportion gives a feeling of how well a company is using its money to generate returns. Comparing a company's return on invested capital with its [weighted average cost of capital (WACC)](/wacc) uncovers whether invested capital is being utilized successfully. This measure is likewise referred to just as return on capital.

ROIC is constantly calculated as a percentage and is normally communicated as an annualized or trailing year value. It ought to be compared to a company's cost of capital to determine whether the company is creating value. On the off chance that ROIC is greater than a firm's weighted average cost of capital (WACC), the most common cost of capital measurement, value is being made and these firms will trade at a premium. A common benchmark for evidence of value creation is a return in excess of 2% of the firm's cost of capital. In the event that a company's ROIC is under 2%, it is viewed as a value destroyer. A few firms run at a zero-return level, and keeping in mind that they may not be destroying value, these companies have no excess capital to invest in future growth.

ROIC is one of the most important and informative valuation metrics to work out. All things considered, it is more important for certain sectors than others, since companies that operate oil apparatuses or fabricate semiconductors invest capital considerably more intensively than those that require less equipment.
