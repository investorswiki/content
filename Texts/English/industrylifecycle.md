# Industry Life Cycle
## What Is the Industry Life Cycle?

The industry life cycle alludes to the development of an industry or business through four stages in light of the business qualities commonly showed in each phase. The four phases of an industry life cycle are the presentation, growth, maturity, and decline stages. Industries are conceived when new products are developed, with critical vulnerability in regards to market size, product determinations, and principal contenders. Consolidation and disappointment trim down a laid out industry as it develops, and the excess contenders limit expenses as growth slows and demand ultimately fades.

## Understanding the Industry Life Cycle

There is no universal definition for the different stages of the industry life cycle, however commonly, it tends to be organized into presentation, growth, maturity, and decline. The relative length of each phase can likewise change substantially among industries. The standard model commonly manages manufactured goods, however the present service economy can function fairly in an unexpected way, particularly in the domain of Internet communications technology.

## Industry Life Cycle Phases
### Presentation Phase

The presentation, or startup, phase includes the development and early marketing of another product or service. Pioneers frequently make new businesses to empower the production and proliferation of the new offering. Data on the products and industry participants are many times limited, so demand will in general be hazy. Consumers of the goods and services need to dive more deeply into them, while the new suppliers are as yet creating and sharpening the offering. The industry will in general be exceptionally [fragmented](/discontinuity) in this stage. Participants will more often than not be unrewarding in light of the fact that expenses are incurred to create and market the offering while incomes are still low.

### Growth Phase

Consumers in the new industry have come to grasp the value of the new offering, and demand develops quickly. A small bunch of important players typically become apparent, and they contend to lay out a share of the new market. Immediate profits for the most part are not a main concern as companies spend on research and development or marketing. Business processes are improved, and geographical expansion is common. When the new product has shown viability, bigger companies in contiguous industries will quite often enter the market through acquisitions or internal development.

### Maturity Phase

The maturity phase starts with a [shakeout](/shakeout) period, during which growth slows, center movements toward expense reduction, and consolidation happens. A few firms accomplish economies of scale, hampering the sustainability of more modest contenders. As maturity is accomplished, barriers to entry become higher, and the competitive scene turns out to be all the more clear. Market share, cash flow, and profitability become the primary objectives of the excess companies now that growth is relatively less important. Price competition turns out to be substantially more pertinent as product differentiation declines with consolidation.

### Decline Phase

The decline phase denotes the finish of an industry's ability to support growth. Obsolescence and advancing end markets negatively impact demand, leading to declining incomes. This makes margin pressure, compelling more vulnerable contenders out of the industry. Further consolidation is common as participants look for cooperative energies and further gains from scale. Decline frequently flags the finish of viability for the incumbent [business model](/businessmodel), pushing industry participants into neighboring markets. The decline phase can be delayed with enormous scale product improvements or repurposing, however these will more often than not draw out a similar cycle.
