## What Is Credit Easing?

Credit easing is a group of unconventional monetary policy devices utilized by central banks to make credit and liquidity all the more promptly accessible in times of financial stress. Credit easing happens when [central banks](/centralbank) purchase assets, for example, government bonds.

Credit easing plans to increase the resources accessible to financial institutions during stressful times.

## Understanding Credit Easing

The Federal Reserve is responsible for a country's [monetary policy](/monetarypolicy) and it conducts monetary policy by three primary instruments: setting the reserve requirement, the discount rate, and conducting open market operations. Contingent upon whether the monetary policy should be expansionary (prod growth) or contractionary (slow growth) will decide the direction every one of these instruments is utilized.

The Fed likewise utilizes a large group of different instruments to conduct monetary policy when traditional monetary policy devices are sufficiently not and the economy should be invigorated or contracted further. One of these is credit easing. Credit easing involves an expansion of the asset side of the Federal Reserve's balance sheet. This attention on assets separates credit easing from other unconventional monetary policy devices, albeit several of these methods include the expansion of the central bank's balance sheet.

In response to the Great Recession, the [Federal Reserve](/federalreservebank) participated in credit easing by purchasing large amounts of Treasuries and [mortgage-backed securities](/mbs) (MBS). From 2006 to 2016, the Fed's balance sheet developed from $.89 trillion to $4.5 trillion. As liquidity to the banking sector increased, interest rates fell, bringing in money less expensive for institutions. The large-scale credit easing by the Fed eventually put a halt to the banking disaster.

"Credit easing," he comments, "looks like quantitative easing in one respect: It includes an expansion of the central bank's [balance sheet](/balancesheet); in any case, in a pure QE system, the focal point of the policy is the quantity of [bank reserves](/bank-reserve), which are liabilities of the central bank; the piece of loans and securities on the asset side of the central bank's balance sheet is incidental." Bernanke additionally points out that credit easing centers around "the mix of loans and securities" held by a central bank.

In spite of these semantics, even Bernanke admits that the difference in the two methodologies "mirrors no doctrinal conflict." Economists and the media have largely dismissed the qualification between the two terms by naming any work by a central bank to purchase assets and swell its balance sheet as quantitative easing.

QE, traditionally talking, nonetheless, alludes to increasing bank reserves rather than bank assets, as was finished by the Bank of Japan in 2001.
