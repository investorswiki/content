# Murabaha
## What Is Murabaha?

Murabaha, likewise alluded to as [cost-plus](/cost-plus-contract) financing, is an Islamic financing structure in which the seller and buyer consent to the cost and markup of an asset. The markup happens of interest, which is illegal in Islamic law. In that capacity, murabaha is definitely not an interest-bearing loan (qardh ribawi) yet is an acceptable form of credit sale under Islamic law. Likewise with a lease to-possess arrangement, the purchaser doesn't turn into the true owner until the loan is completely paid.

## Figuring out Murabaha

In a murabaha contract of sale, a client petitions a bank to purchase a thing for their sake. Conforming to the client's request, the bank lays out a contract setting the cost and profit for the thing, with repayment commonly in portions. Since a set fee is charged as opposed to [riba](/riba) (interest), this type of loan is legal in Islamic countries. Islamic banks are denied from charging interest on loans as per the strict precept that money is just a medium of exchange and has no inherent worth; so banks must charge a flat fee for continuing daily operations.

Many contend that this is basically one more method of charging interest. Nonetheless, the difference lies in the structure of the contract. In a murabaha contract available to be purchased, the bank buys an asset and afterward sells the asset back to the client with a profit charge. This type of transaction is halal or substantial, as indicated by Islamic Sharia/Shar\u012b\u02bfah.

> Giving conventional loans and charging interest on them are viewed as interest-based activities, which are haram (precluded) as indicated by Islamic Shar\u012b\u02bfah.

## Murabaha and Default

Extra charges may not be forced after a murabaha due date, which makes murabaha default a rising concern for Islamic banks. Many banks accept defaulters ought to be boycotted and not permitted future loans from any [Islamic bank](/islamicbanking) as a method of decreasing murabaha default. Even on the off chance that it isn't explicitly referenced in the loan agreement, this arrangement is permissible in Sharia. In the event that a debtor is facing a genuine hardship and can't repay a loan on time, break might be given as depicted in the Quran. Notwithstanding, the government might make a move in instances of tenacious default. Defaults under murabaha arrangements have turned into a problem for companies operating under Islamic law and there has been no reasonable consensus on the most proficient method to deal with them.

## Utilization of Murabaha

The murabaha form of financing is normally utilized in place of loans in different sectors. For instance, consumers use murabaha while purchasing household apparatuses, cars, or real estate. Organizations utilize this type of financing while purchasing machinery, equipment, or raw materials. Murabaha is likewise normally utilized for a short-term trade, like giving letters of credit for importers.

A murabaha letter of credit is issued for the benefit of a candidate (importer). The bank giving the letter of credit consents to pay an amount of money in compliance with the terms depicted in the letter of credit. Since the bank's [creditworthiness](/credit-value) replaces that of the candidate, the beneficiary (exporter) is guaranteed payment. This benefits the exporter in light of the fact that the bank accepts the payment risk. Following the murabaha contract provisions, the importer is required to repay the bank for the cost of goods plus a profit markup amount.

## Illustration of Murabaha

Bilal might want to buy a boat that sells for $100,000 from Billy's Boat Shop. To do as such, Bilal would contact a murabaha bank, that would buy the boat from Billy's Boat Shop for $100,000 and sell it to Bilal for $109,000, to be paid in portions more than a long term period. The amount Bilal pays is a fixed amount to a bank that possesses the asset and there is no interest charge included. Likewise, assuming Bilal defaults on any payments, there are no extra charges that he would bring about. The extra amount Bilal pays over the cost price from the boat shop is in effect a 3% loan, but since it is offered as a fixed payment with no extra costs, it is permitted by Islamic law.
