## What Is Fiscal Drag?

Fiscal drag is an economic term by which [inflation](/inflation) or income growth moves taxpayers into higher tax brackets. This in effect increases government tax revenue without really expanding tax rates. The increase in taxes decreases aggregate demand and consumer spending from taxpayers as a bigger share of their income presently goes to taxes, which leads to deflationary policies, or drag, on the economy.

## Figuring out Fiscal Drag

Fiscal drag is basically an easing back in the growth of the economy brought about by a lack of spending as increased [taxation](/taxation) eases back the demand for goods and services. At the point when an economy is quickly extending, inflation brings about higher income and consequently individuals moving into higher tax brackets and paying a greater amount of their income in taxes. This is especially the case in economies with [progressive taxes](/progressivetax), or tax brackets, which specify that the higher income an individual makes the higher the tax they pay and consequently they move into a higher tax bracket.

Moving into a higher tax bracket and paying a bigger portion of income in taxes, as referenced prior, brings about a possible easing back of the economy as there is presently less income accessible for discretionary spending.

It is common to see fiscal drag as a natural economic stabilizer as it will in general keep demand stable and the economy from overheating. This is generally seen as a gentle deflationary policy and a positive viewpoint to fiscal drag.
