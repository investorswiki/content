Investors once in a while conduct studies to determine the best, and generally profitable, utilization of a property. This is frequently alluded to as the property's highest and best use. For instance, on the off chance that an investment property is [zoned](/drafting) for both commercial and residential use, the investor gauges the upsides and downsides of both until they find out which has the highest possible rate of return. They then use the property thusly.

An investment property is frequently alluded to as a subsequent home. Yet, the two don't be guaranteed to mean exactly the same thing. For example, a family might purchase a cottage or other vacation property to utilize themselves, or somebody with a primary home in the city might purchase a second property in the country as a retreat for ends of the week. In these cases, the subsequent property is for personal use — not as an income property.

## Types of Investment Properties

**Residential:** Rental homes are a famous way for investors to supplement their income. An investor who purchases a residential property and rents it out to tenants can collect month to month rents. These can be single-family homes, condos, apartments, townhomes, or different types of residential structures.

**Commercial:** Income-producing properties don't necessarily in every case must be residential. A few investors — particularly corporations — purchase commercial properties that are utilized explicitly for business purposes. Maintenance and improvements to these properties can be higher, yet these costs can be offset by greater returns. That is on the grounds that the leases for these properties frequently command higher rents. These buildings might be commercially-possessed apartment buildings or retail store areas.

**Blended Use:** A blended use property can be utilized all the while for both commercial and residential purposes. For example, a building might have a retail storefront on the fundamental floor, for example, a convenience store, bar, or restaurant, while the upper portion of the structure houses residential units.

## Financing Investment Properties

While borrowers who secure a loan for their primary residence approach a variety of financing options including [FHA loans](/fhaloan), [VA loans](/valoan), and conventional loans, obtaining financing for an investment property can more test.

Insurers don't give [mortgage insurance](/mortgage-insurance) for investment properties, and accordingly, borrowers need to have no less than 20% down to secure bank financing for investment properties.

Banks likewise demand great credit scores and somewhat low [loan-to-value ratios](/loantovalue) before supporting a borrower for an investment property mortgage. A few lenders likewise require the borrower to have adequate savings to cover no less than a half year's worth of expenses on the investment property, consequently guaranteeing the mortgage and different obligations will be stayed up with the latest.

## Tax Implications

In the event that an investor collects rent from an investment property, the [Internal Revenue Service](/irs) (IRS) expects them to report the rent as income, yet the agency additionally allows them to deduct relevant expenses from this amount. For instance, on the off chance that a landlord collects $100,000 in rent throughout a year yet pays $20,000 in repairs, grass maintenance, and related expenses, they report the difference of $80,000 as self-employment income.

On the off chance that an individual sells an investment property for more than the original purchase price, they have a [capital gain](/capitalgain), which must be reported to the IRS. For 2021 and 2022, capital gains tax rates are either 0%, 15%, or 20% for most assets that are being held for more than a year.

Conversely, on the off chance that a taxpayer sells their primary residence, they just need to report capital gains tax on a home sale in excess of $250,000 assuming they file individually and $500,000 assuming they are married and filing jointly. The capital gain on an investment property is its selling price minus its purchase price minus any major improvements.

To illustrate, envision an investor purchases a property for $100,000 and burns through $20,000 putting in new pipes. A couple of years after the fact, they sell the property for $200,000. In the wake of taking away their initial investment and capital repairs, their gain is $80,000.
