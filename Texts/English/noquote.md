# No Quote
## What Is No Quote?

No quote alludes to a stock or other security that is inactive or not currently being traded, thus no current [two-sided market](/two-sidedmarket) promptly exists. A no quote stock thusly doesn't have a current [bid](/bid) or [ask](/ask) price.

No quote stocks might be inconsistently traded and in this manner hard to buy or sell, making them [illiquid](/illiquid). At the point when the stock is at last traded, it might have an exceptionally wide [spread](/bid-askspread) between the bid and ask price relative to that of an active stock.

## How a No Quote Works

Listed stocks are required to have designated [market makers](/marketmaker) available to give bid and ask volume on each side of the market available for purchase or sale, either on an on-going basis or at whatever point there is an explicit [request for a quote](/request-for-quote) (RFQ).

A few securities, in any case, have no market producers. For example, they might trade [over the counter](/otc) (OTC) or have been [de-listed](/delisting) from an exchange. At the point when a security has no active market creators, or a lack of available buyers and sellers, there is no one to [quote](/quote) the market thus the security is a no quote.

A no quote stock would subsequently be considered profoundly illiquid. Illiquid securities accompany higher risk on the grounds that with few buyers or sellers, it could be hard to get into or out of the security at the price wanted. Most securities traded on major exchanges are liquid and can be bought and sold whenever during trading hours.

A tiny company would be bound to have no quote on their shares than a nationally recognized and laid out [blue chip](/bluechipstock) company.

On the off chance that you are the holder of a no quote security and might want to discard it, you might have to enroll the aid of an able broker to request bids from potential market participants. These gatherings might be hedge funds, investment banks, or other institutional clients who wouldn't fret the lack of liquidity and will buy the security at a discount to make it advantageous for them. The holder could likewise post their offer in the market and leave it there. By posting a [limit order](/limitorder) to sell, it might draw a the offer in a buyer to sell and quickly jumps all over the chance.

At times, no buyer can be found by any means, in which case the owner of the no quote security must choose the option to keep holding on to the security, or discount it as a loss with a [market value](/marketvalue) verifiably of zero.

## Dim Market and Dark Pools

A few stocks trade in a [grey market](/graymarket). This means there are buyers and sellers, however they can't see each other's bids and offers. A price chart or [time and sales](/time-and-sales) will uncover that transactions are happening. In this type of market, traders will normally test for liquidity with limit orders, so they just execute inside a predetermined price range.

This is unique in relation to dark pools which are private exchanges, operating on publicly traded stocks, that execute trades without showing the orders on a public order book or Level II. When a trade happens, the trade is displayed on the [time and sales](/time-and-sales).

## Illustration of a No Quote Stock

For a stock to consistently have no quote, it necessities to have basically no interest in it, and consequently, it is probably not going to stay listed on a major exchange for a really long time. Hence, the vast majority are probably not going to go over a no quote stock except if they are checking tiny and dark OTC stocks out.

To discover what a no quote stock might resemble, take a gander at the Level II of a small listed company after the stock exchange formally closes, or before the stock market authoritatively opens. A stock that commonly trades at $20 or $50 during market hours might have no bids or offers [after-hours](/afterhourstrading) or in the [pre-market](/premarket). In this case, the stock may really have a bid price of zero, or will essentially show nothing, and same with the offer. As the open methodologies, bids and offers begin coming in, giving a quote to the stock.
