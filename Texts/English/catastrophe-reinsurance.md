# Catastrophe Reinsurance
## What Is Catastrophe Reinsurance?

Catastrophe reinsurance is purchased by an insurance company to reduce its exposure to the financial risks of a catastrophic event happening. Catastrophe [reinsurance](/reinsurance) permits the insurer to shift some or all of the risk associated with policies that it guarantees in exchange for a portion of the [premiums](/premium) that it receives from policyholders.

## Figuring out Catastrophe Reinsurance

Reinsurance, also called "insurance for insurance companies," is an option that permits insurers to transfer portions of their risk portfolios to different gatherings. The insurer, or the [cedent](/cedent), offers a fixed percentage of its business to the reinsurer, committing it to foot a portion or the bill ought to a [claim](/insurance_claim) be all made against one of the policies it bought in exchange for a share of the insurance expense â€” the payment customers are charged for coverage under a given plan.

Catastrophe reinsurance explicitly includes outsourcing a portion of the [financial risks](/financialrisk) associated with large-scale catastrophic events, comprising of natural disasters like tremors, floods, and tropical storms, and human-made disasters including a mob or psychological oppressor attack.

Buying protection against these risks is normally a carefully considered decision for a [insurance](/insurance) company. Catastrophes are rare and improbable to happen with frequency. All things considered, when they do strike, the amount of damage they cause can mind-overwhelm. Unexpectedly an insurer could experience a large number of claims at the same time, building up losses that could force it to stop taking on new business or decline to restore existing policies.

Since reinsurers will demand a portion of the premiums in exchange for facing risk, challenges must balance how frequently they use reinsurance with the benefit they receive for encountering a risk reduction. Insurers distinguish how much catastrophe risk they will take on through their [underwriting](/underwriting) activities, and decide that they are so presented to catastrophes from the policies that they make.

## Advantages and Disadvantages of Catastrophe Reinsurance

Without reinsurance, claims made after a catastrophe would come from the insurer's [operating cash flow](/operatingcashflow) (OCF), from [debt financing](/debtfinancing), or from liquidating assets. The impact could be obliterating and possibly put the insurer out of business, making refusal to cover such events or catastrophe reinsurance a reasonable option.

The problem is that catastrophe reinsurance prices can frequently be unreasonable. Reinsurers don't utilize a long [experience](/experience-rating-insurance) period while creating pricing models, liking rather to utilize models of risk [exposures](/exposure-rating) from current events or events that can be anticipated. That means, for instance, that reinsurers would see how rising ocean levels and global warming could increase the probability of future typhoons instead of take a gander at the number of tropical storms that happened by and large.

The ratio of [catastrophe insurance](/catastrophe-insurance) premiums to the losses an insurer might anticipate from a catastrophe happening can be high. This can push insurance companies from purchasing reinsurance against large catastrophe events and toward purchasing reinsurance for more modest events.

## Special Considerations

Present day catastrophe predictive models exploit the latest science and engineering information, utilize immense computing power made conceivable by recent IT advances, and are oftentimes designed utilizing new catastrophe events.

Catastrophe models can investigate risks at a location level and afterward build the location-level outcomes up to a portfolio level. This varies from the exposure curve approach, which depends on aggregate exposures.
