Assets in the fund are ceaselessly changing and don't mature. All things considered, bonds are bought and sold as they terminate or exit the target age scope of the fund. The test for the engineer of a bond ETF is to guarantee that it closely tracks its separate index in a practical way, notwithstanding the lack of liquidity in the bond market. Most bonds are held until [maturity](/maturity), so an active [secondary market](/secondarymarket) is regularly not available for them.

As the ETF doesn't mature, be that as it may, it's hard to alleviate interest rate risk.
