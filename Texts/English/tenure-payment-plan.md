# Tenure Payment Plan
## What Is a Tenure Payment Plan?

A tenure payment plan (or annuity plan) is a method for getting reverse mortgage proceeds where the borrowers get equivalent regularly scheduled payments however long they live in the home. The tenure payment plan has an adjustable interest rate. Interest builds on regularly scheduled payments as the borrower receives them. Interest additionally accumulates on any financed closing cost, including the upfront mortgage insurance premium and the continuous month to month mortgage insurance premiums.

These costs together — month to month tenure payments, interest, closing costs, and mortgage insurance premiums — make up what the borrower owes when the reverse mortgage becomes due and payable.

## Understanding Tenure Payment Plans

A reverse mortgage is a type of home loan accessible to homeowners aged 62 or more established, which is basically a large home equity loan borrowed against their home's value. Those utilizing a reverse mortgage can receive funds either as a [lump sum](/lump-sum-payment), fixed regularly scheduled payment, or credit extension. Dissimilar to a traditional mortgage used to buy a home, a reverse mortgage doesn't need the homeowner to make any loan payments.

A tenure payment plan is a method for getting reverse mortgage payments in equivalent month to month sums. This strategy has a lower initial interest rate than the single-disbursement lump-sum payment plan, which is the main fixed-rate option. The tenure plan's total interest cost could be less over the long run since the homeowner is borrowing money slowly with a lower initial interest rate. In any case, it could cost more than the [single-disbursement plan](/singledisbursement-lumpsum-payment-plan), contingent upon how long the borrower stays in the home and how the adjustable rate changes after some time.

The amount of interest owed over the long haul ordinarily is definitely not a major concern for borrowers who pick the tenure payment plan. Most borrowers utilizing a tenure payment plan are getting it done so they can age in place, and they plan on excess in their homes until the end of their lives. Tenure payments offer stability and consistency, so the homeowner doesn't need to worry about running out of money.

This payment plan isn't really great for somebody who has a large expense the person needs to pay at the same time or hopes to have such an expense from here on out. A lump sum, a credit extension, or a payment plan that consolidates tenure payments with a credit extension may be better options in that scenario.

The borrower's regularly scheduled payments under the tenure plan are calculated as though the borrower will live to be 100. Assume the borrower has a more limited life expectancy. In that case, a [term payment plan](/term-payment-plan), which gives fixed regularly scheduled payments to a set number of years, can allow the homeowner to receive higher regularly scheduled payments. Assuming that the borrower lives beyond 100, the individual in question will keep getting payments for life under the tenure payment plan.

## Special Considerations

Assume there are two borrowers on the reverse mortgage. In that case, the enduring borrower will keep on getting payments for life under the tenure plan, even after the main borrower passes on.

Nonetheless, assume only one of two homeowners is a reverse mortgage borrower, and the borrower passes on first. Then, at that point, the enduring homeowner won't receive any further payments since the person was not a borrower. This scenario has made issues for certain families where a more seasoned spouse took out a reverse mortgage in their name as it were.

Contingent upon the house and individuals residing there, it could seem OK to rent out a room all things being equal. Like that, rents could be raised to keep pace with a higher cost of living in the area.

Annuities generally guarantee long-term safety in exchange for low returns. That makes something of an inconsistency since annuities are generally purchased by individuals with long time skylines. Individuals who are 65 and stressed over where their finances will be in 20 or 30 years can invest some money in a [stock index fund](/total-stock-fund). That generally gives stocks sufficient opportunity to deliver large gains. Tenure payment plans have even more issues in such manner on the grounds that not very many individuals come to 100.
