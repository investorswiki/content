## What Is a Weighted Average?

Weighted average is a calculation that considers the shifting degrees of significance of the numbers in a data set. In working out a weighted average, each number in the data set is duplicated by a foreordained weight before the last calculation is made.

A weighted average can be more accurate than a simple average where all numbers in a data set are assigned an indistinguishable weight.

## Figuring out Weighted Averages

In computing a simple average, or arithmetic mean, all numbers are dealt with similarly and assigned equivalent weight. However, a weighted average relegates weights that decide in advance the relative significance of every data point.

A weighted average is most frequently figured to level the frequency of the values in a data set. For instance, a survey might gather an adequate number of reactions from each age group to be viewed as genuinely legitimate, however the 18-34 age group might have less respondents than all others relative to their share of the population. The survey team might weight the aftereffects of the 18-34 age group so their perspectives are addressed proportionately.

Notwithstanding, values in a data set might be weighted for different reasons than the frequency of occurrence. For instance, in the event that understudies in a dance class are graded on expertise, attendance, and habits, the grade for ability might be given greater weight than different factors.

Regardless, in a weighted average, every data point value is duplicated by the assigned weight which is then added and partitioned by the number of data points.

In a weighted average, the last average number mirrors the relative significance of every perception and is in this way more descriptive than a simple average. It additionally has the effect of smoothing out the data and upgrading its exactness.

### Weighting a Stock Portfolio

Investors normally build a position in a stock over a period of several years. That makes it extreme to keep track of the cost basis on those shares and their relative changes in value.

The investor can work out a weighted average of the share price paid for the shares. To do as such, duplicate the number of shares acquired at each price by that price, add those values and afterward partition the total value by the total number of shares.

For instance, say an investor gets 100 shares of a company in year one at $10, and 50 shares of a similar stock in year two at $40. To get a weighted average of the price paid, the investor increases 100 shares by $10 for year one and 50 shares by $40 for year two, and afterward adds the outcomes to get a total of $3,000. Then the total amount paid for the shares, $3,000 in this case, is partitioned by the number of shares acquired over the two years, 150, to get the weighted average price paid of $20.

This average is currently weighted with respect to the number of shares acquired at each price, in addition to the absolute price.

## Instances of Weighted Averages

Weighted averages appear in numerous areas of finance other than the purchase price of shares, including portfolio returns, inventory accounting, and valuation.

At the point when a fund that holds various securities is up 10% on the year, that 10% addresses a weighted average of returns for the fund with respect to the value of each position in the fund.

For inventory accounting, the weighted average value of inventory accounts at vacillations in commodity costs, for instance, while [LIFO](/lifo) (Last In First Out) or [FIFO](/fifo) (First In First Out) methods give more significance to time than value.

While assessing companies to perceive whether their shares are accurately priced, investors utilize the [weighted average cost of capital (WACC) ](/wacc)to discount a company's cash flows. WACC is weighted in view of the market value of debt and equity in a company's capital structure.

## Features
- A weighted average is sometimes more accurate than a simple average.
- The weighted average considers the relative significance or frequency of certain factors in a data set.
- Stock investors utilize a weighted average to follow the cost basis of shares bought at different times.
## FAQ
### How is a weighted average calculated?
You can figure a weighted average by duplicating its relative extent or percentage by its value in sequence and adding those totals together. In this manner in the event that a portfolio is comprised of 55% stocks, 40% bonds, and 5% cash, those weights would be duplicated by their annual performance to get a weighted average return. So if stocks, bonds, and cash returned 10%, 5%, and 2%, respectively, the weighted average return would be (0.55 x 10%) + (0.40 x 5%) + (0.05 x 2%) = 7.6%.
### What are a few instances of weighted averages utilized in finance?
Many weighted averages are found in finance, including the [volume weighted average price (VWAP)](/vwap), the weighted average cost of capital (WACC), and [exponential moving averages (EMAs)](/ema) utilized in charting. Construction of portfolio weights and the LIFO and FIFO inventory methods additionally utilize weighted averages.
### How does a weighted average vary from a simple average?
A weighted average accounts for the relative contribution, or weight, of the things being averaged, while a simple average doesn't. In this manner, it gives more value to those things in the average that happen relatively more.
