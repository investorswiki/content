# Node
With regards to [blockchain](/blockchain) and cryptocurrencies, a node alludes to every computer running the Bitcoin client. So the Bitcoin network is comprised of thousands of computer nodes spread around the world, and this makes [Bitcoin](/bitcoin) a peer-to-peer, distributed economic system.
Each blockchain node is a communication point in the network. There are distinct types of nodes, and each type is responsible for playing out an alternate set of functions. Accepting Bitcoin for instance, the network nodes might be isolated into four major gatherings: full nodes, listening nodes (supernodes), digger's nodes, and lightweight or SPV clients.
Full nodes are the ones that truly support and secure the Bitcoin blockchain, and they are crucial to the network. Full nodes (or fully approving nodes) are responsible for checking transactions and [blocks](/block) as indicated by the rules of the Bitcoin protocol. What's more, since the network is distributed, the rules are upheld by Bitcoin's agreement algorithm.
The supposed listening nodes, or supernodes, are the full nodes that are made publicly noticeable and open. Thusly, they can speak with whatever other node that lays out an association with them. So any fully approving node that isn't hidden can be viewed as a listening node. This type of node is responsible for giving blockchain data to different nodes, however they may likewise function as a communication bridge.
The mining nodes are the ones that run specific mining software, alongside [ASIC](/asic) machines (as a rule). They invest a ton of resources wanting to get Bitcoin's [block reward](/block-reward). While solo excavators are fully approving nodes, pool diggers frequently give computational resources without downloading the whole blockchain data. So just the administrator of the pool is required to run a full node.
In conclusion, the lightweight or SPV clients are the ones that utilization the Bitcoin blockchain yet don't function as approving nodes. They basically gather data from supernodes, going about as a communication endpoint. In that capacity, these nodes don't keep a copy of the blockchain and don't add to the security of the network.
