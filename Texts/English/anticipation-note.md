## What Is an Anticipation Note?

An anticipation [note](/note) is a short-term obligation issued to meet transitory financing needs with the expectation that future [cash flows](/cashflow) will repay the note.

## Understanding Anticipation Notes

Ordinarily, an anticipation note is a short-term obligation that is issued for transitory financing needs by a district. The term is derived from the idea that funds to pay off the note are "expected" to be received soon. The repayment of [principal](/principal) might be covered by a future longer-term [bond](/bond) issue, taxes, government grant, or other form of revenue. These notes typically have maturities of one year or less and interest is payable at maturity instead of semiannually. The notes are rated by [credit agencies](/credit-agency) (S&P and Moody's) to furnish investors with indications of repayment risk.

Anticipation notes are utilized to meet the short-term cash flow necessities of urban communities or states and give a method for dealing with the timing mismatch between their revenues and expenses. There are four unique types of anticipation notes:

1. [Tax anticipation notes](/tan) (TANs), utilized in anticipation of future tax assortments;
1. [Revenue anticipation notes](/ran) (RANs), issued with the expectation that nontax revenue, (for example, federal or state aid) will pay the obligation;
1. Tax and revenue anticipation notes (TRANs), which are paid off with a combination of taxes and revenue; and
1. [Bond anticipation notes](/bondanticipationnote) (BANs), what function as [bridge loans](/bridgeloan) and are issued when the district expects a future longer-term bond issuance to pay off the anticipation note at maturity.

The two notes were repaid with Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) disaster relief funds that the town had applied for and been guaranteed.
