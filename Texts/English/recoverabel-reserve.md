# Recoverable Reserves
## What Are Recoverable Reserves

Recoverable reserves are oil and gas reserves that are economically and technically achievable to extricate at the existing price of oil.

Resource reserves are important to companies' balance sheets since they are assets that the company projects it will monetize and influence the company's value to investors.

## Figuring out Recoverable Reserves

Recoverable reserves vacillate with the price of oil and gas, not at all like oil or gas resources that can be technically recuperated at any price. Resources are viewed as recoverable reserves on the off chance that they can be developed with reasonable certainty from a given date under current economic conditions, operating methods, and government regulations.

Resource reserves have specific classifications connected with the degree of certainty with which they can be recuperated, in light of seismic and engineering data. Degrees of uncertainty are communicated by separating oil reserves into two primary classifications, proven and unproven.

[Proven reserves](/proven-reserves) are reserves considered to have a 90% likelihood of being recoverable. Unproven reserves are not considered recoverable, due to regulatory or economic factors. This class of reserves is additionally broken down into probable and potential reserves. [Probable reserves](/probable-reserves) are reserves that have an estimated confidence level of roughly half of being effectively recuperated. [Possible reserves](/potential reserves) are those with just a 10% likelihood of recovery. The SEC requires the lower certainty evaluations to be confirmed by a third party before an oil and gas company can publicly state them to possible investors.

Until 2009, the U.S. [Securities and Exchange Commission](/sec) permitted just 1P proven reserves (both proven developed reserves and proven undeveloped reserves) to be publicly reported to likely investors. From that point forward, it has permitted companies to give information around 2P (both proven and probable) and 3P (proven plus probable plus potential) reserves, gave the evaluation is confirmed by qualified third-party specialists.

When an oil and gas field continues on from exploration into development and production, recoverable reserves are sorted as developed and undeveloped.

## Instances of Recoverable Reserves

A few destinations around the world have recoverable reserves that companies list on their regulatory filings with the SEC.

### The Bakken Formation, USA

The Bakken Formation is a stone formation situated in the Williston Basin that stretches from eastern Montana to western North Dakota, South Dakota, and southern Saskatchewan. The United States Geological Survey (USGS) gauges, "there might be 4.4 to 11.4 billion barrels of unseen, technically recoverable oil" in the Bakken formation, making the oil worth half a trillion dollars at $60 per barrel.

### Alberta, Canada

The Canadian area of Alberta contains the greater part of Canada's recoverable reserves, accounting for more than four-fifths of Canada's crude oil production. As indicated by Natural Resources Canada, Canada has a modest amount of the world's total oil reserves or roughly 167 billion barrels.

### Venezuela

Venezuela has the worlds biggest proven oil reserves at 18 percent of the total or around 300 billion barrels. Venezuela's oil industry is nationalized, notwithstanding, and due to sanctions forced by world governments, the nation's oil production has dropped from a pinnacle of 3.45 million barrels each day in 1997 to just 877,000 barrels each day toward the finish of 2019.

## Features
- Recoverable reserves, that is oil or gas that are **worth** recuperating, vacillate with the price of oil and gas.
- The SEC requires reserves that are of sketchy certainty with respect to their recoverability to be checked by a third party before an oil and gas company can publicly state them to possible investors.
- Resources are viewed as recoverable reserves in the event that they can be extricated for a profit and without running foul of government regulations.
