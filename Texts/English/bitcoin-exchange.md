## Decentralized Exchanges

Decentralized bitcoin exchanges are those that are operated without a central authority. These exchanges permit peer-to-peer trading of digital currencies without the requirement for an exchange authority to work with the transactions.

There are a number of benefits to decentralized exchanges. To begin with, numerous cryptocurrency users feel that decentralized exchanges better match the decentralized designs of most digital currencies themselves; many decentralized exchanges likewise require less personal information from their individuals than different types of exchanges. Second, assuming users transfer assets directly to different users, that kills the requirement for the transferring of assets to the exchange, subsequently lessening the risk of theft from hacks and other fraud. Third, decentralized exchanges might be less vulnerable to price manipulation and other fraudulent trading activity.

Notwithstanding transaction fees and funds transfer fees, traders may likewise be subject to [currency conversion fees](/conversion-rate), contingent upon the currencies that are accepted by the bitcoin exchange. Assuming a client transfers Canadian dollars to an exchange that main arrangements in U.S. dollars, the bank or the exchange will switch the CAD over completely to USD for a fee. Executing with an exchange that acknowledges your neighborhood currency is the best method for keeping away from the FX fee.

To be more technical, bitcoin wallets store private keys which are utilized to approve transactions and access the bitcoin address of a client. Most bitcoin exchanges give bitcoin wallets to their users, however may charge a fee for this service.

### Makers and Takers

Online bitcoin marketplaces typically assign bitcoin participants as either [makers](/pricemaker) or [takers](/pricetaker). At the point when a buyer or seller submits a limit request, the exchange adds it to its [order book](/order-book) until the price is matched by one more trader on the furthest edge of the transaction. At the point when the price is matched, the buyer or seller who set the limit price is alluded to as a maker. A taker is a trader who submits a market request that quickly gets filled.

## Illustration of a Bitcoin Exchange

For instance, on a bitcoin exchange, three coin sellers are asking for BTC/USD 2265.75, BTC/USD 2269.55, and BTC/USD 2270.00. A trader who starts a market order to buy bitcoins will have their order filled at the [best ask](/bestask) price of 2265.75. If by some stroke of good luck five bitcoins are available for the best ask and 10 coins are available for 2269.55, and the trader needs to buy 10 at market price, the trader's order will be filled with 5 coins @ 2265.75 and the excess 5 @ 2269.55.

Be that as it may, a trader who figures they can get bitcoins at a better cost could set a limit order for, say, 2260.10. In the event that a seller matches their ask price with this order or sets a price below this figure, the order will get filled. This is all finished by the exchange, which takes a percentage of every transaction for their business.
