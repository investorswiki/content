# Unconditional Investment Company — OEIC
## What Is an Open Ended Investment Company — OEIC?

An unconditional investment company (OEIC) is a type of investment fund domiciled in the United Kingdom that is structured to invest in stocks and different securities. The company's shares list on the [London Stock Exchange](/lse) (LSE) and the price of the shares are based largely on the underlying assets of the fund. These funds can mix various types of investment strategies like income and growth, and [small cap](/small-cap) and [large cap,](/large-cap) and can continually change their investment criteria and fund size.

OEICs are called "unconditional" in light of the fact that they can make new shares to satisfy investor need. Additionally, the fund will cancel shares of investors who exit the fund.

## Understanding an Open Ended Investment Company

An unassuming investment company pools investors' money and spreads it across a great many investments, like equities or [fixed-interest securities](/fixed-interest-security). This diversification decreases the risk of losing an investor's principal. OEIC funds offer the potential for growth or income. They normally function as a medium to long-term investment, held for five to 10 years or longer.

Any U.K. investor, 18 years or more established, may invest in many funds managed by industry specialists. As in the United State, there are different levels of risk accessible for capital growth, income generation, or a combination of both. Shareholders might invest for themselves or for their children. At the point when children turn 18 years of age, they hold the investment by their own doing.

## Charges for OEIC Shares

Starting around 2021, investors pay an initial charge of between 0% to 5% while buying new shares. This type of front end load lowers the amount of money going into the fund to purchase shares. Moreover, there is an annual management charge (AMC) of around 1% to 1.5% of the value of an investor's shares. The AMC covers the fund managers' services. Funds that are not actively managed, like index trackers, have a lot of lower fees.

Most funds quote a [total expense ratio](/ter) (TER) or a continuous charges figure (OCF). Each charge incorporates the AMC and different expenses utilized for contrasting various products. The TER and OCF do exclude dealer charges that can add essentially to annual costs on the off chance that the fund has a high turnover rate.

There may likewise be an exit charge for selling shares, based on a percentage of the total value of the sale. Nonetheless, numerous OEICs don't charge exit fees.

Investors might invest a single payment or regularly scheduled payments with least amounts relying upon the fund. Additionally, access to funds online or via telephone is generally simple. Further, shareholders might pay a fee while moving between funds.

OEICs have just a single price each day, based on the [net asset value](/nav) (NAV) of the underlying assets of the fund. OIECs will generally have lower fees than UTs since they have a more straightforward structure. Numerous investment companies have been changing over unit trusts into OEICs thus.

## Real World Example of OEICs

One such is Fidelity International, an overseas division of Fidelity Investments. In July 2018, the division announced it was founding variable management fees for five UK-domiciled OEICs, including the Fidelity Special Situations, Fidelity European, Fidelity Asian Dividend, Fidelity Global Special Situations, and Fidelity American funds.

The change actually reduced the base AMC of the funds by 10%.
