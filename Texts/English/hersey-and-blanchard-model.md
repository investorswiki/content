# Hersey-Blanchard Model
## What Is the Hersey-Blanchard Model?

The Hersey-Blanchard Model proposes no single leadership style is better than another. Rather than zeroing in on work environment factors, the model recommends leaders change their styles to those they lead and their capacities.

Under the model, effective leadership is both task-applicable and relationship-important. It is an adaptive, flexible style, by which leaders are urged to think about their followers — people or a group — then consider the factors that impact the workplace before picking how they will lead. This guarantees they will meet their objectives.

The Hersey-Blanchard Model is likewise alluded to as the Situational Leadership Model or Theory.

## Grasping the Hersey-Blanchard Model

The Hersey-Blanchard Model, or situational leadership style, was developed by creator Paul Hersey and leadership expert Ken Blanchard, creator of **The One Minute Manager**. The model is certainly not a static leadership style. All things being equal, it is flexible, wherein the manager adjusts their management style to different factors in the working environment, incorporating their relationship with employees.

That means managers who live by the model must pick the [leadership](/leadership) style as it connects with the maturity of followers. For instance, assuming follower maturity is high, the model proposes the leader give insignificant guidance. Paradoxically, assuming that follower maturity is low, the manager might have to give explicit bearings and administer work closely to guarantee the group has clearness on their objectives and how they are expected to accomplish them.

The maturity level of followers is partitioned into three categories: high, moderate and low. High maturity incorporates highly competent and sure people who are experienced and function admirably all alone. Moderate maturity is generally separated into two groups: the first are employees who are fit however lack sufficient confidence to assume on the liability to do as such, and the subsequent group has the confidence yet isn't willing to do the task within reach. Low maturity employees are not sufficiently skilled to do the task but rather are exceptionally energetic.

## Special Considerations
### Hersey-Blanchard Model and Leadership Styles

Hersey and Blanchard developed four types of leadership styles in light of the task and relationships that leaders experience in the work environment. As per the model, the following are styles of leadership managers can utilize:

- **Designating style:** A low-task, low-relationship style wherein the leader allows the group to get a sense of ownership with task choices. This is best utilized with high maturity followers.
- **Taking part style:** A low-task, high-relationship style that stresses shared thoughts and choices. Managers can utilize this style with moderate followers who are experienced yet may lack the confidence to do the tasks assigned.
- **Selling style:** A high-task, high-relationship style in which the leader endeavors to sell their plans to the group by making sense of task bearings in a convincing way. This, too, is utilized with moderate followers. Not at all like the previous style, these followers have the ability however are reluctant to finish the work.
- **Telling style:** A high-task, low-relationship style wherein the leader gives explicit headings and oversees work closely. This style is geared toward low maturity followers.

### Applying the Model and Its Limitations

This leadership method lets executives, managers and different positions of authority assume responsibility for their followers in light of the sharpness, understanding and setting of the group. By thinking about how the qualities, shortcomings and awareness of the followers can influence performance and results of a project, leaders can apply a suitable structure and degree of control to accomplish the ideal outcome.

There are limitations to the model that might be unchangeable as far as the leader might be concerned. The position and authority of the leader might be restricted by the operational hierarchy of leadership or [hierarchy](/corporate-hierarchy) for an organization, which could force them to embrace inflexible styles as opposed to adjust to follower maturity. Moreover, time limitations, a narrow field of options, and limits on accessible assets can likewise force managers to act in light of the conditions they face, killing the possibility of enacting strategies worked around follower maturity.

## Advantages and Disadvantages of the Hersey-Blanchard Model

Albeit this leadership model might be sound in theory, it may not be guaranteed to apply in each situation. It accompanies advantages and disadvantages.

One advantage of an adaptive leadership style is leaders can change their style at their own watchfulness whenever. Furthermore, employees might find a leader who adjusts to shifts in the workforce as a positive characteristic. It is likewise a simple and simple to-apply leadership style, meaning a manager can rapidly assess a situation and go with choices as they see fit.

On the downside, situational leadership might put too much responsibility on the manager, whose choices might be defective. Additionally, the model may not make a difference to each work culture. The model may likewise focus on relationships and tasks, rather than an organization's long-term objectives.
