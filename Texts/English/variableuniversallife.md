# Variable Universal Life (VUL) Insurance
## What Is Variable Universal Life (VUL) Insurance?

Variable universal life (VUL) is a type of [permanent life insurance](/permanentlife) policy with an underlying savings part that considers the investment of the cash value. Like standard universal life insurance, the premium is flexible.

VUL insurance has investment subaccounts that consider the investment of the cash value. The function of the subaccounts is like a [mutual fund](/mutualfund). Exposure to market changes can produce critical returns, yet may likewise bring about substantial losses. This insurance gets its name from the shifting consequences of investment in the always fluctuating market. While VUL insurance offers increased flexibility and growth potential over a traditional cash value or a whole life insurance policy, policyholders ought to carefully evaluate the risks before purchasing it.

## How Variable Universal Life (VUL) Insurance Works

Like [universal life insurance](/universallife), VUL insurance consolidates a savings part with a separate [death benefit](/deathbenefit), considering greater flexibility in dealing with the policy. Premiums are paid into the savings part.

For a VUL insurance policy, the savings component comprises of separately managed accounts, alluded to as "subaccounts." Each year the life insurer deducts what it needs to cover mortality and administrative costs. The rest stays in the separate accounts to earn further interest.

### Two Components

In a whole life policy, the life insurer expects the investment risk by ensuring a base cash value growth. The life insurer transfers the investment risk of the VUL policy to the insured.

The insured must accept the probability that the separate account might produce negative returns, which will reduce the cash value. Critical and supported losses compromise the cash value. Subsequently, the insured might have to dispatch higher premium payments to cover the cost of the insurance and remake the cash value.

### Subaccounts

The separate subaccount is organized like a family of mutual funds. Each has a variety of stock and bond accounts, alongside a [money market](/moneymarketaccount) option. A few policies confine the number of transfers into and out of the funds. On the off chance that a policyholder has surpassed the number of transfers in a year and the account in which funds are invested performs ineffectively, they might have to pay a higher payment to cover the cost of insurance.

The growth of the VUL insurance policy's cash value is tax-deferred. Policyholders might access their cash value by taking a withdrawal or borrowing funds. Be that as it may, in the event that the cash value falls below a specific level, extra premium payments must be made to keep the policy from slipping by.
