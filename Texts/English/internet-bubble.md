# Internet Bubble
## What Is the Internet Bubble?

The internet bubble was a [speculative bubble](/speculativebubble) that developed following the promotion of the world wide web in 1991. The mania was part of a more extensive [tech bubble](/tech_bubble) that prompted gigantic over-investment in telecoms and IT infrastructure. This investment rush prompted exponential growth and a subsequent collapse in the [Nasdaq](/nasdaq), the market for US technology stocks.

## Understanding the Internet Bubble

One of the elements of the internet bubble of the 1990s was investors' suspension of doubt about the feasibility of many website business models. In this [New Economy](/neweconomy), a company required exclusively to have a ".com" in their name to see their stock prices soar following a [initial public offering](/ipo) (IPO), even on the off chance that they still couldn't seem to create a gain, produce any positive cash flow, or even produce any revenue.

Venture capitalists, investment banks, and brokerage houses were blamed for advertising website shares so they could cash in on the wave of IPOs, however Federal Reserve monetary policy was the underlying driver for the internet bubble. The Greenspan Fed aggressively brought down interest rates through the late 1980s and mid 1990s pushing a wave of liquidity into capital markets that initiated the boom in tech.

The [Greenspan-put](/greenspanput) that developed during this period was likewise to fault: in 1994-1995 Greenspan campaigned hard for the Mexican peso bailout, and in 1998 the Fed bailed out Long Term Capital Management. This drove tech investors to expect that paying little mind to underlying fundamentals, the Fed would thus bail them out too assuming the internet bubble were to burst.

Since it was accepted that traditional valuation methods couldn't be applied to internet stocks with new business models and negative earnings and cash flow, investors put a premium on growth, market share, and [network effects](/network-impact). With investors zeroing in on valuation metrics like price-to-sales, numerous internet firms turned to [aggressive accounting](/aggressiveaccounting) to inflate revenue.

With capital markets tossing money at the sector, [start-ups](/startup) were in a race to get big fast. Companies with no [proprietary technology](/proprietarytechnology) abandoned fiscal responsibility and spent a fortune on marketing to lay out brands that would separate themselves from the competition. Some new businesses spent as much as 90% of their budget on advertising.

## The Peak of the Internet Bubble

Record measures of capital began flowing into the Nasdaq in 1997. By 1999, 39% of all venture capital investments were going to internet companies, and close to 295 of the 457 IPOs that year were related to internet companies, trailed by 91 in the principal quarter of 2000 alone. The AOL Time Warner [megamerger](/megamerger) in January 2000, is viewed as the pinnacle of this bubble, which would turn into the biggest merger disappointment ever. At the actual pinnacle of the bubble, Greenspan broadly multiplied down on his conviction that the internet bubble was sustainable and that the tech sector, along with Fed policy under his leadership, had fundamentally changed the economy to permanently increase productivity.

## The Internet Bubble Bursts

Right off the bat in the growth of the bubble, [Fed Chair Alan Greenspan](/alangreenspan) cautioned the markets about their [irrational exuberance](/irrationalexuberance) on Dec. 5, 1996. At last, by the spring of 2000, after banks and brokerages had utilized the excess liquidity the Fed made in advance of the [Y2K bug](/y2k) to fund internet stocks, the Fed had started to gently raise rates in light of inflationary imbalances building in the economy. Having poured gas on the fire, Greenspan presently attempted to sodden the inflationary flares, and in the face of more slow monetary expansion, the bubble quickly burst.

The [crash](/dotcom-bubble) that followed saw the Nasdaq index, which had risen fivefold somewhere in the range of 1995 and 2000, tumble from a pinnacle of 5,048.62 on March 10, 2000, to 1,139.90 on Oct. 4, 2002, a 76.81% fall. Toward the finish of 2001, most website stocks had become penniless. Even the share prices of blue-chip technology stocks like Cisco, Intel, and Oracle lost over 80% of their value. It would require 15 years for the Nasdaq to recapture its website top, which it did on April 23, 2015.
