# Protecting Americans From Tax Hikes (PATH) Act
## What Is the Protecting Americans From Tax Hikes (PATH) Act?

The Protecting Americans from Tax Hikes (PATH) Act of 2015 is an Obama-time law that expanded or restored a number of tax credits for individuals, families, and organizations while carrying out measures to forestall fraudulent claims for those credits. The act stays in force.

The act essentially influences individuals who are eligible to receive certain tax credits:

- Individuals filing for the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) or the Additional Child Tax Credit (ACTC) must have a Social Security number or a legitimate Individual Taxpayer Identification Number (ITIN). On the off chance that an ITIN has not been utilized in a tax filing during the previous three years, it is at this point not substantial and another number must be gotten.
- Anyway, refunds that incorporate these credits are not issued before Feb. 15 of every year. That gives the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) time to check for fraudulent claims.

Altogether, the PATH Act recharged around 50 brief tax breaks for individuals and organizations that had passed their original expiration dates.

## Understanding the PATH Act

The PATH Act zeroed in on a number of tax credits for individuals, families, and organizations. It extended a few credits permanently and expanded qualification for other people.

A tax credit, by and large, is more important to the taxpayer than a tax deduction. A tax deduction just reduces the individual's taxable income. A [tax credit reduces](/taxcredit) the amount of taxes owed, dollar for dollar.

A tax credit may likewise be refundable or to some degree refundable. In that case, a low-income taxpayer could owe practically zero taxes and receive a check from the IRS for some or the entirety of the credit.

### Opportunities for Fraud

Tax credits are especially powerless against fraud by taxpayers seeking to score credits they aren't eligible for and by con specialists going after taxpayers who are eligible.

The Child Tax Credit is a case in point. The program, which was substantially expanded to let American families free from a portion of the financial burden of the COVID-19 pandemic, delivered payments of up to $300 each month per child to taxpayers below certain income levels through 2021. (The situation with the child tax credit in 2022 is hazy as of January 2022.)

Taxpayers who were eligible naturally received those payments, on the grounds that the IRS had the information it expected to recognize them. Yet, those whose incomes were low to such an extent that they didn't need to file expected to pursue the credit online.

Also, that fact opened up an opportunity for con craftsmen taking on the appearance of IRS agents. They moved toward individuals by message, email, phone, and social media post acting like government delegates to deceive personal information out of the accidental.

The other target for fraud, of course, was the IRS itself. Tax filers could commit fraud by underreporting their income or designing wards to fit the bill for the credit.

**The Earned Income Credit Fraud**

A second opportunity for endeavoring to defraud the IRS happened through the Earned Income Tax Credit (EICF). This credit, worth $538 to $6,660 every year, is accessible to low and direct income individuals, with bigger amounts for families with children.

An endeavored fraud can happen when someone files a tax return that distorts the individual's earned income or the number of children in the family, or both.

> The IRS cautions that individuals eligible for the Child Tax Credit are being barraged with calls, messages, email messages, and social media posts from scam specialists seeking to take their money. The agency cautions taxpayers not to give out personal or financial information to anyone indicating to be from the IRS.

## Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) and Additional Child Tax Credit (ACTC)

There was no change in the tax filing process due to the PATH Act. Much of the time, the IRS hopes to send refund checks in 21 days or less.

Be that as it may, on the off chance that you file a [Earned Income Tax Credit](/earnedincomecredit) (EITC) or [Additional Child Tax Credit](/extra child-tax-credit) (ACTC) return right off the bat in the year, the IRS will hold your refund check until Feb. 15. The justification behind the deferral is to give the IRS extra chance to distinguish fraudulent claims and to keep refunds from being paid to identity criminals.

The EITC applies to low-income and medium-income individuals and families, regardless of children. Tax credits rely upon the number of children. The earned income threshold for claiming the ACTC is $2,500.

In the event that the EITC or ACTC doesn't concern you, or on the other hand assuming you file taxes after Feb. 15, the PATH Act doesn't influence the timing of your refund.

> Because of the American Rescue Plan of 2021, the EITC's original cap at $543 for childless households increased to $1,502 for 2021.

### Renewal of Individual Taxpayer Identification Number (ITIN)
