# Spreadlock
## What Is a Spreadlock?

A spreadlock is a [credit derivative](/creditderivative) contract that lays out a foreordained spread for future [interest rate swaps](/interestrateswap). The two principal types of spreadlocks that can be utilized are forward-based spreadlocks and option-based spreadlocks.

With a spreadlock, an interest rate swap client might lock in a current [spread](/spread) between a [swap](/swap) and an underlying government bond yield. This strategy takes into consideration the exchange of [basis points](/basispoint) forward to when the swap is written.

Spreadlocks are possibly valuable for investors considering the utilization of an interest rate swap sooner or later. In any case, they are not accessible in all markets.

## Grasping a Spreadlock

Spreadlocks have been an option for investors since the late 1980s, and they immediately joined swaps, covers, floors, and swaptions as [plain vanilla](/plainvanilla) derivative designs.

A forward spreadlock considers a definitive increase of a set number of basis points on top of the current spread in the underlying swap. With a spreadlock through an option contract, the buyer of the contract can choose whether or not to make the swap valuable.

An illustration of a forward-based spreadlock would be a two-way contract in which the gatherings concur that in one year's time they will go into a five-year swap. In this speculative swap, one party will pay a floating rate, like the [London Interbank Offered Rate](/libor) (LIBOR), and the other party will pay the five-year Treasury yield as of the beginning date, plus 30 basis points. On account of an option-based spreadlock, one of the gatherings would reserve the privilege to conclude whether the swap will come full circle before the date of maturity.

Spreadlocks can be viewed as credit derivatives since one of the factors driving the underlying swap spread is the general level of credit spreads.

A few benefits of utilizing a spreadlock are that they take into consideration more exact interest rate management, plus increased flexibility and customization. The fundamental goal of a spreadlock is to [hedge](/hedge) against adverse moves in the spread among swaps and the underlying government bond yield.

A few drawbacks are that spreadlocks require documentation from the [International Swaps and Derivatives Association](/isda) (ISDA), have unlimited loss potential, and in light of the fact that implied forwards can some of the time be ugly.

## Spreadlocks and Swap Spread Curves

A spreadlock's price is equivalent to the difference between the implied forward swap rate and the implied forward bond yield. The [swap spread](/swapspread) curve can be seen freely from the overall swap [yield curve](/yieldcurve).

Just like with all implied forwards, an emphatically slanted spread curve recommends that swap spreads will rise over the long run since swap spreads for more limited [maturities](/maturity) are lower than longer maturities. A negatively slanted spread curve means that swap spreads will fall over the long run since swap spreads for more limited maturities are higher than longer maturities.

## Spreadlocks and Hedging Bond Issuances

Spreadlocks are principally used to hedge [bond](/bond) issuances. At the point when a company issues a bond the [fixed rate](/fixedinterestrate) is typically over that of the Treasuries. At the point when a company is giving a bond, the interest rates can change between the hour of the decision to issue a bond and the hour of funding.

Supporting the changes in the spread between the offered fixed-rate and the yield on the Treasury can be troublesome. Utilizing a spreadlock locks in a swap rate for a specific period of time at a specific amount in advance, paying little mind to what the rates are at the time the swap starts.
