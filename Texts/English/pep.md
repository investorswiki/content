# Personal Equity Plan (PEP)
## What Was a Personal Equity Plan (PEP)?

PEPs were replaced with Individual Savings Accounts (ISA) in 1999.

The PEP was intended to encourage investment by individuals. Many plans required a base amount to be invested, for example, \u00a3250 or \u00a31,000, contingent upon the type of plan and the plan manager's requirements. Among the incentives introduced to the public to encourage their participation in a PEP was the prospect of income and capital growth at a greater rate than certain other investment vehicles, for example, in the event that they laid out a deposit account with a [building society](/building-society).

The income from a PEP was tax-free, insofar as the invested funds stayed in the plan. Likewise with different types of equity investments, the value of the shares invested in through a PEP could rise or decline with market vacillations.

It was trusted that to see the best return on investment from a PEP, the funds ought to have stayed in place for as many as five years, in the event that not decade. Due to certain management fees and different charges that might have been applied, pulling out funds early might have discredited the gains they accrued.
