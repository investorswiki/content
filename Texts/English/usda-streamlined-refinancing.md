## Qualification Requirements for USDA Streamlined Refinancing

Benefits of this specific option incorporate no requirement to drop the payment by something like $50, and existing borrowers listed on the note can be taken out up to one of the original borrowers stays on the loan. The last option can be beneficial on account of divorce.
