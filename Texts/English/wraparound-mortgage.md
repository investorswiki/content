## What Is a Wraparound Mortgage?

A wraparound mortgage is a type of junior loan which wraps or incorporates, the current note due on the property. The wraparound loan will comprise of the balance of the original loan plus an amount to cover the new purchase price for the property. These mortgages are a form of secondary financing. The seller of the property receives a secured [promissory note](/promissorynote), which is a legal IOU specifying the amount due. A wraparound mortgage is otherwise called a wrap loan, superseding mortgage, agreement available to be purchased, or all-inclusive mortgage.

## How a Wraparound Mortgage Works

Much of the time, a wraparound mortgage is a method of [refinancing](/refinance) a property or financing the purchase of another property while an existing mortgage can't be paid off. The total amount of a wraparound mortgage incorporates the previous mortgage's unpaid amount plus the extra funds required by the lender. The borrower makes the bigger payments on the new wraparound loan, which the lender will use to pay the original note plus give themselves a profit margin. Contingent upon the phrasing in the loan archives, the title may promptly transfer to the new owner or it might stay with the seller until the satisfaction of the loan.

Since the wraparound is a [junior mortgage](/junior_mortgage), any unrivaled, or senior, claims will have priority. In the event of default, the original mortgage would receive all proceeds from the liquidation of the property until it is all paid off.

Wraparound mortgages are a form of [seller financing](/seller-financing) where rather than applying for a conventional bank mortgage, a buyer will sign a mortgage with the seller. The seller then replaces the bank and acknowledges payments from the new owner of the property. Most seller-supported loans will remember a spread for the interest rate charged, giving the seller extra profit.

## Wraparound Mortgage versus Second Mortgage

Both wraparound mortgages and [second mortgages](/secondmortgage) are forms of seller financing. A subsequent mortgage is a type of subordinate mortgage made while an original mortgage is still in effect. The interest rate charged for the subsequent mortgage will in general be higher and the amount borrowed will be lower than that of the principal mortgage.

A remarkable difference among wraparound and second mortgages is in what befalls the balance due from the original loan. A wraparound mortgage incorporates the original note moved into the new mortgage payment. With a subsequent mortgage, the original mortgage balance and the new price join to form another mortgage.

## Illustration of a Wraparound Mortgage

For instance, Mr. Smith claims a house that has a mortgage balance of $50,000 at 4% interest. Mr. Smith sells the home for $80,000 to Mrs. Jones who gets a mortgage from one or the other Mr. Smith or one more lender at 6% interest. Mrs. Jones makes payments to Mr. Smith who utilizes those payments to pay his original 4% mortgage.

Mr. Smith creates a gain on both the difference between the purchase price and the original owed mortgage and on the spread between the two interest rates. Contingent upon the loan administrative work, the house buying's might transfer to Mrs. Jones. Be that as it may, assuming she defaults on the mortgage, the lender or a senior inquirer may [foreclose](/dispossession) and recover the property.
