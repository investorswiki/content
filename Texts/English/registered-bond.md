## What Is a Registered Bond?

A registered bond is a debt instrument whose bondholder's data is kept on record with the responsible party. By chronicling the owner's name, address, and different subtleties, issuers guarantee they're making the bond's coupon payments to the right person.

## Figuring out a Registered Bond

There are two methods for registering bonds. In the principal way, the issuer records the name and address of the owner, which is physically imprinted on the bond certificate. Transferring the ownership of registered bonds requires registered owners either embrace the rear of the certificate or give the certificate up to another person.

Second, a bond can be registered electronically, utilizing mechanized data sets to record a bondholder's data. Under this scenario, if an individual wishes to transfer a bond to someone else, they must hand-off the beneficiary party's personal data to the electronic bond issuer, through telephone, snail mail, or fax.

Registered bonds incorporate debt obligations that have the owner's name and contact data registered on file at the responsible company. Just the individual recognized as the registered owner, as of the interest payment date, may receive the settled upon earnings. Any individual who presents a bond certificate that isn't the registered owner on file will be denied the [coupon payment](/coupon). Assuming a registered bond is lost, taken, or obliterated, it very well may be handily supplanted due to the fact that the owner's data is on file with the issuer.

## Registered Bonds versus Bearer Bonds

Thus, bearer bonds will issue coupon payments or will repay the principal adds up to whoever is in physical possession of the certificate. A bearer bondholder just must cut the coupons joined to the bond certificate and present them for payment.

Thusly, [municipal bonds](/municipalbond), whose tax-exempt status attracted investors, turned out to be more uncommon in bearer forms, after the law came full circle.

Today, basically all bonds in the U.S. presently are registered bonds, be they corporate bonds, U.S. Treasury bonds, or municipal bonds.
