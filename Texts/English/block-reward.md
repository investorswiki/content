# Block Reward
Block reward alludes to the cryptocurrency rewarded to a miner when they effectively approve another block. The block reward is made of two parts: the block subsidy and the transactions fees. The block subsidy comprises of recently produced coins and addresses the greatest part of a block reward. The other part is comprised of all fees paid by the transactions that are remembered for the [block](/block).
Since the block reward is essentially made of the block subsidy, it is extremely considered normal to see individuals discussing the block subsidy while alluding to it as the block reward. So in well known terminology, the term "block reward" doesn't account for the fees.
On account of [Bitcoin](/bitcoin), the block subsidy began at 50 BTC and is being decreased in half every 210,000 blocks (around once like clockwork). Such a cycle is known as Bitcoin [halving](/halving). Bitcoin's block subsidy was diminished to 25 BTC in 2012, and to 12.5 BTC in 2016. The next [halving](/halving) is expected to happen in May 2020.
The recently produced coins are made by a special sort of transaction called coinbase transaction. Ordinarily, the coinbase transaction is the main transaction to be added on a block, and it fundamentally produces coins from nothing in light of the fact that the coins come from a single clear info.
