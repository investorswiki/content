## What Is Semiannual?

Semiannual is a modifier that depicts something paid, reported, distributed, or in any case happens two times every year, commonly once like clockwork.

For instance, a ten-year [general obligation bond](/generalobligationbond) issued by the Buckeye City, Ohio Consolidated School District in 2020 will pay interest on a semiannual basis every year until the bond's maturity date in 2030. Investors who buy these bonds will receive interest payments two times in every one of those years; in this case, once in June and once in December. The school district will likewise distribute a semiannual report on its finances, once in February and once in November.

## Understanding Semiannual

Semiannual is basically a word that denotes an occurrence two times every year. For instance, a company could have company parties semiannually, a couple could praise their marriage semiannually, a family could take some time off semiannually. Whatever happens two times every year happens semiannually.

If a [corporation](/corporation) pays a semiannual [dividend](/dividend) to its shareholders, the shareholders will receive dividends two times yearly. (A corporation can pick the number of dividends to convey every year â€” if any.) Financial statements or reports are habitually distributed on a quarterly (four times each year) basis. It is rare that corporations distribute financial statements just semiannually. They do, be that as it may, distribute an annual report, which per the definition, happens once consistently.

Semiannual is important to comprehend while purchasing bonds. A bond is generally portrayed in the [yield](/bond-yield) that it pays the bondholder. For instance, a $2,000 bond could have a yield of 5%. It is important to be aware if this 5% is paid annually or semiannually to comprehend the payment you would receive as the bondholder.

For instance, on the off chance that the bond paid the yield annually, the bondholder would receive $100 every year. Presently, on the off chance that the bond paid the yield semiannually, the bondholder would receive $200 every year. This is an important qualification to note while purchasing bonds.

U.S. Treasury bonds pay a yield semiannually.
