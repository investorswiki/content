# Likelihood Distribution
## What Is a Probability Distribution?

A likelihood distribution is a statistical function that depicts every one of the potential values and probabilities that a [random variable](/random-variable) can take inside a given reach. This reach will be limited between the base and maximum potential values, yet definitively where the conceivable value is probably going to be plotted on the likelihood distribution relies upon a number of factors. These factors incorporate the distribution's mean (average), [standard deviation](/standarddeviation), [skewness](/skewness), and [kurtosis](/kurtosis).

## How Probability Distributions Work

Maybe the most common likelihood distribution is the normal distribution, or "[bell curve](/bell-curve)," albeit several distributions exist that are commonly utilized. Ordinarily, the data generating cycle of some phenomenon will direct its likelihood distribution. This cycle is called the likelihood density function.

Likelihood distributions can likewise be utilized to make cumulative distribution functions (CDFs), which includes the likelihood of events cumulatively and will constantly begin at zero and end at 100%.

Scholastics, financial analysts and [fund managers](/fundmanager) the same might decide a specific stock's likelihood distribution to assess the conceivable expected returns that the stock might yield from here on out. The stock's history of returns, which can be estimated from any time interval, will probably be made out of just a small portion of the stock's returns, which will subject the analysis to [sampling error](/samplingerror). By [increasing the sample size,](/simple-random-sample) this mistake can be decisively decreased.

## Types of Probability Distributions

There are a wide range of groupings of likelihood distributions. Some of them incorporate the normal distribution, [chi square](/chi-square-measurement) distribution, [binomial distribution](/binomialdistribution), and Poisson distribution. The different likelihood distributions fill various needs and address various data generation processes. The binomial distribution, for instance, assesses the likelihood of an event happening several times over a given number of trials and given the event's likelihood in every trial. furthermore, might be produced by keeping track of the number of free tosses a basketball player that makes in a game, where 1 = a basket and 0 = a miss. Another commonplace model is utilize a fair coin and sorting out the likelihood of that coin coming up heads in 10 straight flips. A binomial distribution is **discrete**, rather than continuous, since just 1 or 0 is a legitimate response.

The most commonly utilized distribution is the normal distribution, which is utilized regularly in finance, investing, science, and engineering. The normal distribution is completely portrayed by its mean and standard deviation, meaning the distribution isn't skewed and shows kurtosis. This makes the distribution symmetric and it is portrayed as a bell-formed curve when plotted. A normal distribution is defined by a mean (average) of zero and a standard deviation of 1.0, with a skew of zero and kurtosis = 3. In a normal distribution, roughly 68% of the data collected will fall inside +/ - one standard deviation of the mean; roughly 95% inside +/ - two standard deviations; and 99.7% inside three standard deviations. Dissimilar to the binomial distribution, the normal distribution is continuous, meaning that all potential values are addressed (rather than just 0 and 1 with in the middle between).

## Likelihood Distributions Used in Investing

Stock returns are frequently assumed to be normally distributed however in reality, they display kurtosis with large negative and positive returns appearing to happen more than would be anticipated by a normal distribution. Truth be told, in light of the fact that stock prices are limited by zero however offer a possibly unlimited upside, the distribution of stock returns has been depicted as [log-normal](/log-normal-distribution). This appears on a plot of stock returns with the tails of the distribution having a greater thickness.

Likelihood distributions are much of the time utilized in risk management too to assess the likelihood and amount of losses that an investment portfolio would cause in view of a distribution of historical returns. One well known risk management metric utilized in investing is value-at-risk (VaR). VaR yields the base loss that can happen given a likelihood and time span for a portfolio. On the other hand, an investor can get a likelihood of loss for an amount of loss and time span utilizing VaR. Abuse and overreliance on [VaR](/var) has been ensnared as one of the major reasons for the 2008 financial crisis.

## Illustration of a Probability Distribution

As a simple illustration of a likelihood distribution, let us take a gander at the number saw while rolling two standard six-sided dice. Each kick the bucket has a 1/6 likelihood of rolling any single number, one through six, yet the sum of two dice will form the likelihood distribution portrayed in the picture below. Seven is the most common outcome (1+6, 6+1, 5+2, 2+5, 3+4, 4+3). Two and twelve, then again, are undeniably more uncertain (1+1 and 6+6).

## Features
- Investors use likelihood distributions to expect returns on assets like stocks over the long run and to hedge their risk.
- Likelihood distributions come in many shapes with various attributes, as defined by the mean, standard deviation, skewness, and kurtosis.
- A likelihood distribution portrays the expected outcomes of potential values for a given data generating process.
