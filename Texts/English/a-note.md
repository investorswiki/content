# A-Note
## What is A-Note?

A-note is the highest tranche of an asset-backed security (ABS) or other structured financial product. During bankruptcy, default, or other credit proceedings, A-note is senior to different notes, such as B-notes. This senior status allows the payment from the underlying assets of A-note debt before others.

A-notes can be rated, or labeled, into AAA, AA or A categories, contingent upon the credit quality of the underlying asset. They may also be alluded to as a "class A note."

## How A-Note Works

A-notes are commonly seen in [mortgage-backed securities](/mbs) (MBS), although they are an aspect of many different types of structured financial products. These [asset-backed securities](/asset-backedsecurity) include those made up of loans, insurance policies and different debts. They are structured so investments and investors are partitioned into [tranches](/tranches), each with an alternate set of risks and rewards.

This layering structure has become more normal as banks and other financial institutions have popularized the utilization of [securitization](/securitization). Through securitization, different financial assets, some riskier than others, are combined into one product. That packaged financial product is then split into tiers, each with a distinct level of risk.

Isolating the combined product in this way allows investors to purchase shares of the underlying debt pool as a type of bond. The division into tranches further enables the investors to select the level of risk and reward that best suits their motivations. Investors in A-notes tranches take on less risk, yet typically have a lower potential rate of return than holders of B-notes or C-note assets.

## Example of A-Note

For example, an investor could buy A-note in a mortgage-backed security. As long as the underlying loan is performing, investors in all tranches will receive their interest and [principal](/principal) payments on schedule. In any case, if the borrower [defaults](/default2) or some other credit proceeding takes place, the investor holding the A-note will be paid back first, before those holding lower tranches of notes. Lower level notes are alluded to as subordinate notes. Therefore, A-notes have a higher credit rating than corresponding B-notes or C-notes.

Generally speaking, A-notes have a lower interest rate than B-notes, while B-notes carry a lower interest rate than C-notes, etc. Interest rates and ratings are based on the risk of the debt. Higher interest rates on lower graded debt is there to entice borrowers.

## Limitations of 'A-Note'

A-note offers more credit protection than their subordinate counterparty notes, as investors in A-notes are bound to receive payment, even on account of a default or other credit proceeding. Notwithstanding, increased security comes at a price. A-notes typically give smaller returns to the investor than B-or C-notes. To compensate investors of subordinate notes the yields are higher to match the additional risk.

Moreover, investors in the A-note tranche must in any case pay attention to the creditworthiness of investments in the subordinate classes. As the risk levels of lower level investments increase, the chances of default and repayment risk rise for all investors.
