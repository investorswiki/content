# Horizontal Analysis
## What Is Horizontal Analysis?

Horizontal analysis is utilized in [financial statement analysis](/financial-statement-analysis) to compare historical data, like ratios, or details, over a number of accounting periods. Horizontal analysis can either utilize absolute comparisons or percentage comparisons, where the numbers in each succeeding period are communicated as a percentage of the amount in the [baseline](/baseline) year, with the baseline amount being listed as 100%. This is otherwise called [base-year analysis](/base-year-analysis).

## How Horizontal Analysis Works

Horizontal analysis permits investors and analysts to see what has been driving a company's financial performance more than several years and to spot trends and growth designs. This type of analysis empowers analysts to survey relative changes in various details over the long run and project them into what's in store. An analysis of the [income statement](/incomestatement), [balance sheet](/balancesheet), and [cash flow statement](/cashflowstatement) over the long haul gives a complete image of operational outcomes and uncovers what is driving a company's performance and whether it is operating effectively and profitably.

The analysis of critical measures of business performance, for example, [profit margins](/net_margin), [inventory turnover](/inventoryturnover), and [return on equity](/returnonequity), can recognize emerging problems and qualities. For instance, [earnings per share (EPS)](/eps) may have been rising in light of the fact that the [cost of goods sold (COGS)](/cogs) has been falling or on the grounds that sales have been developing consistently. Coverage ratios, similar to the cash flow-to-debt ratio and the interest coverage ratio, can uncover how well a company can service its debt through adequate [liquidity](/liquidity) and whether that ability is expanding or decreasing.

Vertical analysis is otherwise called [common size financial statement](/commonsizefinancialstatement) analysis.

For instance, the vertical analysis of an income statement brings about each income statement amount being repeated as a percent of net sales. In the event that a company's net sales were $2 million, they will be introduced as 100% ($2 million separated by $2 million). In the event that the cost of goods sold amount is $1 million, it will be introduced as half ($1 million separated by sales of $2 million).

Then again, horizontal analysis checks out at amounts from the financial statements over a horizon of numerous years. Horizontal analysis is likewise alluded to as **trend analysis**. Expect that the base year for analysis is three years sooner. Each of the amounts on the balance sheets and the income statements for analysis will be communicated as a percentage of the base year amounts. The amounts from three years sooner are introduced as 100% or essentially 100. The amounts from the latest years will be partitioned by the base year amounts. For example, in the event that a latest year amount was three times as large as the base year, the latest year will be introduced as 300. This type of analysis uncovers trends in details, for example, cost of goods sold.

## Analysis of Horizontal Analysis

Contingent upon which accounting period an analyst begins from and the number of accounting periods are picked, the current period can be made to show up curiously positive or negative. For instance, the current period's profits might seem great when just compared with those of the previous quarter however are entirely poor whenever compared to the outcomes for a similar quarter in the first year.

To be sure, sometimes companies change the manner in which they break down their business [segments](/fragment) to make the horizontal analysis of growth and profitability trends more hard to distinguish. Accurate analysis can be impacted by one-off events and accounting charges.

## Illustration of Horizontal Analysis

Horizontal analysis ordinarily shows the changes from the base period in dollar and percentage. For instance, a statement that says incomes have increased by 10% this past quarter is based on horizontal analysis. The percentage change is calculated by first partitioning the dollar change between the comparison year and the base year by the detail value in the base year, then, at that point, duplicating the quotient by 100.

For instance, accept an investor wishes to invest in company XYZ. The investor might wish to decide how the company developed throughout the last year. Expect that in company XYZ's base year, it reported net income of $10 million and retained earnings of $50 million. In the current year, company XYZ reported a net income of $20 million and retained earnings of $52 million. Therefore, it has an increase of $10 million in its net income and $2 million in its retained earnings year over year. In this manner, company ABC's net income became by 100% (($20 million - $10 million)/$10 million * 100) year over year, while its retained earnings just became by 4% (($52 million - $50 million)/$50 million * 100).
