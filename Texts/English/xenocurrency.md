## What Is a Xenocurrency?

The term xenocurrency alludes to any currency that is traded in markets outside of its domestic boundaries. Its name gets from the Greek prefix "xeno," signifying "foreign."

Today, the utilization of the term xenocurrency is rare as the prefix xeno can have negative undertones in modern English. Xenophobia, for instance, means an irrational fear of or scorn toward foreigners. Foreign currency, accordingly, has turned into the preferred term for alluding to non-domestic currencies.

## How Xenocurrencies Work

The term xenocurrency was developed in 1974 by the Austrian-American economist Fritz Machlup, who filled in as President of the International Economic Association from 1971 to 1974.
