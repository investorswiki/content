- Whatever other factor that a judge considers relevant to deciding if alimony ought to be awarded — and how much

Alimony payments may not be issued on the off chance that the two spouses have comparative annual incomes or on the other hand assuming the marriage is genuinely new.

- **Repayment Alimony** — Paid to repay a lower-earning spouse for expenses, for example, tuition or work training, it isn't continuous.
- **Single amount Alimony** — Paid in lieu of a property settlement, it is ordered when one spouse needs no property or things of value from their marital assets.
