# Like-Kind Exchange
## How Is a Kind Exchange?

A like-kind exchange is a tax-deferred transaction that considers the disposal of an asset and the acquisition of [another comparable asset](/like-kindproperty) without generating a capital gains tax liability from the sale of the first asset.

Until the section of tax legislation in December 2017, that might have incorporated the exchange of one business for another — or one piece of substantial property, like work of art or heavy equipment, for another. After 2017, a like-kind exchange applies just to the exchange of a business or real estate investment property for another property.

## How a Like-Kind Exchange Works

At the point when a commercial property or investment property is sold for a gain, the investor is required to pay a capital gains tax on the profit earned. All capital gains are taxed at either the short-term capital gains rate between 10% to 37% for profits made on a sale in the span of one year or the long-term rate, which falls between 10% to 20% for profits made on a sale following one year of the initial purchase date.

Notwithstanding, [Section 1031](/section1031) of the Internal Revenue Code (IRC) excludes an investor from making a tax payment on a gain on the off chance that the proceeds from the sale or disposal of the property are reinvested in a comparative property of equivalent or greater value as part of a qualifying like-kind exchange. Any real estate, with the exception of one's very own residence, is viewed as like-kind to some other real estate. Generally, any real estate property held for useful use in the trade or business or for investment meets all requirements for a like-kind exchange.

A taxpayer that sells a piece of investment property and buys one more inside a stipulated time limit won't need to pay tax on the first disposal. They should pay tax upon sale or disposal of the second property except if another like-kind exchange is finished, in which case the tax payment will be deferred again.

There are several important contemplations to keep as a top priority with a like-kind exchange to guarantee that a [tax liability](/taxliability) isn't made upon the sale of the first asset:

1. The asset being sold must be an investment property and can't be a personal residence.
1. The asset being purchased with the proceeds must be like the asset being sold.
1. The proceeds from the sale must be utilized to purchase the other asset in somewhere around 180 days of the sale of the first asset, in spite of the fact that you must distinguish the property or asset that you are purchasing in the like-kind exchange in no less than 45 days of the sale.

There are a few limitations on the amount of capital gain that is tax-deferred, so guarantee that you check the most recent tax rules before continuing with a like-kind exchange.

## Special Considerations

Notwithstanding the tax deferral benefits, a like-kind exchange permits the seller to concede their depreciation recapture-the gain received from the sale of depreciable capital property that must be reported as income for income tax purposes. A taxpayer can likewise stay away from state taxes on like-kind exchanges.

For instance, a few states expect that either a buyer or seller pay [state income taxes](/state-income-tax) when a property is sold, known as state mandatory withholding. Property moved in a like-kind exchange, be that as it may, can receive an exemption. To claim the exemption, the taxpayer should sign an exemption form or certificate given by the state. A few states require the seller to present the exemption 20 days before closing, while different states might permit the exemption form to submitted at close.

## Benefits and Disadvantages of a Like-Kind Exchange

The most over the top glaring benefit of a like-kind exchange is the favorable tax treatment. Under this exchange, an asset can be replaced with a like-kind asset without triggering a taxable event. The exchange need not be with an asset indistinguishable from the one being replaced; it must be in a similar asset class.

The IRS draws no line on how frequently somebody can do a 1031 exchange. In this way, investors can constantly search for additional lucrative opportunities. Likewise, money that would have been utilized to pay capital gains taxes is available for reinvestment.

Albeit a like-kind exchange offers tax benefits, they are transitory. Taxes are deferred, not dispensed with. Eventually, capital gains taxes will be due. Likewise, on the off chance that the exchange doesn't occur inside the recommended period or as per IRS rules, the transaction will become taxable.

Just as capital gains taxes are deferred, losses are as well. A like-kind exchange that incorporates losses must be carried forward.
