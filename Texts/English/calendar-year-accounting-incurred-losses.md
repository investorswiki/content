## Breaking Down Calendar Year Accounting Incurred Losses

Calendar year accounting incurred losses allude to any amount of money an insurance company either pays or can never again count as a [asset ](/asset)on its books.

## Wellsprings of Incurred Losses

**Insurance claims**. A [insurance claim](/insurance_claim) addresses a request from a policyholder for coverage or compensation for a covered loss or policy event. The insurance industry sees the amounts paid to claimants as losses, on the grounds that the money spent to pay claims is money that is leaving the company instead of staying with it, and that money is presently not an asset of the insurance company.

**Reconsideration of claims**. Reconsideration of claims happen when, after a survey of the insurer's insurance claims currently in process, the insurer determines the value of the claims to be greater than or not exactly the value previously kept in its books. The reconsideration would bring about an accounting incurred loss to the insurer on the off chance that the recently determined value of the claims is higher than the value previously recorded.

**Changes to loss reserves**. Loss reserves are the amount of money planned or set to the side by the management of an insurance company, toward the beginning of the year, for payment of old claims and the anticipated payment of new claims. Regulators require U.S. insurers to keep up with loss reserves to cover claims. Requirements for loss reserves are regularly set at the state level, yet standard levels range from 8% to 12% of the insurers' total incomes. As an insurer's incomes change, the amount that is commanded for loss reserves additionally changes. Changes to loss reserves would bring about an accounting incurred loss assuming that the amount required for the loss reserves increased.
