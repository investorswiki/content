# Capital Decay
## What Is Capital Decay?

Capital decay is a [economic](/economics) term alluding to the amount of [revenue](/revenue) that is lost by a company due to [obsolete](/obsolescencerisk) technology or obsolete business rehearses. A failure to adjust to the times and reinvest accordingly can lead once-steadfast [customers](/client) to escape, burdening sales and the future reasonability of the company.

## Figuring out Capital Decay

The business world is competitive. Things change, production strategies improve, and new, more [efficient](/effectiveness) advancements show up on the scene to dislodge those that preceded it. Companies that fail to improve or possibly keep up with the latest developments risk losing [market share](/marketshare), being stripped of their revenue, and being effectively moved aside by their hungrier rivals.

> Capital decay has become a developing problem for companies in recent years as the rate of mechanical development continues to increase.

No one is invulnerable from capital decay, albeit a few companies are more helpless than others. Clear models remember those operating for [industries](/industry) where technology will in general move rapidly or where [barriers to entry](/barrierstoentry) — high [startup costs](/startup-capital) or different impediments that keep new competitors from effectively entering an industry or area of business — are low.

Whenever a business gets along nicely, all things considered, others will watch from a remote place and plotting how to repeat its prosperity. On the off chance that barriers to entry are low and the send off of a promptly effective rival offering can be executed at a reasonable cost, anticipate that savage competition should be forthcoming.

Companies that use more seasoned [business models](/businessmodel) and that are locked into them due to management inflexibility or high [fixed](/fixedcost)/[sunk costs](/sunkcost) are most at risk of experiencing capital decay. It's a lot simpler to change and develop when the costs incurred for doing so are reasonable; less so when so much [capital](/capital) is tied up in old technology and approaches to carrying on with work.

## Instances of Capital Decay

Capital decay was the boon of many companies in the mid 20th century when modern production methods originally came into utilization. At the point when Henry Ford started to utilize the assembly line for auto production, companies that depended on their employees to build a whole vehicle experienced capital decay and either left business or sold out to Ford Motor Co. (F) or another competitor.

A later illustration of a company that battled to keep up with change is Blockbuster. The rise of the Internet and video web-based features drew customers from stores and booths to online platforms. As is much of the time the case, numerous pundits, [investors](/financial backer), and executives failed to see this shift coming until it was too late.

Blockbuster, in the same way as other different companies that have become wiped out throughout the long term, wasn't altogether irreproachable for its destruction. In 2000, Reed Hastings, founder of the then-obscure Netflix Inc. (NFLX), traveled to Dallas to meet with Blockbuster [CEO](/ceo) John Antioco about striking a partnership.

> Blockbuster went from churning out sales of $5.9 billion out of 2003 to posting $1.1 billion in revenue losses in 2010.

The proposal was for Netflix to run Blockbuster's brand online and for Blockbuster to advance Netflix in its stores. This idea was quickly dismissed by Antioco and his team. At that point, Blockbuster was the king of the video rental industry, with a devoted client base and huge number of retail outlets. Management saw not a great explanation for why that would change and continued to tenaciously hide from reality until [disruptor](/troublesome technology) Netflix took its crown and at last forced Blockbuster into [bankruptcy](/bankruptcy).

## Special Considerations

In any event, when an industry seems, by all accounts, to be in total decline and past saving, there can in any case be ways of keeping up with and squeeze out revenues. Survival frequently relies on flexibility and management's responsiveness. Take Arm and Hammer, for instance. Toward the finish of the 1960s, it looked bound to fail as home baking declined and packaged food varieties were presented with baking pop.

Against this interesting scenery, management found a way for the company to bounce back. To start with, it found a method for involving its baking soft drink product as a deodorizer for coolers. Then, at that point, in later years, baking soft drink started being conveyed as a laundry added substance, toothpaste added substance, and floor covering revitalizer.

Executives that keep their ear to the ground and are sufficiently modest to recognize the requirement for companies to rehash themselves sometimes have a greatly improved chance of remaining above water than the individuals who get out of hand with their prosperity and accept that [life cycles](/lifecycle) are endless. A small bunch of companies have been around for a really long time. The overwhelming majority, nonetheless, rarely endures in excess of a couple of many years.
