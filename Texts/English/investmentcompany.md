## What Is an Investment Company?

An investment company is a corporation or trust participated in the business of investing the pooled capital of investors in financial securities. This is most frequently done either through a closed-end fund or an open-end fund (likewise alluded to as a mutual fund). In the U.S., most investment companies are registered with and regulated by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) under the Investment Company Act of 1940.

An investment company is otherwise called "fund company" or "fund sponsor." They frequently partner with [third-party distributors](/thirdpartydistributor) to sell mutual funds.

## Understanding an Investment Company

Investment companies are business elements, both privately and publicly owned, that make due, sell and market funds to the public. The primary business of an investment company is to hold and oversee securities for investment purposes, yet they ordinarily offer investors various funds and investment services, which incorporate [portfolio management](/portfoliomanagement), recordkeeping, custodial, legal, bookkeeping and tax management services.

An investment company can be a corporation, partnership, business trust or [limited liability company](/llc) (LLC) that pools money from investors on a collective basis. The money pooled is invested, and the investors share any profits and losses incurred by the company as per every investor's interest in the company. For instance, expect an investment company pooled and invested $10 million from a number of clients, who address the fund company's shareholders. A client who contributed $1 million will have a vested interest of 10% in the company, which would likewise convert into any losses or profits earned.

Investment companies are sorted into three types: [closed-end funds](/closed-endinvestment), mutual funds (or [open-end funds](/open-endfund)) and [unit investment trusts](/uit) (UITs). Every one of these three investment companies must register under the Securities Act of 1933 and the Investment Company Act of 1940. Units or shares in closed-end funds are normally offered at a discount to their [net asset value](/nav) (NAV) and are traded on stock exchanges. Investors who need to sell shares will sell them to different investors on the secondary market at not entirely settled by market powers and participants, making them not redeemable. Since investment companies with a closed-end structure issue just a fixed number of shares, ever changing trading of the shares in the market no affects the portfolio.

As investors move their money all through the fund, the fund extends and contracts, individually. Open-ended funds are frequently restricted to investing in liquid assets, given that the investment managers need to plan such that the fund can satisfy the needs for investors who might need their money back out of the blue.

Like mutual funds, unit investment trusts are additionally redeemable, as units held by the trust can be sold back to the investment company.

Investment companies create gains by buying and selling shares, property, bonds, cash, different funds and different assets. The portfolio that is made utilizing the pool of funds is generally diversified and managed by an expert fund manager, who can decide to invest in specific markets, ventures or even unlisted businesses that are at beginning phases in their development. In return, clients gain access to a wide cluster of investment products that they typically could not have possibly had the option to access. The progress of the fund depends on how effective the manager's strategy is. Likewise, investors ought to have the option to save money on trading costs since the investment company can gain [economies of scale](/economiesofscale) in operations.
