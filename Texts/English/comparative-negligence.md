## What Is Comparative Negligence?

Comparative negligence is a principle of [tort law](/tort-law) that applies to casualty insurance in certain states. Comparative negligence states that when an accident happens, the shortcoming and additionally negligence of each party included depends on their separate contributions to the accident. This permits insurers to assign fault and pay [insurance claims](/insurance_claim) likewise.

## Grasping Comparative Negligence

Comparative negligence is most commonly used to assign fault in car accidents. On the off chance that two drivers both break similar traffic laws in an accident, both might be denied their claims. Numerous [insurance carriers](/insurance) assign pin between drivers on a percentage basis, for example, 70/30.

In the event that two gatherings are engaged with an auto accident, the insurers utilize comparative negligence to assign shortcoming. Determining shortcoming in an accident is a critical part of insurance. Insurance companies [litigate](/case risk) to guarantee that they are just obligated for damages brought about by their insured client. Also, defense lawyers will endeavor to limit responsibility to the littlest degree conceivable. Looking into actions that prompted an accident, insurers and the courts determine how to assign shortcoming. That interaction is the embodiment of comparative negligence. The determination of issue will at last lead to concluding how much the insurer must pay.

The damages are awarded relatively founded on the degrees of determined negligence. The party who is found less responsible still has a percentage of the fault assigned to them. The percentage of negligence connected to the less responsible party is called [contributory negligence](/contributory-negligence). In the situation of a lawsuit coming about because of a fender bender, the contributory negligence would be the offended party's inability to exercise reasonable care for their safety. In this somewhat common situation, respondents utilize contributory negligence as a defense.

## Types of Comparative Negligence

Comprehensively, there are three types of comparative negligence rules followed inside various jurisdictions in the United States. They rely upon the percentage of negligence assigned to parties associated with an accident.

### Pure Comparative Negligence

The pure comparative negligence rule permits the offended party to recuperate damages even assuming that they are assigned almost 100% problem for the accident. In such a case, the offended party can in any case recuperate 1% of the damages assessed from the respondent. Thirteen states, including California and New York, follow this rule.

### Modified Comparative Negligence

The modified comparative negligence rule denies offended parties from recuperating [monetary damages](/compensatory-damages) on the off chance that they are assigned to blame past a certain percentage. Ten states, including Colorado and Maine, follow the half bar rule. This means an offended party isn't permitted to recuperate damages in the event that their shortcoming percentage for an accident is half or more. 23 states, including Illinois and Oregon, follow the 51% bar rule, meaning offended parties can't recuperate assuming their shortcoming percentage is 51% or greater.

### Slight/Gross Negligence

South Dakota is the main state to perceive the slight/gross negligence rule. In this rule, issue percentages assigned in an accident are supplanted by "slight" and "gross" contributions to an accident. In effect, the amount of an award in an accident is greater on the off chance that an offended party's contribution to an accident is slight and the respondent's contribution is gross. Gross, in this specific situation, means careless and conscious disregard for the harmed party's safety.

On the other hand, the injury amount awarded to an offended party is less assuming that their contribution to an accident was more than "slight." for instance, on the off chance that a vehicle that hopped a traffic signal harms a jaywalker, the jaywalker will be [awarded less in damages](/common damages) than if they were crossing a green traffic light.

Four states, including Maryland and Alabama, and one jurisdiction, Washington D.C., follow the pure contributory negligence rule. In this rule, an offended party is barred from recuperating damages on the off chance that they contributed even marginally to an accident.

## Special Considerations

Comparative negligence is a sort of careless tort. The term careless tort incorporates hurt done to individuals generally through the disappointment of one more to exercise a certain level of care, in some cases defined as a reasonable standard of care. Accidents are a standard illustration of careless torts.

Careless torts address one of three categories of tort law that are generally used to grasp the system. The other two are purposeful torts and [liability](/liability) torts. A deliberate tort alludes to hurt done to individuals intentionally by the unshakable unfortunate behavior of another, like attack, fraud, and theft. Not at all like negligence and purposeful torts, severe liability torts center around the actual act rather than the culpability of the person causing the damage.
