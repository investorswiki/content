# Tandem Plan
## What Was a Tandem Plan?

A tandem plan was a mortgage purchase program sponsored by the U.S. government. Under a tandem plan or program, the Government National Mortgage Association ([GNMA](/ginniemae)), informally known as Ginnie Mae, bought mortgages at a discounted market price and afterward sold them through the Federal National Mortgage Association (FNMA), better known as Fannie Mae and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp. (FHLMC), typically called Freddie Mac.

In effect, [GNMA](/ginniemae) footed the difference between the purchase and sale price of the mortgages that it buys. This type of structure allowed for very low-interest rates, making the loans available to hopeful homebuyers who wouldn't have the option to manage the cost of them in any case. Ginnie Mae originally sent off a series of tandem plans in 1970. Congress made the major program for conforming loans, authoritatively known as the Brooke-Cranston GNMA Tandem Plan, in 1974, with the entry of the Emergency Home Purchase Assistance Act.

Starting around 2019, new loans are done being funded through the Brooke-Cranston Tandem Plan, however the concept of special assistance programs actually exists. A comparative plan could be restored should the mortgage money supply become too tight.

## How Tandem Plan Loans Worked

Tandem loans gave monetary assistance to builders and engineers of non-benefit public housing. This is the way the Department of Housing and Urban Development website depicted the cycle:

"The program is adaptable regarding the types of housing which can be given and the types of tenants which can be served. It permits line, stroll up, elevator, and gathered or dissipated single-family construction. Projects may likewise be developed related to other Federal or State programs," it stated. "FNMA participation in construction advances for up to 95% is available whether the commitment contracts are held by FNMA or GNMA."

Interest reduction payments could be made for a rental or cooperative housing project, owned by a private nonprofit entity, a limited distribution entity, or a cooperative housing corporation, which is financed under a state or nearby program which gives assistance through loans, loan insurance, or tax abatement.

To fit the bill for interest reduction payments, a project was required to be submitted for endorsement prior to completion. Projects didn't should be financed with [HUD](/us-department-housing-urban-development-hud)- [FHA](/fhaloan) insured mortgages, and HUD-FHA would perceive the organization and operation of the project under state or neighborhood programs to the degree they were not conflicting with the National Housing Act, as per the agency.
