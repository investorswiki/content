## What Is a Lock Limit?

A lock limit is a predefined price movement determined by a [exchange](/exchange) that, in the event that penetrated brings about a trading halt of that instrument past the lock limit price. "Lock limits" commonly allude to the [futures markets](/futures), with the connected terms "[curbs](/tradingcurb)" or "[circuit breakers](/circuitbreaker)" utilized in the stock markets.

Lock limits assist with managing markets and keep them more quiet and orderly. Traders might in any case have the option to execute at the lock limit price, or inside of it, however trading is halted outside of the lock limit price. Lock limits halts might be brief, like five minutes, or they might be in place for the afternoon. Every futures contract has lock limit specifications appended to it.

Lock limits are moderately uncommon in practice and might be regulated and founded diversely among various exchanges.

## Understanding a Lock Limit

Lock limits are utilized across exchanges to control the volatility of trading instruments. They are utilized in futures markets, as well as stocks, albeit in the stock market the term circuit breaker is more normal. The concept is something similar.

Lock limits are in place consistently and are applied to both upside and downside moves. For instance, in the event that the limit on corn is $0.25, a $0.25 go up or down from the prior close will trigger a lock. Assuming that the price has dropped, trading won't happen below the lock limit. This is called [limit down](/limitdown). Assuming the price arrives at the upper limit, the futures contract is [limit up](/limitup). At the point when this happens, trading can't happen over this level during the lock.

Contingent upon the futures contract, trading might be halted completely during a lock limit, or just inside the lock limit price. For instance, in the event that the price is limit down, a big buyer could step in and buy from the sellers at the lock limit price, and afterward [bid](/bid) the price up to push the price away from the lock limit. Trading would then happen as expected as long as the price stays over the lock limit. In different cases, the futures contract might be suspended for the day once the limit is reached.

The next day, another lock limit price would be initiated, and trading can resume up/down to the next lock limit price.

## How Lock Limits Work

For instance, consider soybean dinner trading last closed at 300. The lock limit is 20, subject to change. That means that a solitary day move to 320 or 280 would trigger the lock limit. In the event that the market goes limit up, trading can't occur over 320. Assuming as far as possible down, trading can't occur below 280.

A few futures likewise have [expanded or variable limits](/variablepricelimit). This means that on the off chance that numerous contracts, for various months, go limit up/down, the next day the limit is expanded. On account of soybean dinner, the expanded limit is half, which builds the limit the next day to 30. Assuming the market was limit down at 280, the next day the limit down price will be 250 and the limit up price 310. The limit stays at the expanded rate on the off chance that the price goes limit up/down once more, yet contracts back to 20 in the event that the expanded lock limit isn't hit.
