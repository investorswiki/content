## What Is Chain Banking?

Chain banking is a form of bank governance that happens when a small group of individuals control no less than three independently [chartered](/charteredbank) banks. By and large, the controlling parties are majority shareholders or the heads of interlocking directorates. Chain banking as an entity has declined alongside a flood in [interstate banking](/interstate-banking).

## Understanding Chain Banking

Chain banks became a force to be reckoned with after the stock market crash of 1929. They were well known in light of the fact that they spread risk among groups of banks, rather than focusing it on a single entity. As per a 1931 report led by a Federal Reserve committee, chain banking originally emerged in North Dakota, where a David H. Beecher purchased a bank in 1884 and another in 1887.

Hence, this form of bank ownership became well known in the south. Starting in 1896, the Witham organization purchased a series of banks and controlled almost 200 banks in New York, New Jersey, Georgia and Florida thirty years after the fact.

A major motivation behind why chain banking flourished in the northwest and southern states is on the grounds that they didn't permit branch banking. New Jersey turned into the principal state in 1889 to lay out legal precedent for the foundation of a corporation that was formed exclusively to hold stocks in different companies. Banking organizations and people exploited this law to expand their ownership of other financial institutions.

In chain banking, at least three banks function independently without the traditional obstructions of a [holding company](/holdingcompany). A bank holding company is a parent corporation, limited liability company, or limited partnership that claims enough of the original bank's voting stock to control its policies and management. The activities of separate banks inside chain banking don't overlap (as once in a while happens in a holding company) with the goal that the revenue is boosted however much as could be expected.

## Advantages and Disadvantages of Chain Banking

Yet, less competition and risk can likewise unfavorably affect banking services for a particular region since it limits customer decision. By restraining competition and risk, chain banking can likewise lead to centralization of services in the hands of select players. The interrelationships between different banks in a chain banking system means that a disappointment in one bank can impel issues in different institutions affiliated to it.

## Chain Banking Versus Interstate Banking

Interstate banking filled fundamentally during the 1980s, a period during which state councils passed new laws that permitted bank holding companies to obtain out-of-state banks on a reciprocal basis with different states. As verified over, the rise in interstate banking has connected with a decline in chain banking.

Interstate banking filled in three phases. The initially started during the 1980s with regional banks, which formed when smaller, independent banks merged to make larger banks. Following this, the Riegle-Neal Interstate Banking and Branching Efficiency Act permitted banks which met [capital requirements](/capitalrequirement) to obtain banks in some other state after September 29, 1995. These legislative acts brought about the beginning of cross country interstate banking.

Numerous investment banking systems are auxiliaries of bulge bracket firms like Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, and Deutsche Bank.
