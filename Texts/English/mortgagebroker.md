## What Is a Mortgage Broker?

A mortgage broker is an intermediary who brings mortgage borrowers and mortgage lenders together, however who doesn't utilize their own funds to [originate mortgages](/mortgage_originator). A mortgage broker assists borrowers with associating with lenders and searches out the best fit in terms of the borrower's financial situation and loan cost needs. The mortgage broker likewise assembles desk work from the borrower and gives that administrative work to a mortgage lender for underwriting and endorsement purposes. The broker earns a commission from either the borrower, the lender, or both at closing.

A mortgage broker ought not be mistaken for a [mortgage banker,](/mortgagebanker) which closes and funds a mortgage with its own funds.

## How Mortgage Brokers Work

A mortgage broker fills in as intermediary among borrowers and lenders in the real estate market. Whether a potential borrower is buying another home or refinancing, a broker accumulates loan options from different lenders for the borrower to consider, while qualifying the borrower for a mortgage with those lenders simultaneously. The broker likewise accumulates financial data like income, assets, and employment documentation; a credit report; and other data for surveying the borrower's ability to secure financing that is then given to possible lenders.

The broker decides a fitting loan amount, [loan-to-value (LTV) ratio](/loantovalue), and the borrower's ideal loan type, then submits the loan to a lender for endorsement. The broker speaks with the borrower and the lender during the whole transaction through closing.

Once agreed upon, mortgage funds are loaned for the sake of the mortgage lender, and the mortgage broker gathers a commission called a [origination fee](/origination-fee) from the lender as compensation for its services. The borrower might be responsible for paying all or part of that fee in the [closing statement](/closingstatement). The broker possibly gets compensated when the loan transaction is completed.

A loan officer from a big bank might keep a borrower on hold for an extended period of time in light of the fact that the officer is working with numerous borrowers immediately. On the off chance that a loan starting through a loan officer is declined, no further action is taken with the bank.

A few lenders work only with mortgage brokers, giving borrowers access to loans that would somehow not be accessible to them. Likewise, brokers can get lenders to forgo application, [appraisal](/appraisal), origination, and different fees. Big banks work solely with loan officers and don't forgo fees.
