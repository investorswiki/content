# EBIT/EV Multiple
## What Is the EBIT/EV Multiple?

The EBIT/EV different, shorthand for [earnings before interest and taxes](/ebit) (EBIT) separated by [enterprise value](/enterprisevalue) (EV), is a financial ratio used to measure a company's "earnings yield."

The concept of the EBIT/EV various as a proxy for [earnings yield](/earningsyield) and value was presented by Joel Greenblatt, a significant [value investor](/valueinvesting) and teacher at Columbia Business School.

## Figuring out the EBIT/EV Multiple

Enterprise value (EV) is a measure used to value a company. Investors frequently use EV while looking at companies against each other for conceivable investment since EV gives a clearer image of the real value of a company instead of essentially considering [market capitalization](/marketcapitalization).

EV is an important part of several ratios investors can use to compare companies, like the EBIT/EV different and [EV/Sales](/enterprisevaluesales). The EV of a business can be calculated utilizing the following formula:

>
>  EV = Equity Market Capitalization + Total Debt âˆ’ Cash (and Cash Equivalents)
>

The EV result shows how much money would be expected to buy the whole company. Some EV computations incorporate the expansion of [minority interest](/minorityinterest) and [preferred stock](/preferredstock). However, for by far most of companies, minority interest and preferred stock in the capital structure is remarkable. In this way, EV is generally calculated without them.

EBIT/EV should be an earnings yield, so the higher the various, the better for an investor. There is an implicit bias toward companies with lower levels of debt and higher measures of cash. A company with a leveraged [balance sheet](/balancesheet), all else being equivalent, is more dangerous than a company with less [leverage](/leverage). The company with unassuming measures of debt or potentially greater cash holdings will have a more modest EV, which would deliver a higher earnings yield.

## Benefits of the EBIT/EV Multiple

The EBIT/EV ratio can give a better comparison than more conventional profitability ratios, for example, [return on equity](/returnonequity) (ROE) or [return on invested capital](/returnoninvestmentcapital) (ROIC). While the EBIT/EV ratio isn't ordinarily utilized, it has two or three key benefits in looking at companies.

To start with, utilizing EBIT as a measure of profitability, rather than [net income](/netincome) (NI), takes out the possibly misshaping effects of differences in tax rates. Second, utilizing EBIT/EV standardizes for effects of various [capital structures](/capitalstructure).

Greenblatt states that EBIT "allows us to put companies with various levels of debt and different [tax rates](/taxrate) on fair terms while looking at earnings yields." In his eyes, EV is more fitting as the denominator since it considers the value of [debt](/debt), as well as the market capitalization.

> A downside to the EBIT/EV ratio is that it doesn't standardize for depreciation and [amortization](/amortization) costs. Subsequently, there are as yet potential mutilating effects when companies utilize various methods of accounting for fixed assets.

## Illustration of the EBIT/EV Multiple

Say Company X has:

- EBIT of $3.5 billion;
- A market capitalization of $40 billion;
- $7 billion in debt; and
- $1.5 billion in cash.

Company Z has:

- EBIT of $1.3 billion;
- A market cap of $18 billion;
- $12 billion in debt; and
- $0.6 billion in cash.

EBIT/EV for Company X would be around 7.7%, while the earnings yield for Company Z would be roughly 4.4%. Company X's earnings yield is unrivaled on the grounds that it has greater EBIT, yet in addition since it has lower leverage.

## Features
- Investors and analysts utilize the EBIT/EV various to comprehend how earnings yield converts into a company's value.
- The higher the EBIT/EV different, the better for the investor as this shows the company has low debt levels and higher measures of cash.
- The EBIT/EV numerous allows investors to successfully compare earnings yields between companies with various debt levels and tax rates, in addition to other things.
