# Exempt Employee
## What Is an Exempt Employee?

The term "exempt employee" alludes to a category of employees set out in the [Fair Labor Standards Act](/fair-labor-standards-act-flsa) (FLSA). Exempt employees don't receive extra time pay, nor do they fit the bill for [minimum wage](/minimum_wage). At the point when an employee is exempt, it basically means that they are exempt from getting extra time pay. Exempt employees stand as opposed to [nonexempt employees](/nonexempt-employee).

## Figuring out an Exempt Employee

In any work environment, there are two types of employees: exempt and nonexempt. Exempt employees are the people who are exempt from the lowest pay permitted by law and additional time pay requirements. This is on the grounds that exempt employees are paid a salary as opposed to a time-based compensation, and they work in what are viewed as executive or professional jobs. Exempt employees frequently receive year-end bonuses to make up for the type of work they do, as well with respect to any extra time work.

Requirements vary from one state to another, yet the FLSA arranges exempt employees as any job that falls into these categories:

- Professional
- Administrative
- Executive
- Outside sales
- PC related

These characterizations are very wide — which they are intended to be, as they envelop various jobs in a wide range of industries. As of Jan. 1, 2022, the FLSA specifies that employees in the above categories are exempt in the event that they are paid by salary rather than hourly, and assuming they earn at least $684 each week or $35,568 every year. In 2022, 26 U.S. states will be expanding the lowest pay permitted by law, subsequently, this threshold is probably going to change in certain areas.

Notwithstanding the principal categories of exempt employees, different categories of employees may conceivably be viewed as exempt from getting extra time pay. These incorporate farmworkers; movie theater employees; certain employees of nonmetropolitan broadcast stations; cabbies; employees of railways, motor transporters, and American vessels; and [commissioned sales](/commission) employees of retail or service elements.

## Exempt Employees, Nonexempt Employees, and the Fair Labor Standards Act

The exempt employee category was made by the FLSA, passed in 1938. The watershed labor law safeguards workers against unfair pay practices and work regulations. The law has been enormously changed throughout recent years, however it is as yet one of the main labor laws in the history of the United States, setting regulations for a wide cluster of employee-and employer-related issues.

The FLSA determines the conditions when workers are to be paid and not expected to be paid. For example, while working excess hours, an exempt employee doesn't receive additional time or something extra. Something extra is 1.5 times the hourly rate of the employee — the base an employer needs to pay for additional time. The act stamps extra time as any hours that surpass 40 hours in a seven-day long week of work.

## Benefits and Disadvantages of Exempt Employee Status

The professionals of being an exempt employee start with the security of realizing that you have a consistent paycheck. Likewise, exempt employees tend to earn more than hourly ones and approach such additional items as retirement benefits, including individual retirement accounts (IRAs), [401(k)](/401kplan) plans, and annuities; bonuses; employer-sponsored healthcare plans; and paid vacation time and sick days.

The downside comes generally in not being eligible for extra time. Depending on the mindset of your employer, you could wind up working long hours to satisfy an over-burden work portfolio with no recourse for extra reimbursement or diminishing the stress brought on by the long hours. In short, you are helpless before your chief.
