# Architecture Billings Index (ABI)
## What Is the Architecture Billings Index (ABI)?

The Architecture Billings Index (ABI) is a leading [economic indicator](/economic_indicator) of demand for non-private construction activity. This incorporates both commercial and industrial buildings. A positive ABI can be an indication of strength or recovery in the more extensive economy, while a negative ABI can signal weakness or an approaching downturn.

## Understanding the Architecture Billings Index (ABI)

The Architecture Billings Index (ABI), delivered by the AIA Economics and Market Research Group, depends on reactions to the American Institute of Architect's (Aia's) month to month Work-on-the-Boards survey, which asks the [principals](/head) and partners of AIA part claimed design firms whether their billing activity for the previous month developed, declined, or remained [flat](/flat).

With headquarters in Washington, D.C., the AIA has been gathering data from its individuals through this survey for north of 20 years. The ABI offers an around nine-to year look into the fate of nonresidential construction spending activity. Commercial and industrial building activity incorporates the construction of inns, office buildings, multi-family homes, schools, clinics, and other institutional buildings.

Month to month results are seasonally adjusted to take into account comparison to prior months. The regional and [sector](/sector) data are figured out utilizing a three-month moving average. The change in billing activity gives understanding into the level of demand for design services from engineering firms, which thus gives knowledge into the level of interest in developing new buildings.

The ABI gives knowledge on a national level as well as a regional level and is broken down by sector. In the U.S., in January 2020, before the recession due to the pandemic, the national ABI remained at 52 for billings and 56 for design contracts. By November 2020, the ABI has diminished to 46.3 for billings and 48.6 for design contracts. The most recent ABI perusing (May 2021) shows that business conditions at architecture firms had bounced back to 58.5 for billings and 63.2 for design contracts.

## Deciphering ABI Scores

A score of 50 shows a balance among positive and negative reports, while a score of 100 demonstrates all organizations reported improvements. A rise in the index over 50 means that more firms reported an increase in [demand](/demand) for design services than reported a decline in demand.

It's important to note that a rise in the index over 50 is certainly not a direct measure of the rise in demand, on the grounds that the survey doesn't ask firms reporting more grounded demand to evaluate the level of increase in demand, nor does it give data on the size of those organizations. That being said, higher readings in the ABI generally harmonize with developing demand.

The ABI influences various types of businesses, from architecture firms to reprographics companies to contractors. Design and construction firms counsel ABI while doing strategic planning and deciding [business-cycle](/businesscycle) shifts as it is a decent indicator of market variances and construction trends. The AIA likewise offers an Inquiries Index, which measures expected business rather than real business.

## Benefits of the ABI

Monetary specialists and advisors take a gander at the ABI in combination with other economic indicators like [New Home Sales](/newhomesales), blunder futures prices, and [gross domestic product](/gdp) (GDP) data, to assist with figuring out the state of the economy and to assist with investment choices.

The ABI likewise helps companies engaged with the design and construction process in a wide range of ways. For instance, it can assist compositional firms with budgeting, recognizing opportunities, resource management, hiring and payroll management, and share guidance.
