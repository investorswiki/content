## How Do You Calculate Payroll Taxes?

How you ascertain payroll taxes will rely upon your business and your nearby laws. However, here are a few basic rules given by QuickBooks. The first step is to work out your employees' gross pay.

### 1. Ascertain your employees' gross pay

You can determine an employee's gross pay using their pay rate and your scheduled pay periods. Most businesses will pay employees weekly, at regular intervals, or month to month. To compute an hourly employee's gross pay, duplicate their hours worked in the pay period by their time-based compensation rate. The formula is as follows:

>
> Hourly rate x total hours worked in the pay period = gross pay
>

To compute a salaried employee's gross pay, partition their annual salary by the number of pay periods in the year. The formula is as follows:

>
> Yearly salary/number of pay periods in year = gross pay
>

For instance. An employee makes $50,000 every year. Their company pays employees like clockwork for a total of 26 pay periods. Hence, the employee's gross pay is $1,923.08.

### 2. Take out pre-tax deductions

Subsequent to determining gross pay, you'll have to factor out deductions. These are tax deductions, however other pre-tax deductions may likewise apply. Pre-tax deductions include:

- [401(k)](/401kplan) and some retirement plans
- Medical coverage plans
- [Wellbeing Savings Account](/hsa) (HSA) or Flexible Spending Account (FSA) contributions
- Some life insurance plans

### 3. Deduct taxes (FICA, unemployment, and income taxes)

Whenever you have taken out pre-tax deductions, the remaining pay is taxed. The FICA tax rate is 7.65% — 1.45% for Medicare and 6.2% for Social Security taxes. Other tax rates will be determined by Federal, state, or nearby laws and your employee's W-4.

Compute federal income taxes using IRS tax tables. Most frequently, you will pay federal taxes when you pay Social Security and Medicare taxes. Report all payments on IRS Form 941.

Deduct the 7.65% FICA tax from the employee's gross pay. You, as the employer, must match every employee's contribution. The business submits both the employee's and the company's contributions to Social Security and Medicare.

For instance, an employee acquires $1,923 in gross pay for the most recent pay period. To ascertain the employee's Social Security tax contribution, increase $1,923 by .062 to get $119.26. To work out the employee's Medicare tax contribution, duplicate $1,923 by .0145 to get $27.88. In total, the employee's FICA tax contribution is $147.14 for the pay period, which the employer must match. In this case, the employer must pay $294.28 to the IRS. Half is a direct expense to the company, and the other half is withheld from the employee's paycheck.

Employers don't match income tax deductions, yet they pay federal unemployment taxes. The IRS's Income Withholding Assistant will assist you with determining how much federal income taxes your employees owe.

### 4. Any voluntary deductions must be taken from the remaining wages.

These may include:

- [Roth 401(k)](/roth401k) contributions
- Life insurance plans
- Long-term disability insurance plans
- Wage garnishments
- Union dues

After all taxes and deductions, the remaining amount is how much the employee takes home on payday.
