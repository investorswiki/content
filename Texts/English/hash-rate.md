# Hash Rate
The term hash rate alludes to the speed at which a computer can perform hashing calculations. With regards to [Bitcoin](/bitcoin) and cryptographic forms of money, the hash rate addresses the effectiveness and performance of a mining machine. It characterizes how fast a [mining](/mining) hardware operates while attempting to figure a legitimate [block](/block) hash.
In short, the most common way of mining includes a bunch of hashing endeavors, until a substantial hash is created. All in all, a Bitcoin miner necessities to run a lot of data through a hash function to create a hash, and they are just fruitful when a certain hash value is generated (a hash that beginnings of a certain number of zeros).
In this manner, the hash rate is straightforwardly proportional to the profitability of a miner or mining pool. A higher hash rate means that the likelihood of mining a block is higher and, in this manner, the miner has a better chance of getting the [block reward](/block-reward).
Normally, the hash rate is estimated in hashes each second (h/s) alongside a SI prefix, for example, mega, giga, or tera. For example, a blockchain network that figures one trillion hashes each second would have a hash rate of 1 Th/s.
The hash rate of Bitcoin arrived at 1 Th/s in 2011, and 1,000 Th/s in 2013. In the beginning phases of the network, users could mine new blocks utilizing their personal computers and graphics cards. In any case, with the creation of particular mining hardware (known as [ASIC](/asic) miners), the hash rate began to increase exceptionally fast, making the mining difficulty rise. Hence, personal computers and graphics cards are presently not suitable for Bitcoin mining. Bitcoin's hash rate outperformed a million Th/s in 2016, and 10,000,000 Th/s in 2017. As of July 2019, the network is operating with about 67,500,000 Th/s.
