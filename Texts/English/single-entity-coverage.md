# Single Entity Coverage
## What Is Single Entity Coverage?

Single entity coverage is a type of insurance policy that covers all [real property](/real-property) in a condominium, including both the common areas shared by all property owners as well as the individual units.

Single entity coverage is utilized for condominiums (or condos), a type of residential property where a few common components, like the entrance or light fixtures, are utilized by all inhabitants of the building, while different components are just utilized by the condo unit owner.

## How Single Entity Coverage Works

Single entity coverage is important for owner-involved multifamily lodging in light of the fact that the occupants of condo units can't be approached to purchase an insurance policy covering things that are shared by other condo owners, like a doorway or a light installation in a hallway. The [condominium](/condominium) association purchases this insurance policy, involving the fees charged to the condo owners for upkeep.

A deductible will frequently apply to property insured in the association's policy. The deductible could be on an occurrence basis, or it could apply separately to each building or unit. There might be various deductibles for the different types of property covered. One part of the deductible to consider is the way it will be taken care of with the unit owner. Except if the association records determine who is responsible, the association or the unit owner, then, at that point, the association might have to embrace a policy that depicts the conditions under which a unit owner would be responsible for paying the deductible.

## What Single Entity Coverage Protects

As well as protecting property shared by all condo owners, single entity coverage additionally covers the property inside the individual condo units. This incorporates machines and whatever isn't viewed as a structural improvement or an expansion. Essentially, it covers what was originally part of the condo when it was constructed. It doesn't make a difference to the personal things (like PCs and dress) of the individual condo occupants, and applies to no improvements made to the condo unit.

This is a semi-limited type of coverage that a condominium association can decide to purchase, and is illustrated in the association's rules and [covenants](/contract). This type of insurance is the most common [property insurance](/property-insurance) purchased by condominium associations.

As opposed to pick single entity coverage, a condominium association can rather decide to purchase [bare walls coverage](/bare-walls-coverage) or all-inclusive coverage. Bare walls coverage just applies to things found in shared areas of the building, like light fixtures, walls, and floors, and is the most limited type of condo coverage. All-inclusive coverage incorporates the highlights of single entity coverage, yet in addition covers improvements.
