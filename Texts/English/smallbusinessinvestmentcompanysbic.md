# Small Business Investment Company (SBIC)
## What Is a Small Business Investment Company (SBIC)?

A small business investment company (SBIC) is a type of privately-possessed investment company that is licensed by the [Small Business Administration](/small-business-administration) (SBA). Small business investment companies supply small companies with both equity and debt financing. They give a practical alternative to venture capital firms for the overwhelming majority small undertakings seeking startup capital.

The SBA doesn't make direct investments in small businesses. Its job is to assist SBICs with acquiring leverage by ensuring their loan obligations, called debentures.

## Requirements for a SBIC

Under the LMI debenture, SBICs must cause investments in small businesses that to have somewhere around half of employees or assets in low-to-direct income zones, or in which 35% of full-time employees live in a LMI zone.

## Special Considerations

After a SBIC is licensed and approved, the SBA will furnish it with a commitment to give a set amount of leverage north of several years.

When this fund is laid out, a debt security called a [debenture](/debenture) will be issued when an investment is to be made. The holder of that debenture is then qualified for principal payments and interest over the long run. This is one of the most usually picked long or medium-term debt designs.

The standard debenture has a term of a decade or more, and it is accessible as an amount equivalent to or under two times the private capital committed to the fund. Now and again, the SBA will permit the debenture to be under three times the committed private capital, however just for those licensees who have recently managed more than one fund. The upper limit that SBICs might be conceded access to is a maximum of $175 million for a single fund and $350 million for various funds.
