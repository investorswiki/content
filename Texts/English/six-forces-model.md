## What Is the Six Forces Model?

The six forces model is a strategic business instrument that assists businesses with assessing the competitiveness and engaging quality of a market. It gives a view or outlook by investigating six key areas of business activity and competitive forces that shape any industry.

## How the Six Forces Model Works

The [five forces model](/porter) was originally developed by Michael E. Porter of [Harvard Business School](/harvard-business). It was utilized as a structure to examine an organization's competitive environment. For of analysis, there were certain limitations in that original model. Among those limitations was that the model was more applicable to simple and static markets as opposed to the complex and dynamic markets that exist today.

Moreover, the five forces model didn't account for factors and influences from outside of the market or industry itself. The pace of change in business has increased and new business models keep on arising that don't follow similar examples as incumbent, more established businesses. Competition was added as a part to the model and the refreshed variant incorporates six forces:

1. Competition
1. New contestants
1. End users and purchasers
1. Providers
1. Substitutes

Many substance sources opened up for free or decisively diminished costs to purchasers and users. Such competitive elements, which emphatically changed how content was distributed and reshaped the whole media industry, didn't effortlessly factor into the original model's analysis structure.
