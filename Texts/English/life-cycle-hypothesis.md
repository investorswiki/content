# Life-Cycle Hypothesis (LCH)
## What Is the Life-Cycle Hypothesis (LCH)?

The life-cycle hypothesis (LCH) is an economic theory that portrays the spending and saving habits of individuals throughout a lifetime. The theory states that individuals try to [smooth consumption](/consumption-smoothing) all through their lifetime by borrowing when their income is low and saving when their income is high.

The concept was developed by economists Franco Modigliani and his student Richard Brumberg in the mid 1950s.

## Understanding the Life-Cycle Hypothesis

The LCH expects that individuals plan their spending over their lifetimes, considering their future income. In like manner, they assume debt when they are youthful, accepting future income will enable them to pay it off. They then save during middle age to keep up with their level of consumption when they retire.

A graph of an individual's spending over the long run subsequently shows a mound formed pattern in which [wealth](/wealth) accumulation is low during youth and advanced age and high during middle age.

## Life-Cycle Hypothesis versus Keynesian Theory

The LCH supplanted a previous hypothesis developed by economist [John Maynard Keynes](/keynesianeconomics) in 1937. Keynes accepted that savings were just another great and that the percentage that individuals allocated to their savings would develop as their incomes rose. This introduced an expected problem in that it implied that as a country's incomes grew, a savings excess would result, and [aggregate demand](/aggregatedemand) and economic output would deteriorate.

One more problem with Keynes' theory is that he didn't address individuals' consumption patterns after some time. For instance, an individual in middle age who is the head of a family will consume in excess of a retiree. Albeit subsequent research has generally upheld the LCH, it likewise has its problems.

## Special Considerations for the Life-Cycle Hypothesis

The LCH makes several assumptions. For instance, the theory expects that individuals exhaust their wealth during advanced age. Frequently, notwithstanding, the wealth is given to children, or more seasoned individuals might be reluctant to spend their wealth. The theory additionally expects that individuals plan ahead with regards to building wealth, yet many tarry or lack the discipline to save.

Another assumption is that individuals earn the most when they are of working age. Nonetheless, certain individuals decide to work less when they are moderately youthful and to keep on working parttime when they arrive at retirement age.

Subsequently, one ramifications is that more youthful individuals are more able to take on investment risks than more established individuals, which stays a widely accepted fundamental of personal finance.

Different assumptions of note are that those with high incomes are more able to save and have greater financial smart than those on low incomes. Individuals with low incomes might have credit card debt and less disposable income. In conclusion, safety nets or [means-tried ](/implies test)benefits for the elderly might discourage individuals from saving as they expect to get a higher [social security](/social-security-benefits) payment when they retire.
