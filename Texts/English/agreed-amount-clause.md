# Agreed Amount Clause
## What Is an Agreed Amount Clause?

An agreed amount clause is a property insurance provision through which the insurer consents to postpone the coinsurance requirement. Insurers will require a statement of property values-endorsed by the policyholder-as a condition for enacting or remembering an agreed value provision for a policy.

This arrangement is ordinarily accessible for commercial and different properties.

## How an Agreed Amount Clause Works

The agreed amount clause requires a marked statement of values or [actual cash value](/genuine cash-value). This statement subtleties the value of the insured property. Genuine cash value is the amount equivalent to the [replacement cost](/replacementcost), minus [depreciation](/depreciation), at the hour of the loss. It is the unmistakable value for which the property could sell (which is in every case not as much as what it would cost to supplant it).

Calculation of genuine cash value is calculated by deducting depreciation costs from replacement costs, with depreciation determined by laying out an expected lifetime and afterward determining the leftover percentage of life.

The value listed on the statement will become the basis from which policy coverage is determined. The policyholder settles on this amount beforehand and can't contest the amount of coverage sometime in the future. When the statement is approved, the insurer will suspend the requirement of the [coinsurance](/coinsurance) clause in the policy for the one-year term of the policy.

Many types of insurance have a coinsurance clause, including healthcare, property, and flood insurance. Be that as it may, its utilization isn't something similar for all policy types.

In property insurance, coinsurance applies to the level of coverage that an insurance company will guarantee. Generally, this is 80%, however a few insurers might require 90% or 100% coverage, contingent upon the value of the building, its location, and the possibilities that a loss will happen during the policy period. Additionally, individuals will tend to underinsure their properties or cover them just to the amount they feel generally comfortable paying the premium. Consequently, insurance companies will expect that a policy covers a stated percentage of the value of the structure.

Generally, insurance companies will more often than not defer coinsurance just in that frame of mind of sensibly small claims. At times, policies might incorporate a waiver even in the event of a total loss. Notwithstanding, policies that concede the coinsurance clause will come at a higher premium.

Since co-insurance policies require the payment of deductibles before the insurer will bear any cost, policyholders retain more costs front and center. Utilizing the agreed amount clause, on the off chance that a loss ought to occur, the insurer will evaluate the property in light of the agreed-upon value. These clauses are most important on account of a total property loss. Likewise, before the policy expiration date, the policyholder must present a refreshed statement of value assuming they wish to recharge the agreed amount clause.

It's important to note that the lack of any coinsurance for this type of policy means in the event that coverage is deficient to cover a loss, the policyholder will be responsible for fulfilling the difference. This present circumstance can occur in the event that a policyholder undervalues the property in the statement of value.

## Illustration of an Agreed Amount Clause

For instance, assume you own a building that you've insured on a replacement cost basis at a limit of $1 million, and your policy incorporates a $1,000 deductible. Nonetheless, your statement of values demonstrates that the genuine replacement cost of your building is $2 million.

In the event that a windstorm causes $100,000 damage to the fa\u00e7ade, your insurer will compare the endless supply of your building-$2 million-and your policy limit. Be that as it may, in light of the fact that you underinsured your building, your insurer won't cover your complete loss. All things being equal, your insurer will cover 75% of your losses, less the $1,000 deductible, or $74,000 ((100,000 x 0.75) - 1,000).
