## What Is an Insurance Floater?

Floater insurance is a type of insurance policy that covers personal property that is effectively portable and gives extra coverage over what normal insurance policies don't. Otherwise called a "personal property floater," it can cover anything from jewelry and furs to costly sound system equipment.

[Homeowners insurance](/homeowners-insurance) frequently won't fully cover a few things. Adding a floater policy guarantees the homeowner that the [full value](/full-value) will be supplanted in the event of theft, loss, or damage.

Jewelry and other small important things are effortlessly taken, so the risk is higher. To keep coverage affordable, standard homeowners policies generally just give about $1,500 in coverage to such things, and that means that the insurer won't pay more than that amount for some random piece of jewelry or other important things.

Here are a few key things that floater insurance covers:

- **Fine Art — **Such things as collectibles, books, china, gem, collectibles, fine arts, furniture, glass, lithographs, mirrors, mats, embroideries, canvases, pictures, models, and silverware
- **Firearms** — Both collectible and current
