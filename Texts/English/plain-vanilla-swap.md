# Plain Vanilla Swap
## What Is a Plain Vanilla Swap?

A [plain vanilla](/plainvanilla) swap is one of the simplest financial instruments contracted in the over-the-counter market between two private gatherings, the two of which are generally firms or financial institutions. There are several types of plain vanilla swaps, including a [interest rate swap](/interestrateswap), commodity swap, and a foreign currency swap. The term plain vanilla swap is most commonly used to portray an interest rate swap in which a floating interest rate is exchanged for a fixed rate or vice versa.

## Grasping a Plain Vanilla Swap

A plain vanilla interest rate swap is frequently finished to hedge a floating rate exposure, in spite of the fact that it should likewise be possible to exploit a declining rate environment by moving from a fixed to a floating rate. The two legs of the swap are named in a similar currency, and interest payments are netted. The [notional principal](/notionalprincipalamount) doesn't change during the life of the swap, and there are no embedded options.

## Types of Plain Vanilla Swaps

The most common plain vanilla swap is a floating rate interest rate swap. Presently, the most common floating rate index is the [London Interbank Offered Rate](/libor) (LIBOR), which is set daily by the International Commodities Exchange (ICE). LIBOR is posted for five monetary standards â€” the U.S. dollar, euro, Swiss franc, Japanese yen, and British pound. Maturities range from overnight to 12 months. The rate is set in view of a survey of somewhere in the range of 11 and 18 major banks.

> The Intercontinental Exchange, the authority responsible for LIBOR, will stop distributing one-week and two-month USD LIBOR after Dec. 31, 2021. Any remaining LIBOR will be discontinued after June 30, 2023.

The most common floating rate reset period is at regular intervals, with semi-annual payments. The day count convention on the floating leg is generally real/360 for the U.S. dollar and the euro, or real/365 for the British pound, Japanese yen, and Swiss franc. The interest on the floating rate leg is accrued and compounded for a long time, while the fixed-rate payment is calculated on a simple 30/360 or 30/365 basis, contingent upon the currency. The interest due on the floating rate leg is compared with that due on the fixed-rate leg, and just the net difference is paid.

## Illustration of a Plain Vanilla Swap

In a plain vanilla interest rate swap, Company An and Company B pick a maturity, principal amount, currency, [fixed interest rate](/fixedinterestrate), floating interest rate index, and rate reset and payment dates. On the predefined payment dates for the life of the swap, Company A pays Company B an amount of interest calculated by applying the fixed rate to the principal amount, and Company B pays Company A the amount derived from applying the floating interest rate to the principal amount. Just the netted difference between the interest payments changes hands.
