## What Is an Endowment Loan?

An endowment loan, otherwise called an endowment mortgage, is a type of mortgage where the borrower just pays the interest on the loan every month. Rather than making payments on the principal, the borrower makes standard investments into a savings plan, or endowment, which will mature when the mortgage matures. The borrower then, at that point, utilizes the funds from that endowment to pay off the mortgage's principal.

Endowment loans have fundamentally been famous in the United Kingdom. Consumers utilizing them frequently selected to buy what the British call a [life assurance](/assurance) policy (the equivalent of a whole life insurance policy in the U.S.) to accumulate the savings important to pay off the principal. This life assurance policy would be set to mature all the while with the mortgage.

## How an Endowment Loan Works

To approve an endowment loan, a lender will require proof that the borrower has a realistic plan for repaying the principal. This plan can't depend on an expected inheritance or windfall.

Say a borrower decides to buy a home that costs $150,000, financing the purchase with a 25-year endowment mortgage. The lender giving the mortgage sets the regularly scheduled payment at $850 (mirroring an overarching interest rate of 6.8%). This sum covers just the interest on the loan; the borrower must cover any significant taxes and insurance themselves.

In the mean time, the borrower has likewise acquired a life assurance policy that will mature in 25 years. He makes regularly scheduled payments of $250 into this policy on the grounds that the company giving the policy has calculated that regularly scheduled payments of this amount, with the anticipated yield through interest, will guarantee that the policy will have a cash value of $150,000 or more toward the finish of 25 years. If toward the finish of 25 years, the markets have been consistent, the policy will mature, and the borrower will utilize the $150,000 that has accumulated to pay off the principal. Any amount in the policy more than $150,000 will go to the borrower. Any shortage will expect that the borrower pay off the difference in cash.

## Upsides and downsides of an Endowment Loan

**Benefits of Endowment Loans.** Endowment loans offer numerous incentives for borrowers. The chief one is, of course, the lower regularly scheduled payments since they are just paying interest rather than interest and principal on the loan. Of course, they actually must pay into a life assurance policy or one more form of savings plan to demonstrate that they are planning for the last principal payment at the loan's maturity.

Yet, an enforced savings plan is rarely something terrible, and it might really be profitable: Many individuals have gone into endowment loans accepting that the money they save through their life assurance policy will turn out to be more than the principal of their mortgage. In these cases, the borrower would receive an extra lump sum after the mortgage principal is paid off.

**Risks of Endowment Loans.** Despite these benefits, endowment loans can be riskier than traditional mortgages. Any kind of investment or savings plan can lose value over the long haul contingent upon the market: What in the event that there's a major correction, making a portfolio's holdings plunge, just when the mortgage is coming due? Essentially, unexpected changes in interest rates could skew the projected growth rate of a life insurance policy's cash value. On the off chance that the policy loses value, the borrower might be left with a [shortfall](/shortfall) when the mortgage matures. In this case, they would have to have one more source of cash to have the option to pay off the mortgage.

## Real Life Example of an Endowment Loan

This very scenario hit great many British homeowners in recent years. In the late 1980s, endowment mortgages were a very famous method for financing a home purchase, energized by flourishing stock and real estate markets (and some special tax breaks for the product); more than 1,000,000 endowment savings plans or policies were sold in one year. However, by the late 1990s, obviously these plans planned to fall short of their optimistically projected growth rates â€” and the amounts of the mortgages they should cover. During the 2010s, numerous homeowners were forced to track down alternate ways of repaying their mortgages or risk losing their homes.

Numerous regulators and financial analysts denounced endowment loans as a case of mis-selling, similar to the situation with [variable universal life insurance](/variableuniversallife) policies that unfurled in the U.S. about a similar time. Not many endowment loans are sold in the U.K. today.
