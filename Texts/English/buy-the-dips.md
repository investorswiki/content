For instance, if a stock tumbles from $10 to $8, the trader might choose to cut their losses if the stock ranges $7. They are expecting the stock will go higher from $8, which is the reason they buying, yet they additionally need to limit their losses assuming that they are off-base and the asset continues to drop.

Shares of New Century Mortgage dropped so low that the [New York Stock Exchange](/nyse) (NYSE) [suspended trading](/suspended_trading). Investors who thought the $55-per-share stock was a bargain at $45 would have found themselves with steep losses just half a month some other time when it dropped below a dollar for every share.
