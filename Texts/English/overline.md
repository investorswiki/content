## What Is an Over-Line?

In the insurance industry, the term "over-line" alludes to the portion of an insurance company's coverage that surpasses the normal amount of coverage that they give. Over-line coverage can happen when an insurer [underwrites](/underwriting) a greater number of policies than normal, or when a reinsurer acknowledges a bigger amount of liabilities through a reinsurance contract than is common for that firm.

## How Over-Lines Work

Insurance companies bring in money by gathering [premiums](/insurance-premium) in exchange for [indemnifying](/repayment) their customers against certain risks. Of course, to safeguard these risks, insurance companies must guarantee that they have adequate financial capacity to do as such. The amount of capacity an insurer has relies upon its financial strength and excess capital, or funds not presently used to cover strategy related liabilities. An insurer with excess capacity can endorse new policies, and subsequently acquire more premiums.

As well as giving insurance to individual customers, insurance companies additionally give insurance to each other through [reinsurance contracts](/reinsurance). For instance, if Insurer A has excess capacity — that is, more money than it needs to cover its existing liabilities — it can utilize that capacity to sell extra insurance coverage, for example, by selling reinsurance to Insurer B. On occasion, this can lead insurers to take care of a bigger overall amount than is regular for their operations. This excess level of coverage is alluded to as the firm's "over-line."

State insurance regulators pay close consideration regarding the amount of liability that insurance companies take on through their underwriting activities. Insurers are required to report their financial position to state regulators, who utilize these reports to determine whether an insurer is in great financial wellbeing or on the other hand in the event that there is a risk of [insolvency](/insolvency). Hence, companies with critical levels of over-line coverage could draw in examination from insurance regulators, who might keep thinking about whether the insurer has assumed responsibility for an unreasonable level of risk.

## Illustration of an Over-Line

Emma is the manager of an insurance company. Investigating her company's financial metrics, she notes that her firm's financial performance has been strangely strong in the past 12 months, leading to an excess of cash reserves. That's what she assesses, assuming the claims on her existing contracts play out in line with projections, she will be left with generally 20% excess capacity.

To send this capital and work on her primary concern, Emma chooses to take on reinsurance contracts, accepting the risk held by different insurers in exchange for extra premiums. In spite of the fact that Emma accepts that her new contracts are probably going to be both productive and safe, the extra reinsurance contracts raise her firm's overall coverage level over its historical average. Hence, it is conceivable that the new over-line coverage level will draw in the consideration of the state insurance regulator, requiring Emma to make sense of the change and show that the new policies are financially solid.
