# Refund
## What is a refund?
A refund is the payment the federal or state government makes to an excess amount of taxpayer taxes during the previous year. This payment comes as a check, direct deposit or savings bond.
## More profound definition
There are two primary perspectives on refunds. One side sees tax refunds as evidence of a without interest loan given to the government. The other thinks about them as forced savings, since the taxpayers don't approach the money until after they receive the refund.
The people who need to reduce or dispose of their tax refund need to increase the number of exemptions they claim, and the individuals who need to increase their refunds ought to diminish their claimed exemptions. Individuals who need to make these changes ought to talk to a tax professional about their options.
A few taxpayers receive a refund even on the off chance that they pay no taxes to the government. Intended to benefit low-to direct income families, the earned income tax credit reduces the amount of taxes the taxpayers owe. This reduced tax bill can lead to a tax refund.
## Refund model
Every year when you complete your tax return, you list your income for the year and take away from that amount accessible deductions to decide your adjusted gross income. This is the figure the IRS uses to work out the amount of tax you owe.
On the off chance that you have a job, your employer deducts taxes from your paycheck and sends the money to the IRS. At the point when the total amount of taxes you paid out of your paycheck is greater than whatever you really owe, the government returns the overage to you, and that is your refund for the year.
