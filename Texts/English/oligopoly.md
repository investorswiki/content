## What Is an Oligopoly?

An oligopoly is a market structure with a small number of firms, none of which can keep the others from having huge influence. The concentration ratio measures the market share of the biggest firms.

A [monopoly](/monopoly) is a market with just a single producer, a [duopoly](/duopoly) has two firms, and an oligopoly consists of at least two firms. There is no exact upper limit to the number of firms in an oligopoly, however the number must be low an adequate number of that the actions of one firm essentially influence the others.

## Figuring out Oligopolies

Oligopolies in history incorporate steel manufacturers, oil companies, rail lines, tire manufacturing, supermarket chains, and remote transporters. The economic and legal concern is that an oligopoly can block new contestants, slow innovation, and increase prices, all of which hurt consumers.

Firms in an oligopoly [set prices](/pricemaker), whether collectively — in a [cartel](/cartel) — or under the leadership of one firm, as opposed to [taking prices](/pricetaker) from the market. Profit edges are consequently higher than they would be in a more competitive market.

## Conditions That Enable Oligopolies

The conditions that empower oligopolies to exist incorporate high entry costs in [capital expenditures](/capitalexpenditure), legal privilege (license to involve remote range or land for railways), and a platform that gains value with additional customers (like social media).

The global tech and trade transformation has changed a portion of these conditions: offshore production and the rise of "smaller than normal plants" have impacted the steel industry, for instance. In the office software application space, Microsoft was targeted by Google Docs, which Google funded utilizing cash from its web search business.

## Why Are Oligopolies Stable?

An intriguing inquiry is the reason such a group is stable. The firms need to see the benefits of collaboration over the costs of economic competition, then, at that point, consent to not compete and on second thought settle on the benefits of co-operation. The firms have at times found creative ways of staying away from the presence of [price-fixing](/fixing), like utilizing phases of the moon. Price-fixing is the act of setting prices, as opposed to allowing them to be determined by the unregulated economy powers. Another approach is for firms to follow a recognized [price leader](/price-leadership); when the leader raises prices, [the others will follow](/follow-the-leader-evaluating).

## The Prisoner's Dilemma

The fundamental problem that these firms face is that each firm has an incentive to cheat; assuming all firms in the oligopoly consent to jointly limit supply and keep prices high, then each firm stands to capture substantial business from the others by breaking the agreement undermining the others. Such competition can be pursued through prices, or through basically the individual company extending its own output brought to market.

Game scholars have developed models for these scenarios, which form a kind of [prisoner's dilemma](/detainees dilemma). At the point when costs and benefits are balanced so that no firm needs to break from the group, it is considered the [Nash equilibrium](/nash-equilibrium) state for oligopolies. This can be accomplished by contractual or market conditions, legal limitations, or strategic connections between members of the oligopoly that empower the discipline of cheaters.

## Special Considerations

It is fascinating to note that both the problem of keeping an oligopoly and the problem of coordinating action among purchasers and merchants overall on the market include molding the settlements to different detainee's dilemmas and related coordination games that repeat over the long run. Thus, a significant number of the very institutional factors that work with the development of market economies by lessening detainee's dilemma problems among market participants, like secure enforcement of contracts, social conditions of high trust and correspondence, and laissez-faire economic policy, could likewise possibly help encourage and support oligopolies.

Governments in some cases answer oligopolies with laws against price-fixing and collusion. Yet, a cartel can price fix on the off chance that they operate past the scope or with the gift of governments. [OPEC](/opec) is one illustration of this since it is a cartel of oil-delivering states with no overall authority. On the other hand, in mixed economies, oligopolies frequently search out and lobby for ideal government policy to operate under the regulation or even direct supervision of government agencies.

## Highlights
- The term "oligopoly" alludes to a small number of producers working, either unequivocally or implicitly, to confine output or potentially fix prices, to accomplish above normal market returns.
- The major difficulty that oligopolies face is the detainee's dilemma that every member faces, which encourages every member to cheat.
- Government policy can discourage or encourage oligopolistic behavior, and firms in mixed economies frequently look for government favoring for ways of limiting competition.
- Economic, legal, and technological factors can contribute to the formation and maintenance, or disintegration, of oligopolies.
## FAQ
### What Are Some Negative Effects of an Oligopoly?
An oligopoly is the point at which a couple of companies apply huge control over a given market. Together, these companies might control prices by colluding with one another, eventually giving uncompetitive prices in the market. Among other impeding effects of an oligopoly remember limiting new participants for the market and diminished innovation. Oligopolies have been found in the oil industry, railroad companies, remote transporters, and big tech.
### Is the U.S. Airline Industry an Oligopoly?
With just four companies controlling almost 66% of all domestic trips in the U.S. starting around 2021, it has been indicated that the airline industry is an oligopoly. These four companies are Delta Airlines, United Airlines Holdings, Southwest Airlines, and American Airlines. According to a report compiled by the White House, "decreased competition contributes to expanding fees like stuff and cancellation fees. These fees are many times brought up in lockstep, showing a lack of significant competitive pressure, and are frequently hidden from consumers at the point of purchase." Interestingly, in 1978, The Airline Deregulation Act was forced, which stripped away the Civil Aeronautics Board the ability to direct the industry. Prior to this time, the airline industry operated similar as a public utility, while fare prices had declined 20 years before the deregulation was presented.
### What Is an Example of a Current Oligopoly?
One measure that shows assuming an oligopoly is available is the concentration ratio, which works out the size of companies in comparison to their industry. Occasions where a high concentration ratio is available incorporate mass media. In the U.S., for instance, the sector is overwhelmed by just five companies: NBC Universal; Walt Disney; Time Warner; Viacom CBS; and News Corporation — even as web-based features like Netflix and Amazon Prime start to infringe on this market. In the mean time, inside big tech, two companies control smartphone operating systems: Google Android and Apple iOS.
