# Dual Interface Chip Card
## What Is a Dual Interface Chip Card?

A dual interface chip card is a credit or [debit card](/debitcard) with a single [embedded chip](/chip-card) that permits the card to be utilized in both contact and contactless transactions. The "contactless" part means it has a RFID or NFC chip that empowers it to get the card's distinguishing data and make payments through radio-recurrence identification (RFID) or near-field communication (NFC) innovations. The "contact" part means it very well may be utilized with physical readers, either through a traditional magnetic stripe or in light of the fact that the chip can be dunked into an EMV reader.

## How a Dual Interface Chip Card Works

Credit and debit cards have traditionally required a client to swipe the card through an electronic [terminal](/point-of-sale-terminal). This permits the terminal to peruse the magnetic strip on the rear of the card, which contains distinguishing data about the account.

The dual interface chip card is a type of [smart card](/chip-card) with an embedded chip that can work with both contact and contactless transactions (otherwise known as tap-and-pay). Furnished with a hidden radio wire, a contactless card permits users to wave their card in front of a reader to pay for a thing.

The credit card number and client's name and expiration date are as yet contained on the face (or progressively, the rear) of the card, and a [EMV chip](/emv) (Europay, MasterCard, and Visa chip) may in any case be incorporated, to give added security in transactions. Overall, having a contactless chip or potentially an EMV chip, and a magnetic strip permits the cardholder to complete transactions on a more extensive assortment of machines in a highly secure way.

Contactless chip cards permit recognizing data to be effectively perused by a sensor. Contactless terminals are normally utilized by employees who have identification identifications that must be tapped or waved past a sensor to gain access to a building or room.

Shippers that need to exploit dual interface chip cards must upgrade their card terminal so it can acknowledge both contact and contactless chip cards. Numerous dealers have upgraded their terminals to take into account contactless payment transactions since they are quicker and can assist with diminishing waiting times for stores with high volumes of transactions.

Dual interface chip cards give greater payment processing convenience. They can be utilized with both contact and contactless payment terminals. Many card issuers are presently delivering dual interface chip cards for their customers and eliminating ones with more seasoned technology. Terminals have added new chip usefulness and furthermore started to take into account both chip transactions and contactless transactions.

## Special Considerations

Dual interface chip cards are being created by additional issuers as technology advances across the industry. Numerous issuers have started to issue these cards, which make the checkout interaction a lot quicker with vendors, as they can be utilized with both contact and contactless payment terminals and handheld gadgets.

While dual interface chip cards are turning out to be more well known, their additional costs are one explanation they were delayed to take off. Dual interface cards generally cost roughly two times as a lot to deliver as a chip card. While high volume production assists with keeping manufacturing costs down, the additional cost was a thought â€” in any event, until 2020.

Last year saw increased demand for contactless network, as World Health Organization (WHO) and legislatures across the world pushed the utilization of smart cards to support social removing proposals while directing point of sale purchases.
