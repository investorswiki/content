# Oracle
An oracle might be defined in more ways than one, as per the unique situation. Inside the blockchain setting, an oracle is essentially a data source that is utilized as a bridge between smart contracts and other outside sources.
All the more specifically, an oracle is an agent that speaks with outside data sources as well as checks and validates that the data being given is accurate. Subsequently, oracles are responsible for giving fundamental and reliable data to smart contracts, which thusly perform certain tasks.
The significance of oracles depends on the way that blockchain smart contracts are simply able to access the data that is held inside their own digital network. Consequently, oracles are required as a communication instrument that "interprets" real world occasions (non-deterministic data) to digital values that be recognized by smart contracts (deterministic data).
Blockchain oracles might be classified by their utilization case. The most common types are:
- Hardware Oracles: Integrates with physical systems and innovations, giving real-world data to smart contracts. For example, hardware oracles can speak with RFID sensors utilized in different industries (automobile, drug, supply chain, and so on.)
- Software Oracles: generally commonly utilized; recover online data from outside programs and web APIs -, for example, market prices, flight status, and climate data.
- Consensus Oracles: kind of decentralized oracles that gathers large measures of data from a set number of different oracles, following specific methods to decide the legitimacy and exactness of data collected. Consensus oracles are being utilized in prediction markets platforms, like Augur and Gnosis.
- Inbound Oracles: sends outside data to smart contracts or software oracles. Can be designed as a set of "if" rules (for example "in the event that an asset hits a certain price, place a buy request").
- Outbound Oracles: sends smart contracts data to outside systems, making it feasible for smart contracts to speak with non-blockchain sources.

As a general rule, a blockchain oracle comprises of a third-party data source that is dependent on outer permission to work appropriately, and that means they are typically a device given by centralized substances. In this way, most oracles wind up forfeiting the decentralized properties of the smart contracts.
### The Oracle Problem
Contingent upon the data given by the centralized oracles, smart contracts will execute various capabilities, implying that oracles have tremendous power over smart contracts. This is known as the Oracle Problem, which ascends as a conflict of trust that centralized third-party oracles bring to trustless smart contracts and blockchain systems.
Albeit decentralized oracles, like the consensus oracles, may introduce a potential solution, there are as yet many difficulties to be survived, since decentralized oracle networks are very hard to carry out in a secure, functional, and trustless way.
