# Manufacturing Production
## What Is Manufacturing Production?

Manufacturing production alludes to the methodology of how to most efficiently make and produce goods available to be purchased, past just a [bill of materials](/bill-of-materials). Three common types of manufacturing production processes are: make to stock (MTS), specially make (MTO), and make to gather (MTA). Such strategies enjoy benefits and disadvantages in labor costs, [inventory control](/inventory), overhead, customization, and the speed of production and filling orders.

## Understanding Manufacturing Production

[Manufacturing](/manufacturing) is the creation and assembly of parts and finished products available to be purchased on a large scale. It can use a number of methods, including human and machine labor, and natural and compound processes, to turn [raw materials](/rawmaterials) into finished goods by using tools.

Production is like manufacturing however more extensive in scope. It alludes to the processes and strategies that are utilized to change over raw materials or semi-finished goods into finished products or services regardless of the utilization of machinery. Whether it is either, manufacturers need to match their production methods to the requirements and wants of the market, the accessible resources, order volume and size, seasonal changes in demand, [overhead costs](/overhead) (like labor and inventory), and various different factors.

## Types of Manufacturing Production
### Make to Stock (MTS)

The [make-to-stock](/make-to-stock) (MTS) strategy is a traditional production strategy that depends on demand conjectures. It is best used when there is an anticipated demand for a product, for example, for toys and apparel at Christmastime. MTS can be risky when demand is more hard to foresee, in any case. When utilized with a business or product that has a capricious [business cycle](/businesscycle), MTS can lead to too much inventory and a mark in profits, or too little inventory and a botched opportunity.

### Specially make (MTO)

The [make-to-order](/specially make) (MTO) strategy (otherwise called "worked to order") allows customers to order products worked to their determinations, which is especially valuable with vigorously redid products. Instances of specially make products include computers and computer products, cars, heavy equipment, and other big-ticket things. Companies can lighten inventory issues with MTO, yet the customer stand by time is normally essentially longer. This demand-based strategy can't be utilized with all product types.

> One limitation of specially make (MTO) products is that the production costs will generally be higher than make-to-stock (MTS) products in view of the amount of customization required to satisfy the customer's order.

### Make to Assemble

The make-to-collect (MTA) strategy is a hybrid of MTS and MTO in that companies stock essential parts in view of demand expectations, yet don't gather them until customers place their order. The advantage of such a strategy is that it allows fast customization of products in view of customer demand. Thusly, a genuine model is found in the restaurant industry, which prepares a number of raw materials in advance and afterward anticipates a customer order to begin assembly. One downside to MTA is a company might receive too many orders to handle given the labor and parts it has close by.

## Special Considerations

The [just-in-time (JIT)](/jit) inventory system is an illustration of a strategy that spotlights on one part of manufacturing production â€” inventory management. The system benefits companies since it allows them to diminish waste and inventory costs by just receiving goods utilized in production at the time they are required.

Companies that utilize a JIT inventory system don't store large inventories of parts and raw materials expected to deliver their goods. Instead, conveyances of these things show up at the production facility in more modest amounts on a case by case basis to complete production. To make a JIT strategy work, efficient scheduling is of the embodiment to guarantee production isn't delayed due to the lack of materials. Electronic inventory systems assist managers with monitoring inventory and answer rapidly when production materials get too low.

## Features
- A company that utilizes the specially make (MTO) strategy creates a product solely after receiving a confirmed customer order.
- A company that utilizes the make-to-stock (MTS) strategy matches the level of goods it keeps in inventory with anticipated consumer demand.
- Numerous factors impact manufacturing production, for example, the availability of raw materials, marketplace demand, labor costs, and inventory costs.
- Manufacturing production alludes to the strategies companies use to fabricate and deliver goods available to be purchased.
- A company that utilizes the make-to-gather (MTA) strategy stocks the essential parts required for production yet doesn't begin to collect them until a customer places an order.
