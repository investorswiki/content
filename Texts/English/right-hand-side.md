# Right Hand Side (RHS)
## What Is Right Hand Side (RHS)?

The right hand side (RHS) alludes to the [offer](/ask) price in a [currency pair](/currencypair) and demonstrates the most minimal price somebody will sell the [base](/basecurrency) currency. A foreign exchange quote reflects the amount of the quote currency, which is listed second in the pair, it takes to buy the base currency which is the primary currency listed in the pair.

## Grasping the Right Hand Side (RHS)

The right hand side (RHS) is, in a real sense, the right-hand side of the foreign exchange price quote. Quotes show the [bid](/bid) on the left and [offer](/ask) on the right. The right hand side is the current offer price. This is where somebody who needs to buy could execute in a split second since there is a willing seller costing that much.

For instance, on the off chance that the currency pair quote is 1.2500 by 1.2505, the right hand side is 1.2505. This addresses the price at which somebody will sell the base currency, and buy the quote currency. In the forex market, currencies are constantly exchanged. For instance, an offer in the EUR/USD is an offer to sell the EUR (base) and buy the USD (quote currency).

The difference between the bid and offer is called the [spread](/bid-and-ask). The bid is the highest price somebody will buy the base currency at (in terms of the quote currency), and the offer is the most reduced price somebody will sell the base currency at.

The size of the bid/ask spread is an indicator of the current liquidity in a market. A tight spread means there is great [liquidity](/liquidity), which brings transaction costs and assists down with expanding returns. Forex brokers normally bring in money off of the bid/ask spread, as the difference between the bid and the ask price is their profit on the transaction. This isn't generally the case. Some forex brokers don't falsely increase spreads or endeavor to bring in money off the spread, and on second thought charge a commission on each trade.

If the [EUR/USD](/eur-usd-euro-us-dollar-currency-pair) currency pair is trading at 1.1550/1.1560, the RHS, or offer price, is 1.1560, this is where somebody will sell EUR and buy USD, or where an assailant (or price taker) can buy EUR and sell USD. The spread is 10 [pips](/pip).

In the event that the euro is the domestic currency, and a currency pair is quoted in terms of EUR/USD, then, at that point, that is alluded to as a [indirect quote](/indirectquote). Then again, in the event that the currency pair is quoted as USD/EUR, that is alluded to as a [direct quote](/directquote) (assuming that the euro is the domestic currency). Regardless, the base currency will constantly be on the [left hand side](/left-hand-side) (LHS) and the quote currency will be on the RHS.

Expect a person is in the U.S. what's more, sees it costs $1.1560 to buy a single euro (EUR/USD). If that somehow happened to be switched over completely to an indirect quote (it is direct for a U.S. resident) then it would be displayed as USD/EUR trading at 0.8650/0.8658, where a trader could buy one dollar for \u20ac 0.8658. To get these numbers, partition one by the direct bid (1.1550) and ask (1.1560) prices.

## Illustration of the Right Hand Side In a Forex Transaction

The accompanying chart shows the bid and ask prices for a number of various currency pairs. The bid is on the left and offer is on the right. The difference between the bid and ask prices is the spread.

How about we examine what the [USD/CAD](/usd-cad-us-dollar-canadian-dollar-currency-pair) quote means. The left hand side, the bid, is 1.30527. That means somebody will buy one USD for 1.30527 [Canadian dollars](/cad-canadian-dollar). This is the highest price somebody who in a flash wanted to sell USD could execute at, since there is a willing buyer costing that much.

The right hand side, the ask, is 1.30544. That means somebody will sell one USD for 1.30544 Canadian dollars. This is the most reduced price somebody who immediately wanted to buy USD could execute at, since there is a willing seller costing that much.

USD/CAD is a direct quote on the off chance that the domestic currency is CAD. The quote is showing the amount CAD it takes to buy one USD, or the amount CAD one USD can buy. The quote doesn't show the number of USD it takes to buy one CAD. For that we want the indirect quote (assuming the domestic currency is still CAD).

To get the indirect quote, partition one by the bid, and afterward partition one by the offer. This will give the indirect bid and the indirect offer.

1/1.30527 = 0.76613 and 1/1.30544 = 0.7660

The bid is consistently the lower price, and the offer generally the higher. Consequently the bid for the CAD/USD is 0.7660 and the offer is 0.76613. This shows the number of USD it takes to buy one Canadian dollar. 0.76613 is the right hand side of the quote.

## Features
- The bid price shows up on the left in a quote and the offer on the right.
- The offer price is the most reduced price somebody will sell the base currency at, or the price at which a buyer can in a flash buy the base currency.
- The right hand side (RHS) alludes to the offer price in a forex quotation.
