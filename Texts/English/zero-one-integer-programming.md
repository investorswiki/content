# Zero-One Integer Programming
## What Is Zero-One Integer Programming?

Zero-one integer programming (which can likewise be written as '0-1' integer programming) is a mathematical method of utilizing a series of binary functions; specifically, yes ('1') and no ('0') replies to show up at a solution when there are two [mutually exclusive](/mutuallyexclusive) options.

In the world of finance, zero-one integer programming is frequently used to give replies to [capital rationing problems](/capitalrationing), as well as to streamline investment returns and help with planning, production, transportation, and different issues.

## Understanding Zero-One Integer Programming

Integer programming is a branch of mathematical programming or optimization, which includes making conditions to take care of issues. The term "mathematical programming" is associated with the way that the goal of taking care of different issues is picking programs of action. Doling out a simple yes/no value can be a strong method for laying out a linear critical thinking system to recognize failures.

Fundamentally, the most essential guidelines executed by a computer are binary codes, comprising just of ones and zeros. Those codes are straightforwardly converted into the "on" and "off" states of the power moving through the computer's physical circuits. Generally, these simple codes form the basis of "machine language", the most fundamental assortment of programming dialects. These on and off positions can likewise be understood as relegating a "yes" or "no" to a logical function.

Of course, no human would have the option to build modern software programs by expressly programming ones and zeros. All things considered, human software engineers must depend on different layers of abstraction that can permit them to explain their orders in a format that is more natural to humans. Specifically, modern developers issue orders in alleged "significant level dialects", which use natural grammar like whole English words and sentences, as well as logical administrators, for example, "And", "Or", and "Else" that are recognizable to regular utilization.

At last, nonetheless, these significant level orders should be converted into machine language. Instead of doing so physically, developers depend on [assembly languages](/assembly-language) whose purpose is to decipher between these undeniable level and low-level dialects naturally.

## True Example of Zero-One Integer Programming

A simple illustration of how zero-one integer [programming](/application-programming-interface) may be utilized in capital rationing would be in determining the number of product development projects that can be completed by a company by a certain date or inside a certain budget. For instance, a number of variables for each project can be given values that at last outcome in a 1 (yes) or 0 (no) binary decision about the decision about whether to remember the project for a budget. This can be useful to companies that are uncertain about a specific business decision and are searching for a direct method for surveying the potential outcomes.

## Features
- Zero-one integer programming depends on mutually exclusive yes (1) and negative (0) decisions to track down solutions to logic issues.
- This type of programming can be valuable for companies settling on choices on issues like what to invest in or which of two proposed products are most straightforward to make.
- In zero-one integer issues, every variable is addressed simply by 0 ('no') or 1 ('yes'), and could address choosing or dismissing an option, turning on or off electronic switches, or a straight-forward yes or no response utilized in different applications.
