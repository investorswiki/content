## What Is the Dow Jones Euro STOXX 50?

The Dow Jones Euro STOXX 50 is a [stock index](/index) that addresses 50 of the largest companies in Europe in view of [market capitalization](/marketcapitalization).

## Figuring out Dow Jones STOXX 50

The Dow Jones STOXX 50 is chosen from a stock universe that is an aggregate of the 18 Dow Jones STOXX 600 Supersector indices. The index captures around 60% of the free-float market cap of the EURO STOXX Total Market Index (TMI) for 12 European countries. Each sub-index puts its largest members on a selection list, which is then positioned by market cap to pick the STOXX 50 members.

The index limits the weighting of any one member to 10%, yet no sector limitations are applied to the index's construction. Thusly, banking companies overwhelm the STOXX 50. The index is intended to capture [blue chip companies](/bluechip) in the region, so the average weighted market cap is large.
