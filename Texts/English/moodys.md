## Moody's History

Moody's Corporation traces all the way back to **Moody's Manual of Industrial and Miscellaneous Securities**, which was first distributed by company pioneer John Moody in 1900. The manual gave general data and statistics about the stocks and bonds of financial institutions, government agencies, manufacturing, mining, and different companies. While **Moody's Manual** was an effective venture for the company, it didn't have the financial resources to endure the [Bank Panic of 1907](/bank-panic-of-1907), and Moody ultimately sold the publication.

In 1909, John Moody returned to financial distributing with **Moody's Analyses of Railroad Investments**. This time, in any case, rather than just distributing general data and statistics, Moody offered investors his [analysis](/financial-analysis) of a railroad's operations and finances. He included letter rating images, which he adopted from the rating system utilized in the mercantile industry.

Moody's Investors Service was laid out in 1914 and based on its foundation by including ratings for industrial companies, utilities, and [government bonds](/government-bond) issued by U.S. urban areas and districts. Moody's Investors Service was bought by credit reporting company [Dun and Bradstreet](/dandb) (D&B) in 1962 yet was veered off in 2000. It has been an independent company from that point forward.

## The 2008 Financial Crisis

Moody's, S&P, and Fitch have all been vigorously censured for their job in the financial market crisis of 2008. A significant part of the analysis centers around the AAA ratings that were given to mortgage-backed securities that much of the time were involved [subprime loans](/subprimeloan). The ratings agencies' exceptionally complex models failed to consider the possibility of a broad cross country decline in housing prices and what that would mean for the performance of the bonds.

In 2007, as housing prices began to fall, Moody's [downgraded](/downgrade) 83% of the mortgage securities that had been rated Aaa just one year sooner. The pervasiveness of a system where a bond's issuers pay the ratings company for their work has been faulted by certain spectators for expanded ratings. Moody's rival S&P paid $1.5 billion to the Justice Department, 19 states, and the District of Columbia to determine claims that it intentionally deceived investors.
