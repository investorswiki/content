# Inefficient Portfolio
## What Is an Inefficient Portfolio?

An inefficient portfolio is one that conveys an expected return that is too low for the amount of risk taken on. On the other hand, an inefficient portfolio likewise alludes to one that requires too much risk for a given expected return. By and large, an inefficient portfolio has a poor risk-to-compensate ratio.

## Figuring out an Inefficient Portfolio

An inefficient [portfolio](/portfolio) opens an investor to a higher degree of risk than needed to accomplish a target return. For instance, a portfolio of high-yield bonds expected to give just the risk-free rate of return would be supposed to be inefficient. An investor could accomplish a similar return by purchasing [Treasury bills](/treasurybill), which are considered among the safest investments in the world (as opposed to high-yield bonds, which are, by definition, rated as risky investments).

## Efficient Portfolios versus Inefficient Portfolios

In an efficient portfolio, investable assets are combined such that creates the best conceivable expected level of return for their level of risk — or the lowest risk for a target return. The line that interfaces this multitude of efficient portfolios is known as the [efficient frontier](/efficientfrontier). The efficient frontier addresses those portfolios that have the maximum rate of return for each given level of risk. The last thing investors need is a portfolio with a low expected return and a high level of risk.

No point on the efficient frontier is any better than some other point. Investors must analyze their own risk-return inclinations to figure out where they ought to invest in the efficient frontier. This concept was first planned by [Harry Markowitz](/harrymarkowitz) in 1952. In his paper "Portfolio Selection," which was distributed in the Journal of Finance in 1952. Markowitz spearheaded the concept of the [modern portfolio theory](/modernportfoliotheory) (MPT). As indicated by MPT, an investment's risk and return attributes ought not be seen alone. All things considered, they ought to be assessed by what the investment means for the overall portfolio's risk and return.

MPT accepts that investors are risk-disinclined, implying that given two portfolios that offer similar expected return, investors will lean toward the safer one. Consequently, an investor will take on increased [risk](/risk) provided that compensated by higher expected returns; an investor who needs higher expected returns must acknowledge more risk. The assumption is that a rational investor won't invest in a portfolio on the off chance that a subsequent portfolio exists with a better risk-expected return profile.

Basically, MPT can be utilized to develop a portfolio that limits risk for a given level of expected return; it is exceptionally helpful for investors attempting to build efficient portfolios utilizing exchange-traded funds (ETFs). Efficient portfolios use modern portfolio theory. As indicated by the theory, you can limit the volatility of your portfolio by spreading your risk among various types of investments. Utilizing this thought, a portfolio of risky stocks could, on the whole, have less risk than a portfolio that stands firm on just a single concentrated situation, even assuming it is a moderately safe holding.

## Highlights
- As a rule, an inefficient portfolio has a poor risk-to-compensate ratio; it opens an investor to a higher degree of risk than needed to accomplish a target return.
- An inefficient portfolio is one that conveys an expected return that is too low for the amount of risk taken on.
- In an efficient portfolio, investable assets are combined such that delivers the best conceivable expected level of return for their level of risk — or the lowest risk for a target return.
