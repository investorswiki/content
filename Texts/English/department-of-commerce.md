## Figuring out the Department of Commerce (DOC)

The Department of Commerce (DOC) is a Cabinet-level executive department of the U.S. government that is dedicated to advancing economic growth. The department attempts to make occupations through sustainable development, economic growth, positive international trade terms, and the openness of high technology. It works closely with businesses, colleges, universities, and urban communities and towns to accomplish those objectives.

The Department of Commerce was initially part of the Department of Commerce and Labor, which was laid out on Feb. 14, 1903, by President Theodore Roosevelt. It turned into a standalone department when a separate Department of Labor was laid out on March 4, 1913, by President Howard Taft on his last day in office.

U.S. labor leaders started campaigning for a Department of Labor in the late 1860s, after the Civil War. In 1888, President Chester Arthur laid out the non-Cabinet level Department of Labor, which was planned to collect data about working individuals in the United States. In the late 1890s, pressure developed to lay out a Department of Commerce to address the interests of business. Labor leaders had been happy with the non-Cabinet department yet protested Cabinet status for business when it was not given to labor.

President Theodore Roosevelt accepted that business and labor ought to cooperate; in this way, as pressure for a Department of Commerce developed, he utilized the opportunity to hoist Labor to Cabinet status too. Pressure from the labor movement, which felt that business and labor were working in resistance, prompted the split of the two departments in 1913.

In 2012, President Barack Obama proposed in his State of the Union address that the Commerce Department be supplanted by another department dedicated to the promotion of trade and exports. That was remembered for his proposed budget that year, and in every year for the balance of his administration, without progress.
