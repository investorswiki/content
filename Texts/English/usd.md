## A Brief History of the USD

The USD has been the official currency of the United States since the entry of the National Currency Act of 1785. Before that, the United States utilized an interwoven system of temperamental mainland currency, British pounds, and different foreign currencies. From the beginning, the dollar was named exclusively in coins, with paper currency presented in 1861, and its value was keyed to the relative prices of gold, silver, and copper.

Different acts of Congress modified the USD's design, value, and underlying commodities until the currency's oversight was formalized with the Federal Reserve Act of 1913.

U.S. dollars stopped being redeemable with the **de facto** abandonment of the gold standard in 1933, when President Franklin D. Roosevelt restricted the private ownership of gold. In 1944, the [Bretton Woods Agreement](/brettonwoodsagreement) effectively forced each of the major currencies of the world to change over from a precious metal-based value system to one of the [fixed exchange rates](/fixedexchangerate), with governments permitted to sell gold to the United States for $35 an ounce, payable just in U.S. dollars. The gold standard was formally abandoned in 1971, when the Bretton Woods exchange rates were abandoned.

Today, the USD is a free-drifting currency on global forex markets. In the post-Bretton Woods world, the U.S. dollar acts as the reserve currency of most countries. Rather than stockpiling gold and silver, the [central banks](/centralbank) of the world keep a consistent reserve of dollars as a [hedge](/hedge) against inflation.
