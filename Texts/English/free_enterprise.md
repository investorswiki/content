# Free Enterprise
## What is free enterprise?
Free enterprise, otherwise called free market or capitalism, is an economic system driven by supply and demand. Private businesses and consumers control the marketplace with next to zero obstruction from the government. In this type of system, the government doesn't have a central plan for the country's economy.
## More profound definition
The parts of free enterprise include:
- Freedom to pick which business to open and how it works.
- Right to claim private property.
- Driven by the craving to boost profits.
- Competition among the producers of goods and services.
- Right of consumers to freely spend their money.

In a free enterprise system, consumers are individuals who pay for products and services. Eventually, their self-interest helps drive this type of economic system. Consumers conclude what they need to spend their money on and which businesses they need to purchase goods and services from. They shop around for the best potential goods at the most reduced prices.
One of the greatest parts of free enterprise is that individuals are free to pick. This additionally reaches out to workers, who have the freedom to pick the type of employment they wish to have. They not just get to pick which field they need to work in, yet in addition which employers they wish to work for.
Businesses are the producers in a free market system. The businesses are responsible for delivering the highest quality goods and services at prices that augment profits. Businesses answer what consumers need and what consumers are spending their money on. While free enterprise permits entrepreneurs to start any sort of business they pick, it offers no guarantees that the business will succeed.
Free enterprise advances economic growth by empowering entrepreneurs to begin new businesses. Numerous businesses offering something similar or comparable goods and services leads to competition, which is great for the consumer. At the point when businesses contend with one another to create better products at better prices, the consumer receives the rewards. In like manner, competition can lead to innovation as businesses endeavor to think of better approaches to boost their profits.
## Free enterprise model
In free enterprise, there are three types of markets: resource, product and financial. Resource markets are marketplaces where businesses can get labor, raw materials and capital. Businesses tap into the resource market when they need to track down new employees to work for their company. Product markets are the marketplaces where businesses sell their completed goods and services. This does exclude the sale of raw materials or other intermediate goods expected to create the end result. Financial markets are marketplaces where purchasers and sellers exchange assets like stocks, bonds, securities, currencies and then some.
While a free enterprise system has next to no government impedance, a communist economic system accompanies heavy government regulations. In the middle of between free enterprise and communist economies are mixed economies. The United States has a mixed economy. While it is generally a free market, it isn't unregulated. The government forces a few regulations to safeguard consumers and workers without encroaching on the freedoms granted to businesses in a free enterprise economic system.

## Features
- The contention for free enterprise depends on the conviction that government impedance in business and the economy hampers growth.
- A free enterprise legal system will in general bring about capitalism.
- Free enterprise alludes to business activities that are not regulated by the government but rather are defined by a set of legal rules, for example, property rights, contracts, and competitive bidding.
