## What Is a Rectangle?

A rectangle is a pattern that happens on price charts. A rectangle is shaped when the price arrives at a similar horizontal support and resistance levels on numerous occasions. The price is restricted to moving between the two horizontal levels, making a rectangle. The concept of a rectangle is like a Darvas Box.

## What Does a Rectangle Tell You?

A rectangle is a [technical analysis](/technicalanalysis) pattern made on a chart. The term alludes to an example where the price of a security is trading inside a limited reach where the levels of resistance and support are parallel to one another, looking like the state of a rectangle.

The limited reach, or rectangle, generally happens when investors are hesitant about the long-term course of a security. Thus, it rises and falls inside the defined reach, unfit to gain ground one way or another.

In a rectangle pattern, investors will see the price of the security test the levels of support and resistance several times before a breakout. When the security breaks out of the rectangle's reach, in one or the other heading, it is viewed as trending toward the breakout. Not all breakouts turn out to find success. For instance, the price could break out of the rectangle to the upside and fall once more into the rectangle shortly later. That is called a [failed break](/failedbreak).

## Instances of How to Use a Rectangle

There are several methods for trading a rectangle. The two primary methods are to try to capture profit while the price moves this way and that inside the rectangle or sit tight for breakouts.

### Range Trading

Trading the rectangle requires recognizing the pattern early. Since a breakout is probably going to happen at last, the reach or rectangle trader is expecting to get in a couple of effective trades before that occurs.

- They endeavor to buy close to support, as the price turns up. A [stop loss](/stop-lossorder) is placed below support, and a [profit target](/profit-target) is set below resistance.
- They endeavor to [short](/short) close to resistance, as the price turns down. A stop loss is placed above resistance, and a profit target goes above support.

In the event that the price breaks out of the rectangle, this will bring about a losing trade for these traders. The price will break through support or resistance, and their stop loss will be set off.

### Breakout Trading

At the point when the price breaks through support or resistance, the [breakout](/breakout) trader gets a move on. They buy assuming the price moves above resistance, or they short on the off chance that the price falls below support. They place a stop loss in case the price switches on them. A few traders like to take the rectangle's level and afterward add it to the rectangle's top for an upside breakout (or deduct the range from the lower part of the rectangle on a downside breakout). That furnishes them with a profit target.

For instance, accept the price is going somewhere in the range of $48 and $50 for quite a long time. At long last, the price breaks above $50. The level of the reach, $2, is added to the highest point of the reach, $50, giving a target of $52. In the event that the price broke to the downside, the target is $46.

These strategies sound simple, however they are not so simple to execute in reality. Normally, the price won't slow down at precisely the same support or resistance each time the price visits the area. Determining where to go long or short, or when a breakout happens, isn't clear 100% of the time.

There are different varieties of these fundamental methods, for example, utilizing a [trailing stop loss](/trailingstop) for the exit or utilizing technical indicators to aid with the entry timing.

## Real-World Example of a Rectangle

During the rectangle, the price action combined into a smaller reach. This cycle framed another chart pattern called the triangle. The price broke below the low of the triangle before dipping under the low of the rectangle.

## Rectangle versus Head and Shoulders Pattern

A rectangle is a period where the price is moving sideways. A [head and shoulders](/head-shoulders) pattern is where the price is progressing from an uptrend to a downtrend. The price is making higher tops on the left side and afterward a lower top on the right. It shows the uptrend might switch.

## Limitations of the Rectangle Chart Pattern

A rectangle is not difficult to spot however not so natural to trade. The price will not necessarily arrive at the prior support or resistance levels, and sometimes it will surpass them. That can deceive traders, coming about in missed or losing trades.

False breakouts are copious during rectangles. A few traders really like to hang tight for a false breakout and afterward place a trade betting that the reach will proceed.

A few breakouts will bring about immense profits as the price bursts out of the rectangle with a big move. Numerous rectangles will end with negligible price movement. At times, the price moves out of the reach and afterward begins running once more.

## Features
- A few traders like to trade the rectangles, buying close to the base and selling or shorting close to the top, while others like to hang tight for breakouts.
- The rectangle closes when there is a breakout, and the price moves out of the rectangle.
- A rectangle happens when the price is moving between horizontal support and resistance levels.
- The pattern shows there is no trend, as the price goes all over among support and resistance.
