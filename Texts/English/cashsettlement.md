# Cash Settlement
## What Is a Cash Settlement?

A cash settlement is a settlement method utilized in certain futures and options contracts where, upon expiration or exercise, the seller of the [financial instrument](/financialinstrument) doesn't deliver the genuine (physical) underlying asset however rather transfers the associated [cash position](/cash_position).

## Figuring out a Cash Settlement

[Futures](/futurescontract) and options contracts are derivative instruments that have values in light of a [underlying asset](/underlying-asset), which can be an equity or a commodity. At the point when a futures contract or options contract is expired or exercised, the reasonable recourse is for the holder of the contract to deliver the physical commodity or transfer the genuine shares of stock. This is known as physical delivery and can be substantially more bulky than a cash settlement.

On the off chance that an investor goes [short](/short) on a futures contract for $10,000 worth of silver, for instance, it is badly designed toward the finish of the contract for the holder to deliver the silver to another investor physically. To dodge this, futures and [options contracts](/optionscontract) can be conducted with a cash settlement, where, toward the finish of the contract, the holder of the position is either credited or charged the difference between the initial price and the last settlement.

For instance, the purchaser of a cash-settled cotton futures contract is required to pay the difference between the [spot price](/spotprice) of cotton and the futures price, instead of taking ownership of physical heaps of cotton. This is rather than [physical](/physicaldelivery) settlement, where delivery of the real underlying instrument(s) happens.

Traders and examiners in agricultural futures and options markets, who trade things like cows and other livestock, additionally generally favor this sort of arrangement. These traders are not farmers or meat processors and just care about the [market price](/market-price). Thus, they don't wish to take delivery of a herd of live creatures.

> Most options and futures contracts are cash-settled. In any case, an exception is listed [equity options](/equity_derivative) contracts, which are frequently settled by delivery of the real underlying shares of stock.

## Benefits of a Cash Settlement

For sellers not wishing to take real possession of the underlying [cash commodity](/cashcommodity), a cash settlement is a more helpful method of executing futures and options contracts. Cash-settled contracts are one of the primary explanations behind the entry of examiners and, thus, bring more [liquidity](/liquidity) to derivatives markets.

Different benefits to cash settlements include:

1. **Reducing the overall time and costs required during a contract's finalization**: Cash-settled contracts are moderately simple to deliver in light of the fact that they require just the transfer of money. A real physical delivery has extra costs attached onto it, for example, transportation endlessly costs associated with guaranteeing delivery quality and verification.
1. **Safeguards against a default**: Cash settlement requires [margin accounts](/marginaccount), which are observed daily to guarantee that they have the required balances to conduct a trade.

## Special Considerations

Cash settlement can turn into an issue at [expiration](/expirationdate) on the grounds that, without the delivery of the real underlying assets, any [hedges](/fence) in place before expiration won't be offset. This means that a trader must be constant to close out supports or roll over lapsing derivatives positions to repeat the terminating positions. This issue doesn't happen with physical delivery.

## Cash Settlement Example

Futures contracts are taken out by investors who accept a [commodity](/commodity) will increase or diminish in price from here on out. On the off chance that an investor goes short a futures contract for wheat, they are expecting the price of wheat will diminish in the short term. A contract is initiated with one more investor who takes the opposite side of the coin, accepting wheat will increase in price.

An investor goes short on a futures contract for 100 bushels of wheat for a total of $10,000. This means toward the finish of the contract, on the off chance that the price of 100 bushels of wheat drops to $8,000, the investor is set to earn $2,000.

Notwithstanding, assuming the price of 100 bushels of wheat increases to $12,000, the investor loses $2,000. Reasonably, toward the finish of the contract, the 100 bushels of wheat are "delivered" to the investor with the [long position](/long).

To make things more straightforward, a cash settlement can be utilized. Assuming the price increases to $12,000, the short investor is required to pay the difference of $12,000 - $10,000, or $2,000, instead of really delivering the wheat. On the other hand, in the event that the price diminishes to $8,000, the investor is paid $2,000 by the long position holder.
