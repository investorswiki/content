## What Is Poop and Scoop?

"Poop and scoop" happens when a small group of informed individuals endeavors to drive down a stock's price by spreading false information, bits of gossip, and generally harming information ("poop") to then buy the stock at a lower price ("scoop"). In the event that they are fruitful, they can purchase the stock at bargain prices, as the overall marketplace will have sold off the security, making the price fall decisively. "Poop and scoop" is generally disliked by securities exchange regulators and can be prosecuted by the SEC.

## Figuring out Poop and Scoop

"Poop and scoop" is a purposeful strategy to try to move the market price of a security by delivering or promoting false, negative information about a company or an asset. The participants in the "poop and scoop" mean to buy the targeted security at a discount, realizing that the briefly depressed market price doesn't mirror the security's true value and the price will once the remainder of the market finds this. They can then sell the security at a profit later.

The SEC characterizes this sort of activity as a form of market manipulation and securities fraud under the 1934 Securities Exchange Act. Researchers have exhibited that market manipulation to influence prices is both conceivable and possibly profitable for controllers however hurts society by lessening the effectiveness of arbitrage at finding the true valuation of securities and in this manner diminishing the proficiency of the market at assigning productive resources in the economy. This makes a requirement for a regulator to prevent securities market regulation (among different purposes).

"Poop and scoop" is something contrary to a "[pump and dump](/pumpanddump)," in which at least one people will spread false information on a security with expectations of raising the price misleadingly and having the option to sell their position at a lot higher price. "Poop and scoop" is somewhat more uncommon, as the potential gains that can be realized by pumping up and afterward selling a low-value stock will generally be greater than those conceivable by pooping on and afterward selling a notable, higher-priced stock. Both of these practices are criminal operations and punishable by the [SEC](/sec) in the United States.

## Poop and Scoop versus Short and Distort

A comparative (and in like manner unlawful) tactic employed by exploitative traders is "[short and distort](/shortanddistort)," where rather than buying the stocks at a discount when reports and false information make the price drop, investors short sell the security and afterward talk the value down my spreading misinformation for a profit. Be that as it may, perceiving a real short position being underlying a company by a large investor, a "poop and scoop" (or a "short and distort") could likewise parlay off the noise genuine shorters are generating.

For example, an activist [hedge fund](/hedgefund) could be publicly hoarding a short position, while spreading the word about it well they're sending off a campaign against certain corporate actions and are shorting the stock in like manner. To capitalize on the negative news encompassing the stock subject to investigation, a "poop and scoop" or "distort and short" shark could assist the activist hedge with funding by overstating and adding to the negative news, while likewise accumulating a short position.

In any case, there's tiny difference in the thought processes behind the poop and scoop and hedge fund investors.

Algorithms that act on fake news or intentionally deceptive public information can both increase controllers' returns and worsen the social costs and damage of information base market manipulation. On the other hand, in the event that calculations can be programmed or figure out how to separate fake from authentic information better than human traders, then, at that point, they could make the contrary difference. Notwithstanding, such smart calculations may very well as effectively additionally be utilized to work related to fake news bots to produce, disperse, and trade on seriously persuading fake information to fool other, less sophisticated calculations and traders, which could extraordinarily amplify the market and economic damage (as well as gains to controllers).
