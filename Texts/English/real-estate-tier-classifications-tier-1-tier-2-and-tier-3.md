# Real Estate Market Tiers
## What Are Real Estate Market Tiers?

Real estate market tiers arrange urban areas as Tier I, Tier II, or Tier III relying upon the stage of development of their [real estate](/realestate) markets.

Every real estate tier has characterizing attributes:

- Tier I urban communities have a developed and laid out real estate market. These urban areas will generally be highly developed, with helpful schools, facilities, and organizations. These urban communities have the most costly real estate.
- Tier II urban communities are currently fostering their real estate markets. These urban communities will quite often be exceptional, and many companies have invested in these areas, however they haven't yet arrived at their pinnacle. Real estate is normally moderately cheap here; in any case, assuming growth proceeds, prices will rise.
- Tier III urban areas have undeveloped or nonexistent real estate markets. Real estate in these urban communities will in general be cheap, and there is an opportunity for growth assuming real estate companies choose to invest in fostering the area.

## Seeing Real Estate Market Tiers

Numerous organizations see Tier II and Tier III urban communities as helpful objections, especially in times of economic strength. These areas present an opportunity for growth and development and permit organizations to extend and give employment to individuals in developing urban communities. Moreover, the cost to operate in prime Tier I real estate is costly, and companies frequently consider underdeveloped areas to be a method for extending and invest in future growth.

Conversely, organizations will generally zero in favoring the laid out markets in Tier I urban communities when the economy is in distress, as these areas don't need the investment and risks associated with undeveloped areas. However they are costly, these urban communities feature the best facilities and social programs.

U.S. urban communities frequently classified as Tier I urban communities incorporate New York, Los Angeles, Chicago, Boston, San Francisco, and Washington D.C. Then again, Tier II urban communities might comprise of Seattle, Baltimore, Pittsburgh, and Austin â€” despite the fact that groupings might contrast through time and in view of certain criteria. In any case, real estate prices frequently fluctuate radically from one tier to another. For instance, Kiplinger gauges a median home value in Pittsburgh of $152,000, compared to $418,000 in New York City and $650,000 in Los Angeles, as of Feb. 2020.

## Risks Associated with Different Real Estate Market Tiers

Tier I urban communities are many times at risk for encountering a [housing bubble](/housing_bubble), which happens when prices flood due to high demand. Be that as it may, when prices get too high, nobody can stand to pay for real estate. At the point when this occurs, individuals move away, real estate demand diminishes, and prices strongly drop. This means that the bubble has "burst."

Tier II and Tier III urban areas will generally be more hazardous spots to foster real estate and organizations. These risks stem from the way that the frameworks in Tier II and Tier III urban communities are underdeveloped and don't have the resources to support new pursuits. It's costly to foster these frameworks, and there's consistently the chance that the development will not succeed, and the real estate market will wind up coming up short.

## Highlights
- At the point when the economy is poor, organizations for the most part stick to Tier 1 urban areas, yet when it is flourishing, they might think about Tier 2 and Tier 3 urban communities.
- Real estate market tiers are broken down into three levels, addressing how advanced the markets are in the underlying urban communities.
- The higher the tier of the city, the more beneficial it is seen for development by organizations hoping to extend.
- Tier 1 urban communities, for example, New York or Los Angeles are highly developed, Tier 2 urban communities, for example, Seattle or Pittsburgh are as yet fostering their real estate markets, and Tier 3 urban communities, for example, Akron or Biloxi have underdeveloped markets.
