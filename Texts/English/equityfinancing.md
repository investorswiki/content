[Equity](/equity) financing comes from many sources: for instance, a business person's friends and family, investors, or a [initial public offering](/ipo) (IPO).

In the event that a company has given investors a percentage of their company through the sale of equity, the best way to eliminate them (and their stake in the business) is to repurchase their shares, which is a cycle called a purchase out. In any case, the cost to repurchase the shares will probably be more costly than the money they initially gave you.
