# Composite Index
## What Is a Composite Index?

A composite index is a statistical device that gathers a wide range of [equities](/value), securities, or indexes to make a representation of overall market or sector performance. Normally, the components of a composite index are combined in a standardized manner so that large measures of data can be introduced without any problem.

## Figuring out a Composite Index

Composite indexes are made to conduct investment analysis, measure economic trends, and forecast market activity.

They are additionally utilized as instruments for tracking securities' price changes relative to a whole stock market or sector. They in this manner give a valuable benchmark against which to measure a financial backer's portfolio. The goal of a [well-differentiated portfolio](/enhancement) is ordinarily to outperform the really composite indexes. Three of the most-followed indexes in the United States are the Nasdaq Composite, Dow Jones Industrial Average (the Dow), and the Standard and Poor's 500 Index (S&P 500).

## Types of Composite Indexes
### The Nasdaq Composite

The [Nasdaq Composite](/nasdaqcompositeindex) was first settled in 1971 with just 50 companies. Today, an index incorporates in excess of 3,000 individual, common equities that are listed on the Nasdaq Stock Market. The Nasdaq Composite is calculated utilizing a [market capitalization](/marketcapitalization) (market cap)- weighted methodology (likewise alluded to as a cap-weighted methodology).

### Standard and Poor's 500 Index

The [Standard and Poor's 500 Index](/sp500) (S&P 500) is widely viewed as the best barometer of large U.S. equities. It contains the 500 largest, U.S. public corporations by [market value](/marketvalue). The S&P 500 is likewise a cap-weighted index.

### Dow Jones Industrial Average

The Dow Jones Industrial Average (likewise alluded to just as "the Dow" or "the Dow Jones") is a price-weighted composite index. At the point when you read in the news that the "market is up," they are generally alluding to the Dow.

## Cap-Weighted Index versus Price-Weighted Index

In contrast to the Dow (which is a price-weighted index), the Nasdaq and the S&P 500 are both cap-weighted indexes.

With cap-weighted indexes, every part's total market capitalization is proportionately used to decide the index level. In this methodology, parts with a higher market capitalization will have more weight in the composite, and parts with a lower market capitalization will have less weight in the composite. For a stock to show up at a cap-weighted index's total market capitalization, the price per share of each company is duplicated by its total number of shares outstanding:

### Illustration of a Cap-Weighted Composite Index
- Stock A: Price per share equals $25 and total shares outstanding equivalent a million
- Stock B: Price per share equals $50 and total shares outstanding equivalent 500,000
- Stock C: Price per share equals $50 and total shares outstanding equivalent a million

Their individual market caps would be:

- Stock A = $25 x a million = $25,000,000
- Stock B = $50 x 500,000 = $25,000,000
- Stock C = $50 x a million = $50,000,000

Subsequently, the total market capitalization of the composite would be $100,000,000. Stock A's weight would be 25%, Stock B's weight would be 25%, and Stock C's weight would be half. Commonly, a [index divisor](/indexdivisor) would be utilized to deliver the index sensible for reporting. In this case, the divisor would be $100,000, and the initial composite level would be equivalent to $100,000,000/$100,000 = 1,000.

In a [price-weighted index](/priceweightedindex), parts are weighted by price (not by market capitalization or by the number of shares outstanding). Each stock impacts the index in relation to its price per share. A stock with a higher price will be given more weight than a stock at a lower price, and subsequently, that specific stock will greaterly affect the index's overall performance.

### Illustration of a Price-Weighted Composite Index

In a [price-weighted index](/priceweightedindex), parts are weighted by price, not by market capitalization or shares outstanding. Each stock impacts the index in relation to its price per share. A stock with a higher price will be given more weight than a stock with a lower price, and will consequently have a greater say in the index's performance:

- Stock A: price equals $3
- Stock B: price equals $6
- Stock C: price equals $30
- Stock D: price equals $10
- Stock E: price equals $1

The composite level would be found by adding the parts, then partitioning that sum by the number of parts. In this case, the composite level would be $10 ($50/5 = $10).

## Features
- Composite indexes are utilized to conduct investment examinations, measure economic trends, and forecast market activity.
- The goal of a very much broadened portfolio is generally to outperform the really composite indexes â€” the Nasdaq Composite, the Dow, and the S&P 500.
- A composite index is a statistical device that gathers a wide range of equities, securities, or indexes to make a representation of overall market or sector performance.
