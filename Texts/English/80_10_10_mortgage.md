In the event that you're worrying about that 20 percent down payment, there are a number of first-time homebuyer loans and awards that can assist you with moving into a permanent spot for less upfront money without the additional layer of a piggyback loan:
- FHA loan - Backed by the Federal Housing Administration, a FHA loan permits you to pull off just 3.5 percent down on a home purchase. You can likewise fit the bill for this loan with shoddy credit.

You may be contemplating deferring a home purchase until you can make a more sizable down payment, yet McBride points out that the waiting game can be a losing formula.
"Home prices have been rising quicker than individuals could save, so making the 20 percent down payment is a moving target," McBride says. "Particularly for a first property, it's very much conceivable to make a smaller down payment to get into that starter home. Then, at that point, following a couple of years, when you trade up to a more permanent home, you have sufficient equity that it turns into your 20 percent down payment."
