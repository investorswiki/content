# Martingale System
## What Is the Martingale System?

The Martingale system is a system of [investing](/investing) in which the dollar value of investments constantly increases after losses, or the position size increases with the bringing down [portfolio](/portfolio) size. The Martingale system was presented by French mathematician Paul Pierre Levy in the eighteenth century. The strategy depends on the reason that only one great bet or trade is expected to turn your fortunes around.

This technique can be diverged from the [anti-martingale system](/antimartingale), which includes halving a bet each time there is a trade loss and doubling it each time there is a gain.

## Figuring out the Martingale System

The fundamental thought behind the Martingale system is that statistically, you can't lose constantly, and in this manner you ought to increase the amount allocated in investments — even assuming they are declining in value — in anticipation of a future increase.

Martingale strategies depend on the theory of [mean reversion](/meanreversion). Without a copious supply of money to get positive outcomes, you really want to get through missed trades that can bankrupt a whole account. It's likewise important to note that the amount risked on the trade is far higher than the expected gain. Notwithstanding these downsides, there are ways of further developing the martingale strategy that can support your chances of succeeding.

The Martingale system is usually compared to betting in a casino with the expectations of breaking even. At the point when a player who utilizes this method encounters a loss, they quickly double the size of the next bet. By over and over doubling the bet when they lose, the card shark, in theory, will eventually even out with a success. This accepts the speculator has an unlimited supply of money to wager with, or if nothing else enough money to come to the triumphant payoff. For sure, just a couple of successive losses under this system could lead to losing all that you accompanied.

## Fundamental Example of the Martingale System

To figure out the rudiments behind the strategy, we should check an essential model out. Assume you have a coin and participate in a betting game of either heads or tails with a starting bet of $1. There is an equivalent probability that the coin will land on heads or tails, and each flip is independent. (The prior flip doesn't impact the outcome of the next flip.)

However long you stick with a similar call of either heads or tails, you would eventually, given a limitless amount of money, see the coin land on heads (or tails) — assuming that is your call — and in this way recover the entirety of your losses, plus $1.

## Why Martingale Works Better With Forex

Notwithstanding, even in instances of a sharp [decline](/decline), the currency's value rarely arrives at zero.

The [FX](/forex) market likewise offers another advantage that makes it more appealing for traders who have the capital to follow the martingale strategy. The ability to earn interest permits traders to offset a portion of their losses with [interest](/interestrate) income. That means a shrewd martingale trader might need to utilize the strategy on currency pairs toward [positive carry](/positivecarry).

As such, they would borrow utilizing a low-interest rate currency and buy a currency with a higher interest rate.
