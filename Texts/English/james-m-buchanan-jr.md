## Public Choice Theory

In 1962, alongside individual economist Gordon Tullock, James M. Buchanan Jr. composed **The Calculus of Consent**, which presents the fundamental principles of public decision theory. The book is viewed as a reference to the discipline of public decision in political science and economics.

The public decision theory applies economics to political direction and challenges the conventional convictions that legislators act to the greatest advantage of their constituents. It assesses how incentives and personal gain shape lawmakers' decisions. Buchanan's experiences into human nature and political results give a comprehension of the advantages that spur political actors and consider more accurate expectations of political decisions.In 1986, Buchanan was granted the Nobel Prize in economics for "his development of the contractual and constitutional bases for the theory of economic and political direction."

The Center for Public Choice at George Mason University expands on the earth shattering economic and political science speculations for which Buchanan was granted the Nobel Prize. As a research program, public decision stretches out the instruments of economics to break down the behavior of citizens, competitors, lawmakers, civil servants, and judges. Made in 1957 at the University of Virginia, the Center was initially called the Thomas Jefferson Center for Studies in Political Economy. In 1969, the Center moved to Virginia Tech and, in 1983, to George Mason University, where it works today.
