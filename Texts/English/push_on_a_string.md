# Pushing On A String
## What Is Pushing On A String?

Pushing on a string was a phrase begat as a similitude for the limits of monetary policy and the barrenness of central banks concerning invigorating an economy.

## Grasping Pushing On A String

Pushing on a string is a figure of discourse for influence that is more effective in moving things in a single heading as opposed to another — you can pull, yet not push. [Monetary policy](/monetarypolicy) here and there just works in a single heading since organizations and households can't be forced to spend in the event that they would rather not. Increasing the [monetary base](/monetarybase) and [bank reserves](/bank-reserve) won't invigorate an economy in the event that banks think it is too unsafe to loan and the private sector needs to save more due to economic vulnerability.

In economics, pushing on a string explicitly alludes to a situation where [expansionary monetary policy](/expansionary_policy) is ineffective at raising an economy out of a recession. Since the demand to hold cash is effectively unlimited so options to the [supply of money](/moneysupply) and credit are just added to the cash balances of financial institutions, organizations, or consumers (or used to pay down debt), and result in no increase in [aggregate demand](/aggregatedemand) or multiplier effect. This situation is known as a [liquidity trap](/liquiditytrap), where the market can ingest unlimited measures of new liquidity into the preparatory cash holdings of market participants paying little mind to how low interest rates are pushed.

Since these conditions render expansionary monetary policy weak to invigorate a [economic recovery](/economic-recovery), the similarity of pushing on a string is utilized as a contention for expansionary [fiscal policy](/fiscalpolicy) to take over as the primary tool to raise an economy out of recession. To broaden the relationship, assuming the money supply is the string that the central bank is (fruitlessly) pushing on, then, at that point, it ultimately depends on the fiscal policy producers to "pull" on the opposite finish of the string by straightforwardly helping aggregate demand with new government spending to reestablish confidence and lift private spending of cash balances through the [multiplier effect](/multipliereffect).

While the phrase "pushing on a string" is frequently credited to British economist [John Maynard Keynes](/john_maynard_keynes), there is no evidence he utilized it. In any case, this accurate allegory was utilized in U.S. Congressional declaration in 1935, when Federal Reserve Governor Marriner Eccles, repeating the phrase expressed by Congressman T. Alan Goldsborough, said there was minimal the Fed could do to animate the economy and end the [Great Depression](/great_depression):

>
> **Lead representative Eccles: Under current conditions there is very little, regardless, that can be done.**
>
>
> **Representative T. Alan Goldsborough: You mean you can't push a string.**
>
>
> **Lead representative Eccles: That is an effective method for putting it, one can't push a string. We are in the profundities of a depression and...beyond making an income sans work situation through reduction of discount rates and through the creation of excess reserves, there is very little, on the off chance that anything that the reserve organization can do toward achieving recovery.**

## Pushing On a String Example

The pushing on a string illustration was pertinent during the 2007-2008 Financial Crisis, when early efforts to invigorate the economy appeared to create little outcomes. The Fed had allocated trillions of dollars toward [quantitative easing](/quantitative-easing) (QE) and furthermore lowered the [federal funds rate](/federalfundsrate) to approach zero percent.

At first the Fed appeared unfit to create demand out of nowhere since households — troubled with debt — increased their [savings rate](/savings-rate). Monetary policy appeared desperate and useless, with the increase in money supply in the U.S. offset by declining [money velocity](/velocity). Thus, the Fed was pushing on a string.

Household debt fell until 2013, yet bounced back to a record level of $14.15 trillion toward the finish of 2019. Some accept that quantitative easing and low rates managed to fight off catastrophe — however we won't ever realize how much better or more terrible the crisis would have been without these efforts.
