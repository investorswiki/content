The FHA was laid out in 1934 by the U.S. government and turned out to be part of the U.S. [Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD)](/us-department-housing-urban-development-hud) in 1965.

The FHA funds its operations with income created through mortgage insurance premiums (MIPs).

## Grasping the FHA

The FHA is one of the world's largest mortgage insurers, protecting FHA-approved lenders from losses — especially on the off chance that the borrower defaults. It was laid out in 1934 to assist with animating the U.S. housing market. The underlying thought was that more individuals would fit the bill for mortgages to buy homes assuming lenders were given insurance.

## Special Considerations

The FHA expects borrowers to pay two types of MIPs:

- The first is the up-front MIP, which is 1.75% of the loan amount in 2022.
- The second is the annual MIP, which is charged month to month. These payments range from 0.45% to 1.05% of the loan amount.

Payment amounts contrast contingent upon the loan amount, the length of the loan, and the original [loan-to-value (LTV) ratio](/loantovalue). Originally, the annual MIP was automatically eliminated once borrowers hit 78% LTV in light of the original purchase price. After the [subprime mortgage crisis](/subprime-meltdown), the FHA was facing a fiscal crisis and in 2013 executed a rule that the annual MIP stays over the life of the loan. Because of the change, most borrowers with FHA mortgages will [refinance](/refinance) through a traditional mortgage once they hit 80% LTV. Even in the event that their credit scores have not improved fundamentally, they are bound to be approved for a conventional loan since they have 20% [equity in their property](/home_equity).
