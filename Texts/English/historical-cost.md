# Historical Cost
## What Is a Historical Cost?

A historical cost is a measure of value utilized in accounting in which the value of an asset on the balance sheet is recorded at its [original cost](/originalcost) when acquired by the company. The historical cost method is utilized for fixed assets in the United States under [generally accepted accounting principles](/gaap) (GAAP).

## Figuring out Historical Costs

The historical cost principle is a fundamental accounting principle under U.S. GAAP. Under the historical cost principle, most assets are to be recorded on the [balance sheet](/balancesheet) at their historical cost even on the off chance that they have essentially increased in value over the long haul. Not all assets are held at historical cost. For instance, [marketable securities](/marketablesecurities) are recorded at their fair market value on the balance sheet, and impaired elusive assets are written down from historical cost to their fair market value.

Esteeming assets at historical cost prevents exaggerating an asset's value when asset appreciation might be the consequence of unpredictable market conditions. For instance, in the event that a company's primary headquarters, including the land and building, was purchased for $100,000 in 1925, and its expected [market value](/marketvalue) today is $20 million, the asset is as yet recorded on the balance sheet at $100,000.

### Asset Depreciation

Moreover, as per [accounting conservatism](/accounting-conservatism), asset [depreciation](/depreciation) must be recorded to account for wear and tear on long-lived assets. [Fixed assets](/fixedasset, for example, buildings and machinery, will have depreciation recorded consistently over the asset's [useful life](/usefullife). On the balance sheet, annual depreciation is accumulated over the long haul and recorded below an asset's historical cost. The deduction of [accumulated depreciation](/accumulated-depreciation) from the historical cost brings about a lower net asset value, guaranteeing no exaggeration of an asset's true value.

## Asset Impairment versus Historical Cost

Autonomous of [asset depreciation](/depreciation) from physical wear and tear over long periods of purpose, an impairment might happen to certain assets, including intangibles, for example, [goodwill](/goodwill-impairment). With asset impairment, an asset's fair market value has dipped under what is originally listed on the balance sheet. An asset impairment charge is a normal restructuring cost as companies reexamine the value of certain assets and make business changes.

For instance, goodwill must be tried and explored annually for any impairment. Assuming it is worth not exactly carrying value on the books, the asset is viewed as impaired. Assuming it has ascended in value, no change is made to historical cost. On account of impairment, the devaluation of an asset in light of present market conditions would be a more conservative accounting practice than keeping the historical cost in salvageable shape. At the point when an asset is written off due to asset impairment, the loss straightforwardly lessens a company's profits.

## Mark-to-Market versus Historical Cost

The [mark-to-market](/marktomarket) practice is known as [fair value](/fairvalue) accounting, by which certain assets are recorded at their market value. This means that when the market moves, the value of an asset as reported yet to be determined sheet might go up or down. The deviation of the mark-to-market accounting from the historical cost principle is really useful to report on held-available to be purchased assets.

An asset's market value can be utilized to foresee future cash flow from expected sales. A common illustration of mark-to-market assets incorporates marketable securities held for the purpose of trading. As the market swings, securities are marked vertical or downward to mirror their true value under a given market condition. This considers a more accurate representation of what the company would receive on the off chance that the assets were sold right away, and it is helpful for profoundly [liquid](/liquidity) assets.
