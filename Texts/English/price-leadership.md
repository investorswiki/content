# Price Leadership
## What Is Price Leadership?

Price leadership happens while a leading firm in a given industry can apply sufficient influence in the sector that it can effectively determine the price of goods or services for the whole market. This type of firm is sometimes alluded to as the price leader.

This phenomenon is common in industries that have oligopolistic market conditions, like the airline industry. This level of influence in many cases leaves the opponents of the price leader with barely any choice yet to [follow its lead](/follow-the-leader-pricing) and match the prices in the event that they are to hold onto their [market share.](/marketshare) In the airline industry, a predominant company normally sets the prices and different airlines feel a sense of urgency to change their prices to match the prices of the leading firm.

## How Price Leadership Works

There are certain economic conditions that make the rise of price leadership bound to happen inside an industry: the number of companies included is small; entry to the industry is restricted; products are homogeneous; demand is [inelastic](/inelastic), or less flexible; organizations have a comparable long-run average total cost (LRATC). LRATC is an economics metric that is utilized to determine the base (or most minimal) average total cost at which a firm can deliver any given level of output over the long haul (when all data sources are variable).

The expansion of price leadership will in general happen all the more frequently in sectors that produce goods and services that offer little [differentiation](/product_differentiation) starting with one producer then onto the next.

Price leadership likewise will in general arise when there is a high level of consumer demand for a specific product; this outcomes in consumers being drawn away from any contending products. Accordingly, the price of the specific product that is encountering high levels of consumer demand turns into the market leader.

## Types of Price Leadership

There are three primary models of price leadership: barometric, deceitful, and predominant.

### Barometric

The barometric price leadership model happens when a particular firm is more skilled than others at distinguishing shifts in applicable market powers, for example, a change in production costs. This permits the firm to answer market powers all the more productively. For example, the firm might start a price change.

It is feasible for a firm with a small market share to act as a barometric price leader in the event that it's a decent producer and assuming the firm is receptive to trends in its market. Different producers might follow its lead, expecting that the price leader knows about something that they still can't seem to understand. Nonetheless, in light of the fact that a barometric leader has next to no power to impose its decisions on different firms in the industry, its leadership may be short-lived.

### Tricky

The tricky price leadership model might arise inside markets that have oligopolistic conditions. Deceitful price leadership happens because of an explicit or implicit agreement among a modest bunch of predominant firms to keep their prices in mutual arrangement.

Smaller firms inside the market are effectively forced into following the price change initiated by the predominant firms. This practice is most common in industries where the [cost of entry](/barrierstoentry) is high, and the costs of production are known.

These agreements between firms-either explicit or implicit-might be viewed as unlawful on the off chance that the work is designed to cheat the public. There is a fine line between price leadership and unlawful acts of collusion. Price leadership is bound to be viewed as conniving and possibly unlawful in the event that the changes in the price of a decent are not connected with changes in the operating costs of the firm.

### Prevailing

The prevailing price leadership model happens when one firm controls by far most of the market share in its industry. Inside the industry, there are other, smaller firms that give similar products or services as the leading firm. Nonetheless, in this model, these smaller firms can't influence prices.

A predominant price leadership model is sometimes alluded to as a partial [monopoly](/monopoly). In this type of model, the price leader could participate in predatory pricing, which alludes to the practice of bringing prices down to levels that make it unimaginable for smaller, contending firms to stay in business. In many countries, business decisions that enact predatory pricing and are pointed toward harming smaller companies are unlawful.

## Benefits and Disadvantages of Price Leadership

There are numerous possible benefits for firms that arise as price leaders inside an industry. In certain occurrences, different firms inside an industry may likewise benefit from the rise of a price leader. For instance, on the off chance that companies in a particular market follow a price leader by setting higher prices, then, at that point, all producers in that market stand to profit, insofar as demand stays consistent.

Price leadership additionally can possibly wipe out (or reduce) price wars. On the off chance that a market is totally contained companies of a comparable size, without even a trace of price leadership, price wars could result as every contender attempts to increase its share of the market.

One symptom of price leadership might be better-quality products because of an increase in profits. Increased profits frequently mean more revenue for companies to invest in research and development (R&D), and hence, an increase in their ability to design new products and deliver more value to customers.

The dynamics of price leadership may likewise make a system of relationship as opposed to competition. At the point when firms in a similar market pick a parallel pricing structure-as opposed to undermining each other-it encourages a positive environment helpful for growth for all companies.

There are additionally numerous expected disservices to the development of price leadership inside an industry. By and large, price leadership is simply beneficial to businesses (in terms of their profits and performance). Price leadership where prices are increased passes no material benefits on to consumers- - - but in the case where the price leader brings down prices consumers might benefit with more affordable goods and services.

In each price leadership model-barometric, tricky, predominant the venders benefit from increased revenues, not the consumers. Customers should pay something else for things that they were accustomed to getting for less (before the dealers planned to raise prices).

 Consumers, nonetheless, may benefit in the short run on the off chance that a price leader brings down prices. This expects the price leader isn't utilizing predatory pricing to drive firms not able to answer out of business and later on apply monopoly pressure and raise prices.

Price leadership can likewise be unfair to smaller firms since small firms who endeavor to match a leader's prices might not have a similar [economies of scale](/economiesofscale) as the leaders. This can make it difficult for them to support predictable price declines (and, in the long-term, to stay in business).

Price leadership can likewise bring about malpractices with respect to contending firms that pursue the choice not to follow the leader's prices. All things being equal, they might participate in aggressive promotion strategies, for example, rebates, unconditional promises, free delivery services, and installment payment plans.

At last, in a price leadership model, there is an inevitable error between the benefits gave to the price leader versus the benefit presented to different firms operating in a similar industry. For instance, assuming it costs the price leader less capital to create a similar product than it costs another firm, then the leader will set lower prices. This will bring about a loss for any firm that has higher costs than the price leader.
