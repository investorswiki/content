# Open Source
Open-source programming is a type of programming whose [source code](/source-code) is distributed and accessible for anybody to check out, change or reallocate. Open-source programming typically gets developed in an open, collaborative way between a wide range of participants. Such projects embrace principles of transparency, open exchange, free participation, fast prototyping, and community-arranged, collaborative development.
While all open-source programming licenses empower anybody to study, adjust, and reallocate the source code, some expect that the original source code is distributed alongside the modified source code.
Something contrary to open-source programming is shut source programming, whose source code isn't distributed, and just the person, team, or organization who made it has the privilege to adjust and disperse it.
Open-source programming can enjoy upper hands over different types of programming. While advancing the philosophy of open joint effort that might possibly benefit designers and users the same, it can likewise lead to a higher quality product due to the open call for participation getting a wide range of specialists from different fields. Fixing issues can likewise be quicker and lower cost than on account of shut source programming, as possibly a high number of participants have the right, access, and skill to keep an eye on those issues.
Then again, if open-source programming is developed in a decentralized way, without a single entity organizing the development cycle, it can require a substantial amount of investment for the various participants to settle on strategic choices. Many open-source projects execute special types of governance models to address this issue.
In more extensive terms, the movement that plans to make all or most programming utilize an open-source license is called the open-source programming movement. The objectives of this movement additionally incorporate working on open-source technology with the production of high-quality code made helpfully by comparably disapproved of individuals. Engineers who support the open-source programming movement intentionally compose and exchange code as a contribution to the philosophy of open coordinated effort.

## Highlights
- Open source alludes to a project, frequently a product or IT development project, with freely accessible code and permission to make alters, bug fixes, changes, and upgrades.
- Open source depends on community engagement, trust, and lenient licensing strategies.
- Open source programming efforts have been behind the absolute most famous applications and operating systems accessible, including the Android OS for cell phones and the Firefox web browser.
