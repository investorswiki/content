# Security Market Line (SML)
## What Is the Security Market Line?

The security market line (SML) is a line drawn on a chart that fills in as a graphical representation of the [capital asset pricing model (CAPM)](/capm) — which shows various levels of systematic, or market risk, of different [marketable securities](/marketablesecurities), plotted against the [expected return](/expectedreturn) of the whole market at some random time.

Otherwise called the "trademark line," the SML is a perception of the CAPM, where the x-pivot of the chart implies liability (in terms of [beta](/beta)), and the y-hub of the chart addresses expected return. The [market risk premium](/marketriskpremium) of a given not entirely settled by where it is plotted on the chart relative to the SML.

## Understanding the Security Market Line

The security market line is an investment evaluation instrument derived from the CAPM — a model that portrays [risk-return relationship](/riskreturntradeoff) for securities — and depends on the assumption that investors should be compensated for both the [time value of money (TVM)](/timevalueofmoney) and the comparing level of risk associated with any investment, alluded to as the [risk premium](/riskpremium).

The concept of beta is central to the CAPM and the SML. The beta of a security is a measure of its [systematic risk](/systematicrisk), which can't be disposed of by diversification. A beta value of one is considered as the overall market average. A beta value that is greater than one implies a liability level greater than the market average, and a beta value of short of what one implies a danger level that is not exactly the market average.

The formula for plotting the SML is:

- **Required return** = risk-free rate of return + beta (market return - risk-free rate of return)

> Albeit the SML can be a significant device for assessing and looking at securities, it ought not be utilized in seclusion, as the expected return of an investment over the risk-free rate of return isn't the main thing to consider while picking investments.

## Utilizing the Security Market Line

The security market line is ordinarily utilized by money managers and investors to assess an investment product that they're considering remembering for a [portfolio](/portfolio). The SML is valuable in deciding if the security offers a good expected return contrasted with its level of risk.

At the point when a security is plotted on the SML chart, in the event that it shows up over the SML, it is considered [undervalued](/undervalued) on the grounds that the position on the chart demonstrates that the security offers a greater return against its [inherent risk](/inherent-risk).

On the other hand, assuming the security plots below the SML, it is viewed as overvalued in price on the grounds that the expected return doesn't beat the inherent risk.

The SML is habitually utilized in looking at two comparable securities that offer roughly a similar return, to figure out which of them includes the least amount of inherent market risk relative to the expected return. The SML can likewise be utilized to contrast securities of equivalent risk with see which one offers the highest expected return against that level of risk.

## Features
- The formula for plotting the SML is **required return = risk-free rate of return + beta (market return - risk-free rate of return)**.
- The SML can assist with deciding if an investment product would offer a great expected return contrasted with its level of risk.
- The security market line (SML) is a line drawn on a chart that fills in as a graphical representation of the capital asset pricing model (CAPM).
