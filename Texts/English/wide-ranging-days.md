# Wide-Ranging Days
## What Are Wide-Ranging Days?

Wide-ranging days depict the price scope of a stock on an especially unstable day of trading. Wide-ranging days happen when the high and low prices of a stock are a lot further separated than they are on a normal day. Some [technical analysts](/technical-expert) recognize these days by utilizing the [volatility ratio](/volatility-ratio).

## Seeing Wide-Ranging Days

Wide-ranging days have a true reach that is bigger than the encompassing days, and wide-ranging days normally foresee a trend [reversal](/reversal). Extreme wide-ranging days signal major trend reversals, while less extreme wide-ranging days signal minor reversals.

The [average true range](/atr) (ATR) gives a method for contrasting the trading range between numerous days by checking out at the difference between current low minus the close of the previous period. The absolute true reach for a given period is the greater of the high for the period minus the low for the period, the high for the period minus the close for the previous period, or the close for the previous period minus the low for the current period.

The average true reach is normally a 14-day [exponential moving average](/ema) (EMA) of the true reach, albeit various trades might utilize various periods. An exponential moving average is a type of moving average that puts a greater weight and significance on the latest data points. This is additionally alluded to as the exponentially [weighted ](/weighted)moving average.

> After a sharp down-trend, a wide-ranging day with a strong close (close to the high of the day) is a signal that the trend will reverse. In the mean time, after a strong advance, a wide-ranging day with a weak close (close to the low of the day) signals a downside reversal.

Traders might involve volatility ratios in their stock charts while searching for potential reversal opportunities.
