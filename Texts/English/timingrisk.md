# Timing Risk
## What Is Timing Risk?

Timing risk is the hypothesis that an investor goes into while trying to buy or sell a [stock](/stock) in light of future price forecasts. Timing risk makes sense of the potential for missing out on beneficial developments in price due to a blunder in timing. This could really hurt the value of an investor's portfolio coming about because of purchasing too high or selling too low.

## Grasping Timing Risk

There is some discussion about the feasibility of timing. A say that it's difficult to time the market reliably; others say that [market timing](/markettiming) is the key to better than expected returns.

A common idea on this subject is that it is better to have "time in the market" than trying to "time the market." The growth of monetary markets after some time upholds this, as does the fact that numerous active managers fail to beat market midpoints in the wake of factoring in transaction costs.

For instance, an investor is presented to timing risk on the off chance that he expects a market [correction](/correction) and chooses to liquidate his whole portfolio in the hope of repurchasing the stocks back at a lower price. The investor risks the chance of the stocks expanding before he buys back in.

## Timing Risk and Performance

A study examining investor behavior found that, during the October 2014 downturn, one of every five investors decreased openness to stocks, exchange-traded funds (ETFs), and mutual funds, and generally 1% of investors diminished their portfolios by 90% or more.

> Further analysis found that investors who sold the majority of their portfolios had substantially failed to meet expectations the investors who took practically no action during the correction.
>

The investors who sold 90% of their holdings understood a trailing year return of - 19.3% in August 2015. Investors who took practically zero action returned - 3.7% over a similar period. This model shows that market timing might fail as a lucrative tool.

## Special Considerations
### Higher Trading Expenses

Investors who are ceaselessly trying to time the market are buying and selling all the more often, which builds their fees and [commission](/commission) charges. In the event that an investor makes a terrible market timing call, extra trading expenses compound poor returns.

### Extra Tax Expenses

Each time a stock is bought or sold, a taxable event happens. On the off chance that an investor is holding a beneficial position in a stock and sells it determined to buy in again at a lower price, he must regard the capital gain as standard income assuming that the two transactions happened inside a year period. In the event that the investor stands firm on the footing for north of 12 months, he gets taxed at a lower capital gains tax rate.
