## What Is a Futures Exchange?

A futures exchange is a marketplace where a different scope of commodities [futures](/futurescontract), [index futures](/indexfutures), and [options on futures](/options-on-futures) contracts are bought and sold. The individuals who are permitted access to the exchange are brokers and commercial traders who are members of the exchange. Members should be registered with the [National Futures Association (NFA)](/nfa) and the [Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC)](/cftc). People who need to trade futures contracts must do as such by laying out an account with a registered broker. Futures exchanges likewise give clearing and settlement functions.

## How a Futures Exchange Works

The function of a futures exchange is to normalize and advance futures trading for whatever number participants as would be prudent. The incentive components for the people who run the exchange are generally founded on the volume and dollar value of what is traded â€” the as much as possible. That means they work to get as numerous participants making however many trades as is conceivable. This has prompted numerous innovations in recent years, driving increased participation through electronic organizations.

Where a futures exchange used to have an important physical presence, for example, the trading floors in the [Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME)](/cme) or the [New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX)](/nymex), it is presently not a fact that these areas hold as much significance as they once did. Since trading can occur from the computer of anybody associated through the internet to an exchange-member broker, trading is decentralized around the world and happens almost 24 hours every day during the week.

[Futures](/futures) traded on a futures exchange permit the merchants of the underlying [commodities](/commodity) the certainty of the price they will receive for their products at the market. Simultaneously, the exchange will empower consumers or purchasers of those underlying commodities the certainty of the price they will pay, at a defined time from here on out.

To support as much participation and [liquidity](/liquidity) as could be expected, contracts trading on an exchange have normalized sizes, expiration dates, and, for options, [strike prices](/strikeprice). This normalization appears differently in relation to [over-the-counter (OTC)](/otc) contracts where purchasers and venders consent to bespoke terms.

Exchanges additionally give pricing data, dispersed by data vendor firms. Data sharing considers transparency in activities and fairness to all. Pricing data, including price, [bids](/bid), and [offers](/offer), is accessible to all interested institutions and people similarly, regardless of their size.

Another vital part of the exchange is that it gives clearing services. While different firms give the clearing, the exchange normalizes the charges and the performance of that service. Clearing services guarantee that participants don't need to worry about the risk of their trade counterparty [failing to deliver](/failuretodeliver) on their contractual obligations. That makes trading an extremely simple proposition for short-term examiners and keeps them interested in participating in the futures market.

## A Short History of Futures Exchanges in the U.S.

The biggest futures exchange in the U.S., the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, was framed in the late 1890s when the main futures contracts offered were for agricultural products. The rise of interest rate, or [bond futures](/bondfutures), and [currency futures](/currencyfuture) in major foreign exchange markets came during the 1970s. The present futures exchanges are fundamentally bigger, with hedging of financial instruments through futures. These futures hedging contracts involve the majority of the futures market activity. Futures exchanges play an important job in the operation of the global financial system.

Financial exchanges saw numerous mergers, with the most huge being between the Chicago Mercantile Exchange and the [Chicago Board of Trade (CBOT)](/cbot) in 2007. Rebranded as the CME Group, it then acquired NYMEX Holdings, Inc., the parent of the New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX) and [Commodity Exchange, Inc (COMEX)](/comex) in 2008. Filling again in 2012, it added the Kansas City Board of Trade, who is the prevailing player in hard red winter wheat.

Another major player in the U.S. is the [Intercontinental Exchange (ICE)](/intercontinentalexchange). Brought into the world as an electronic exchange in 2000, ICE acquired the [International Petroleum Exchange (IPE)](/international-petroleum-exchange) in 2001. In 2007, it acquired both the [New York Board of Trade (NYBOT)](/nybot) and the Winnipeg Commodity Exchange (WCE). At last, it expanded into equities with the acquisition of NYSE Euronext in 2013.
