# Markov Analysis
## What Is Markov Analysis?

Markov analysis is a method used to forecast the value of a variable whose anticipated value is impacted simply by its current state, and not by any prior activity. Fundamentally, it predicts a random variable dependent exclusively on the current conditions encompassing the variable.

Markov analysis is frequently utilized for anticipating ways of behaving and decisions inside large gatherings. It was named after Russian mathematician Andrei Andreyevich Markov, who spearheaded the study of stochastic processes, which are processes that include the operation of chance. Markov previously applied this method to foresee the developments of gas particles caught in a holder.

## Grasping Markov Analysis

The Markov analysis process includes characterizing the probability of a future action, given the current state of a variable. When the probabilities of future actions at each not entirely settled, a decision tree can be drawn, and the probability of an outcome can be calculated.

Markov analysis has several useful applications in the business world. It is frequently employed to foresee the number of defective pieces that will fall off an assembly line, given the operating status of the machines on the line. It can likewise be utilized to foresee the proportion of an organization's [accounts receivable](/accountsreceivable) (AR) that will turn out to be terrible obligations.

Companies may likewise utilize Markov analysis to forecast future brand loyalty of current customers and the outcome of these consumer decisions on an organization's [market share](/marketshare). Some stock price and option price forecasting methods consolidate Markov analysis, too.

## Benefits and Disadvantages of Markov Analysis

The primary benefits of Markov analysis are simplicity and out-of-test forecasting precision. Simple models, for example, those utilized for Markov analysis, are in many cases better at making expectations than additional muddled models. This outcome is notable in [econometrics](/econometrics).

Sadly, Markov analysis isn't exceptionally helpful for making sense of occasions, and it can't be the true model of the underlying situation as a rule. Indeed, it is relatively simple to estimate [conditional probabilities](/conditional_probability) in view of the current state. In any case, that frequently enlightens one little concerning why something occurred.

In engineering, very clear knowing the likelihood that a machine will break down doesn't make sense of why it separated. All the more significantly, a machine doesn't actually break down in light of a likelihood that is a function of whether it separated today. In reality, a machine could break down in light of the fact that its gears should be greased up more regularly.

In finance, Markov analysis faces similar limitations, yet fixing issues is confounded by our relative lack of information about [financial markets](/financial-market). Markov analysis is significantly more valuable for assessing the portion of obligations that will default than it is for screening out awful [credit risks](/creditrisk) in any case.

## An Example of Markov Analysis

Markov analysis can be utilized by stock speculators. Assume that a [momentum investor](/momentum_investing) estimates that a most loved stock has a 60% chance of beating the market tomorrow assuming it does so today. This estimate includes just the current state, so it meets the key limit of Markov analysis.

Markov analysis likewise permits the speculator to estimate that the likelihood the stock will outperform the market for both of the next two days is 0.6 * 0.6 = 0.36 or 36%, given the stock beat the market today. By utilizing [leverage](/leverage) and [pyramiding](/pyramiding), speculators endeavor to enhance the possible profits from this type of Markov analysis.

- Markov analysis isn't extremely helpful for making sense of occasions, and it can't be the true model of the underlying situation as a rule.
- The primary benefits of Markov analysis are simplicity and out-of-test forecasting exactness.
