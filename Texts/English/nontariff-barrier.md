# Nontariff Barrier
## What Is a Nontariff Barrier?

A nontariff barrier is a method for confining trade involving trade barriers in a form other than a [tariff](/tariff). Nontariff barriers incorporate [quotas](/quota), [embargoes](/embargo), sanctions, and [levies](/demand). As part of their political or economic strategy, a few countries regularly use nontariff barriers to confine the amount of trade they conduct with different countries.

## How Nontariff Barriers Work

Countries commonly use nontariff barriers in international trade. Choices about when to impose nontariff barriers are impacted by the political collusions of a country and the overall availability of goods and services.

As a rule, any barrier to international trade-including tariffs and non-tariff barriers-impacts the global economy since it limits the elements of the free market. The lost revenue that a few companies might experience from these barriers to trade might be considered a [economic loss](/economicprofit), particularly for defenders of laissez-faire capitalism. Promoters of laissez-faire capitalism accept that legislatures ought to keep away from meddling in the functions of the free market.

Countries can involve nontariff barriers in place of, or related to, conventional tariff barriers, which are taxes that an exporting country pays to an importing country for goods or services. Tariffs are the most common type of trade barrier, and they increase the cost of products and services in an importing country.

In many cases countries seek after alternatives to standard tariffs since they release countries from paying included tax imported goods. Alternatives to standard tariffs can definitively affect the level of trade (while making an unexpected monetary impact in comparison to standard tariffs).

## Types of Nontariff Barriers
### Licenses

Countries might utilize licenses to limit imported goods to specific businesses. Assuming a business is conceded a trade license, it is allowed to import goods that would somehow be limited for trade in the country.

### Quotas

Countries frequently issue [quotas](/quota) for importing and exporting the two goods and services. With quotas, countries settle on determined limits for products and services considered importation to a country. By and large, there are no limitations on importing these goods and services until a country arrives at its quota, which it can set for a specific time span. Moreover, quotas are much of the time utilized in international trade permitting arrangements.

### Embargoes

[Embargoes](/embargo) are the point at which a country-or several countries-formally ban the trade of indicated goods and services with another country. Legislatures might take this action to support their specific political or economic objectives.

### Sanctions

Countries impose [sanctions](/tradesanction) on different countries to limit their trade activity. Sanctions can incorporate increased administrative activities or extra customs and trade techniques that sluggish or limit a country's ability to trade.

### Voluntary Export Restraints

Exporting countries sometimes utilize voluntary export restrictions. Voluntary export limitations set limits on the number of goods and services a country can export to indicated countries. These restrictions are commonly founded on availability and political unions.

## Illustration of Nontariff Barriers

The nontariff barriers included sanctions that cut exports of gas, diesel, and other refined oil products to the nation. They additionally denied the export of industrial equipment, machinery, transport vehicles, and industrial metals to North Korea. The aim of these nontariff barriers was to put economic pressure on the nation to stop its nuclear arms and military activities.
