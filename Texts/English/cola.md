# Cost-of-Living Adjustment (COLA)
## What Is a Cost-of-Living Adjustment (COLA)?

A cost-of-living adjustment (COLA) is an increase made to [Social Security](/socialsecurity) and [Supplemental Security Income (SSI)](/ssi) to balance the effects of rising prices in the economy — called [inflation](/inflation).

COLAs are ordinarily equivalent to the percentage increase in the [Consumer Price Index for Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers (CPI-W)](/cpi-w) for a specific period. The Consumer Price Index (CPI) addresses the average prices of a basket of goods and is utilized to measure inflation.

The COLA for 2022 is 5.9%, importance for somebody who received $10,000 in Social Security benefits in 2021, their 2022 annual benefit would total $10,590.

## Figuring out Cost-of-Living Adjustment (COLA)

Since inflation was high during the 1970s, pay related contracts, real estate contracts, and government benefits utilized COLAs to safeguard against inflation. The U.S. [Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS)](/bls) decides the CPI-W, which the [Social Security Administration (SSA)](/ssa) utilizations to register COLAs. The COLA not set in stone by applying the percentage increase in the CPI-W from the second from last quarter of one year to the second from last quarter of the following year. This data is refreshed consistently on the SSA website.

Congress sanctioned a COLA provision to offer automatic yearly COLAs in light of the annual increase in the CPI-W that went into effect in 1975. Before 1975, Social Security benefits were increased when Congress approved special legislation. In 1975, COLAs depended on the increase in the CPI-W from the second quarter of 1974 to the principal quarter of 1975. From 1976 to 1983, COLAs depended on the increases in the CPI-W from the principal quarter of the previous year to the primary quarter of the current year. Beginning around 1983, COLAs have been dependent on the CPI-W from the second from last quarter of the previous year to the second from last quarter of the current year.

Inflation levels went from 3.3% to 11.3% during the 1970s. In 1975, the COLA increase was 8%, and the inflation rate was 9.1%. In 1980, the COLA arrived at the highest level in history at 14.3%, while the inflation rate was 13.5%. During the 1990s, definitely lower inflation rates incited small COLA increases averaging 2% to 3% each year. That went on into the mid 2000s, when even lower inflation rates brought about no COLA increases in 2010, 2011, and 2016. The COLA for 2022 is 5.9%, up from 1.3% in 2021.

## Special Considerations

COLA is dependent on two parts: the CPI-W and the employer-contracted COLA percentage. CPI decides the rate of inflation and is compared yearly. When consumer prices drop — or on the other hand in the event that inflation has not been sufficiently high to prove a COLA increase — beneficiaries don't receive a COLA. In the event that there is no CPI-W increase, there is no COLA increase.

When a COLA increase isn't approved, [Medicare Part B premiums](/medicare-part-b-premiums) continue as before for roughly 70% of beneficiaries who get the premiums deducted from their Social Security checks. However, the leftover beneficiaries — those with higher incomes, the people who didn't participate in that frame of mind through their employer, and new beneficiaries — should pay the Medicare Part B premium increases.

The standard month to month Medicare Part B premium set for 2021 is $148.50, however the premium ascents to $170.10 in 2022 — an increase of $21.60 from 2021.

## Different Types of COLAs

A few employers, like the U.S. military, sometimes give a brief COLA to employees who are required to perform work assignments in urban communities with a higher cost of living than their home city. This COLA terminates when the work assignment is done.
