## What Is a Trade-Through?

A trade-through is an order that is carried out at a poor price, even however a better price was accessible on a similar exchange or another exchange.

Regulations to safeguard against trade-throughs were first passed during the 1970s and were subsequently developed in Rule 611 of [Regulation NMS](/regulation-nms) that passed in 2007.

## Grasping Trade-Throughs

Trade-throughs are unlawful since regulations state that an order must be executed at the best accessible price. On the off chance that a better price is quoted somewhere else, the trade must show up for [execution](/execution), and not "traded through" so the execution happens at a more terrible price.

Rule 611 of Regulation NMS, otherwise called the [Order Protection Rule](/order-protection-rule), means to guarantee that both institutional and retail investors get the best conceivable price for a given trade by looking at statements on numerous exchanges. These regulations expand the old trade-through provisions that existed at the NYSE to all NASDAQ and AMEX-listed stocks, as well as numerous more modest exchanges.

The current Order Protection Rule likewise safeguards share blocks of under 100 shares, which in the past could be traded by businesses without penalty. In numerous ways, these regulations have assisted more modest retail investors with keeping away from unfair price execution and contend on level playing fields with larger institutional investors that purchase stock in large blocks.

## Exceptions to Trade-Through Regulations

Trade-throughs are defined as the purchase or sale of a stock that is listed on an exchange with consolidated market data dispersed, during standard trading hours, at a price that is lower than a protected bid or higher than a protected offer. While Regulation NMS applies comprehensively to a wide range of scenes that execute trades in modern equity markets, including registered exchanges, [alternative trading systems](/alternative-trading-framework) (ATSs), off-exchange market producers, and other merchant dealers, there are a couple of occasions where trade-through regulations may not matter.

Manual statements are not viewed as protected by Regulation NMS since consolidated market data isn't dispersed electronically. Just electronically-conveyed price statements fall under the new regulations and the best prices, or [top-of-book orders](/order-book), must be posted across all exchanges that are subject to Regulation NMS.

The other big exception is the supposed "one-second window" that is intended to deal with the useful hardships of preventing intramarket trade-throughs during a fast-moving market when statements are quickly evolving. In the event that a trade is executed at a price that would have not been a trade-through inside the previous one second, then, at that point, the trade is excluded from trade-through regulations.

## Illustration of a Trade-Through Occurring in a Stock

Accept an investor needs to sell their 200 Berkshire Hathaway Class B (BRK.B) shares. The stock has 500 shares being [bid](/bid) at $204.85, and one more 300 shares being bid at $204.80.

The highest bid is currently $204.85 with 500 shares, so in the event that our investor sells, the order ought to execute at that price expecting the price and shares don't change before the sell order arrives at the exchange.

The sell order for 200 shares ought to fill at $204.85, leaving 300 shares on the bid costing that much.

A trade-through would happen on the off chance that the order was executed at $204.80, or some other price lower than $204.85 even however there were shares accessible at a better price ($204.85) to fill the sell order.

Essentially, accept an investor needs to buy 100 shares of BRK.B. Currently 1,000 shares are being offered at $204.95. Since a very sizable amount of shares are being offered at $204.95 to fill the buy order, the investor needing to buy ought to get their shares at $204.95. A trade-through happens on the off chance that the buyer winds up paying a higher price, as $205, even however there are shares listed at the better price of $204.95.

## Features
- Trade-through rules don't matter to manual statements (just electronic ones) and the one-second rule likewise gives a bit of elbowroom in fast-moving markets.
- A trade-through happens when an order is executed at a more regrettable price than the best price accessible, basically trading through or bypassing the better market price.
- Trade-throughs shouldn't happen in regular market conditions since, by regulation, orders must be steered to the best price.
