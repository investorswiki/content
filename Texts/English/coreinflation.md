These increases eliminate data inconsistencies and give point by point long-term trends.

## The Importance of Core Inflation

It is significant to measure core inflation since it mirrors the relationship between the price of goods and services and the level of consumer income. Assuming prices for goods and services increase over the long run yet consumer income doesn't change, consumers will have less purchasing power. Inflation makes the value of money or income decline in comparison to the prices of fundamental goods and services.

Notwithstanding, assuming consumer income rises, called wage growth, while the prices of goods and services stay unchanged, consumers will have seriously purchasing power. Likewise, as investment portfolios and home prices rise, asset inflation happens, which can give extra money to consumers to spend.
