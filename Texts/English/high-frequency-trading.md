# High-Frequency Trading (HFT)
High-Frequency Trading (HFT) is a type of algorithmic trading that includes executing a large number of orders in parts of a second. HFT use high-frequency financial data and sophisticated electronic trading devices to break down markets and execute a large number of orders inside short time spans.
High-frequency traders move all through trades at a quick pace, expecting to capture small amounts of profit each time that, over the long haul, aggregate into a substantial sum of profit. Commonly, the [algorithms](/calculation) with quicker execution speeds enjoy an upper hand over calculations with more slow execution speeds.
HFT can further develop market conditions as it gives a consistent flow of liquidity and possibly eliminates high [bid-ask spreads](/bid-askspread). Due to this positive impact on the markets, a few exchanges boost HFT by offering rebates or decreased fees for HFT suppliers.
Then again, HFT can fundamentally increase the [volatility](/volatility) of the markets as calculations can settle on choices in the span of milliseconds with practically no human collaboration.
HFT is likewise a disputable trading method in light of the fact that the [liquidity](/liquidity) it gives can show up and vanish very quickly, keeping different traders from having the option to exploit it.
It is estimated that HFT calculations are responsible for a considerable amount of the trading volume in the global markets. Due to the complexity of these calculations, commonly just large financial institutions approach this trading method.

## Highlights
- It adds liquidity to the markets and kills small bid-ask spreads.
- HFT is condemned for permitting large companies to gain an upper hand in trading.
- HFT is complex algorithmic trading in which large numbers of orders are executed in practically no time.
- One more protest is that the liquidity created by this type of trading is fleeting â€” it vanishes in practically no time, making it unimaginable for traders to exploit it.
