## What Is the Nicaraguan Cordoba (NIO)?

The Nicaraguan c\u00f3rdoba (NIO) is the national currency of Nicaragua, the biggest country in Central America. It is at times alluded to as the **c\u00f3rdoba oro**. The c\u00f3rdoba is named after Spanish colonizer Francisco Hern\u00e1ndez de C\u00f3rdoba, founder of the urban communities of Le\u00f3n and Granada.

The NIO is made up of 100 subunits called **centavos**, and is addressed by the symbol C$ recorded as a hard copy. Its paper notes are vivid and have denominations of 10, 20, 50, 100, 200, 500 and 1,000 c\u00f3rdobas. Coins circle in values of 5, 10, 25, and 50 centavos, as well as in one, five and ten c\u00f3rdobas.

## Understanding the NIO

The history of currencies in Nicaragua is moderately unique in that the country formerly utilized several distinct currencies at the same time inside its nation. The most common among these were the currencies of Peru, Bolivia, Colombia and the United States. In 1859, the Le\u00f3n market in Nicaragua was permitted to issue a currency with a value one-10th that of the [U.S. dollar](/usd). In any case, this new currency just circled locally, meaning it didn't fill the job of an undeniable national currency.

In 1878, the main national coins entered circulation. Beginning in 1888, [private banks](/bank) were likewise permitted to print and issue private currencies. This prompted a complex currency system where private currencies existed together alongside the national currencies of numerous nations. This ended in 1912 with the creation of the Central Bank of Nicaragua. Before long, the c\u00f3rdoba was laid out as the official national currency.

The c\u00f3rdoba battled with tenacious [inflation](/inflation) soon after its presentation. The currency underwent [redenomination](/redenomination) in 1988, with the new c\u00f3rdoba issued at a rate of 1 for every 1,000 old c\u00f3rdobas. In 1990, the **c\u00f3rdoba oro** was presented as a unit of account. In 1991, the gold c\u00f3rdoba — which initially had been backed on a 1-to-1 basis with U.S. dollar saves — was devalued to 20 U.S. pennies per gold c\u00f3rdoba, equivalent to five million old c\u00f3rdobas. On April 30, 1991, the c\u00f3rdoba supplanted the gold c\u00f3rdoba and old c\u00f3rdoba as legal tender.

## Real World Example of the NIO

In 1992, the Central Bank of Nicaragua announced an exchange rate policy by which the NIO would be depreciated against the U.S. dollar by 5% each year. Between December 2011 and December 2020, the NIO's value debilitated from around 21.8 NIO per USD to 34.8 NIO per USD.

Nicaragua is quite possibly of the most unfortunate country in the Western Hemisphere. Its economy depends on agriculture and quite a bit of its income is derived from coffee bean and tobacco [exports](/trade). Notwithstanding, crop yields become more modest every year due to erosion, pollution, and heavy pesticide use. Mining is a developing industry, and the harvesting of timber proceeds, despite environmental worries.
