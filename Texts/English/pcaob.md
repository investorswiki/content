# Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB)
## What Is the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB)?

The Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB) is a non-benefit organization that regulates auditors of publicly traded companies. The purpose of PCAOB is to limit [audit risk](/audit-risk). Specifically, the PCAOB manages the audits of public companies, brokers, and dealers registered with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)

## Understanding the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board

The Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB) was laid out with the entry of the [Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002](/sarbanesoxleyact). The act was passed in response to different accounting outrages of the late 1990s. The board safeguards investors and different stakeholders of public companies by guaranteeing that the auditor of a company's financial statements has followed a set of severe rules.

The PCAOB is supervised by the [Securities and Exchange Commission](/sec) and, starting around 2010, the PCAOB has managed the audits of SEC-registered brokers and dealers.

## PCAOB Advisory Groups

The PCAOB has two advisory groups: the Standing Advisory Group and the Investor Advisory Group. The job of these two groups is to give counsel and knowledge to the Board.

The Standing Advisory Group meets semi-annually to examine data and technology, cybersecurity, corporate culture, communications on PCAOB standards, the governance and leadership of quality control systems, current or emerging issues influencing audits or auditors, and implementation of the new auditor's report.

The Investor Advisory Group meets once per year to examine the group's strategic plan, quality control standards, implementation of the new auditor's report, and implementation of Form AP. The PCAOB Board has developed a five-step strategic plan, which is spread out in its annual report. The five-step plan is made out of the following:

- Drive improvement in the quality of audit services through a combination of prevention, detection, discouragement, and remediation.

- Improve transparency and availability through proactive stakeholder engagement.
- Seek after operational greatness through efficient and effective utilization of our resources, information, and technology.
