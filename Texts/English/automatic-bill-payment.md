## Automatic payment model
A consumer has a vehicle loan and is concerned that he will neglect to make a payment. He inquires as to whether it offers an automatic payment option. The lender expects him to consent to an arrangement that permits the lender to take the payments automatically from his bank account.
Numerous lenders permit their customers to set up automatic payments straightforwardly through their websites. In this case, the customer would sign on, assign the account from which he needs the funds charged every month, and consent to a specific date.
Signing up for automatic payments through a company website has something like two benefits: First, the customer has day in and day out access to account data, including the amount he owes. Second, he can pursue changes to the agreement, if necessary. For instance, assuming the borrower concludes that he might want to make a bigger payment every month to pay the loan off right on time, he can sign on and request that a bigger amount be charged from his account.
