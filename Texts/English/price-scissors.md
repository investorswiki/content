# Price Scissors
## What is Price Scissors?

Price scissors is a term that alludes to a supported change in the terms of trade between various goods or classes of goods. Frequently this can include a country's drop in the price received for a fostering economy's agricultural [exports](/send out), while its manufactured goods [imports](/import) rise in price or remain moderately stable. This phenomenon can make chaos as people don't expect prices take such wild and inverse bearings from the standard, and the rural agricultural population sees simultaneous decline in wages and rising cost of living.

## Understanding Price Scissors

Price scissors draws its name from its graphical outline; it was authored by Leon Trotsky, while portraying the veering trend lines of agricultural and industrial price indexes. With time on a horizontal pivot and price level on a vertical hub, the plotting of industrial and agricultural prices on the graph will seem to be a pair of scissors, meeting at a point and afterward strongly moving in inverse headings.

The considerable economic effects of this are best represented with a model: If a country is a [net exporter](/netexporter) of dairy products and a [net importer](/netimporter) of dress, a large price drop in the worldwide value of milk combined with a sharp increase in the price of materials would make a price scissors. In this case, the domestic economy battles to cope with the burden of paying significantly more for apparel and different materials, while being not able to sell dairy products at the prices with which they are acclimated. Salaries for dairy farmers and those in related industries will fall, while their cost of living will rise on account of higher attire prices.

## Historical Examples of Price Scissors

The Scissors Crisis in the Soviet Union is the primary historic illustration of the price scissors phenomenon. From 1922 to 1923, during the New Economic Policy (NEP), the prices of industrial and agricultural goods shot in inverse headings, arriving at top divergence at agricultural prices falling 10% lower and industrial prices rising 250% higher than prices a decade sooner. Russian worker farmers' salaries fell, making it even harder for them to buy manufactured goods. Numerous farmers stopped selling their produce and moved to resource cultivating, which started recharged fears of starvation after the 1921-22 starvation had proactively killed millions.

The Scissors Crisis had a couple of causes, established in Soviet botch of the economy and the destruction following the Bolshevik revolution. For one's purposes, the government, in an off track endeavor to address the threat of starvation, fixed grain prices at falsely low levels. This clearly prompted low agricultural prices. Moreover, there was a [surplus](/surplus) of agricultural products to industrial products; agricultural production had bounced back rapidly from the starvation and civil war that followed the revolution of 1917. Conversely, industrial capacity and fundamental infrastructure had been harmed or annihilated by the war, altogether slowing industrial production. The Scissors Crisis ignited far reaching worker strikes inside major Russian urban areas as rival socialist groups disturbed against Lenin's mixed economy policies and pinned the crisis on the NEP. The government eventually cut industrial production costs through [rationalization](/rationalization), wage-cutting, cutbacks, and promotion of consumer cooperatives. This lowered industrial output prices and the divergence among agricultural and industrial prices died down.

## Highlights
- This divergence can make the producers of agricultural commodities endure as their salaries fall and cost of living rises.
- The original utilization of the term price scissors was in reference to a policy-prompted economic crisis in the Soviet Union in 1923.
- Price scissors is a supported divergence in the prices of various goods or classes of goods, which is usually used to portray high industrial output and low agricultural prices.
