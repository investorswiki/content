# Undersubscribed
## What Is Undersubscribed?

"Undersubscribed" alludes to a situation where the demand for an issue of securities, for example, a [initial public offering](/ipo) (IPO) or one more offering of securities is not exactly the number of shares issued. Undersubscribed offerings are in many cases a question of overpricing the securities available to be purchased or on account of poor marketing of the securities to possible investors.

This situation is otherwise called an "underbooking," and might be diverged from [oversubscribed](/oversubscribed) when demand for an issue surpasses its supply.

## Grasping Undersubscribed

An offering is undersubscribed when the underwriter can't get sufficient interest in that frame of mind available to be purchased. Since there may not be a firm offering price at that point, purchasers generally buy in for a certain number of shares. This cycle allows the underwriter to check demand for the offering (called "signs of interest") and decide if a given price is fair.

Ordinarily, the goal of a public offering is to sell at the specific price at which every one of the issued shares can be sold to investors, and there is neither a shortage nor a surplus of securities. In the event that the demand is too low, the underwriter and issuer could lower the price to draw in additional supporters. In the event that there is more demand for a public offering than there is supply ([shortage](/shortage)), it means a higher price might have been charged, and the issuer might have raised more capital. Then again, in the event that the price is too high, insufficient investors will buy into the issue, and the underwriting company will be left with shares it either can't sell or must sell at a marked down price, causing a loss.

## Factors that Can Cause an Undersubscription

When the underwriter is certain it will sell each of the shares in the offering, it shuts the offering. Then it purchases every one of the shares from the company (in the event that the offering is a guaranteed [offering](/offering)), and the issuer gets the proceeds minus the underwriting charges. The underwriters then sell the shares to the endorsers at the offering price. In some cases, when underwriters can't track down an adequate number of investors to purchase IPO shares, they are forced to purchase the shares that couldn't be sold to the public (otherwise called "eating stock").

Albeit the underwriter can impact the initial price of the securities, they don't have the last say on all the selling activity on the principal day of an IPO. When the endorsers start selling on the secondary market, the unregulated economy powers of supply and demand direct the price, and that can likewise influence the initial selling price on the IPO. Underwriters typically keep a secondary market in the securities they issue, and that means they consent to purchase or sell [securities](/security) out of their own inventories to safeguard the price of the securities from extreme volatility.

## Highlights

- Undersubscribed (underbooked) alludes to an issue of securities where demand doesn't meet the available supply.
- An undersubscribed IPO is commonly a negative signal as it proposes that individuals are not anxious to invest in the company's issue or that it has not been marketed well.
- Institutional or accredited investors are most frequently those eligible to buy into another issue.
