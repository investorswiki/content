## What Is SEC Form PRE 14A?

SEC Form PRE 14A, otherwise called a preliminary [proxy statement](/proxystatement), is a form that must be filed with the [Securities and Exchange Commission](/sec) (SEC) by or in the interest of a registrant when a shareholder vote is required on an issue not connected with a challenged matter or consolidation/procurement.

## How SEC Form PRE 14A Works

Companies file SEC Form PRE 14A in circumstances that require a [shareholder](/shareholder) vote.

SEC Form PRE 14A incorporates information about: the date, time, and place of the meeting of stockholders; the revocability of proxy; a [dissenter's right](/nonconformists rights) of examination; the people making the sales; the direct or indirect interest of certain people in issues to be acted upon; the modification or exchange of securities; [financial statements](/financial-statements); voting strategies; and different subtleties.
