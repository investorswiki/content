# Member Month
## What Is Member Month?

Member month alludes to the number of individuals participating in an insurance plan every month. Member month is calculated by taking the number of individuals enrolled in a plan and duplicating that sum by the number of months in the policy. Member months help insurance companies work out the average month to month [premiums](/insurance-premium) should have been charged to their customers.

## Grasping Member Month

Member month statistics are most generally found in the reports of group insurance companies, for example, group wellbeing plans. Deciding the number of individuals that are enrolled in an insurance plan requires partitioning the total number of member months by the number of months in the year.

Consequently, in the event that an insurer demonstrates that its member months total 1500, the total number of individuals covered is around 125 (1,500 member months/12 twelve months). The calculation is a guess since certain members might have policies that last one year, while others might have policies that last a more limited duration. For instance, 1,500 member months could mean 125 members on annual policies, or it could mean 100 members on year policies and 50 members on half year policies ([100 x 12 months] + [50 x 6 months] = 1,500 member months).

One individual who has a policy that lasts one year makes twelve-member months (1 person x 12 months in the policy). Assuming that policy has a duration of six months, a solitary member will create six-member months (1 person x 6 months in the policy). For policies with numerous members, for example, a family on a medical coverage policy, the number of member months is bigger in light of the fact that every family member counts. For instance, a family of four enrolled in a year medical coverage policy creates 48 member months (4 individuals x 12 months in the policy).

## Member Months and PMPM

Member months can likewise be utilized to ascertain the average month to month premiums. This is finished by separating the revenue produced by a group policy by the total member months, which gives a guess for the average cost of a policy.

The member month statistic can likewise be utilized to decide PMPM, which means "cost **p**er **m**ember **p**er **m**onth." The PMPM calculation is frequently utilized by health care coverage companies to decide the average cost of medical services for every one of their members. PMPM is additionally utilized outside the healthcare industry by companies that offer healthcare benefits to their employees. PMPM assists companies with assessing how much every individual member ought to be charged for coverage.

## Instructions to Calculate PMPM

To compute PMPM, pick the year for which to ascertain PMPM, decide the number of individuals covered under the plan for that year, and decide the member months by duplicating the number of individuals covered (for each of the 12 months of the year) by 12. Then, decide the total cost of healthcare benefits for every one of the members under the plan during the current year. Partition the total cost of healthcare benefits for all members by the number of member months to show up at the PMPM for the year.

## Illustration of Member Months and PMPM

A business has 50 employees with an insurance plan through a neighborhood insurance company. The representative's all's policies are year policies. Accordingly, the business has 600 member months with the insurance company (50 employees x 12 months).

The insurance company needs to compute its cost per member each month (PMPM). The insurer discovers that the total cost for giving the coverage to the company's all's employees equals $500,000 annually. The PMPM would approach $833 ($500,000 * 600 member months).

The insurance company would have to work with the business to figure out which percentage would be paid by the business in the interest of the employees-and what portion would be the representative's responsibility.
