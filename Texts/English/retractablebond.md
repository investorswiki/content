# Retractable Bond
## What is Retractable Bond?

Retractable bond, otherwise called [variable-rate demand note](/variable_rate_demand_note), is a debt security that features a [put option](/putoption) which permits the holder to force the [issuer](/issuer) to recover the bond before [maturity](/maturity) at its [face value](/facevalue).

## Figuring out Retractable Bond

The inclusion of the put option, permits the [bondholder](/bondholder) the right to cash in on the retractable bond's [principal](/principal) when the lock-out period closes. Fundamentally, a retractable bond can safeguard an investor from [interest rate risk](/interestraterisk). An investor might decide to abbreviate the maturity on a [bond](/bond) due to adverse market conditions or on the other hand on the off chance that they require the principal sooner than anticipated. Retractable bond is now and then alluded to as a put bond, putable bond, or puttable bond.

A retractable bond's put feature draws a base line on the bond price, regardless of the increase in interest rates before its maturity date. Initially, the rule of thumb was that retractable bonds were issued at 0.2% less in yield than a normal bond of a similar issuer. With the growth of [options](/option) and [swap](/swap) markets, these bonds are priced utilizing options pricing strategies.

To decide a retractable bond's price the value of the underlying debt must initially be resolved utilizing the [discounted cash flow](/dcf) (DCF) approach. The put feature is then estimated as the benefit of holding or practicing the embedded option utilizing [options pricing modeling](/optionpricingtheory). This pricing method is the basis of the value of the debt at different option valuation dates up to the bond's maturity point. In this way, a retractable bond is equivalent to its cash flows plus the value of the put feature.

Something contrary to retractable bonds is [extendable bonds](/extendablebond). They function similarly as retractable bonds just they stretch out the initial maturity to a more drawn out maturity date. Investors utilize both retractable and extendable bonds to alter the terms of their portfolios to exploit changes in interest rates.

## Retractable Bond Benefit

Assume a company issues 20-year retractable bonds to the market. This retractable position implies the investor who purchases the bond from the issuer has the privilege to receive the [par value](/parvalue), or face value, of the bond whenever before its maturity date. Assuming the investor exercises the right to retract, they will relinquish the excess [coupon](/coupon) payments on the bond.

An investor could exercise the retraction option due to unfavorable economic conditions, for example, a rise in interest rates. An increase in interest rates would convert into lower bond prices. Thus, the bondholder could reinvest the funds received from practicing the retractable bond into a higher-yielding bond.
