# Antidilutive
## What Is Antidilutive?

Antidilutive is a term that depicts the effects of certain actions, like securities retirement, securities conversion, or other [corporate actions](/corporateaction) (e.g., [acquisitions](/procurement) made through the issuance of [common stock](/commonstock) or different securities) on the [earnings per share (EPS)](/eps) or voting power of existing shareholders. Antidilutive activities keep up with or increase the voting power or EPS for existing shareholders by bringing down the company's outstanding share count or expanding the company's earnings.

A second utilization of the term antidilutive alludes to ownership rights, by which existing shareholders in a certain [class of shares](/class) reserve the privilege to purchase extra shares when there is another issuance of securities that would somehow reduce their ownership percentage. This is called a [anti-dilution provision](/anti-dilutionprovision). The ability of existing shareholders to purchase extra shares assists them with keeping up with their extent of outstanding share ownership, in this manner keeping up with their share of the voting power or receipt of the company's EPS.

Either definition can be diverged from [dilutive](/dilution) corporate actions.

## Understanding Antidilutive

Albeit most commonly utilized in reference to [convertible securities](/convertible-security) whose exercise would build EPS, the utilization of the term "antidilutive" has become significantly more exhaustive. It alludes to any action that helps an existing shareholder keep up with or increase their voting power or receipt of the company's EPS. In the event that securities are retired, changed over, or affected by certain corporate activities, and the transaction results in an increased EPS, then, at that point, the action is viewed as antidilutive.

In any case, these antidilutive actions are excluded from the calculation of completely [diluted earnings per share](/dilutedeps) (EPS), which is the benefit per-share of outstanding common stock. The two accountants and financial analysts register diluted earnings per share as a most dire outcome imaginable while assessing a company's stock. With diluted earnings per share, it is assumed that all convertible securities (e.g., convertible preferred shares and convertible debentures) were exercised.

## Dilutive versus Antidilutive

Antidilutive alludes to activities that keep up with or increase EPS and shareholder voting power. On the other hand, dilutive portrays the effect of certain actions or activities that reduce EPS. Because of dilutive activities, existing shareholders' ownership interests are reduced. Dilution is many times achieved through the issuance of dilutive securities, for example, [stock options](/stockoption) and convertible debt instruments, which eventually increase the number of outstanding shares of common stock and reduce EPS for existing shareholders.

In any case, certain contracts contain [protective provisions](/dilution-security) that restrict the reduction of a shareholder's interest assuming subsequent funding adjusts happen.

## Antidilutive Example

For instance, assume Company A has five existing shareholders, who each own 10% of the company. In the event that Company An issued more shares to gain new shareholders, the existing shareholders would see their 10% ownership stake shrink as additional owners bought in. This is known as [dilution](/dilution). On the off chance that Company A had an antidilutive policy in place, they would have to offer the existing five shareholders the ability to buy more shares to keep up with their 10% ownership in the company.
