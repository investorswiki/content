# Market Is Up
## What Does "Market Is Up" Mean?

The phrase "market is up" means the stock, bond, or commodity market, or an index addressing them, currently trades higher than it did at some specific point in the past. More often than not, financial media and individual investors allude to the stock market, saying it is up or down, they are contrasting it with the previous trading session.

Frequently a follow-up use of the term will harmonize with a reference to the performance during the previous week, month, quarter, or year to date. Something contrary to market is up would be "market is down" or "market is off".

## Figuring out the Phrase "Market Is Up"

At the point when a given trading market (most often the U.S. Stock market) is being reported by financial media, this phrase will be utilized when, in comparison to the previous day's closing level, the reference price is higher. This could likewise allude to the previous week's closing level or even last year's closing level (year to date).

The contrary phrase is the market is down or, commonly, the market is off by a given amount. For instance, it isn't unusual to hear a financial correspondent say, "[Dow Jones Industrial Average](/djia) (DJIA) was off almost one percent by the present close," meaning the closing price of the current day was almost one percent lower than the close of the other day.

Many factors can be utilized to make sense of why the market is up for a given trading session, however eventually, the core driver of prices is the frequency and net volume of purchases or sales. In the event that a bigger number of individuals bought than sold, or on the other hand in the event that purchasers bought at additional quick spans than venders all through the trading session, then, at that point, the market is probably going to close higher. This dynamic generally happens in light of the fact that new data happens in the market that adjusts the valuations for assets that professional money managers are modeling.

## Model

For instance, during earnings season, surprisingly good reports from a number of companies could increase the projected values of these companies. Analysts use pricing models which are updated quickly or not long after surprise news has been delivered. At the point when such news disperses, it likely, thusly, drives up the market.

Also, job reports can impact it, as could the federal funds at any point rate set by the [Federal Open Market Committee](/fomc) (FOMC). Since that rate is what the government charges banks to borrow from the [Federal Reserve](/federalreservebank), any changes will impact interest rates all through the economy. As a general rule, the stock market rises when interest rates move lower in light of the fact that looser money means more consumer spending and business investment.

Without a doubt, it very well may be a change in investor perspectives following an election, another product send off, or international quieting.

At the point when journalists say the market is up, they frequently mean that the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA), an index of 30 key stocks traded on the New York Stock Exchange and the NASDAQ, is up. Assuming the Dow closed at 22,800 on Monday and at 23,000 on Tuesday, the market would be up at Tuesday's close.

## At the point when the Market Is Up, Most Investors Make Money

An up market doesn't be guaranteed to emphatically affect all investors. For instance, traders who own stocks can benefit when the stock market is up. Notwithstanding, bond traders might lose money since bonds frequently fall in value when stocks rise.

At the point when the market is up extensively and for a long period of time, investors must face a decision about how to continue. For instance, in December 2017, the stock market was well into one of the longest bull markets on record. Should investors accept a few profits and reduce risk? Of course, that is an individual decision in view of one's personal situation and risk profile.

In January 2018, the market at last started a long-anticipated [correction](/correction), falling by around 12% in just half a month's time. Investors previously holding stocks for a really long time or longer actually accepted the market was up for them. In any case, investors buying just ahead of the decline disagreed. The market being up relies upon what your identity is and when you began.
