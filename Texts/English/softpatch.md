## What Is a Soft Patch?

The term "soft patch" alludes to a period where the economy has dialed back in the midst of a bigger trend of economic growth. The term is many times utilized casually in the financial media and in statements issued by the [U.S. Federal Reserve](/federalreservebank) while portraying periods of economic weakness.

## Figuring out a Soft Patch

The term "soft patch" is frequently used to depict a decline in the [real gross domestic product](/realgdp) (real GDP) that goes on for a few [quarters](/quarter) at a time. A two-quarter soft patch happens when the [gross domestic product](/gdp) (GDP) growth in the two latest quarters is not exactly the growth during the previous quarter. Essentially, a three-quarter soft patch happens when the three latest quarters reflect lower growth than the quarter immediately prior.

The traditional definition of a [recession](/recession) is likewise portrayed by a decline in GDP for two successive quarters. A soft patch is defined with somewhat less unbending nature than a recession and happens among box and tops as it is just utilized during periods of overall expansion. In the event that an economy proceeded with its decline in GDP, that wouldn't show a soft patch yet rather a market reversal towards a recession and conceivably a depression.

[Alan Greenspan](/alangreenspan) advocated the term during his tenure as chair of the Federal Reserve somewhere in the range of 1987 and 2006. Be that as it may, you can track down notices of the term in Federal Reserve distributions from as far back as the 1940s.

In spite of its common use, there is no exact and generally accepted definition of what a soft patch really means. For example, the term is likewise used to portray conditions in which GDP has eased back in response to a short-term rise in commodity prices.

## Soft Patches in the Economy

The [National Bureau of Economic Research](/nber) (NBER) has distributed data demonstrating that somewhere in the range of 1950 and 2012, the U.S. economy experienced 69 occurrences in which a soft patch endured multiple quarters; and 52 cases in which it endured multiple quarters. This data recommends that the phenomenon is to be sure very common.

Simultaneously, it is hard to tell how huge an event each soft patch is. Albeit a particular soft patch is probably not going to dependably foresee a defining moment in the overall [business cycle](/businesscycle), longitudinal data shows that each of the 11 business cycle expansions that happened during this time span (1950 through 2012) were gone before by a soft patch.

Through this analysis, one can affirm that soft patches are a part of the business cycle and are not really harbingers of a delayed economic decline.

All market participants are justifiably worried about where we stand corresponding to the overall business cycle since changes in that cycle will definitely trigger reallocations of capital all through various types of assets, in this manner impacting investors' portfolios.

For example, MarketWatch distributed an article in April 2019 addressing whether first-quarter GDP growth pointed to a soft patch in the economy, which they suggested might be owing to the 35-day government shutdown that impacted very nearly 1,000,000 federal employees prior in the year. However first-quarter results have traditionally been impacted by factors that stunt growth, even after seasonal changes from the holiday period are thought about.
