## What Is Stock Parking?

Stock parking is the unlawful practice of selling shares to one more party with the understanding that the original owner will buy them back a little while later. The goal of stock parking is to hide a stock's real ownership while maintaining the presence of regulatory compliance.

## Stock Parking Explained

Stock parking is an unlawful measure by which a [broker](/broker) organizes to sell shares to one more party to reduce their position for [disclosure](/disclosure) deadlines, with the understanding that the original broker will purchase the shares back later at a profit to their receiving broker. Brokerages try to park stocks to keep their holdings clean under Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) guidelines during disclosure periods, or to seem like they have satisfied each of their obligations by the [settlement date](/settlementdate) for a specific trade.

Here and there individual stockbrokers park stocks without their manager's information. In these instances, the broker might have moved the shares to conform to the internal regulations of their brokerage, as opposed to stay away from a SEC violation. In some cases two individual stockbrokers can plot to create their personal gains unbeknownst to both of their companies with this arrangement. Frequently, the broker is trying to briefly abstain from disclosing long-term holdings that they need to continue holding; this can be on the grounds that their total holdings will not endure federal scrutiny assuming they retain throughout the entire their term holdings, or in light of the fact that their brokerage firms hold punishments for aged stocks.

## Parking versus Kiting

"Parking" is likewise used to depict a form of share [kiting](/kited). In these cases, brokerage firms endeavor to cover undeclared short positions (shares which the broker owes) whose stock was not delivered by the settlement date. As opposed to performing a buy-in transaction, these organizations conspire with each other and, by delaying the settlement cycle, inflate the number of shares accessible for trade in the secondary market.

Stock parking addresses collusion and artificial manipulation of the market. As is much of the time the case with SEC regulations, the seriousness of the discipline for colluding to park shares generally relies upon the seriousness of the infraction; the number of shares traded, the amount of taxable income unregistered and the scale of the scheme. Small violations can incur minimal in excess of a small fine and a ban from trading securities. Bigger cases are prosecuted all the more harshly; in a striking case in 1989, corporate raider Paul Bilzerian was sentenced on nine counts of tax fraud connected with a stock parking scheme and was condemned to four years in jail and a fine of $1.5 million.
