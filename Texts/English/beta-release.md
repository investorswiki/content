# Beta (Release)
In computer science, the term beta alludes to the second stage of a software development cycle, and it comes right after the [alpha](/alpha) stage. Beta comprises of a phase where the software as of now has every one of the major elements and capabilities working, however its productivity, convenience, security actually needs further testing. Normally, the beta stage makes the software open to analyzers that are not part of the development team or company.
To perform such tests, the software is made accessible to engineers and possible customers. This cycle is otherwise called a beta release, and the people that add to it are called beta analyzers. A program might be released for testing to a limited number of welcomed analyzers (closed beta), or it tends to be unveiled to anyone with any interest at all (open beta).
As the name proposes, closed (or private) beta testing includes a more modest group of analyzers. This approach might be suitable for testing software that tries to gather feedback from specific target demographics, or that can't be tried on a more extensive scale due to scaling limitations. Then again, open beta testing as a rule includes a broad client base, which is frequently made of likely consumers. In this specific circumstance, open beta may likewise be viewed as a marketing strategy with the goal to show the product.
Beta analyzers are typically driven by an oddity about another product, particularly the workers. Commonly, the beta testing phase centers around convenience with the goal that analyzers report bugs and give feedback. They may likewise recommend the expansion of new elements and functionalities, albeit this is more normal during the [alpha](/alpha) stage.
Thus, the beta stage permits engineers to make improvements and fix bugs before the product is sufficient for the next stage (release). At the point when a beta software is close to its last rendition, it is frequently called a "release candidate." If no more issues or bugs emerge, the program can be at long last sent off as a "steady release."
