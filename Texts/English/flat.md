## Understanding Flat

In [forex](/unfamiliar exchange), flat alludes to the condition of being neither long nor short in a particular currency, and is likewise alluded to as "being square."

## Understanding Flat Stocks

At the point when the stock market has made practically zero movement throughout some undefined time frame, being a flat market is said. This doesn't mean that all publicly traded securities in the market are making no huge movements. All things being equal, the rising price movement of some sector or industry stocks might be offset by an equivalent declining movement in the prices of securities from different sectors. Investors and traders searching for profits in a flat market are better off trading individual stocks with up momentum, as opposed to trading the [market indices](/marketindex).

Individual stocks can likewise be flat. For instance, in the event that a stock throughout the past month has been trading around $30, it very well may be considered trading flat.

A [bond](/bond) is trading flat in the event that the buyer of the bond isn't responsible for paying the interest that has accrued since the last payment (accrued interest is normally part of the bond purchase price). In effect, a flat bond is a bond that is trading without the accrued interest. The price of a flat bond is alluded to as the flat price or [clean price](/cleanprice). Regularly, flat prices are quoted so as not to distort the daily increase in the [dirty price](/dirtyprice) (bond price plus accrued interest) since accrued interest doesn't change the [yield to maturity](/yieldtomaturity) (YTM) of the bond.

A bond likewise trades flat on the off chance that interest payment on the bond is due yet the issuer is in default. Bonds that are in default are to be traded flat without calculation of accrued interest and with delivery of the coupons which have not been paid by the issuers. Likewise, in the event that a bond chooses a similar date as the interest is paid and, consequently, no extra interest has accrued past the amount previously paid out, the bond is said to trade flat.
