# Batting Average
## What Is Batting Average?

An investment manager's "batting average" is a statistical technique used to measure a manager's ability to meet or beat a [index](/index). A batting average is calculated by separating the number of days (or months, quarters, and so forth) in which the manager beats or matches the index by the total number of days (or months, quarters, and so on) in the period of inquiry and duplicating that factor by 100.

The higher the batting average, the better. The highest number conceivable average would be 100%, meaning the manager outperformed the benchmark each and every period. Interestingly, a batting average of 0% means the manager not even once outperformed their [benchmark](/benchmark).

## Understanding the Batting Average

A [investment manager](/investment-manager) who outperforms the market in 15 out of a potential 30 days would have a statistical batting average of half. The more drawn out the period taken in the sample size, the more [statistically significant](/statistically_significant) the measure becomes. Numerous [analysts](/expert) utilize this simple calculation in their more extensive evaluations of individual investment managers.

The term begins from baseball, where the batting average addresses the percentage of a player's hits to at bats.

A manager could outperform the benchmark by, express, 0.1% for a long time, yet in the 11th month fall short of the benchmark by 3.50%. In such a case the batting average would be 90.90%, yet the manager would have emphatically [underperformed](/fail to meet expectations) their benchmark.
