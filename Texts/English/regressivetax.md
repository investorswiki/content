# Regressive Tax
## What Is a Regressive Tax?

A regressive tax is a tax applied uniformly, taking a bigger percentage of income from low-income earners than from high-income earners. It is contrary to a [progressive tax](/progressivetax), which takes a bigger percentage from high-income earners.

## Figuring out Regressive Taxes

A regressive tax influences individuals with low incomes more seriously than individuals with high incomes since it is applied uniformly to all circumstances, no matter what the [taxpayer](/taxpayer). While it very well might be fair in certain examples to tax everybody at a similar rate, it is viewed as vile in different cases. Thusly, most income tax systems utilize a progressive schedule that taxes high-income earners at a higher percentage rate than low-income earners, while different types of taxes are uniformly applied.

Albeit the United States has a progressive taxation system with regards to [income tax](/incometax), meaning higher income earners pay a higher percentage of taxes every year compared to those with a lower income, we truly do pay certain duties that are viewed as regressive taxes. A portion of these incorporate state sales taxes, client fees, and somewhat, property taxes.

> A regressive tax system is more normal in less developed countries, where there might be a greater number of individuals in a similar income bracket, in this way diminishing the negative impact of the regressive tax.

## Sales Taxes

Governments apply sales tax uniformly to all consumers in view of what they buy. Even however the tax might be uniform, (for example, a 7 percent [sales tax](/salestax)), lower-income consumers are more impacted.

For instance, envision two individuals each purchase $100 of dress each week, and they each pay $7 in tax on their retail purchases. The first individual procures $2,000 each week, making the sales tax rate on her purchase 0.35 percent of income. Conversely, the other individual acquires $320 each week, making her attire sales tax 2.2 percent of income. In this case, albeit the tax is similar rate in the two cases, the person with the lower income pays a higher percentage of income, making the tax regressive.

## Client Fees

[Client fees](/client fee) exacted by the government are one more form of regressive tax. These fees incorporate admission to government-subsidized historical centers and state parks, costs for driver's licenses and identification cards, and toll fees for streets and scaffolds.

For instance, on the off chance that two families travel to the Grand Canyon National Park and pay a $30 admission fee, the family with the higher income pays a lower percentage of its income to access the park, while the family with the lower-income pays a higher percentage. Albeit the fee is a similar amount, it comprises a more critical burden on the family with the lower income, again making it a regressive tax.

## Property Taxes

[Property taxes](/propertytax) are fundamentally regressive on the grounds that, assuming two individuals in a similar tax jurisdiction live in properties with similar values, they pay a similar amount of property tax, no matter what their incomes. In any case, they are not absolutely regressive in practice since they depend on the value of the property. Generally, thought lower-income earners live in more affordable homes, consequently to some extent indexing property taxes to income.

## Flat Taxes

Frequently threw around in banters about income tax, the phrase "flat tax" alludes to a taxation system wherein the government taxes all income at a similar percentage paying little heed to earnings. Under a flat tax, there are no special deductions or credits. Rather, every person pays a set percentage on all income, making it a regressive tax. Accordingly, lower-income individuals pay really similar rate as higher-income earners rather than lower ones.

## "Sin" Taxes

Taxes collected on products that are considered to be hurtful to society are called [sin taxes](/sin_tax). These are added to the prices of goods like liquor and tobacco to prevent individuals from using them. Yet again the [Internal Revenue Service (IRS)](/irs) believes these taxes to be regressive, in light of the fact that, they are more burdensome to low-income earners as opposed to their high-income partners.
