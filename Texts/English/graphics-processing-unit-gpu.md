# Graphics Processing Unit (GPU)
## What Is a Graphics Processing Unit (GPU)?

A Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) is a chip or electronic circuit capable of delivering graphics for display on an electronic gadget. The GPU was acquainted with the more extensive market in 1999 and is best known for its utilization in giving the smooth graphics that consumers anticipate in modern videos and games.

## How a Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) Works

The graphics in videos and gs comprise of polygonal directions that are changed over into bitmaps — a cycle called "delivering" — and afterward into signals that are displayed on a screen. This conversion requires the Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) to have a ton of processing power, which likewise makes GPUs helpful in [machine learning](/machine-learning), artificial intelligence, and different tasks that require a large number of complex and sophisticated calculations.

## History of the Graphics Processing Unit (GPU)

In 1999, Nvidia presented the Geforce 256, the first widely accessible GPU. Nvidia defined a GPU as a "solitary chip processor with integrated transform, lighting, triangle arrangement/cutting, and delivering motors that is capable of processing at least 10 million polygons each second." The GeForce 256 better on the technology by different processors by streamlining 3D gaming performance.

While Nvidia actually rules in the GPU market, the technology has enormously gotten to the next level. During the 2000s Nvidia delivered its GeForce 8800 GTX which has a surface fill rate of an incredible 36.8 billion every second.

Today, GPUs have seen a resurgence in fame. Their utilization has been extended into new industries because of the coming of artificial intelligence and cryptocurrencies. GPUs play likewise had an impact in laying out more extensive access to better virtual reality gaming.

## GPUs versus CPUs

Before the appearance of GPUs in the late 1990s, realistic delivering was dealt with by the Central Processing Unit (CPU). At the point when utilized related to a CPU, a GPU can increase computer performance by taking on a few computationally intensive functions, like delivering, from the CPU. This accelerates how rapidly applications can process since the GPU can perform numerous computations all the while. This shift additionally took into account the development of further developed and asset intensive software.

Processing data in a GPU or a CPU is dealt with by centers. The more centers a processing unit has, the quicker (and possibly more productively) a computer can complete tasks. GPUs use huge number of centers to handle tasks in parallel. The parallel structure of the GPU is not the same as that of the CPU, which utilizes less centers to consecutively handle tasks. A CPU can perform computations quicker than a GPU, which improves it at essential tasks.

## Special Considerations

The term "GPU" is frequently utilized reciprocally with "graphics card," however the two are unique. A graphics card is a piece of hardware that contains at least one GPUs, a daughterboard, and other electronic parts that permit the graphics card to function.

A GPU can, be that as it may, be integrated into the motherboard or be found in the daughterboard of a graphics card. Initially, top of the line computers were the only ones to feature graphics cards. Today, most work stations commonly utilize a separate graphics card with a GPU for increased performance, as opposed to depend on a GPU incorporated into a motherboard.

## GPUs and Cryptocurrency Mining

While GPUs were initially famous with video altering and computer gaming lovers, the fast growth of [cryptocurrencies](/cryptocurrency) made another market. This is on the grounds that cryptocurrency mining requires great many computations to add transactions to a [blockchain](/blockchain), which is something that could be productive with access to a GPU and a modest supply of power.

In recent years, two unmistakable graphics card manufacturers, Nvidia Corp. (NVDA) and Advanced Micro Devices Inc. (AMD) have encountered a fast increase in sales and revenue because of cryptocurrency mining.

This had the symptom of disappointing non-mining customers, who saw prices increase and supply dry up. Subsequently, retailers incidentally limited the number of graphics cards that an individual could purchase. While diggers of the more famous cryptocurrencies, for example, [bitcoin,](/bitcoin) have shifted to utilizing specialized and more financially savvy chipsets called application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs), Graphics Processing Units are as yet used to mine less popular currencies.

> The rise in the ubiquity of cryptocurrencies has caused a monstrous shortage of GPUs. Reporting from the Verge calculated that GPUs are being sold for a few times their street price on locales like eBay.

## Instances of GPU Companies

Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) and Nvidia (NVDA) are two of the greatest names in the GPU market. Let's investigate the two companies below.

### Advanced Micro Devices (AMD)

AMD is one of the most confided in producers of realistic cards. The manufacturer started as a startup in Silicon Valley in 1969 and grows elite performance computing and perception products. AMD entered the GPU market in 2006 when it acquired leading video card maker ATI. From that point forward, AMD and Nvidia have been the predominant players in the GPU market. As of May 2021, AMD has a market cap of $97.3 billion. AMD has delivered north of 500 million GPUs starting around 2013 and controls 17% of the GPU market share.

AMD puts its spotlight in the GPU market on PC gaming and is a #1 among gamers worldwide.

### Nvidia (NVDA)

Nvidia was the absolute first company to carry GPUs into the world in 1999. The principal GPU in history was known as the Geforce 256. 1999 was additionally the year Nvidia sent off its [initial public offering](/ipo) (IPO) at $12 per share. As of May 2021, the stock is trading around $645 per share.

Nvidia has a market cap of $404.8 billion and controls 13% of the GPU market share.

Nvidia has significant reach in the advanced GPU market. As indicated by Nvidia's website "eight of the world's main 10 supercomputers currently use NVIDIA GPUs, InfiniBand networking, or both. NVIDIA powers 346 of the overall TOP500 systems on the latest rundown."

Nvidia's own supercomputer, named Selene, is positioned fifth in the world and is the world's quickest industrial supercomputer.

## Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) FAQs
### What Is the Difference Between GPU and VGA?

Though GPU is a chip or electronic circuit capable used to deliver graphics for display on an electronic gadget, a VGA or video graphics exhibit connector is a physical gadget used to transfer video signs and computer video output.

### How Do You Overclock Your GPU?

Before overclocking ensure you completely clean your gadget and introduce any updates and bug fixes to your software. Because of updates in technology, overclocking is genuinely simple. Basically introduce software, for example, Afterburner and let the system go to work. After the establishment is complete, run a gaming benchmark to try out the new software.

### What Is GPU Scaling?

GPU scaling is a feature that empowers users to change the viewpoint ratio of a game in light of their screen's resolution. A few users accept this adjusting the viewpoint ratio will additionally upgrade the picture quality of the display.
