# Extra Voluntary Contribution (AVC)
## What Is an Additional Voluntary Contribution (AVC)?

An extra voluntary contribution (AVC) is a term depicting an employee's [tax-deferred](/taxdeferred) payment to a retirement savings account that surpasses the amount their employer matches. The employee might make extra annual voluntary contributions up to certain approved amounts by the [Internal Revenue Service](/irs) (IRS).

## Grasping an Additional Voluntary Contribution (AVC)

Employees can make extra voluntary contributions to tax-deferred savings accounts, for example, [401(k)](/401kplan), [403(b)](/403bplan), SEP-IRA, SIMPLE IRA, and [Roth 401(k)](/roth401k) plans. Everything except the Roth IRAs permit the employee to contribute pretax dollars.

This basically means that employees might delay paying income taxes on this portion of their salaries until they pull out the money upon retirement. With Roth IRAs, the income taxes are paid at the time contributions are made, meaning they are not [pretax contributions](/pretaxcontribution). In any case, Roth IRAs permit tax-free withdrawals or [distributions](/conveyance) in retirement.

### Employer Matching Contributions

With employer-sponsored retirement plans, employers can match the percentage of the salary that an employee contributes, up to a threshold. For instance, an employer could contribute 3% of an employee's salary every year.

The employer could expect that the employee likewise contribute a base percentage to fit the bill for the employer match. Now and again, companies offer programs with higher matching maximums, while others offer no matching options of any sort.

### Employee Contribution Limits

The IRS has laid out annual contribution limits for 401(k)s. For 2021, the maximum employee contribution limit each year is $19,500 (expanding to $20,500 in 2022). Assuming you are aged 50 or more seasoned, an extra catch-up contribution of $6,500 for both 2021 and 2022 is permitted.

SIMPLE IRAs have a $13,500 employee contribution limit in 2021 (expanding to $14,000 in 2022). For the two years, the catch-up contribution is $3,000. SIMPLE IRAs are plans that are offered by companies with less than 100 employees.

The contribution limits for employer-sponsored retirement plans are a lot higher than the limits for[ individual retirement accounts](/ira) (IRAs) and individual [Roth IRAs](/rothira). Per the IRS, individuals can contribute a maximum of $6,000 in 2021 and 2022 to IRAs. For those aged 50 and over, they can contribute an extra $1,000 as a catch-up contribution.

In the above employee contribution limits, they do exclude employer contributions. If an employer, for instance, contributed to an employee's plan 5% of the employee's salary, they would add $2,500 to the employee's 401(k).

Suppose that the employee was likewise required to add 5% of their salary to fit the bill for the employer match. Any extra employee contributions past the employer match of 5% would be viewed as extra voluntary contributions.

## Tax Consequences of Excess Contributions

Extra voluntary contributions might differ in tax treatment, contingent upon the type of plan. Commonly, contributions made to tax-deferred accounts will gather or develop tax-free until retirement.

At the point when the funds are removed for retirement, the IRS will levy a 6% tax on the extra amount contributed, and on any investment returns earned by that money consistently up to that point.
