# Average Annual Yield
## What is average annual yield?
Average annual yield is the [income of an investment](/investmentincome) separated by the age of the investment. Such investments can be [deposit](/deposit) accounts somebody holds with her bank, shares of [stock](/commonstock), or [assets](/assets) like products or real estate. The average annual yield is calculated by looking at rates of return north of at least two years.
## More profound definition
Any time somebody puts away money, she needs a [return on her investment](/returnoninvestment). The return, as calculated throughout the span of the investment's lifetime, can be communicated as an average annual yield.
On any long term investment, the average annual yield will decide the asset's performance over the long run.
Looking at average annual yields can assist the normal investor with pursuing smart investment choices for her portfolio. A few investments might perform better than others, which is true among various asset classes as well as even among a similar asset class. The average annual yield is calculated subsequent to adding up all income associated with the investment, including [interest](/interest) and [dividends](/dividend).
Since an asset's value might vacillate, the average annual yield is key when an investor chooses to [diversify](/enhancement) her portfolio. An investor will need to reduce her investments in assets that have lower yields for those with higher yields, and the average annual yield gives her a more careful picture than a simple snapshot of a period of time.
## Average annual yield model
Joan has a portfolio of stocks that she's monitoring. She takes a gander at the shares of stock she has for the Green Calf energy drink company and see that that year's rate of return was about $500. On a $5,000 investment, that means her annual rate of return was 10 percent. Last year, a similar investment yielded $100, and $250 the year before that, individually earning 2 percent and 5 percent rates of return. Her average annual yield on the stock is 5.67 percent.
