## What Is an Evergreen Option?

An evergreen option is a provision of some [employee stock option plans](/esop) (ESOPs) in which extra shares are consequently granted to the plan consistently. An evergreen option may likewise be called an "evergreen provision" or "evergreen plan."

## How Evergreen Options Work

An evergreen plan utilizes a percentage of the company's common shares outstanding to determine the number of options to grant. For instance, in the event that a company has 75 million outstanding shares and a 5% evergreen option provision, the company could issue 3.750 million shares in compensation in the main year. In the subsequent year, the company would have 78.750 million shares outstanding and could, consequently, issue up to 3.937 million shares in compensation.

Evergreen option plans don't normally have an expiration date and don't need shareholder endorsement. Be that as it may, the board of directors must endorse the number of shares that are naturally designated to the plan every year. Evergreen options ordinarily get issued as incentive stock options (ISOs), which are options rigorously saved for employees, for the most part company executives.

## Benefits of Evergreen Options

An evergreen option gives a [publicly traded company](/publiccompany) a method for drawing in and hold top managers and employees by furnishing them with extra compensation far in excess of a salary. Evergreen options assist with adjusting managers' and employees' interests to those of shareholders, in light of the fact that their options increase in value assuming the company performs well.

## Limitations of Evergreen Options

The downside of evergreen provisions for shareholders is the annual issuance of extra shares [dilutes](/dilution) the company's share base. Current shareholders who don't receive evergreen options have a more modest ownership in the company on the grounds that the total number of shares outstanding has increased, however their shareholding has continued as before.

For instance, Taylor has a 1% interest in a company that has 20 million shares outstanding (200,000 shares \u00f7 20,000,000 share base). After senior executives receive their annual evergreen options, the company has 22 million shares outstanding. Taylor's interest in the company has diminished to 0.9% (200,000 shares \u00f7 22,000,000 share base). In the event that a company is performing ineffectively, the dilution of its shares might offset the benefits of giving evergreen options.

## Taxation of Evergreen Options

Giving evergreen options are issued as incentive stock options, the grant is a non-taxable transaction. The main tax event happens when the shares are sold, not exercised. In the event that the shares are quickly sold after they get exercised, any realized gains are treated as ordinary income. Be that as it may, assuming the shares are held for a considerable length of time after they have been exercised, and not sold until two years after the grant date, gains are treated as a long-term capital gain.

For instance, assume Robin's evergreen options are granted December 15, 2017, and they exercise them December 15, 2018. If Robin has any desire to report a long-term capital gain, they can't sell their shares until December 15, 2019.

## Features
- Evergreen options consider employees with stock options plans to receive extra shares each eligible year naturally.
- While great for participating employees, evergreen options can weaken earnings and voting rights for different shareholders.
- Since they ordinarily have no set expiration date, the extra share purchases are thought of "evergreen."
