# Thin File
## What Is a Thin File?

A "thin file" alludes to the credit report of somebody with practically zero credit history. Consumers who are just starting out and might very well never have applied for a new line of credit or had a credit card are said to have thin files.

## Grasping a Thin File

Credit bureaus order data on individual consumers' utilization of credit to produce a [credit report ](/creditreport)on them. That credit report, which remembers data for how much the person has borrowed and whether they have paid their bills on time, is utilized to work out their [credit score](/credit_score) and might be audited by prospective lenders to decide how creditworthy they are.

Having a thin file can make it challenging to get credit or be approved for a loan, since it gives lenders very little data with which to judge the person's creditworthiness. To get around that problem, a few lenders will think about other data in settling on their choices.

## Step by step instructions to Build Credit with a Thin File

To borrow money, then you have several options. The most straightforward, in light of the fact that it depends on moves that you've previously made, is to ask the lender to consider payments that normally aren't reported to the credit bureaus, like utility bills and rent. In the event that you're applying for a home mortgage, for instance, Fannie Mae says lenders can develop a nontraditional [credit history](/credit-history) as far as you might be concerned, utilizing a combination of your [bank statements](/bank-explanation), [canceled checks](/canceled-check), bills set apart as paid, and reference letters from [creditors](/creditor) and landowners.

Another option that calls for greater investment and exertion is to get a credit card and begin building a strong credit history. In the event that you have no credit history, the main type of card accessible to you might be a [secured credit card.](/securedcard) A secured credit card expects you to deposit a sum of money with the lender that will then, at that point, act as your credit line, the maximum amount that you can charge to the card.

Make a point to get a secured credit card that will report your payments to each of the three major credit bureaus: Equifax, Experian, and TransUnion. Additionally, make sure to pay your bills on time. If not, you'll build a poor credit history. At last, search for a secured card with a low or no annual fee.

After you've involved a secured card for some time and your credit history is presently not as thin, you might be eligible to apply for a conventional credit card.

At that point, you no doubt will have laid out a credit score too. As indicated by Experian, "Records ordinarily need to have at least three months and maybe however much six months of activity before they can be utilized to compute a credit score."
