# Full Value
## What Is Full Value?

Full value is a term used to portray a [asset](/asset) trading at a fair price. Full value is reached when the calculated value of an asset, its [intrinsic value](/intrinsicvalue), is equivalent to its [market value](/marketvalue), the price at which it very well may be bought or sold on the open market.

## Seeing Full Value

As indicated by the [efficient market hypothesis](/efficientmarkethypothesis) (EMH), the market value of an asset ought to continuously rise to its true intrinsic value. In reality, for different reasons, assets rarely trade at their full value.

That makes sense of why the saying "purchase low, sell high" is quibbled around so frequently. [Value investors](/valueinvesting) accept there are a lot of underestimated companies out there that can be bought below their intrinsic value. The thought is that purchasing neglected [stocks](/stock) will yield greater [returns](/return) over an extended time as different investors will step by step start to perceive their merits, pushing up their share prices to mirror their true worth (full value), or, even better, perhaps [overvaluing](/overvalued) them.

> Frequently, the market's valuation of an asset varies from the intrinsic value of the asset.

At the point when an asset has arrived at full valuation, it is supposed to be neither over-nor [undervalued](/undervalued). [Portfolio managers](/portfoliomanager) and [analysts](/investigator) frequently watch for full valuation as an indication of a proper opportunity to sell an asset, albeit professional investors might differ with respect to the place where full value is really arrived at given varying estimates of intrinsic value.

## Full Value Method

[Fundamental analysis](/fundamentalanalysis) is generally ordinarily utilized by analysts to determine the intrinsic value of an asset, like a stock, and whether it is trading at its full value. Fundamental analysts study whatever can influence an asset's value, including economic and industry conditions, the state of a company's finances, and the viability and history of its management team.

The ultimate objective of fundamental analysis is to create a [quantitative](/quantitativeanalysis) value that an investor can compare with a [security's](/security) current market price.

### Cash Is King

Frequently, analysts will zero in on cash to determine a company's intrinsic value. One method that is especially well known is working out [discounted cash flow](/dcf) (DCF).

In short, DCF analysis tries to figure out the value of a company today, in view of projections of how much [cash flow](/cashflow) it will produce from here on out. The goal is to estimate the money an investor would receive from an investment, adjusted for the [time value of money](/timevalueofmoney).

## Limitations of Full Value

Because of the endless factors engaged with determining intrinsic value, including the interesting system of esteeming [intangible assets](/intangibleasset), estimates of intrinsic value can fluctuate between analysts. A lack of consensus thusly makes it difficult to lay out in the event that an asset is trading at the right market price or not.

Different intrinsic valuations can likewise be reached in light of the fact that not all investors have similar access to data on a given asset. Their interpretation of the asset's value will illuminate their decision on what it is worth, and what they will pay for it, on the open market. Taken as a whole, these investors' activities will influence the market valuation of the asset.

[Supply and demand](/law-of-supply-demand), too, may play a job in setting a market price. Assuming investors as a whole determine that a stock is an appealing investment, yet the number of shares are deficient to meet all of their [demand](/demand) for the stock, the stock price might rise, even farther than the intrinsic value of the stock.

Also, [market sentiment](/marketsentiment) can impact market price. For instance, idle gossip about a company can obliterate its share price, leading it to trade way below its real intrinsic value.
