# Discounts For Lack Of Marketability (DLOM)
## What Does Discounts For Lack Of Marketability Mean?

Discounts for lack of marketability (DLOM) allude to the method used to assist with working out the value of closely held and restricted shares. The theory behind DLOM is that a [valuation](/valuation) discount exists between a stock that is publicly traded and in this way has a market, and the market for privately held stock, which frequently has nearly nothing if any marketplace.

Different methods have been utilized to evaluate the discount that can be applied including the [restricted stock](/restrictedstock) method, [IPO](/ipo) method, and the option pricing method.

## Grasping Discounts For Lack Of Marketability (DLOM)

The restricted stock method indicates that the main difference between a company's [common stock](/commonstock) and its restricted stock is the lack of marketability of the restricted stock.

Accordingly, the price difference between the two units ought to emerge due to this lack of marketability. The IPO method connects with the price difference between shares that are sold pre-IPO and post-IPO. The percent difference between the two prices is viewed as the DLOM utilizing this method. The option pricing method utilizes the option's price and the strike price of the option as the determinants of the DLOM. The option price as a percentage of the strike price is viewed as the DLOM under this method.

The consensus of many studies recommends that the DLOM ranges between 30% to half.
