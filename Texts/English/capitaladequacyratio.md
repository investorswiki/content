# Capital Adequacy Ratio - CAR
## What Is Capital Adequacy Ratio - CAR?

The capital adequacy ratio (CAR) is a measurement of a bank's accessible capital communicated as a percentage of a bank's risk-weighted credit exposures. The capital adequacy ratio, otherwise called capital-to-risk weighted assets ratio (CRAR), is utilized to safeguard contributors and advance the stability and effectiveness of financial systems around the world. Two types of capital are measured: [tier-1 capital](/tier1capital), which can retain losses without a bank being required to cease trading, and [tier-2 capital](/tier2capital), which can assimilate losses in the event of a winding-up thus gives a lesser degree of protection to contributors.

## Computing CAR

The capital adequacy ratio is calculated by separating a bank's capital by its risk-weighted assets. The capital used to compute the capital adequacy ratio is separated into two tiers.

### Tier-1 Capital

[Tier-1 capital](/tier1capital), or core capital, consists of equity capital, ordinary share capital, elusive assets and examined revenue reserves. Tier-1 capital is utilized to ingest losses and doesn't need a bank to cease operations. Tier-1 capital is the capital that is permanently and effectively accessible to cushion losses endured by a bank without it being required to stop operating. A genuine illustration of a bank's tier one capital is its ordinary share capital.

### Tier-2 Capital

[Tier-2 capital](/tier2capital) includes unaudited retained earnings, unaudited reserves and general loss reserves. This capital retains losses in the event of a company [winding up](/windingup) or liquidating. Tier-2 capital is the one that cushions losses in case the bank is winding up, so it gives a lesser degree of protection to contributors and creditors. It is utilized to retain losses on the off chance that a bank loses all its Tier-1 capital.

The two capital tiers are added together and partitioned by risk-weighted assets to compute a bank's capital adequacy ratio. [Risk-weighted assets](/riskweightedassets) are calculated by taking a gander at a bank's loans, assessing the risk and afterward doling out a weight. While measuring [credit exposures](/credit-exposure), changes are made to the value of assets listed on a bank's balance sheet.

The loans the bank has issued are all weighted in light of their degree of [credit risk](/creditrisk). For instance, loans issued to the government are weighted at 0.0%, while those given to people are assigned a weighted score of 100.0%.

### Risk-Weighted Assets

[Risk-weighted assets](/riskweightedassets) are utilized to determine the base amount of capital that must be held by banks and different institutions to reduce the risk of [insolvency](/insolvency). The [capital requirement](/capitalrequirement) depends on a [risk assessment](/risk-assessment) for each type of bank asset. For instance, a loan that is secured by a [letter of credit](/letterofcredit) is considered to be riskier and requires more capital than a mortgage loan that is secured with collateral.

## Why Capital Adequacy Ratio Matters

The reason least capital adequacy ratios (CARs) are critical is to ensure that banks have sufficient cushion to ingest a reasonable amount of losses before they become indebted and consequently lose contributors' funds. The capital adequacy ratios guarantee the productivity and stability of a nation's financial system by bringing down the risk of banks becoming indebted. Generally, a bank with a high capital adequacy ratio is considered safe and prone to meet its financial obligations.

During the method involved with winding-up, funds belonging to contributors are given a higher priority than the bank's capital, so investors can only lose their savings on the off chance that a bank enlists a loss surpassing the amount of capital it has. Subsequently the higher the bank's capital adequacy ratio, the higher the degree of protection of investor's assets.

Off-balance sheet agreements, for example, [foreign exchange](/foreign-exchange) contracts and guarantees, additionally have credit risks. Such exposures are converted to their credit equivalent figures and afterward weighted likewise to that of on-balance sheet credit exposures. The [off-balance sheet](/off-balance-sheet-obs) and on-balance sheet credit exposures are then lumped together to get the total risk-weighted credit exposures.

> In light of everything, a bank with a high capital adequacy ratio (CAR) is perceived as sound and looking great to meet its financial obligations.

## Instance of Using CAR

Currently, the base ratio of capital to risk-weighted assets is 8% under [Basel II](/baselii) and 10.5% under Basel III. High capital adequacy ratios are over the base requirements under Basel II and Basel III.

Least capital adequacy ratios are critical in guaranteeing that banks have sufficient cushion to retain a reasonable amount of losses before they become bankrupt and consequently lose contributors' funds.

For instance, assume bank ABC has $10 million in tier-1 capital and $5 million in tier-two capital. It has loans that have been weighted and calculated as $50 million. The capital adequacy ratio of bank ABC is 30% ($10 million + $5 million)/$50 million). Hence, this bank has a high capital adequacy ratio and is considered to be safer. Thus, Bank ABC is more averse to become ruined assuming unexpected losses happen.

## Vehicle versus the Solvency Ratio

Both the capital adequacy ratio and the solvency ratio give ways of assessing a company's debt versus its revenues situation. Nonetheless, the capital adequacy ratio is normally applied explicitly to assessing banks, while the solvency ratio metric can be utilized for assessing any type of company.

The [solvency ratio](/solvencyratio) is a debt evaluation metric that can be applied to a company to survey how well it can cover the two its short-term and long-term outstanding financial obligations. Solvency ratios below 20% show an increased probability of default.

Analysts frequently favor the solvency ratio for giving a complete evaluation of a company's financial situation, since it measures genuine cash flow as opposed to net income, not which may all be promptly accessible to a company to meet obligations. The solvency ratio is best employed in comparison with comparative firms inside a similar industry, as certain industries will generally be essentially more debt-weighty than others.

## Vehicle versus Tier-1 Leverage Ratio

A connected capital adequacy ratio in some cases considered is the [tier-1 leverage ratio](/tier-1-leverage-ratio). The tier-1 leverage ratio is the relationship between a bank's [core capital](/core-capital) and its total assets. It is calculated by separating Tier-1 capital by a bank's average total consolidated assets and certain off-balance sheet exposures. The higher the tier-1 leverage ratio is, the more probable a bank can endure negative shocks to its [balance sheet](/balancesheet).

## Limitations of Using CAR

One limitation of the CAR is that it neglects to account for expected losses during a bank run or financial crisis that can distort a bank's capital and cost of capital.

Numerous analysts and bank executives consider the [economic capital](/economic-capital) measure to be a more accurate and solid assessment of a bank's financial sufficiency and risk exposure than the capital adequacy ratio.

The calculation of economic capital, which gauges the amount of capital a bank needs to have close by to guarantee its [ability to handle its current outstanding risk](/economic-capital), depends on the bank's financial wellbeing, credit rating, expected losses and confidence level of solvency. By including such economic real factors true to form losses, this measurement is remembered to address a more practical appraisal of a bank's genuine financial wellbeing and risk level.

## Highlights
- Vehicle is involved by regulators to determine capital adequacy for banks and to run stress tests.
- Two types of capital are measured with CAR. [Tier-1 capital](/tier1capital) can retain a reasonable amount of loss without compelling the bank to stop its trading, while [tier-2 capital](/tier2capital) can support a loss on the off chance that there's a liquidation.
- Vehicle is critical to guarantee that banks have sufficient cushion to ingest a reasonable amount of losses before they become wiped out.
- The downside of utilizing CAR is that it doesn't account for the risk of a possible run on the bank, or what might occur in a financial crisis.
