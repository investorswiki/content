# Implementation Lag
## What Is Implementation Lag?

Implementation lag is the postpone between an adverse macroeconomic event and the implementation of a fiscal or monetary policy response by the government and central bank. Implementation lag can result from defers in perceiving a problem; conflicts and bargaining over the proper response; physical, technical, and administrative limitations on the genuine execution of new policy; and structural economic lags as the policy change manages the economy. Implementation lag might reduce the effectiveness of a policy response or even outcome in periods of procyclical policy.

## Understanding Implementation Lag

There is dependably an implementation lag after a macroeconomic surprise. For a certain something, policymakers may not even realize there is a problem, as a result of data lag. A ton of economic data isn't distributed for a month or a quarter after the period it applies to. Even then, at that point, these [lagging indicators](/laggingindicator) might be subject to successive corrections. [GDP](/gdp) data, for instance, is famously questionable when initially distributed, which is the reason the Bureau of Economic Analysis cautions that its evaluations are useful, yet all at once never really last.

For an advance warning of economic dangers, policymakers take a gander at [leading indicators](/leadingindicator), like reviews of business confidence, and bond and stock market indicators, similar to the yield bend — financial specialists policymakers actually need to hold on to check whether these expectations work out. Then, as a result of [recognition lag](/recognition_lag), it might require months or years before legislators perceive there has been an economic shock or structural change in the economy. Incumbent lawmakers might even be hesitant to recognize there is a chance of a recession until they are in one.

Central bankers, financial specialists, and government officials then need to consider over the right response before they execute policy changes. The right policies won't really be self-evident, particularly to financial specialists. Furthermore, lawmakers, who normally have political as opposed to economic objectives, as to shift responsibility elsewhere. Great economics — like preventing huge asset bubbles that will crush the economy when they burst — frequently make awful politics, and business analysts will more often than not differ widely over what comprises great economics in any case. For this reason the relationship among economics and politics prompts so many policy bungles, and why monetary policy so frequently turns out to be procyclical and weakening as opposed to being countercyclical and assisting with streamlining the [economic cycle](/economic-shock).

Even when financial specialists and legislators are in total agreement, there will in any case be a [response lag](/response_lag), before any monetary or fiscal policy action affects the economy. New government spending programs might require weeks or months to get the money in the hands of the ultimate beneficiaries as a matter of fact. Infusions of new money into the economy additionally get some margin to manage the financial sector and the real economy, with long and variable lags between monetary policy changes and ultimate outcomes. As quantitative easing has shown, it can require a very long time before monetary policy affects the economy — similar to the case when central banks [push on a string](/push_on_a_string) — and tax cuts can take just as long to have an evident impact.

Due to this multitude of postponements, when an economic policy response to a negative economic shock or a downturn into recession really deals with the economy, the economic situation will unavoidably have changed somewhat. It is possible that the economic downturn has become more serious, and the initial policy response is presently lacking to address the situation. Or on the other hand it is possible that the economy has proactively started to self-right, and when the policy response produces results it essentially stokes the fire of the next economic cycle or bubble. In this case, such policy will in general be procyclical and really amplifies economic precariousness over the long haul.

## Features
