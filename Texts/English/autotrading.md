Conditional orders permit an investor to enter trades at determined levels for automatic execution when a price is reached.

Institutional investors and technical traders will utilize complex systems that consider conditional orders and strategies, for example, [grid trading](/grid-trading), trend trading, scalping, or [fading](/blur).

Many technical [day traders](/daytrader) will just work with brokers that permit modules or outer programs to interface with their platform, or that offer a coding program inside the actual platform to make [indicators](/pointer) and autotrading programs.

Brokerage platforms like TD Ameritrade and Interactive Brokers, for instance, offer coding and autotrading capacities. Institutional investors will ordinarily have their proprietary trading platforms that consider autotrading through algorithmic programming.

## Autotrading Strategies

Institutional investors may utilize complex calculations that try to place trades for investment portfolios in view of defined criteria represented by a portfolio's objective. This may incorporate buying or selling securities automatically to maintain a specific percentage or dollar [allocation](/assetallocation) to each stock, or matching the holdings in the portfolio to an index.

Technical informal investors will utilize autotrading to invest in light of technical market signals. They regularly utilize complex conditional orders for auto trading. These types of orders permit an investor to indicate an entry price and build a collar around the trade to institute foreordained profit and [loss levels](/stop-lossorder) for risk management.

Autotrading programs can be worked to capitalize on creating trends, trade [gaps](/hole), trade ranges, or scalp the bid/ask spread. There are innumerable strategies. Using them is just limited by the trader's ability to concoct profitable strategies and really program them.

Most brokers offer a platform that comes outfitted with the ability to introduce applications offered by different traders and organizations.

Forex traders can likewise make their trading programs by utilizing MetaTrader 4 or MetaTrader 5 coding language called MQL4 and MQL5, for instance.

## Autotrading Strategy Criteria

Programming a simple trading strategy for autotrading is complex. Rules should be sufficiently simple to be coded, and ca exclude subjectivity, as the computer needs defined rules.

Interesting points include:

- Position size: A position size could be equivalent to 10% of account equity. Or on the other hand it very well may be further developed, first characterizing the difference between the entry price and stop loss, setting a maximum risk, for example, 1% of the account capital, and afterward characterizing the position size in view of the 1% risk and the distance between the stop loss and entry on the specific trade. This further developed position sizing approach is sometimes called optimal position sizing since the position size changes in view of the specifics of a trade.
- How trades will be placed, and what specific boundaries will trigger a trade: For a trade to be placed on a [moving average](/movingaverage) (MA), crossover expects that the price initially be on one side of the MA, and afterward be on the other. The data source must likewise be indicated. How is still up in the air: the last price? the bid price? the [asking](/ask) price?
- How trades will be closed, and what triggers the closing of trade: This could be achieved by submitting limit requests and stop-loss orders at the start of the trade. These orders will close the trade at the order prices, whether the trade is profitable or unprofitable. A more complex strategy could be to program a [trailing stop loss](/trailingstop).
- Requirements on the system, for example, when it ought to or shouldn't trade: This incorporates things, for example, when the programmer shouldn't or ought to trade. For instance, the programmer may not maintain that the program should run until five minutes after the stock market opens. Hence, they would have to put in a time limitation in the programming code.
- Need for shields: For instance, in the event that over 5% equity is lost, or an open trade is losing in excess of a defined amount, the program closes all trades, as well as an email is shipped off an administrator to check on the program.

These are essential criteria to consider while making an automated trading program. The more complex the system, the more criteria, and factors should be thought of.
