## Understanding Freed Up

"Freed up" can be a clue to the situation with an initial public offering (IPO) or a [direct public offering](/directpublicoffering) (DPO). In the event that a firm chooses to begin offering public shares of its stock, it normally must hire at least one [investment banks](/investmentbank) (IB) that can deal with the IPO. Utilizing beyond what one bank can assist with spreading the risk of the IPO between banks, yet one bank will generally be the lead during this cycle.
