# Matching Contribution
## What Is a Matching Contribution?

A matching contribution is a type of contribution an employer decides to make to their employees' employer-sponsored retirement plan. The contribution depends on [elective deferral contributions](/electivedeferralcontribution) that the employee makes.

## How a Matching Contribution Works

Generally, the employer's contribution might match the employee's elective deferral contribution up to a certain dollar amount or percentage of compensation. For instance, an employer could match half of an employee's contribution.

It frequently requires several years or a vesting period for this benefit to start. At the point when an employee is vested, then, at that point, they legally own the money their employer has contributed to their [401(k)](/401kplan) or other retirement accounts. In the event that an employee leaves the company, they will lose the right to claim any matching contribution funds in which they are not yet fully vested.

[Vesting](/vesting) likewise has strong connections to employee retention. Stock bonuses, for instance, can allure valued employees to stay with the company for a long time, especially in the event that the company is promising and may be acquired or [go public](/goingpublic) in the approaching year(s), which would mean the employee's stock would duplicate in value.

Now and again, vesting is immediate. For instance, employees are 100% vested in SEP and [SIMPLE](/simple)employer contributions. With respect to a 401(k), a [cliff vesting](/cliffvesting) or [graded vesting](/graded-vesting) schedule might heighten toward a full matched contribution. Employers ought to make the vesting schedule accessible to employees alongside information about the 401(k) plan.

## Matching Contribution and Retirement Savings

They can add to their own [individual retirement account](/traditionalira) (IRA) or Roth IRA, alongside a company's 401(k) plan. For more modest companies, SEP and SIMPLE plans could be more effective.

The most common form of a matched contribution happens in a 401(k) plan, nonetheless. Remarkably, 401(k)s are [qualified](/qrp) employer-sponsored retirement plans that employees add to on a post-tax or potentially pretax basis. Employers might make matching or [non-elective contributions](/non-electivecontribution) to the plan for the benefit of eligible employees and may add an extra profit-sharing feature.

Earnings in a 401(k) plan accrue on a tax-deferred basis. This means that inside a given year, an employee won't need to pay taxes on these funds; nonetheless, when they pull out the amount at 59\u00bd, the eligible retirement age, they pay ordinary [income tax](/incometax) assuming the initial contribution is pre-tax. On the off chance that the employee pulls out funds prior to 59\u00bd for a non-qualified reason, they could cause a 10% penalty.

Individuals must likewise take [required least distributions](/requiredminimumdistribution) (RMDs) before they arrive at a certain age, generally 72. As a result of [compounding](/compounding), the more drawn out these funds stay in retirement accounts, the more important they become. Notwithstanding, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) powers individuals to begin pulling out money at one point as the U.S. economy requirements to keep enough of these funds in circulation.

Assuming the plan permits — and the employee is as yet employed after they arrive at age 72 — the RMD can be delayed until April 1 following the year the employee resigns.
