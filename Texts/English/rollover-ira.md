# Rollover IRA
## What Is a Rollover IRA?

A rollover Individual Retirement Account (IRA) is an account that considers the transfer of assets from an old employer-sponsored retirement account to a [traditional IRA](/traditionalira). The purpose of a [rollover](/rollover) IRA is to keep up with the tax-deferred status of those assets. Rollover IRAs are normally used to hold 401(k), 403(b), or profit-sharing plan assets that are transferred from a former employer's sponsored retirement account or qualified plan.

Rollover IRAs don't cap the amount of money an employee can roll over and they permit account holders to invest in a wide cluster of assets like stocks, bonds, ETFs, and mutual funds.

## How a Rollover IRA Works

By moving retirement plan assets through a [direct rollover](/directrollover), in which the former employer's plan administrator moves the assets directly to the rollover IRA, employees try not to have 20% of their transferred assets kept by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). Alternatively, assets can be moved utilizing a [indirect rollover](/indirect-rollover), in which the employee claims the plan assets and afterward puts them into another eligible retirement plan in 60 days or less.

With an indirect rollover, be that as it may, 20% of the account's assets might be kept and can't be recuperated until the employee records their annual tax return. In the event that the movement of assets from a qualified employer-sponsored retirement plan to a rollover IRA isn't dealt with accurately, the employee will face taxes. In the event that they have not yet arrived at retirement age (59\u00bd), they will likewise pay early withdrawal punishments on those assets.

On account of a transfer with a money order, the rollover check must be saved in 60 days or less. Assuming that it is kept following 60 days, the funds will be taxed and punishments will be charged.

## Special Considerations
