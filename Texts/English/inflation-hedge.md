# Inflation Hedge
## What Is an Inflation Hedge?

An inflation hedge is an investment that is considered to safeguard the diminished purchasing power of a currency that outcomes from the loss of its value due to rising prices either full scale economically or due to inflation. It regularly includes [investing](/investing) in an asset that is expected to keep up with or increase its value over a predetermined period of time. On the other hand, the hedge could include taking a higher position in [assets](/asset), which might diminish in value less quickly than the value of the currency.

## How Inflation Hedging Works

Inflation hedging can assist with safeguarding the value of an investment. Certain investments could appear to give a respectable return, yet when inflation is considered in, they can be sold at a loss. For instance, on the off chance that you invest in a stock that gives a 5% return, yet inflation is 6%, you are losing that 1%. Assets that are viewed as an inflation hedge could be inevitable; investors run to them, which keeps their values high even however the [intrinsic value](/intrinsicvalue) might be a lot of lower.

For instance, assuming that the dollar loses value from the effects of inflation, gold will in general turn out to be more costly. So an owner of gold is protected (or hedged) against a falling dollar on the grounds that, as inflation rises and dissolves the value of the dollar, the cost of each and every ounce of gold in dollars will rise thus. So the investor is compensated for this inflation with additional dollars for every ounce of gold.

## A Real World Example of Inflation Hedging

Organizations sometimes participate in inflation hedging to keep their operating costs low. One of the most renowned models is Delta Air Lines purchasing an oil refinery from ConocoPhillips in 2012 to offset the risk of higher stream fuel prices.

To the degree that airlines try to hedge their fuel costs, they commonly do as such in the crude oil market. Delta felt they could deliver stream fuel themselves at a lower cost than buying it on the market and in this manner straightforwardly hedged against fly fuel price inflation. At that point, Delta estimated that it would reduce its annual fuel expense by $300 million.

## Limitations of Inflation Hedging

Inflation hedging has its limits and now and again can be unpredictable. For instance, Delta has not in every case brought in money from its refinery in the years since it was purchased, restricting the viability of its inflation hedge.

The contentions for and against investing in commodities as an inflation hedge are generally revolved around variables, for example, global population growth, mechanical innovation, production spikes and blackouts, emerging market political turmoil, Chinese economic growth, and global infrastructure spending. These persistently changing factors play a job in the viability of inflation hedging.

## Highlights
- Inflation hedging can be utilized to offset the anticipated drop in a currency's price.
- Restricting downside risk is a major commonality between institutional investors and currency hedging is a common practice.
