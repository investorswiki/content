## What Is a Delivery Month?

## Grasping Delivery Months

The buyer consents to buy the underlying asset upon expiration, while the seller consents to surrender it by then. Some [commodities](/commodity) can be delivered at whatever month, while others must be delivered in certain months. The delivery month is just the month stipulated in a [futures contract](/futurescontract) for cash settlement or for physical delivery. Commodities are any great for which there is a demand. This incorporates anything from stocks and bonds to precious metals, oil, corn, sugar, and soybeans.

If a futures trader has any desire to offset or [liquidate](/liquidate) a position, the delivery months must match. Most futures positions are energized prior to the delivery month, so the contracts that are close to delivery frequently see the most volume and set the current price of the underlying commodity. On the off chance that they don't match, the trader winds up [long](/long) one month and short an alternate month as opposed to counteracting the position.

This means on the off chance that you don't exit your position before the month's over before the contract's expiration, you must take [physical delivery](/physicaldelivery) of the cocoa â€” or the commodity being referred to. Certain commodities, as verified above, can be delivered all year.

- February: **G**
- Walk: **H**
- April: **J**
- May: **K**
- June: **M**
- July: **N**
- Regal: **Q**
