# National Association of State Boards of Accountancy (NASBA)
## What is the National Association of State Boards of Accountancy?

The National Association of State Boards of Accountancy (NASBA) is a nonprofit group that serves the 55 state and U.S. region boards of accountancy, which are responsible for regulating the accountancy calling in the United States and controlling the Uniform CPA Examination.

Public accountancy is regulated at the state level, with each state keeping an independent board of accountancy that characterizes and upholds standards.

## Understanding the National Association of State Boards of Accountancy

The National Association of State Boards of Accountancy (NASBA) was established in 1908 to unite best practices of the calling for the protection of the public that depends on sound financial reporting.

NASBA perceives that a well-functioning economy is based on trust, and without accurate and reasonable accounting, this trust is compromised. A core mission of NASBA is keeping up with public trust in the calling in the wake of accounting embarrassments at companies like [Enron](/enron), [WorldCom](/worldcom), and others.

The association likewise screens and gives feedback to legislative and regulatory issues facing the accounting trade.

NASBA runs training and education programs for accountants for the [certified public accountant](/cpa) (CPA) exam. As opposed to mainstream thinking, the NASBA doesn't foster substance or direct the exam. That job has a place with the [American Institute of Certified Public Accountants](/american-institute-of-certified-public-accountants) (AICPA), which takes input from the NASBA and state boards of accountancy.

In any case, an important function that the group does concerning CPAs is licensing. Since the license to practice accountancy is conceded at the state level, a CPA licensed in one state needs to get another license on the off chance that they move to an alternate state. The NASBA runs the National Qualification Appraisal Service, with the goal that CPAs licensed in one state might have their qualifications recognized in another state.

NASBA holds regional and national gatherings every year, distributes comment letters and white papers, and scatters its own annual report. As of April 2021, the association's board comprised of five officers, eight regional directors and nine directors-at-large.
