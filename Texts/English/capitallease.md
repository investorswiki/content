# Capital Lease
## What Is Capital Lease?

A capital lease is a contract qualifying a renter for the brief utilization of an asset and has the economic qualities of asset ownership for the end goal of accounting.

## Grasping Capital Lease

The capital lease requires a renter to book assets and liabilities associated with the lease in the event that the rental contract meets specific requirements. Fundamentally, a capital lease is viewed as a purchase of an asset, while an operating lease is taken care of as a true lease under [generally accepted accounting principles](/gaap) (GAAP). A capital lease might be diverged from an operating lease.

Even however a capital lease is technically a kind of rental agreement, GAAP accounting standards view it as a purchase of assets on the off chance that certain criteria are met. Capital leases can affect companies' financial statements, impacting interest expense, depreciation expense, assets, and liabilities.

To qualify as a capital lease, a lease contract must fulfill any of the following four criteria:

1. the life of the lease must be 75% or greater for the asset's [useful life](/usefullife).
1. the lease must contain a [bargain purchase](/bargain-purchase) option at a cost not exactly the market value of an asset.
1. the lessee must gain ownership toward the finish of the lease period.
1. the current value of [lease payments](/lease-payments) must be greater than 90% of the asset's market value.

In 2016, the [Financial Accounting Standards Board](/fasb) (FASB) made an amendment to its accounting rules expecting companies to capitalize all leases with contract terms over one year on their financial statements. The amendment became effective on December 15, 2018, for public companies and December 15, 2019, for private companies.

## Capital Leases Vs. Operating Leases

A [operating lease](/operatinglease) is different in structure and accounting treatment from a capital lease. An operating lease is a contract that allows for the utilization of an asset yet conveys no ownership rights of the asset.

Operating leases used to be considered off-balance sheet financing â€” implying that a leased asset and associated liabilities of future rent payments were excluded from a company's balance sheet to keep the [debt to equity ratio](/debtequityratio) low. By and large, operating leases empowered American firms to keep billions of dollars of assets and liabilities from being recorded on their [balance sheets](/balancesheet).

Be that as it may, the practice of keeping operating leases off the balance sheet was changed while Accounting Standards Update 2016-02 ASU 842 happened. Starting Dec. 15, 2018, for public companies and Dec. 15, 2019, for private companies, right-of-purpose assets and liabilities coming about because of leases are recorded on balance sheets.

To be classified as an operating lease, the lease must meet certain requirements under generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) that exempt it from being recorded as a capital lease. Companies must test for the four criteria, otherwise called the "brilliant line" tests, listed over that decide if rental contracts must be reserved as operating or capital leases. On the off chance that these conditions are not generally met, the lease can be classified as an operating lease, in any case, being a capital lease is reasonable.

The [Internal Revenue Service](/irs) (IRS) may rename an operating lease as a capital lease to dismiss the lease payments as a deduction, consequently expanding the company's taxable income and tax liability.

## Accounting for Capital Leases

A capital lease is an illustration of [accrual accounting's](/accrualaccounting) inclusion of economic events, which requires a company to work out the [present value](/presentvalue) of an obligation on its financial statements. For example, on the off chance that a company estimated the current value of its obligation under a capital lease to be $100,000, it then, at that point, records a $100,000 debit entry to the relating fixed asset account and a $100,000 credit entry to the capital lease liability account on its balance sheet.

Since a capital lease is a financing arrangement, a company must break down its periodic lease payments into an interest expense in light of the company's applicable interest rate and depreciation expense. In the event that a company makes $1,000 in month to month lease payments and its estimated interest is $200, this creates a $1,000 credit entry to the cash account, a $200 debit entry to the interest expense account, and a $800 debit entry to the capital lease liability account.

A company must likewise deteriorate the leased asset that factors in its salvage value and helpful life. For instance, in the event that the previously mentioned asset has a 10-year helpful life and no salvage value in light of the [straight-line basis](/straightlinebasis) depreciation technique, the company records a $833 month to month debit entry to the depreciation expense account and a credit entry to the accumulated depreciation account. At the point when the leased asset is discarded, the fixed asset is credited and the accumulated depreciation account is debited for the leftover balances.
