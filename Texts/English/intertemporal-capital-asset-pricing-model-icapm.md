# Intertemporal Capital Asset Pricing Model (ICAPM)
## What Is Intertemporal Capital Asset Pricing Model (ICAPM)?

The Intertemporal Capital Asset Pricing Model (ICAPM) is a [consumption-based capital asset pricing model](/ccapm) (CCAPM) that expects investors hedge risky positions. Nobel laureate [Robert Merton](/robert-c-merton) presented ICAPM in 1973 as an extension of the capital asset pricing model (CAPM).
