# Emerging Markets Bond Index (EMBI)
## What Is the Emerging Markets Bond Index (EMBI)?

The emerging markets bond index (EMBI) is a [benchmark](/benchmark) index for measuring the total return performance of international government and corporate bonds issued by emerging market countries that meet specific liquidity and structural requirements. Regardless of their increased riskiness relative to developed markets, emerging market bonds offer several potential benefits, for example, portfolio diversity as their returns are not closely [correlated](/connection) to traditional asset classes.

## Understanding the Emerging Markets Bond Index

An emerging market depicts a non-industrial nation or economy that is advancing toward turning out to be further developed by quickly industrializing and taking on free-market[ economies](/freemarket). The largest emerging markets incorporate Nigeria, China, India, Brazil, South Africa, Poland, Mexico, Turkey, Argentina, Russia, and so forth. To exploit the fast growth happening in these countries, investors hope to bonds issued by the government of these nations.

Emerging market debt or bonds are considered [sovereign debt](/sovereign-debt). These government bonds are normally issued in foreign currencies, either in US dollars, euros, or Japanese yen. In light of the increased economic and political risk present in these countries, the [credit rating](/creditrating) on emerging market bonds will generally be lower than that on [developed market](/developed-economy) bonds. Due to the perceived higher risk of investing in these assets, the sovereign bonds have higher yields for investors than that of additional stable bonds in developed countries. For instance, the PIMCO Emerging Local Bond Fund delivered a total return of over 14% in the initial nine months of 2017, while the iShares Core US Aggregate Bond ETF acquired 3.1% during a similar time span. Investors who need exposure to emerging economies and who will face extra risk challenges do as such through [mutual funds](/mutualfund) or [exchange-traded funds](/etf) (ETFs) that track the performance of a [benchmark index](/benchmark, for example, the emerging markets bond index.

## How the EMBI Is Used

Emerging markets bond indexes are utilized as benchmarks for bond performance in emerging markets. The most well known emerging markets bond indexes are the JP Morgan EMBI+ Index, JP Morgan EMBI Global Index, and JP Morgan EMBI Global Diversified Index. The EMBI+ Index measures [Brady bonds](/bradybonds), which are dollar-designated bonds issued fundamentally by Latin American countries. The EMBI+ likewise incorporates dollar-named loans and [Eurobonds](/eurobond) and develops J.P. Morgan's original Emerging Markets Bond Index (EMBI), which was presented in 1992 when it covered just Brady bonds. Countries in the EMBI+ index are chosen by a sovereign credit rating level. The index is weighted on the basis of the [market capitalization](/marketcapitalization) of government bonds, however it is the sub-index with the best liquidity requirements, so a few markets are excluded. To fit the bill for index membership, the debt must be over one year to maturity, have basically a $500 million outstanding [face value](/facevalue), and meet rigid trading rules to guarantee that pricing shortcomings don't influence the index.

## EMBI+

The JP Morgan EMBI Global Index is an extended adaptation of the EMBI+ Index. The EMBI Global has similar criteria as the EMBI+. In any case, it doesn't choose countries in light of their sovereign credit rating level. All things being equal, the index incorporates a number of higher-evaluated countries through a formula which joins the World Bank-characterized [per capita income](/income-per-capita) brackets and every country's debt-rebuilding history. Subsequently, it is fairly more exhaustive, broader, and, hence, more representative than the EMBI+ Index.

The EMBI Global Diversified limits the loads of countries with larger debt stocks by just including a predefined portion of these countries' eligible current face measures of debt outstanding. The large markets are weighted lower, and the small markets are weighted higher than in the EMBI Global Index.

The J.P. Morgan indexes are a well known benchmark for money managers that deal in emerging market debt so investors might see the index utilized as a comparison for their mutual funds or exchange-traded funds. In light of their higher interest rates, emerging market bonds can fundamentally outperform U.S. [Treasury bonds](/treasurybond). Other emerging bond indexes incorporate Barclays USD Emerging Market GovRIC Cap Index, DB Emerging Market USD Liquid Balanced Index, and Bloomberg USD Emerging Market Sovereign Bond Index.
