# Put Bond
## What Is a Put Bond?

A put bond is a debt instrument that permits the bondholder to force the issuer to repurchase the security at indicated dates before maturity. The repurchase price is set at the time of issue and is typically at[ par value](/parvalue) (the face value of the bond).

## How a Put Bond Works

A bond is a debt instrument that makes periodic interest payments, known as [coupons](/coupon), to investors. At the point when the bond develops, the investors or lenders receive their principal investment valued at par. It is cost-effective for bond issuers to issue bonds with lower yields as this diminishes their [cost of borrowing](/costofdebt). Notwithstanding, to urge investors to acknowledge a lower yield on a bond, an issuer could implant options that are invaluable to bond investors. One type of bond that is positive for investors is the put, or puttable, bond.

A put bond is a bond with a [embedded put option](/embeddedoption), giving bondholders the right, however not the obligation, to demand early repayment of the principal from the issuer or an outsider going about as an agent for the issuer. The put option on the bond can be exercised upon the occurrence of determined occasions or conditions or at a certain time or times prior to maturity. In effect, bondholders have the option of "putting" bonds back to the issuer either once during the lifetime of the bond (known as a one-time put bond) or on several unique dates.

Bondholders can exercise their options on the off chance that interest rate levels in the markets increase. As there is an inverse relationship between interest rates and bond prices, when interest rates increase, the value of a bond diminishes to mirror the way that there are bonds in the market with higher coupon rates than what the investor is holding. At the end of the day, the [future value](/futurevalue) of coupon rates turns out to be less important in a rising interest rate environment. Issuers are forced to repurchase the bonds at par, and investors utilize the proceeds to buy a comparable bond offering a higher yield, a cycle known as [bond swap](/bondswap).

Of course, the special benefits of put bonds mean that some yield must be forfeited. Investors are wiling to acknowledge a lower yield on a put bond than the yield on a [straight bond](/straight-bond) due to the value added by the put option. Similarly, the price of a put bond is consistently higher than the price of a straight bond. While a put bond permits the investor to recover a long-term bond before maturity, the yield generally equals the one on short-term instead of long-term securities.

## Special Considerations for Put Bonds

The terms overseeing a bond and the terms administering the embedded put option, for example, the dates the option can be exercised, are determined in the [bond indenture](/trust_indenture) at time of issuance. The bond might have put protection associated with it, which subtleties the period of time during which the bond can't be "put" to the issuer.

A few types of put bonds incorporate the multi maturity bond, option tender bond, and [variable rate demand obligation](/variable_rate_demand_note) (VRDO).

## Features
- The put option on the bond can be exercised upon the occurrence of determined occasions or conditions or at a certain time or times.
- A put bond is a debt instrument with an embedded option that gives bondholders the right to demand early repayment of the principal from the issuer.
- The embedded put option acts an incentive for investors to buy a bond that has a lower return.
