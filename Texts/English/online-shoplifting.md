# Online Shoplifting
## What Is Online Shoplifting?

Online shoplifting is the theft of goods from an Internet-based merchant. Online shoplifting could appear to be harmless since the shoplifter never communicates with the person in question and executes the fraud with a couple of keystrokes and mouse clicks. It is a crime in any case, and online shoplifters can face serious legal issues, like charges of mail fraud.

## How Online Shoplifting Works

One method for conducting online shoplifting is through the credit card [chargeback](/chargeback) process. A consumer purchases goods online utilizing a credit card, gets the goods, then, at that point, presents a statement to the credit card company claiming that they never received the goods. Subsequently, the credit card company starts a chargeback and powers the merchant to [refund](/refund) the customer's purchase.

Even however the customer has never set foot in the merchant's place of business, they have successfully shoplifted by fraudulently utilizing the chargeback cycle to get goods without paying for them. Furthermore, in the event that a credit card payment processor gets too numerous chargeback requests for a similar company, it might stop working with them. The online merchant then encounters secondary damage from online shoplifting since it can never again acknowledge a certain brand of credit card. This may, thus, reduce sales since the powerlessness to acknowledge that card will fundamentally bother customers.

Honestly, chargebacks themselves are not fraudulent, however when consumers abuse this tool implied for consumer protection, it raises alerts with the two retailers and credit card issuers. On top of the lost merchandise, the **New York Times** reports it can cost up to $40 on average to process a chargeback request.

## Types of Online Shoplifting

One more method for conducting online shoplifting is through piracy. Illegally downloading [copyrighted](/copyright) music, books, or films for free as opposed to purchasing them through genuine channels is a form of online shoplifting that all the while burglarizes the two producers and merchants.

The issue has represented a test for a number of reasons. Consumers of pilfered content need it for free, or if nothing else an exceptionally low cost. Furthermore, media companies frequently lack the resources to answer developing requests for free satisfied; the digital media "hidden world" moves quicker than big businesses, with conglomerates of intelligent programmers and privateers combining efforts across the globe. Thirdly, the expansion of client produced content allows everybody to make and circulate content without even understanding that they are committing copyright infringement en route.

With regards to finding a solution, there is no indisputable evidence or universal set of best practices to keep privateers away. Companies should collect their asset-protection strategies in pieces and pieces to limit losses and guarantee that feedback circles are in place.
