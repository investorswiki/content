# Victor's Curse
## What Is the Winner's Curse?

The champ's curse is a propensity for the triumphant bid in a [auction](/auction) to surpass the [intrinsic value](/intrinsicvalue) or true worth of a thing.

Hypothetically, on the off chance that perfect data was accessible to everybody and all participants were totally rational in their choices and skilled at valuation, a completely [efficient market](/marketefficiency) would exist and no excessive charges or [arbitrage](/arbitrage) opportunities could at any point happen.
