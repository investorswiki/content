# Ethereum Classic (ETC)
## What Is Ethereum Classic (ETC)?

Ethereum Classic (ETC) is a [open-source](/open-source), decentralized, [blockchain](/blockchain)- based distributed [cryptocurrency](/cryptocurrency) platform that runs [smart contracts](/smart-contracts). Ethereum Classic was shaped in 2016 because of a hack of The DAO, a smart contract operating on the [Ethereum](/ethereum) blockchain. The original blockchain was split in two, with the majority of users deciding to reverse the hack and return the taken funds.

The split revealed philosophical divisions inside the Ethereum community. In view of the principle that "Code is Law," a small number of designers and excavators accepted that The DAO's investors ought to endure the side-effects of investing in a flawed project. Nonetheless, the majority of the Ethereum community chose to roll back the blockchain, really making a [bailout](/bailout) for The DAO's investors.

## Grasping Ethereum Classic (ETC)

Ethereum is a [blockchain](/blockchain) platform like bitcoin, with one key difference: as well as recording transactions of value, it can likewise be utilized as a distributed computer to run self-executing [smart contracts](/smart-contracts).

Ethereum Classic works with smart contracts by offering the benefit of decentralized governance. At the end of the day, the contracts can be upheld without an outsider included, like a lawyer. Smart contracts are like in the event that statements, meaning **if** the activities required inside the contract have been satisfied, **then** the answering contract boundaries would be completed. **If** the contract boundaries have not been satisfied, **then** there may be a penalty, a fee, or the contract may be voided, contingent upon the terms laid out at the onset of the contract.

For instance, in a real estate transaction, in the event that the contract stated that an upfront deposit was to be paid on a certain date, and the funds were not received, then the contract could be voided. The smart contracts are held inside a distributed ledger or blockchain network. A [distributed ledger](/distributed-ledgers) is a ledger of transactions and contracts, which are kept and kept up with in a decentralized way across different areas.

The agreement between a buyer and seller is written in lines of code inside the smart contract, which is self-executing, contingent upon the terms inside the contract. Thus, there is no requirement for outside monitoring or controlling by a central authority since the code controls the execution of the contract.

## History of Ethereum Classic

Initially, the Ethereum blockchain was laid out as a single network where transactions were worked with by utilizing the cryptocurrency ether or ETH. The new network immediately became famous for [initial coin offerings](/initial-coin-offering-ico), as various groups utilized the platform to send off their own tokens.

One of the best ICOs was The DAO, a decentralized venture fund where investors would vote on assets to invest in. The DAO immediately accumulated in excess of 11 million ETH, from more than 18,000 investors, before obscure programmers found a smart contract bug permitting them to pull out about 33% of The DAO's accumulated ether.

Due to the scale of the hack, numerous investors proposed turning around the Ethereum blockchain to save the impacted investors, while others contended that doing so would set the precedent for future bailouts. After a quickly organized survey, 97% of the community voted to restore the lost funds through a [hard fork](/hard-fork).

Subsequently, the Ethereum blockchain split into two separate networks. The fresher network inherited the name Ethereum and involves ETH or ether as its cryptocurrency. The more seasoned one, known as Ethereum Classic, utilizes ETC.

## Worries of Ethereum Classic

Albeit both Ethereum and Ethereum Classic offer smart contracts and are after a similar market, Ethereum has acquired in prevalence as the more real of the two networks. Likewise, Ethereum's ETH is second just to Bitcoin as the most significant cryptocurrency network in the world.

One of the chief worries of Ethereum Classic is the potential limitations with regards to scalability. Commonly, the network can handle 15 transactions each second, however that number is undeniably not as much as payment networks, for example, Visa, which handles more than 1,000 transactions each second. In spite of the fact that Ethereum Classic has gone through numerous software overhauls, the scalability of its payment systems stays to be one of its greatest difficulties proceeding.

Likewise, security is probably going to stay an issue with smart contracts, especially since Ethereum Classic has previously encountered a hack and theft of millions of dollars. These worries might actually forestall smart contracts through Ethereum Classic from being utilized in major financial and real estate transactions.

Regulations of the cryptocurrency market keep on creating, which might change how Ethereum Classic — and different networks — work. For instance, the [Security and Exchange Commission](/sec) (SEC) doesn't consider Ethereum or Bitcoin securities due to their decentralized networks.

Without being viewed as a security, some cryptos may have difficulties getting approved for inclusion in different financial products that contain a basket of securities, stocks, and bonds, for example, [exchange traded funds](/etf) and [mutual funds](/mutualfund). Proceeding, uncertainty remains encompassing the regulatory landscape for Ethereum Classic as well as other, less famous blockchain networks.

## Eventual fate of Ethereum Classic

The eventual fate of Ethereum Classic looks less brilliant than Ethereum since Ethereum is viewed as the more genuine of the two networks, particularly with the security worries of Ethereum Classic.

Investors have lost confidence in ETC throughout the years due to hacks into the system, and until ETC can redevelop its code and software to forestall future hacks, Ethereum Classic might have difficulties ahead. Notwithstanding, it is not yet clear the way that the smart contracts will be developed inside the Ethereum Classic project and whether they can be adopted for broad use.

## How Is Ethereum Classic Different from Ethereum?

Despite the fact that Ethereum Classic's ETC has value as a speculative digital asset that investors can trade, Ethereum's ETH is viewed as the more real and widely traded. In mid 2021, the [Chicago Mercantile Exchange](/cme) (CME) approved the trading of ether [futures](/futurescontract). Just Bitcoin and Ether have been approved for such transactions. The futures are [derivative](/derivative) contracts on an underlying security with a fixed price and maturity date. Ether futures permit investors to trade ether for speculation yet in addition to [hedge](/hedge) an outstanding position in ETH or maybe other cryptos.

We can decide how the investment community sees ETC versus ETH by breaking down how much capital or investment dollars are being committed to the two currencies. While contrasting the two market capitalizations of the two cryptos, ETH is the unmistakable victor. The market cap of a cryptocurrency is calculated by duplicating the currency's price — in view of a [fiat currency](/fiatmoney) like U.S. dollars — by the outstanding coins or tokens in circulation.

And so on has 133.9 million coins in circulation with a market capitalization of $6.1 billion while ETH has roughly 120 million in circulation and a market cap of more than $417 billion. And so on trades at $46.00, while ETH trades for more than $3,475 per coin as of April 2, 2022.

Albeit the two networks offer smart contracts, the potential for the previously mentioned security concerns encompassing ETC will probably push investors to invest in ETH and embrace Ethereum's smart contracts versus those of Ethereum's Classic.

## Goals of Ethereum Classic

Since the split, there have been many redesigns and improvements to the Ethereum Classic project. The goal of the project keeps on being working toward turning into a global payment network utilizing smart contracts that can function without centralized governance.

Similarly as with other cryptocurrencies, Ethereum Classic will probably keep on endeavoring to be a [digital store of value](/storeofvalue), meaning it very well may be saved and exchanged while holding its value. The digital store of value for crypto incorporates its purchasing power that can be immediately transformed into cash or used to buy another asset, like money.

**Revision April 2, 2022:** This article has been altered to mirror that The DAO, not Ethereum, was hacked in 2016.

## Features
- Ethereum Classic was originally known as Ethereum. It was brought about by Vitalik Buterin and the Ethereum Foundation and sent off in 2015.
- The dispute caused a split in the Ethereum community, with the majority deciding to reverse the hack. Ethereum Classic is the name of the original, smaller blockchain.
- Ethereum Classic (ETC) is an open-source, decentralized, blockchain-based distributed cryptocurrency platform that runs smart contracts.
- Ethereum Classic was made after The DAO hack in 2016.
