## What's the significance here to Be Long on a Stock or Investment?
The least complex and most common utilization of "long" in investing has to do with non-derivative securities (securities that don't get their value from the price movement of an underlying asset). This type of security addresses direct ownership of an asset — models incorporate stocks, [ETFs](/indexfund), [mutual funds](/mutualfund), [bonds](/bond), and commodities.
Assuming that an investor is long on a stock (or bond, or commodity), it means that they own it, accept it will go up in value, and plan to hold for the long term to exploit this.
Any time a buy-and-hold investor (not a trader) purchases a security, they become long on that security.

The value of a call option goes **up** as the underlying stock goes **up** in price. In this way, in the event that an investor is long on a call option, they own the contract and trust the price of the underlying stock — and thusly the [premium](/option-premium) (value) of the option — will go up. At the end of the day, somebody who is long on a call option is **bullish** about the underlying stock.
For instance, if an individual trusted that the price of [Pepsi](/pep) stock planned to go up, they could start a long call by buying a call option for 100 shares of Pepsi with a strike price equivalent to Pepsi's current stock price that lapses in two months. In the event that Pepsi stock goes up, the option holder could resell the contract for a profit. In this case, the contract's value goes **up** when the stock's value goes **up**.
### On a Put Option

The value of a put option goes **up** as the underlying stock goes **down** in price. In this manner, in the event that an investor is long on a put option, they own the contract and accept the price of the underlying stock will go down, and consequently, the premium (value) of the option will go up. At the end of the day, somebody who is long on a put contract is **bearish** on the underlying stock.
For instance, on the off chance that an individual accepted that the price of Airbnb stock planned to go down, they could start a long put by buying a call option for 100 shares of Airbnb with a strike price equivalent to Airbnb's current stock price that lapses in two months. In the event that Airbnb stock goes down, the option holder could resell the contract for a profit. In this case, the contract's value goes **up** when the stock's value goes **down**.
## What's the significance here to Be Long on a Futures Contract?

At the point when an investor buys a futures contract to lock in the current price of a commodity since they accept the commodity will cost more in what's in store is supposed to be long on that futures contract. For example, assuming a bread company accepted the price of wheat planned to rise over the course of the next six months due to production network issues, they could start a long position by entering a futures contract that guarantees delivery of a certain amount of wheat six months in the future at the present price to ensure they might in any case fabricate bread in the future without expanding their costs.
