# Consistent Ratio Plan
## What Is a Constant Ratio Plan?

A consistent ratio plan (otherwise called "steady mix" or "steady weighting" investing) is a [strategic asset allocation](/strategicassetallocation) strategy, or investment formula, which keeps the aggressive and conservative parts of a portfolio set at a fixed ratio. To keep up with the target asset loads — commonly, between that of stocks and [bonds](/bond) — the portfolio is occasionally [rebalanced ](/rebalancing)by selling outflanking assets and buying failing to meet expectations ones. Hence, [stocks](/stock) are sold on the off chance that they rise quicker than different investments and bought assuming they fall in value more than different investments in the portfolio.

Assuming a portfolio's strategic asset allocation is set to be 60% stocks and 40% bonds, a consistent ratio plan will guarantee that, as markets move, that 60/40 ratio is protected over the long haul.

## The Basics of a Constant Ratio Plan

A consistent ratio plan is an illustration of a long-term [formula investing](/formula_investing) strategy, which doesn't include security analysis and forecasting, or market timing. It can leverage dynamic like management characteristics through systematic rebalancing as per an endorsed formula, as the market rises and falls.

At the point when the genuine ratio varies from the ideal ratio by a predetermined amount, transactions are made to rebalance the portfolio. Steady ratio plans, along with consistent dollar value plans, are like [buy-and-hold](/buyandhold) asset allocation strategies utilized in portfolio management, then again, actually buy-and-hold strategies never rebalance. A steady ratio plan would guarantee that a 70/30 or 80/20 asset allocation (stocks to bonds) stays 70/30 or 80/20 even as markets move.

The cost of these rebalancing transactions lessens investment returns. Yet, steady ratio plans aim to streamline investment returns over a longer [time horizon](/timehorizon) by adjusting the portfolio counter-consistently, and taking profits on speculative stocks that have mobilized firmly.

By selling beating stocks and buying failing to meet expectations ones, steady ratio plans run counter to [momentum investing](/momentum_investing) strategies that sell failing to meet expectations assets and buy outflanking ones. For this reason they work best in unstable markets with a general mean-returning pattern.

There are no rigid rules for timing portfolio rebalancing under strategic or steady weighting asset allocation. Notwithstanding, a common rule of thumb is that the portfolio ought to be rebalanced to its original mix when some random asset class moves more than +/ - 5% from its original target.

## Types of Constant Ratio Plans

Since [capitalization-weighted](/capitalizationweightedindex) indices once in a while overweight overvalued stocks and underweight undervalued ones at the pinnacle of bull markets, some [smart beta exchange-traded funds](/smart-beta-etf) (ETFs) are additionally counter-repeating — targeting factors like momentum, volatility, value, and size — by systematically overweighting or underweighting them.

Smart-beta rebalancing utilizes extra criteria, for example, value defined by performance measures like book value or return on capital, to dispense the holdings across a selection of stocks. This rules-based method of portfolio creation adds a layer of systematic analysis to the investment that simple index investing needs.

## History of Constant Ratio Plans

The steady ratio plan was one of the principal strategies formulated when institutions began to invest essentially in the stock market, during the 1940s. One of the main references to it exists in a July 1947 issue of the **Journal of Business of the University of Chicago.** An article in the October 1949 issue of the **Journal of Business of the University of Chicago** examined the requirement for forecasting in "formula timing plans."
