# Pooled Funds
## What Are Pooled Funds?

Pooled funds are funds in a portfolio from numerous individual investors that are aggregated for the motivations behind investment. Mutual funds, hedge funds, exchange traded funds, [pension funds](/pensionplan), and unit investment trusts are instances of professionally managed pooled funds. Investors in pooled funds benefit from [economies of scale](/economiesofscale), which allow for lower trading costs per dollar of investment, and diversification.

## The Basics of Pooled Funds

Groups, for example, investment clubs, partnerships, and trusts utilize pooled funds to invest in stocks, bonds, and mutual funds. The pooled investment account allows the investors to be treated as a single account holder, empowering them to buy a greater number of shares by and large than they could individually, and frequently for better — limited — costs.

[Mutual funds](/mutualfund) are among the best-known about pooled funds. Actively managed by professionals, except if they are index funds, they spread their holdings across different investment vehicles, decreasing the effect that any single or class of securities has on the overall portfolio. Since mutual funds contain hundreds or thousands of securities, investors are less impacted assuming that one security underperforms.

One more type of pooled fund is the unit investment trust. These pooled funds take money from more modest investors to invest in stocks, bonds, and different securities. In any case, dissimilar to a mutual fund, the unit investment trust doesn't change its portfolio over the life of the fund and invests for a fixed period of time.

### Disadvantages

At the point when money is pooled into a group fund, the individual investor has less control over the group's investment choices than if he were settling on the choices alone. Not all group choices are best for every individual in the group. Likewise, the group must arrive at a consensus before choosing what to purchase. At the point when the market is unstable, taking the time and work to arrive at an agreement can accept away open doors for quick profits or diminishing expected losses.

While investing in a professionally managed fund, an investor surrenders control to the money manager running it. Moreover, he causes extra costs as management fees. Charged annually as a percentage of the assets under management (AUM), fees reduce a fund's total return.

A few mutual funds likewise charge a load or sales charge. Funds will shift on when this fee is charged, however most common are front-end loads — paid at the hour of purchase and back-end loads — paid at the hour of stripping.

An investor will file and pay taxes on fund distributed [capital gains](/capitalgain). These profits are spread uniformly among all investors, in some cases to the detriment of new shareholders who didn't be able to benefit over the long haul from the sold holdings.

Assuming the fund sells holdings frequently, capital gains distributions could happen annually, expanding an investor's taxable income.
