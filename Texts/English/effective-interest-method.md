# Effective Interest Method
## What Is the Effective Interest Method?

The effective interest method is an accounting standard used to amortize, or discount a [bond](/bond). This method is utilized for bonds sold at a discount, where the amount of the bond discount is amortized to [interest expense](/interestexpense) over the bond's life.

The effective interest rate utilizes the [book value](/bookvalue), or the carrying amount of the bond, to work out interest income, and the difference between interest income and the bond's interest payment is the amount of the [accretion](/accretion) or [amortization](/amortization) posted every year.

The effective method can measure up to the [straight-line method](/straightlinebasis).

## Figuring out the Effective Interest Method

The effective interest method becomes possibly the most important factor when bonds are purchased at a discount or premium. Bonds are regularly issued at par or face value of $1,000 and sold in multiples of $1,000. In the event that a bond is purchased at not as much as par, the amount below the par value is the bond discount, and since the bond returns the par amount to the purchaser at maturity, the discount is extra bond income to the buyer.

Likewise, a bond purchased at a price better than expected incorporates a bond premium, and the premium is an extra expense to the bond buyer in light of the fact that the buyer just gets the par amount at maturity.

> For loans, for example, mortgages, the effective interest rate is all the more normally known as the [annual percentage rate](/apr), or APR. The APR accounts for [compound](/compounding) interest plus different costs associated with a loan.

## Effective Interest Method and Accretion

Expect an investor purchases bonds with a $500,000 par value and a [coupon](/coupon) rate of 6%. The bonds are purchased for $377,107, which incorporates a bond discount from par of $122,893. The bond's interest income is calculated as the carrying amount increased by the [at the market](/atthemarket) interest rate, which is the total return earned on the bond given the discount paid and the interest earned. In this case, expect the market interest rate is 10%, which is duplicated by the $377,107 carrying amount to ascertain $37,710 in interest income.

The bond pays annual interest of 6% on a $500,000 par amount, or $30,000, and the difference between the interest paid and interest income, or $7,710, is the amount of the bond discount accretion for year one. The bond accretion for the year is moved into bond income, and the accretion amount is additionally added to the carrying amount, making the new carrying amount of $384,817, which is utilized to ascertain bond accretion for year two. Toward the finish of the 10-year life of the bond, the carrying amount is adjusted up to the $500,000 par amount.

## Considering in Bond Amortization

A bond purchased at a premium generates a bigger [cost of debt](/costofdebt) for the bond buyer, in light of the fact that the premium paid is amortized into bond expense. Expect, in this case, a 4.5%, $100,000 par value bond is purchased for $104,100, which incorporates a $4,100 premium.

The annual interest payment for the bond is $4,500, yet the interest income earned in year one is under $4,500 on the grounds that the bond was purchased at a market rate of just 4%. The real interest income is 4% duplicated by the $104,100 carrying amount, or $4,164, and the premium amortization for year one is $4,500 less $4,164, which equals $336. The amortization of $336 is posted to bond expense, and the amount additionally decreases the carrying amount of the bond.
