On the left, the price is falling and afterward forms a long-legged doji. The price combines and afterward climbs. At last the price can't gain traction, however, and the price falls by and by.

As the price keeps falling it forms another long-legged doji. This is indeed the beginning of a consolidation period. The price breaks over the consolidation and moves higher overall. The long-legged doji didn't cause the reversal, however it foreshadowed the consolidation or indecision present in the market before the reversal higher.

On the right, the price falls and combines. The long-legged doji forms after the consolidation, dropping somewhat below the consolidation low however at that point energizing to close inside the consolidation. The price then broke higher. This doji had a marginally bigger [real body](/realbody).
