## Instructions to Calculate the Pretax Rate of Return

The pretax rate of return is calculated as the [after-tax rate of return](/after_tax_return) separated by one, minus the tax rate.

## What Does the Pretax Rate of Return Tell You?

The pretax rate of return is the gain or loss on an investment before taxes are considered. The government applies investment taxes on extra income earned from holding or selling investments.

[Capital gains taxes](/capital_gains_tax) are applied to securities sold for a profit. Dividends received from stock and interest earned on [bonds](/bond) are likewise taxed toward the finish of a given year. Since dividends on stocks might be taxed at an alternate level from interest income or capital gains, for instance, the pretax rate of return empowers comparisons to be made across various asset classes. While the pretax rate of return is an effective comparison device, it is the after-tax rate return that is generally important to investors.

## Illustration of How to Use the Pretax Rate of Return

For instance, expect an individual accomplishes a 4.25% after-tax rate of return for stock ABC and is subject to a capital gains tax of 15%. The pretax rate of return is in this way 5%, or 4.25%/(1 - 15%).

For a tax-free investment, the pretax and after-tax rates of return are something similar. Assume that a [municipal bond](/municipalbond), bond XYZ, that is [tax-exempt](/tax_exempt) likewise has a pretax return of 4.25%. Bond XYZ, consequently, would have a similar after-tax rate of return as stock ABC.

In this case, an investor might pick the municipal bond in light of its greater degree of safety and the way that its after-tax return is equivalent to that of the more unstable stock, regardless of the last option having a higher pretax rate of return.

As a rule, the pretax rate of return is equivalent to the [rate of return](/rateofreturn). Think about Amazon, where possessing the stock for 2018 would have generated a return of 28.4% — that is the pretax return and rate of return. Presently, in the event that an investor had calculated the after-tax rate of return for their Amazon return utilizing a 15% capital gains tax rate, it would be 24.14%. Assuming that we just had the tax rate and after-tax return, we'd compute the pretax return with the formula 24.14%/(1 - 15%).

## Pretax versus After-Tax Returns

While pretax rates of return are the returns most frequently shown or calculated, organizations and top level salary investors are still extremely interested in after-tax returns. This comes as the tax rate can seriously affect their navigation — from what to invest in during the time period they hold the investment for.

After-tax returns consider taxes — prominently, capital gains taxes — while pretax doesn't. The rate of return ordinarily isn't shown as an after-tax figure given the way that every investor's tax situation will change.

## Limitations of Using the Pretax Rate of Return

The pretax return is decently handily calculated and most frequently what's shown while dissecting an investment — whether it be a mutual fund, ETF, bond, or individual stock. Notwithstanding, it leaves out the way that taxes in all likelihood should be paid on any earnings or gains received as part of the investment.
