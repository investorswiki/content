# Bitcoin Maximalism
## What Is a Bitcoin Maximalism?

Bitcoin maximalists trust that [Bitcoin](/bitcoin), which is the world's most famous [cryptocurrency](/cryptocurrency), is the main digital necessary asset later on. Maximalists accept that any remaining [digital currencies](/virtual-currency) are inferior to Bitcoin. The maximalist philosophy holds the view that other cryptocurrencies are not in accordance with the beliefs that were laid out by the pseudonymous [Satoshi Nakamoto](/satoshi-nakamoto), who made Bitcoin in 2009.

Bitcoin is not normal for government-issued currencies, called [fiat currencies](/fiatmoney), which are managed by a centralized authority. All things being equal, Bitcoin is decentralized and its [blockchain](/blockchain) is a publicly distributed ledger, meaning the transactions are shared with participants and transparent.

In any case, regardless of Bitcoin's ubiquity as a vigorously traded digital asset, it has likewise prompted the creation of numerous other cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin maximalists trust that these other cryptocurrencies — called [altcoins](/altcoin) — are pointless and inferior.

## Grasping Bitcoin Maximalism

Despite the fact that Bitcoin might not have been the absolute first endeavor at a decentralized cryptocurrency, it has undeniably been the best hitherto. Bitcoin maximalists hold the conviction that the Bitcoin network will give all that investors need in a digital currency later on. Along these lines, maximalists are proudly for (or if nothing else in agreement about the certainty of) a Bitcoin [monopoly](/monopoly) sooner or later.

[Ethereum](/ethereum) designer Vitalik Buterin remarked on the possibility of Bitcoin maximalism in 2014. Buterin depicted Bitcoin maximalism as "Bitcoin dominance maximalism." Buterin proceeded to portray the perspective on maximalists.

> The possibility that an environment of different contending cryptocurrencies is unfortunate, that it is inappropriate to send off 'one more coin,' and that it is both exemplary and unavoidable that the Bitcoin currency comes to take a monopoly position in the cryptocurrency scene.

Buterin recognized the maximalist philosophy thusly:

>
> A simple craving to support Bitcoin and improve it; such inspirations are irrefutably beneficial...rather a position building something on bitcoin is the main right method for getting things done and that doing anything more is deceptive. Bitcoin maximalists frequently use "network impacts" as a contention, and claim that there is no point in fighting against them.

### Bitcoin's Blockchain

The [distributed ledger](/distributed-ledgers) technology is at the core of Bitcoin's blockchain network. The distributed ledger is beneficial since it permits the sharing of transactions by sending recorded duplicates of the data to participants inside the shared network. Subsequently, this transparency assists with expanding security and prevent fraud. In the event that a troublemaker changes one portion of the blockchain, different participants who have duplicates of the original transactions can figure out what was changed by the fraudster and restore the genuine transaction.

Be that as it may, Bitcoin's (BTC) notoriety has introduced the age of cryptocurrencies leading to the creation of many other digital currencies. A large number of these cryptocurrencies are worked from the essential Bitcoin structure here and there or another, while other digital currencies are based on blockchain technology however not really on Bitcoin's network specifically. As such, the distributed ledger of Bitcoin has been modified with the goal that it very well may be utilized for different purposes and not only a peer-to-peer cash payment system as was originally expected.

### Modified Blockchains

The rising fame of blockchain technology has given rise to modified forms of Bitcoin's distributed ledger called private blockchains. Companies and governments can make private blockchain networks in which just a select number of participants are permitted access to the network whenever they've been checked or validated.

These private blockchains can be permissioned or semi-permissioned networks, which permit a combination of both public and private characteristics. Inside these networks, there are designated authorizations conceded to certain participants permitting them to perform just specific activities on the network. The network could likewise impose limitations on which capabilities are permitted by participants, for example, read-just and altering access. An illustration of a semi-private blockchain network would be a neighborhood government that permits certain taxpayers and businesses access to legal titles and record-keeping while at the same time limiting access to those records for the overall population.

While public blockchains are decentralized, meaning they have no centralized authority with oversight power, private blockchains have a centralized entity, for example, a government or business, that manages and controls the network.

Since Bitcoin maximalists accept that decentralization is a key characteristic of Bitcoin's blockchain network. The utilization of private, semi-private, and permissioned blockchains runs in opposition to the reasons for cryptocurrencies in that they ought to be open, transparent, and have no centralized governance.

## Purposes behind Bitcoin Maximalism

The maximalists are a vocal group of Bitcoin supporters that back Bitcoin over any remaining digital currencies. Below are a portion of the justifications for why maximalists accept Bitcoin will deliver any remaining cryptos inadequate.

### Bitcoin's Network

Numerous Bitcoin maximalists today support the possibility that the outcome of a digital currency is dependent upon the underlying blockchain network. It is common to hear the possibility that, albeit other digital currencies might offer changes upon the original Bitcoin premise, which are intended to address issues inherent in the Bitcoin network, the ultimate marker of progress is the length and strength of a blockchain. Since Bitcoin's underlying network is however strong as it seems to be, the thinking goes, and on the grounds that elements of a specific digital currency can be unreservedly co-opted by another digital currency, the network itself is the main factor.

Maximalists might point to the dominance of Bitcoin and [Bitcoin cash](/bitcoin-cash) in the list of competitors of digital currencies by [market cap](/marketcapitalization) as evidence of this principle. Bitcoin cash and Bitcoin gold have limited highlights in comparison with numerous more up to date altcoins. Be that as it may, the altcoins keep a higher value as a result of their association with the Bitcoin network. The wealth, the size of the client base, and the history of achievement are highlights, which set the Bitcoin network separated from other blockchains.

### Bitcoin Is Well-Established

One more contention for the maximalist point of view is the principle that new financial instruments must face a high barrier to building investor trust. Even as digital currencies have become dramatically more famous, there are as yet many major financial institutions and individual investors that like to withdraw from the market.

Bitcoin maximalists accept that the method involved with coordinating digital currencies completely into the world of mainstream finance and it be a sluggish one to contribute will. Subsequently, untouchables are probably going to pay the most careful thoughtfulness regarding the most established, generally well known, and most settled networks. On account of digital currencies, the most settled is Bitcoin.

With many new, untested digital currencies emerging, Bitcoin enjoys a strong benefit in that it has proven dependability and achievement. At the point when other cryptocurrency networks experience the ill effects of hacks or other negative publicity, Bitcoin maximalists will generally consider this to be additional evidence in support of their contention.

### Bitcoin's Trading Influence on Altcoins

A last contention for the maximalist philosophy includes to do with diversification inside a cryptocurrency or more extensive portfolio. Since the price of Bitcoin will in general influence the price of the altcoin world all the more extensively, investing in altcoins might be a sketchy approach to differentiating one's cryptocurrency holdings.

The contention then follows that investors would be better off investing in a best-of-breed asset, like Bitcoin, rather than gambling with their money by investing in different coins or tokens. In any case, Bitcoin's rise in price has not generally driven altcoins higher however maximalists could contend that is due to the inferior quality of altcoins.

## Worries About Bitcoin Maximalism

Bitcoin maximalism has its obstacles to survive assuming Bitcoin is to turn into the main digital currency. Large numbers of the altcoins and the subsequent varieties of blockchain networks have appeared due to the limitations of the Bitcoin network and its cryptocurrency. A portion of the difficulties and limitations of Bitcoin incorporate the accompanying:

### Scalability
Cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin utilize a [proof-of-work](/evidence work) (PoW) interaction to check transactions done on the blockchain. The people who are responsible for confirming the transactions and guaranteeing that they're accurate are called excavators. Diggers act as the auditors of the network by checking the authenticity of the transactions and assist with preventing fraud.

As new transactions are added to the blockchain, duplicates are shipped off the hubs, which are all the participants and computers on the network. Nonetheless, as Bitcoin's fame develops, so too does the volume of transactions. Assuming that we think of a blockchain network as a shared database, the more data that is added, the more the system gets stalled leading to latency.

Thus, a colossal amount of energy is expected to handle the developing volume of transactions. For instance, the amount of power expected to secure the Bitcoin blockchain is getting enormous to the point that, starting around 2021, it surpasses the total amount of energy consumption of the country of Pakistan.

The latency or gradualness inside Bitcoin's blockchain is preventing the scalability of the cryptocurrency. All in all, Bitcoin's [scalability](/scalability) issue is preventing it from being accepted for broad use for financial transactions since it can't handle the volume. Subsequently, other blockchain networks and their cryptocurrencies are required, which pokes a hole in the Bitcoin maximalist philosophy.

### Trading Volatility

One more test to Bitcoin turning into a broadly utilized method of payment is that the cryptocurrency's price vacillates too fiercely — called volatility. In the event that the price vacillates too fiercely, it makes it challenging for companies and individuals to utilize crypto as a [medium of exchange](/mediumofexchange) for everyday business transactions.

### Smart Contracts

In the early years, Bitcoin was limited in its usage and didn't give systems to building [smart contracts](/smart-contracts) and decentralized applications (dApps), which other blockchains are specifically intended to support. A smart contract is a self-executing contract that contains the terms of an agreement between a buyer and a seller, which is written in computer code. The digital code controls the terms and the execution of the transaction.

Smart contracts permit transactions to be finished between two gatherings, like the purchase or sale of an automobile. Accordingly, there is no centralized authority required since the contract is just executable assuming the two players perform the duties required in the contract.

Smart contracts, which are utilized in the Ethereum blockchain network, have acquired notoriety inside the financial sector. In spite of the fact that Bitcoin's blockchain network has increased its capability by offering smart contracts, it lags behind Ethereum for financial transactions.

### Alternative Blockchains

Throughout the course of recent years, blockchain networks have been laid out by businesses and industries. These alternative blockchain networks don't be guaranteed to require the cryptocurrencies that are commonly traded today. All things being equal, these businesses are making their own networks and cryptocurrencies to be utilized privately by a specific group of participants.

For instance, a banking group, drove by the Union Bank of Switzerland (UBS), has developed a sandbox, which permits them to investigate the purposes of blockchain technology for payments inside the financial sector. In doing as such, UBS — in partnership with other large banks — made its own cryptocurrency called the Utility Settlement Coin (USC) and known as the Fnality project.

The USC would operate in a manner that is like cash since it very well may be switched on a one-over completely to one basis into a fiat currency, like the U.S. dollar. The USC would likewise be backed by a central bank, which is as an unmistakable difference to Bitcoin's cryptocurrency. As such, the financial sector has avoided Bitcoin's blockchain and cryptocurrency by making its own network, which can be utilized for payments between customers, businesses, and for bank-to-bank transfers.

## Eventual fate of Bitcoin Maximalism

Bitcoin maximalists would claim that any issues with the Bitcoin blockchain can be addressed and are presently in development. Whether governments, companies, and investors opt for Bitcoin's blockchain versus the numerous different options will probably decide if Bitcoin maximalists will win out eventually. Notwithstanding, given the investment in different networks and cryptos, it's seeming to be there will be numerous other cryptocurrencies long into the future.

## Highlights
- Bitcoin maximalists would almost certainly contend that Bitcoin's deficiencies can be settled, however the investment in alternative blockchains keeps on developing.
- Bitcoin maximalists accept that Bitcoin is the main digital necessary asset later on.
- Bitcoin maximalists accept that any remaining digital currencies are inferior to Bitcoin.
- Notwithstanding, Bitcoin's scalability issue has prompted the development of other blockchain networks that can handle an increased volume of transactions.
