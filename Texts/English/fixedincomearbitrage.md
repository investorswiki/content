# Fixed-Income Arbitrage
## What Is Fixed-Income Arbitrage?

Fixed-income arbitrage is an investment strategy that endeavors to profit from pricing differences in different bonds or other interest-rate securities.

## Understanding Fixed-Income Arbitrage

While utilizing a fixed-income arbitrage strategy, the investor expects restricting positions in the market to exploit small price errors while restricting interest rate risk. Fixed-income arbitrage is a [market-neutral strategy](/marketneutral), implying that it is intended to profit whether or not the overall bond market will trend higher or lower from here on out.

Fixed-income arbitrage is fundamentally utilized by hedge funds and investment banks. These funds watch a scope of fixed-income instruments, including [mortgage-backed securities](/mbs) (MBS), government bonds, corporate bonds, municipal bonds, and, surprisingly, more complex instruments like [credit default swaps](/creditdefaultswap) (CDS). At the point when there are indications of mispricing in the equivalent or comparative issues, fixed-income arbitrage funds take leveraged [long](/long) and [short](/short) positions to profit while the pricing is remedied in the market.

The strategy remembers taking a short position for the issue that has all the earmarks of being overpriced and a long position on the security that is underpriced. The expectation is that the gap between these prices should close and even if the two of them go up or down, they ought to draw generally nearer to each other.

The two principal challenges in this strategy incorporate, first, the requirement for these securities to be adequately liquid, and second, that the fixed-income securities picked for arbitrage are adequately comparable in nature. Without these two conditions, traders will find it hard to profit from a convenient limiting of the price difference.

Even simple fixed-income arbitrage trades carry risks. Contingent upon the type of fixed-income security, the opportunity of market pricing really being in mistake relies vigorously upon the model being utilized to assess the instruments. Models, particularly those dealing with bonds issued by companies and creating economies, can be off-base and have been so in the past.

Numerous investors actually recall the collapse of [Long-Term Capital Management](/longtermcapital) (LTCM), which was a leading fund in rehearsing fixed-income arbitrage. This association with LTCM makes sense of the strategy's standing as picking up nickels in front of a steamroller: the returns are small and the risks can pound.

As the returns made from closing these pricing gaps are small, fixed-income arbitrage is a strategy for very much capitalized institutional investors. The amounts of leverage required to make the trades significant are not accessible to individual investors.

Funds that utilize fixed-income arbitrage generally brand it as a capital preservation strategy. Notwithstanding the amount of capital expected to perform fixed-income arbitrage, there is another hurdle facing anybody endeavoring this type of investment. As more capital is dedicated to finding and profiting from fixed-income arbitrage, opportunities become more diligently to find, smaller in size, and shorter in duration.

Be that as it may, the market rarely keeps an optimal level of anything for a really long time, so fixed-income arbitrage swings between periods where it is underused and profoundly profitable to being abused and barely profitable.

## Fixed-Income Arbitrage and Swap-Spread Arbitrage

A portion of the strategies alluded to in easygoing communication as fixed-income arbitrage may not really fit the definition of a pure arbitrage trade — one that looks to take advantage of an almost riskless trade in view of simple mathematical differences. Generally, such pure arbitrage opportunities are incredibly rare. A more normal form of fixed-income arbitrage centers around impermanent pricing misalignments that happen normally in any market system.

A common illustration of a fixed-income arbitrage strategy that doesn't fit the form of pure arbitrage is swap-spread arbitrage. In this trade, the investor takes up positions in an interest rate swap, a Treasury bond, and a [repo rate](/implied_repo_rate) to profit on the difference between the swap spread — the spread between the fixed swap rate and the coupon rate of the Treasury par bond — and the floating spread, which is the difference between a floating rate, like [LIBOR](/libor), and the repo rate. On the off chance that the two rates join or even reverse from their historical trends, the arbitrager takes losses that are amplified by the leverage used to make the trade.
