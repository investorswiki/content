# Unemployment Claim
## What Is an Unemployment Claim?

The term unemployment claim alludes to the request for cash benefits made by an individual after they are laid off from their job. Claims are filed through state governments for brief payments after individuals lose their jobs through no shortcoming of their own.

The United States Department of Labor (DOL) tracks the number of weekly unemployment claims. It gives both seasonally adjusted and seasonally unadjusted claims numbers and furthermore records increments or diminishes of at least 1,000 claims by state. This information is reported in the media as an indication of national and state economic wellbeing.

## Understanding Unemployment Claims

Unemployment claims are paid from state funds that are collected from employers as an unemployment insurance tax. Unemployment benefits are payable for a limited number of weeks and are intended to supplant about half of a worker's previous wages. Most states give as long as 26 weeks of benefits for unemployed individuals.

Individuals are required to file unemployment claims with the UI program in the state where they worked. Claims might be filed in person, online, or via telephone depending on the state. When a claim is filed, the following information must be given:

- Social Security number
- Contact information
- Insights concerning the former work

Workers must likewise meet certain criteria to be eligible for claims. They must be actual employees of the business, getting W-2 forms at year-end — not independent contractors or specialists.

The initial date of an unemployment claim determines the benefit year during which claimants might file weekly claims as well as the base period of the claim. The base period determines the wages used to register the weekly and maximum benefit sums and for which employers will have potential [chargeback](/chargeback) or [reimbursement](/reimbursement) liability for any benefits paid to the claimant. Just base period employers are part of an unemployment claim. Non-base period employers have no such liability.

## Special Considerations

The time you file an unemployment claim is vital. Consider, for instance, an employer that recruits an employee in March and allows that individual to pursue 30 days.

Assuming the claimant files an initial claim before April 1, the base period would exclude the first quarter of that year (the quarter in progress), nor the fourth quarter of the previous year (the lag quarter). It actually comprises of the fourth quarter of the year before the year going before the current year, and the first 3/4 of the year going before the current year. However, since the employer didn't report wages during that base period, it will have no financial association in the claim.

A similar applies assuming the claimant waited until April, May, or June to file the initial claim — in that case, the base period would preclude the second quarter of the current year, the first quarter of the current year, and comprise of the four quarters of the previous year.

In the event that the ex-employee files an initial claim after June 30 of the current year, then, at that point, the employer could be a base period employer, yet its chargeback liability would be limited due to having paid just 30 days' worth of wages.
