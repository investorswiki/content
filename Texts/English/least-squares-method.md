# Least Squares Method
## What Is the Least Squares Method?

The [least squares](/least-squares) method is a form of mathematical regression analysis used to determine the [line of best fit](/line-of-best-fit) for a set of data, giving a visual show of the relationship between the data points. Each point of data addresses the relationship between a known independent variable and an obscure dependent variable.

## Figuring out the Least Squares Method

This method of [regression](/regression) analysis starts with a set of data points to be plotted on a x-and y-pivot graph. An analyst utilizing the least squares method will create a line of best fit that makes sense of the likely relationship among independent and dependent variables.

The least squares method gives the overall reasoning to the placement of the line of best fit among the data points being examined. The most common application of this method, which is some of the time alluded to as "linear" or "normal," means to make a straight line that limits the sum of the squares of the errors that are created by the consequences of the associated equations, for example, the squared residuals coming about because of differences in the noticed value, and the value anticipated, in light of that model.

### The Line of Best Fit Equation

The line of best fit determined from the least squares method has an equation that recounts the story of the relationship between the data points. Line of best fit equations might be determined by computer software models, which incorporate a summary of results for analysis, where the coefficients and summary results make sense of the reliance of the variables being tried.

### Least Squares Regression Line

Assuming the data shows a more streamlined relationship between two variables, the line that best fits this linear relationship is known as a least-squares regression line, which limits the vertical separation from the data points to the regression line. The term "least squares" is utilized in light of the fact that it is the littlest sum of squares of errors, which is additionally called the "difference."

In regression analysis, dependent variables are delineated on the vertical y-pivot, while independent variables are represented on the horizontal x-hub. These assignments will form the equation for the line of best fit, which is determined from the least squares method.

As opposed to a linear problem, a non-linear least-squares problem has no closed solution and is generally tackled by emphasis. Carl Friedrich Gauss claims to have first found the least-squares method in 1795 — albeit the discussion over who concocted the method remains.

## Illustration of the Least Squares Method

An illustration of the least squares method is an analyst who wishes to test the relationship between a company's stock returns, and the returns of the index for which the stock is a part. In this model, the analyst tries to test the reliance of the stock returns on the index returns.

To accomplish this, the returns are all plotted on a chart. The index returns are then designated as the independent variable, and the stock returns are the dependent variable. The line of best fit gives the analyst coefficients making sense of the level of reliance.

## Features
- Least squares regression is utilized to anticipate the behavior of dependent variables.
- The least squares method is a statistical technique to find the best fit for a set of data points by limiting the sum of the offsets or residuals of points from the plotted curve.
- The least squares method gives the overall reasoning to the placement of the line of best fit among the data points being contemplated.
## FAQ
### What Is the Least Squares Method?
The least squares method is a mathematical technique that permits the analyst to determine the best approach to fitting a curve on top of a chart of data points. It is widely used to make dissipate plots more straightforward to decipher and is associated with [regression analysis](/regression). Nowadays, the least squares method can be utilized as part of most statistical software programs.
### What Is an Example of the Least Squares Method?
To outline, consider the case of an investor thinking about whether to invest in a gold mining company. The investor could wish to know how sensitive the company's stock price is to changes in the market price of gold. To study this, the investor could utilize the least squares method to trace the relationship between those two variables over the long run onto a dissipate plot. This analysis could assist the investor with anticipating the degree to which the stock's price would almost certainly rise or fall for some random increase or reduction in the price of gold.
### How Is the Least Squares Method Used in Finance?
The least squares method is utilized in a wide assortment of fields, including finance and investing. For financial analysts, the method can assist with evaluating the relationship between at least two variables —, for example, a stock's share price and its [earnings per share](/eps) (EPS). By performing this type of analysis investors frequently try to anticipate the future behavior of stock prices or different factors.
