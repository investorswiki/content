# SEC Form 8A12BEF
## What Was SEC Form 8A12BEF?

SEC form 8A12BEF was utilized for enrolling listed bonds with the [Securities and Exchange Commission](/sec) (SEC) under Section 12(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.

The form has since been replaced by [Form 8-A12B](/sec-form-8-a12b), which is available for download on the website of the Securities and Exchange Commission.

## Understanding SEC Form 8A12BEF

SEC form 8A12BEF was required when a company wished to issue bonds that would be traded on a public exchange.

The form became effective automatically after filing, thus the "EF" in Form 8A12BEF.

Companies presently use Form 8-A12B when they are preparing to issue any type of security, whether it is debt or equity.

Issuers of bonds must give details, for example, the interest rate to be paid and the maturity date.

The "EF" was dropped from Form 8A12B as the option to have the filing be effective immediately or sooner or later was taken out.

> Rule 12(b) of the [Securities Exchange Act of 1934](/seact1934) states that when an issuer records for the registration of securities, the issuer must give detailed information about the issuer and offering.

Note that the Toll Brothers filing also rattles off the details of the offering. Toll Brothers was enrolling senior subordinated notes due in 2006 paying 8.75% interest, which would trade on the [New York Stock Exchange](/nyse) (NYSE).

As another example, here is a DTE Energy filing that was recorded with the more up to date Form 8-A12B. Again, it's a Form 8-A that has certain designations or classifications that make it this specific form. On account of DTE Energy, it's a Form 8-A with the 12b designation checked, and that means the form "relates to the registration of a class of securities pursuant to Section 12(b) of the Exchange Act."
