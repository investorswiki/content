# Gross Dividends
## What Are Gross Dividends?

Comparative in concept to gross income, gross dividends are the sum total of all dividends received by an investor for tax purposes. Gross dividends incorporate all [ordinary dividends](/ordinary-dividends) that are paid, plus capital-gains distributions and [nontaxable distributions](/nontaxable-dispersion) received by the taxpayer during the prior year taxes, fees, and expenses are deducted.

Gross dividends can be stood out from net dividends.

## Grasping Gross Dividends

More often than not, gross dividends paid to American investors are reported on IRS [Form 1099-DIV](/form1099div). Ordinary dividends are reported in Box 1a, while different types of dividend income are listed somewhere else. All dividends are viewed as ordinary except if they are explicitly classified as [qualified dividends](/qualifieddividend). Box 1b is designated for reporting qualified dividends, which shows the portion of the amount in Box 1a that might be eligible for decreased capital gains rates. Box 3 shows non-dividend distributions.

A 1099-DIV is required to be shipped off any individual who has received dividends (counting capital gain dividends and exempt-interest dividends) and different distributions on stock of ten bucks or more, or on the other hand on the off chance that funds were kept to pay foreign tax on dividends and different distributions on stock over a given year. Not all dividend income reported on the 1099-DIV is reported on Schedule B.

In numerous countries, income from dividends is treated at a more ideal tax rate than ordinary income. Investors might shift focus over to dividend-paying stocks to exploit possibly better tax conditions. The amount of tax owed on dividends relies upon overall income and whether the dividends are qualified or nonqualified.

## Illustration of a Gross Dividend Versus a Net Dividend

For instance, suppose that company ABCXYZ chooses to issue a dividend of $1.20 to its shareholders. This means for each share owned, the company pays $1.20 in dividends. In the event that a shareholder-owned 1,000 shares, they would receive an annual payout of $1,200 in gross dividends. Companies in the U.S. regularly pay quarterly dividends, while non-U.S. companies generally pay annual or semi-annual dividends.

On the off chance that the dividend was viewed as an ordinary one and taxed at a rate of 35%, with another 2% going toward fees and expenses, the net dividend would really be $756. On the off chance that the dividend was a qualified one all things considered, with a decreased tax rate of 15%, the net dividend would really be $996.
