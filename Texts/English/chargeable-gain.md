Assuming the assets being referred to meet all requirements for [capital allowances](/capital-allowance), any loss asserted against the chargeable gain would likewise be reduced by value stemming from the capital allowances. For example, assuming an asset that was acquired for 7,000 British pounds could create 2,000 British pounds in capital allowance while it was owned. At the point when the asset is subsequently sold, for instance, for 3,000 British pounds, the company would just record 2,000 British pounds as the capital loss.
