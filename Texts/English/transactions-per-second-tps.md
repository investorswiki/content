# Transactions Per Second (TPS)
With regards to blockchains, transactions each second (TPS) alludes to the number of transactions that a network is fit for processing each second.
The rough average TPS of the Bitcoin blockchain is around 5 - however this might differ on occasion. Ethereum, interestingly, can handle generally double that amount.
The development of innovations that increase the transaction rate of blockchains has been an important area of research throughout the long term. These decentralized networks present totally new moves in terms of their ability to scale for increased demand.
This challenge isn't simply about expanding TPS. Centralized databases are as of now fit for taking care of thousands of transactions each second. VISA, for instance, handles around 1,500-2000 transactions each second. So why not just utilize these arrangements? Indeed, the principal problem is that Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other blockchains aim to rival that while as yet keeping a high degree of decentralization.
Decentralization comes at the cost of performance and security. In this way, these scalability arrangements not just have to increase the performance of the network in any case, simultaneously, likewise keep up with the wide range of various advantageous properties of blockchain. In any case, blockchain isn't actually anything over an inefficient database.
It's important to note that if a blockchain has high TPS, it isn't really better than other blockchains with lower TPS. Numerous blockchain projects brag about their high TPS numbers. Notwithstanding, it's close to 100% sure that such performance was accomplished by forfeiting other important parts of the network. For instance, out of nowhere, Bitcoin has great many hubs distributed across the globe running the Bitcoin software. A blockchain with just 10-20 hubs could undoubtedly outperform Bitcoin, yet it could barely be called decentralized or even distributed.
