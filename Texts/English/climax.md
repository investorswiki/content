# Climax
## What Is a Climax?

A climax happens toward the finish of a [bull](/bullmarket) or [bear](/bearmarket) market cycle and is described by raised trading volume and sharp price developments. Climaxes are generally gone before by extreme sentiment readings, either inordinate elation at market tops, or unnecessary cynicism at market bottoms.

## Grasping Climax

Climaxes frequently happen toward the finish of bull or bear cycles. Investors become complacent to the risks inherent in markets and accept strongly that the trend by and by in place won't reverse course in the close to term. More limited term climaxes might be the consequence of new declarations or improvements pushing a value higher than ever.

Basically, climaxes are a consequence of supply and demand factors. They happen from a last surge of investors who buy into a rising market or sell into a declining market. In the two circumstances, a climax for the most part flags the finish of a strong bullish or bearish market trend.

## Buying Climaxes

One of the clearest signs of the finish of a [bull market](/bullmarket) is a buying climax, during which volume heightens to extreme levels and bullish happiness saturates media coverage of stocks, market indices, or commodities. The key characteristic of a buying climax is the exhaustion of demand as the last buyers enter the market. The last flood of buying normally prompts price spikes, which might last for days, weeks, or months. As demand winds down, buyers become less able to pay higher prices. There might be a concise period of stagnation in prices before a combination of profit-taking and new sellers set moving the beginning of a sharp reversal.

The finish of the [tech bubble](/tech_bubble) in the year 2000 is a prime illustration of a buying climax. Starting in November 1999, the [NASDAQ Composite](/nasdaq) acquired 39% en route to its buying climax high of 7,275.17 in February 2000. During this time period, the index saw consistently expanding volume in light of elation over the New Economy. Throughout the following months ending in September 2002, the index declined by 76%.

## Selling Climaxes

The beginning of a selling climax is much of the time announced consistently expanding volume on the sell side of the market as developing cynicism speeds up the [downtrend](/downtrend). As the selling climax draws near, the last buyers at long last give in, driving shares pointedly lower. When the supply side of the market subsides, demand at support levels can make the price level off before a combination of profit-taking and new buyers set moving the beginning of a sharp reversal.

A rebound in oil prices in mid 2016 is an illustration of a selling climax. Subsequent to making a high in June 2014, oil prices declined consistently for a long time, capped by a selling climax in January 2016. Subsequent to making its selling climax low of $26.68 per barrel on Jan. 20, 2016, oil prices valued by 80% over the following four months.
