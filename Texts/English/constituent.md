## What Is a Constituent?

A constituent is a company whose shares are part of an index like the [S&P 500 ](/sp500)or [Dow Jones Industrial Average](/djia) (DJIA). It is a component or a member of a [index](/index). The weighted aggregation of the share prices of every one of its constituents is utilized to work out the value of an index.

Every constituent must commonly need to meet certain requirements relating to [market capitalization](/marketcapitalization), [market exposure](/marketexposure), and [liquidity](/liquidity) before being added to an index.

## Grasping Constituents

Individual constituents make up the market indexes in the United States, including the Dow Jones Industrial Average, the S&P 500, the [Nasdaq Composite Index](/nasdaqcompositeindex), and the [NYSE Composite Index](/nysecompositeindex), among several others, The Dow Jones Industrial Average, for instance, consists of shares of thirty large companies. It traces all the way back to 1896. In any case, Charles Dow made the primary index — around then, it was a simple average of stock prices — in 1884 when he distributed the Dow Jones Railroad Average, which is today known as the Dow Jones Transportation Average.

Indexes serve a number of important capabilities, including tracking the performance of particular markets or sectors of the stock market or economy and furnishing investors and portfolio managers with [benchmarks](/benchmark) to assess their own performance. For investors in the stock market, the S&P 500 Index is considered the benchmark for relative performance and a fund manager that consistently outflanks the index is "beating the market."

By getting access into a market index, a constituent stock or company gets the benefit of increased exposure and a certain amount of credibility. It can likewise help the share price since there are numerous [passive index funds](/indexfund) that endeavor to follow the S&P 500 and different indexes. At the point when a company becomes a constituent, these funds must buy shares and the buying demand can make a [S&P 500 phenomenon](/spphenomenon) called the index effect.

## Requirements of Constituents

Criteria for being a constituent of a market index fluctuate starting with one index then onto the next. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is comprised of notable companies, traversing across numerous industries, with every constituent having a weight on the overall index proportional to its price. A committee at Dow Jones figures out who comes and goes inside the industrial average.

While the Dow is a price-weighted index, different indexes are some of the time made in an unexpected way. There are three general methods for building an index:

- **Price-weighted indexes** give greater weight to the share price of every constituent.
- **Market value-weighted indexes** give more weight to the size or market capitalization of every constituent.
- **Equivalent weighted indexes** treat all members the equivalent, regardless of price or market cap.

The Nasdaq Composite Index and New York Composite Index track the performance of all equities listed on each stock exchange. The weight that every individual constituent has on the overall index depends on market capitalization, with both the price return and [dividend yield](/dividendyield) of every constituent considering into developments of the index. The S&P 500 is one more illustration of a market value-weighted index and the largest companies biggestly affect its performance.

## Model: The Dow 30

The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA), otherwise called the Dow 30, is a stock market index that tracks 30 large, freely possessed [blue-chip](/bluechip) companies trading on the New York Stock Exchange and the NASDAQ. The index is much of the time reconsidered to supplant companies that presently not meet the listing criteria with those that do.

For example, on Aug. 24, 2020, Salesforce.com, Amgen, and Honeywell were added to the Dow, as constituents, supplanting ExxonMobil, Pfizer, and Raytheon Technologies. Below is the current rundown of Dow Jones constituents:
