## The Rise and Fall of a Better Place

Better Place was a precursor of electric vehicle companies like Tesla. Its plan was to change over ordinary internal combustion vehicles into electric ones by retrofitting them with replaceable lithium-particle battery packs. Rather than charging these cars, there would be stations to swap out old batteries for new ones. In the midst of much publicity, the company had the option to raise almost $1 billion in startup funding, a record at that point, and making it one of the world's first "[unicorns](/unicorn)". Before long, he had inked deals to test the cars in Israel and Denmark, with different countries arranging behind.

All along, be that as it may, Agassi had unreasonable expectations for what the company could do in the market with the money it had. Agassi used his incredible associations with strike a deal with the CEO of Nissan-Renault, Carlos Ghosn, to build Better Place's automobiles. Ghosn reportedly suggested they start by building 50,000 vehicles, which would represent half of the Israeli vehicle market. Agassi inflated this number to 100,000 when he opened up to the world to examine his plans for the company.

Agassi wanted his cars to be less expensive than internal combustion alternatives, which at the time was not possible. In subsequent funding adjusts, production costs were minimized and Agassi's story of groundbreaking technology was used to legitimize stunningly ridiculous claims.

Better Place additionally pursued several awful management choices. For instance, none of the founding employees had experience in the automobile industry. As opposed to zeroing in on making a concept and afterward building it with the assistance of product managers who could guarantee a reliable and affordable product, Agassi started hiring marketing employees around the world who were entrusted with campaigning national governments outside of Israel for favorable tax breaks.

At that point, it seemed like Agassi couldn't possibly be at fault. Even Thomas Friedman, the American political analyst, writer, and beneficiary of three Pulitzer Prizes, writing in the New York Times in 2008, suggested that the U.S. government would improve to fund Agassi's startup than save Detroit from the financial crisis that almost annihilated the infrastructure of the city.

In any case, in the late spring of 2009, Agassi's vision and idealism appeared to start disentangling. He moved from California to Israel without telling his partners ahead of time, and his relationship with his significant other reached a conclusion. His new sweetheart started going to executive gatherings with him, and he lost a key employee Eliza Peleg (who was reportedly a vital contrast to Agassi's inappropriate hopefulness).

The company's costs expanded as Agassi demanded that Better Place invest in building all that from charging stations to route technology. At the point when the company ought to have been downsizing its costs and considering outsourcing, it was really losing huge amounts of funds consistently. it has been speculated that the amount of money the company was losing every day on operating expenses like sales, R&D, salaries, and payments to \u00adsuppliers surpassed $500,000.

Eventually, it because clear to the company's investors that Better Place's costs were wild and that the company didn't have a viable path to profitability. In late 2012, Agassi surrendered as CEO. Altogether, the company sold under 1,500 vehicles of its projected 100,000, generally to employees and through corporate leases. He surrendered as CEO of Better Place in October 2012 and Better Place petitioned for financial protection in May 2013.
