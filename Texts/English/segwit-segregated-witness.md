## FAQ
### Is SegWit Secure?
SegWit improves the security of Bitcoin's blockchain by preventing transaction malleability â€” the ability to change small snippets of data in a block.
### Is SegWit a Soft Fork?
SegWit is a soft fork of the Bitcoin blockchain. Soft forks are changes that don't make a new blockchain, while a hard fork does.
### Why Was SegWit a Good Idea?
The cryptocurrency community actually discusses whether SegWit is positive or negative, however security upgrades and diminished transaction times benefit the blockchain, excavators, and hubs that acknowledge it. SegWit prompted the implementation of Taproot, an upgrade to Bitcoin based upon SegWit that takes into account even quicker validation.
