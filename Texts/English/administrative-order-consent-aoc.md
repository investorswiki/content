## What Is an Administrative Order-on-Consent (AOC)?

An administrative order-on-consent (AOC) is an agreement between an individual or business and a regulatory body where the individual or business consents to pay for damages brought about by violations and to cease activities that made the damages happen.

Administrative orders-on-consent, or AOCs, are most frequently associated with environmental damages, like pollution. In a business context, the [Environmental Protection Agency](/environmental-protection-agency) (EPA) generally issues an AOC to clean up or fix environmental damages. The AOC can then be upheld in court in the event that the business doesn't consent.

Administrative orders-on-consent (AOCs) are utilized by state and federal governments to propel individuals and businesses to pay for environmental damages brought about by their activities.

The administrative order on consent frames what damages were caused, and what steps should be taken to moderate the damage and cleanup.

Governments and businesses willfully go into administrative orders-on-consent. This doesn't mean, in any case, that the agreement isn't binding once it is placed into nonperformance might bring about litigation.

Both the business engaged with the administrative order on consent and the government giving the AOC have an interest in guaranteeing that environmental damages are dealt with in a cost-viable and opportune way.
