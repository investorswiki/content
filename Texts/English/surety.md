# Surety
## What Is Surety?

The surety is the guarantee of the debts of one party by another. A surety is an organization or person that takes on the obligation of paying the debt in case the debtor policy defaults or is unable to make the payments.

The party that guarantees the debt is alluded to as the surety, or as the [guarantor](/guarantor).

## Surety Explained

A surety is most common in contracts in which one party questions whether the [counterparty](/counterparty) in the contract will actually want to satisfy all requirements. The party might require the counterparty to approach with a guarantor [in order to reduce risk](/counterpartyrisk), with the guarantor going into a contract of suretyship. This is expected to bring down risk to the [lender](/lender), which may, thus, lower interest rates for the borrower. A surety can be as a "surety bond."

A surety bond is a legally binding contract went into by three parties — the principal, the obligee, and the surety. The obligee, normally a government entity, requires the principal, commonly a business owner or contractor, to get a surety bond as a guarantee against future work performance.

The surety is the company that gives a [line of credit](/lineofcredit) to guarantee payment of any claim. They give a [financial guarantee](/financial-guarantee) to the obligee that the principal will satisfy their obligations. A principal's obligations could mean conforming to state laws and regulations relating to a specific business license, or meeting the terms of a construction contract.

In the event that the principal neglects to deliver on the conditions of the contract went into with the obligee, the obligee has the privilege to file a claim against the bond to recuperate any damages or losses incurred. Assuming the claim is substantial, the surety company will pay repayment that can't surpass the bond amount. The underwriters will then, at that point, anticipate that the principal should repay them for any claims paid.

## Important Distinctions

A surety isn't an insurance policy. The payment made to the surety company is paying for the bond, yet the principal is as yet liable for the debt. The surety is simply required to ease the obligee of the time and resources that will be utilized to recuperate any loss or damage from a principal. The claim amount is as yet recovered from the principal through either collateral posted by the principal or through different means.

A surety isn't a [bank guarantee](/bankguarantee). Where the surety is liable for any performance risk presented by the principal, the bank guarantee is liable for the financial risk of the contracted project.
