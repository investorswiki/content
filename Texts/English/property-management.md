## What Is Property Management?

Property management is the daily oversight of residential, commercial, or industrial real estate by a third-party contractor. Generally, [property managers](/property-manager) get a sense of ownership with everyday repairs and progressing maintenance, security, and upkeep of properties.

## Grasping Property Management

The obligations of a property manager generally include the accompanying:

- Screening expected tenants

### Who Needs a Property Manager?

Some might have various rental properties in their portfolios and lack the time or ability to keep up with the properties and deal with individual tenants. A few owners just have an interest in possessing rental properties and earning profits from them. At the point when this is the case, they hire professional property managers.

[Absentee landlords](/absentee-landowner) likewise utilize property management services. Some property management companies take care of individual landowners who rent out a single property, for example, a vacation home.

Property owners who take part in affordable housing programs will quite often utilize property management services in light of the fact that their rental properties are subject to complex federal rules that require specialized aptitude.

Certain [real estate](/realestate) brokers likewise operate as property managers. For instance, a [broker](/broker) in a resort town might give buyer and seller agent services as well as property management services. At the point when this is the case, the real estate broker records, shows, rents, and keeps up with vacation rentals for a number of property owners.

## Special Considerations

Property management licensing requirements change by state. Most states require property management companies to be licensed by the neighborhood real estate board, so property owners need to ensure that the organizations they hire are appropriately licensed.

For example, property managers in Florida are required to have real estate brokers licenses to operate in their states. That is on the grounds that a portion of their obligations are considered real estate activity. Holding a real estate broker's license permits property managers to list rental properties in the [multiple listing service](/different listing-service-mls) (MLS) and to market the properties by standard real estate marketing methods. Holding a real estate broker's license likewise permits the property management company to place a real estate board lockbox on a property's door so other licensed agents can show the property.

Florida likewise requires property managers to hold a broker's license on the off chance that they deal with rentals or [leases](/rent) and receive a [commission](/commission) for their services. Property managers who deal with the properties they own in the state, in any case, needn't bother with a license to do as such.

Managers in Massachusetts don't need a broker's license. That is on the grounds that certain duties viewed as real estate activities, like listing and leasing properties, might be secondary to the fundamental duties performed by the property manager.
