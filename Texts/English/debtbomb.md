# Debt Bomb
## What Is a Debt Bomb?

A debt bomb is a situation happening when a major financial institution, like a multinational bank, [defaults](/default2) on its obligations which, thus, causes disruption not just in the financial system of the institution's nation of origin yet in addition in the global financial system as a whole.

## Understanding Debt Bombs

As the well-known axiom goes, "In the event that you owe the bank 1,000,000 dollars, the bank possesses you. In the event that you owe the bank $100 million, you own the bank." A debt bomb is the last situation.

A default on a debt (or debts) that make up a major part of a bank's [portfolio](/portfolio) (or many lenders' portfolios) can have financial consequences that go a long ways past the borrower and their credit rating. At the point when a debt bomb "goes off" the lenders will likewise face significant financial stress as they record the value of the asset that the debt addresses on their books. This can negatively impact their primary concern, increase their liquidity needs, and, surprisingly, trigger reserve and regulatory requirements.

Smart lenders might take great measures to arrange or help borrowers in keeping away from default to stay away from these outcomes. (Smarter lenders might try not to place themselves in that frame of mind, in any case, by [diversifying](/broadening) their holdings and [hedging](/hedging-exchange) their risk). The larger the debt, the more serious these effects will be.

Thus, particularly in the present integrated global financial networks, this can lead the lenders to default on their debts or be forced to liquidate different assets, putting financial stress on the lenders' own creditors or on different borrowers. The subsequent [debt deflation](/debtdeflation) could in fact have serious ramifications for the real economy as organizations diminish their activities to cover their financial positions or face a [liquidity crisis](/liquidity-crisis) that leaves them unfit to finance progressing operations.

The debt burden of a single entity isn't the greatest concern; it's the ripple effect that stresses global policymakers. The effects of a debt bomb ripple outward through the financial system like the shockwave of overpressure made by a physical blast. A larger debt bomb won't just at first affect lenders, however its impact will likewise be felt by a more extensive scope of market participants, by implication associated with the debt bomb by a complex network of counterparty connections and economic interdependencies. This frequently brings about a flowing effect of systemic risk, pulling industries, locales, or economies down with the debt bomb.

## Instances of Debt Bombs

Whether an individual company, industry, or a whole nation heaps debt on top of debt, it raises the threat of a debt bomb. With enough leverage, things eventually collapse under their own weight.

In many regards, as economic growth has become more integrated through [globalization](/globalization), the negative effects of debt bombs can have new and unmatched ramifications for international partners. For example, since the loosening up of international markets brought on by the housing crisis in the United States in 2009, the country of Greece's mind-boggling national debts have troubled its [European Union](/europeanunion) partners. Even today, Greece battles to set its fiscal house up, which keeps on burdening other European Union member countries.

A debt bomb can likewise happen on the off chance that consumer spending depends intensely on debt. For instance, assuming consumers incurred gigantic credit card debt, individual debt holders could default as a group and make inconvenience for creditors. In the U.S., consumer debt outstanding as a percent of GDP has increased to record highs of almost 20% in recent years. Widespread defaults on consumer debts are frequently associated with economic downturns. Defaults on mortgages by families were a major factor in the [2008 financial crisis](/great-downturn).
