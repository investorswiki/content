## What Is Peercoin?

Peercoin is an alternative [cryptocurrency](/cryptocurrency) sent off in August 2012 that depends on the Bitcoin system. Like Bitcoin, Litecoin, and Dash, Peercoin stores value, offers complete obscurity, and can be sent over the internet with next to no central authority (like a bank).

Peercoin was made by the software designers Sunny King and Scott Nadal. It was the principal digital currency to utilize a combination of proof-of-stake (PoS) and proof-of-work (PoW) consensus algorithms.

## Grasping Peercoin

Peercoin is an altcoin. An altcoin is any cryptocurrency that isn't Bitcoin. Altcoins often introduce themselves as better alternatives to Bitcoin; Peercoin was the first altcoin to target the issue of Bitcoin's high energy consumption. Notwithstanding energy effectiveness, the founders of Peercoin meant to give increased security.

Bitcoin's protocol expects miners to tackle troublesome math issues to approve transactions on a blockchain. The principal miner to tackle a given riddle gets a reward as a couple bitcoins that were made. Tackling these riddles requires a lot of computing power and, thusly, consumes a ton of power. This is one of the issues that Peercoin attempts to tackle.

Peercoin tokens are initially mined through the usually utilized PoW hashing process. As the hashing difficulty increments over the long haul, users are rewarded with coins by means of the PoS algorithm. PoS block generation depends on the coins previously held by people; for instance, somebody holding 1% of the currency will be rewarded with 1% of all PoS coin blocks. This cycle is additionally alluded to as "printing."

Block generation through PoS requires insignificant energy compared to the cycle essential for generating hardware-serious PoW hashes. As the PoW blocks offer less rewards, there is a progress to utilizing the PoS portion of the algorithm (which requires insignificant energy for generating blocks). This means that over the long haul, the Peercoin network will consume less energy.

From the start, Peercoin was viewed as an expected rival to Bitcoin. Peercoin's market capitalization came to $163 million in November of 2013. It arrived at that equivalent level again roughly four years after the fact, in January 2018. At its 2013 pinnacle, it was the fourth-biggest cryptocurrency in terms of market capitalization (behind Bitcoin, Litecoin, and Ripple (XRP)).

Regardless of a promising and imaginative beginning, Peercoin no longer positions on the arrangements of top coins to watch or invest in. As of Aug. 4, 2021, Peercoin's market capitalization is $23.6 million, holding the 631st spot on CoinMarketCap.com's crypto list. Peercoin has an active foundation, be that as it may, and work keeps on being finished by the Peercoin community.

## How Is Peercoin Different From Bitcoin?

While Peercoin depends on Bitcoin's system, the two cryptocurrencies can be recognized by their various approaches to mining. Bitcoin secures its network with a PoW system, while Peercoin is a hybrid cryptocurrency that likewise uses PoS. Peercoin was the main virtual currency to use PoS, as a matter of fact.

In a PoS system, participants who currently own Peercoin are the ones that check transactions on the network. The more peercoins a client holds, the more important their verification is for the network. Since having more peercoins is an advantage for miners, this system is planned to boost users that save their Peercoin (instead of spending it).

Compared to Bitcoin, Peercoin is a more energy-productive method for getting the blockchain.

## Peercoin's Built-In Inflation

Peercoin's organizer, Sunny King, has said in a meeting that there is a tradeoff between zero inflation in the value of a cryptocurrency and its security. For instance, miners of Bitcoin won't be rewarded with new bitcoins in the end, and their whole revenue will be dependent on fees, decreasing the economic incentive to keep up with the network's integrity.

Peercoin's stamping system incorporates inflation into the system with the goal that there is dependably an economic incentive for miners. As per Sunny King, "the alternative design approach is to recognize the base inflation rate expected to secure the network however let transaction fees be obliterated to counter inflation. As I would see it, this is a better approach that can give better and more stable security to the network while conditionally protecting the strong store-of-value properties."

## Highlights
- Peercoin was the first altcoin to target the issue of Bitcoin's high energy consumption by using a proof-of-stake (PoS) system for checking the blockchain.
- Like Bitcoin, Litecoin, and Dash, Peercoin stores value, offers complete namelessness, and can be sent over the internet with practically no central authority (like a bank).
- Peercoin is an alternative cryptocurrency sent off in August 2012 that depends on the Bitcoin system.
