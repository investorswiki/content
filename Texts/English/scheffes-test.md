# Scheff\u00e9 Test
## What Is a Scheff\u00e9 Test?

A Scheff\u00e9 test is a statistical test that is a post-hoc test utilized in statistical analysis. It was named after American analyst Henry Scheff\u00e9. The Scheff\u00e9 test is utilized to make impromptu comparisons, as opposed to pre-arranged comparisons, among group means in a [analysis of variance](/anova) (ANOVA) try.

An impromptu comparison is a comparison made inside a data set after an ANOVA test has been run, so the boundaries of the comparison are not incorporated into the ANOVA explore. The Scheff\u00e9 test can be utilized to decide if individual means contrast, or whether an average one group of means varies from the average of one more group of means.

## Understanding the Scheff\u00e9 Test

While the Scheff\u00e9 test enjoys the benefit of giving the experimenter the flexibility to test any comparisons that seem fascinating, the drawback of this flexibility is that the test has moderately lower statistical power than tests that are intended for pre-arranged comparisons.

While pre-arranged comparisons can be made utilizing tests, for example, t-tests or F-tests, these tests are not suitable for post hoc or spontaneous comparisons. For such comparisons, different comparison tests, for example, the Scheff\u00e9 test, the Tukey-Kramer method, or the [Bonferroni test](/bonferroni-test) are proper.
