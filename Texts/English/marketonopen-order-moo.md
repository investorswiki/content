# Market-On-Open Order (MOO)
## What Is a Market-On-Open Order (MOO)?

A Market-On-Open (MOO) order is an order to be executed at the day's opening price. Market-On-Open (MOO) orders must be executed when the market opens or presently, yet must give the primary printed price of the day.

A market-on-open order might be contrasted with [market-on-close](/marketonclose) (MOC) orders.

## How a Market-On-Open Order Works

MOO orders on the [Nasdaq](/nasdaq) can be placed, canceled or amended from 7 a.m. to 9:28 a.m. Eastern Time, Monday to Friday. MOO orders on the NYSE can be taken any time up until 9:28 a.m. Eastern Time. Execution of MOO orders is guaranteed, giving there is adequate liquidity, yet there is no guarantee what the price will be.

To execute a market-on-open order, a trader enters a buy order while the market is closed and something like two minutes before the market opens. In those two minutes, market-production sellers will check the number of orders that are waiting for execution at the open, and what the idea of those orders may be (large or small, buy or sell, Limit, Stop or Market). They will adjust their offers and offers in light of this information and the principal trade of the session will lay out the [opening price](/openingprice).

The opening price ought to have thought about all MOO orders. For instance, in the event that there were a large number of MOO orders, the opening requesting price will be fundamentally higher than the closing price from the other day.

## When to Use MOO Orders

Traders and investors use MOO orders when they accept market conditions warrant buying or selling shares at the open. For instance, during earnings season — the period when companies report their quarterly outcomes — most companies report results after markets close. Huge price movement regularly follows on the next trading day. The MOO order doesn't determine a limit price, in contrast to a [Limit-on-Open (LOO) order](/limitonopenorder) that indicates one, and is the sister order to the Market-on-Close (MOC) order.

Companies that surpass expectations generally see their stocks rise in price, while companies that miss gauges see their stocks decline. MOO orders may likewise be utilized by [brokers](/merchant) to close mistake positions. Frequently errors are not found until trades get booked to accounts toward the finish of the trading day. A MOO order guarantees the blunder is closed out as soon as conceivable on the next day to limit risk.

## Illustration of a Market-on-Open Order

The stock trades lower in the after-hours market, and the investor figures it will continue to decline forcefully all through the next day. They would, thusly, enter a MOO order since they accept the stock will open tomorrow at a lower price however close even lower.

The risk is that the investor accepts Intel's opening price, regardless assuming it's down 5%, 10% or 20%. On the other hand, assuming the investor feels that Intel might recuperate fairly all through the next trading day and would prefer to hold their [position](/position) than take the opening market price, they could enter a LOO order, which indicates the price at which they will sell their Intel shares. This guarantees the stock isn't sold below the investor's limit price. For example, on the off chance that the investor places a LOO order with a limit of $50, the shares would be sold on the open at the market price, giving the stock is trading at $50 or above.
