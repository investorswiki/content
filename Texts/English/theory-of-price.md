# Theory of Price
## What Is the Theory of Price?

The theory of price is an economic theory that states that the price for a specific decent or service depends on the relationship between its [supply and demand](/law-of-supply-demand). The theory of price posits that the place where the benefit acquired from the people who demand the entity meets the dealer's marginal costs is the most optimal market price for that great or service.

## Grasping the Theory of Price

The theory of price — likewise alluded to as "price theory" — is a [microeconomic](/microeconomics) principle that utilizes the concept of supply and demand to decide the appropriate price point for a given decent or service.

The goal is to accomplish the equilibrium where the quantity of the goods or services provided matches the demand of the comparing market and its ability to gain the great or service. The concept of price theory allows for price changes as market conditions change.

## Relationship of Supply and Demand to Price Theory

Supply means the number of products or services that the market can provide. This incorporates both substantial goods, like vehicles, and elusive goods, for example, the ability to make an appointment with a skilled service provider. In each occurrence, the accessible supply is finite in nature. There are just a certain number of cars accessible and just a certain number of appointments accessible at some random time.

Demand applies to the market's longing for unmistakable or elusive goods. Whenever, there is likewise just a finite number of potential consumers accessible. Demand might vacillate relying upon different factors, similar to whether an improved variant of a product is accessible or on the other hand on the off chance that a service is not generally required. Demand can likewise be affected by a thing's perceived value by the consumer market.

Equilibrium happens when the total number of things accessible — the supply — is consumed by possible customers. In the event that a price is excessively high, customers might keep away from the goods or services. This would bring about excess supply.

Conversely, in the event that a price is excessively low, demand may essentially offset the accessible supply. Financial specialists use price theory to find the selling price that carries supply and demand as close to the [equilibrium](/equilibrium) as could be expected.

## Illustration of the Theory of Price

Firms frequently separate their product lines upward, as opposed to on a level plane, taking into account consumers' differential readiness to pay for quality. As per an article distributed in Marketing Science with research by Michaela Draganska of Drexel University and Dipak C. Jain of INSEAD, many firms offer products that shift in attributes, like tone or flavor, however don't change in quality.

For instance, Apple, Inc. offers different MacBook Pro models with changing prices and abilities. Every PC arrives in various varieties that are a similar price. The study found that involving uniform prices for all products in a product line is the best pricing policy. For instance, in the event that Apple charged a higher price for a silver MacBook Pro versus a space gray MacBook Pro, demand for the silver model could fall, and the supply of the silver model would increase. By then, Apple may be forced to reduce the price of that model.
