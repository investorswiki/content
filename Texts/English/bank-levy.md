## Understanding a Bank Levy

Bank demands became a force to be reckoned with following the 2008 global financial crisis when a significant number of the world's financial institutions were bailed out by their national governments to stay away from an even more grievous outcome than what had proactively happened.

This is done to keep up with financial discipline and prevent freakish spending, bonuses, or conceivable excessively hazardous behavior. The levy is forced to control the banks' hazardous borrowing activities that contributed to the [credit crisis](/credit-crisis). The proceeds from the tax are set to the side by the government to make an insurance fund to bail out the industry in the event of a future crisis so as not to make taxpayers pay for bailouts.

The bank levy permits a bank to freeze the account(s) of a debtor until all the sought-after debt is reimbursed in full. On the off chance that the levy isn't lifted, the creditor can take the funds from the bank account and apply them to the total debt owed.

As a rule, a debtor is permitted to dispute the levy, which might prevent the levy or reduce the amount the creditor can access.
