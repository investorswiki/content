## What Is a Synthetic Put?

A synthetic put is an options strategy that consolidates a [short](/short) stock position with a [long call option](/calloption) on that equivalent stock to impersonate a [long put option](/long_put). It's likewise called a synthetic long put. Basically, an investor who has a short position in a stock purchases a [at-the-money](/atthemoney) call option on that equivalent stock. This action is taken to safeguard against appreciation in the stock's price. A synthetic put is otherwise called a married call or protective call.

## Grasping Synthetic Puts

The synthetic put is a strategy that investors can use when they have a [bearish](/bear) bet on a stock and are worried about potential close term strength in that stock. It is like an insurance policy aside from that the investor believes the price of the underlying stock should fall, not rise. The strategy consolidates the [short sale](/shortsale) of a security with a long-call position on a similar security.

A synthetic put mitigates the risk that the underlying price will increase. It doesn't, be that as it may, deal with different risks, which might allow the investor to remain uncovered. Since it includes a short position in the underlying stock, it conveys with it that large number of associated risks — fees, margin interest, and the possibility of paying [dividends](/profit) to the investor from whom the shares were borrowed to sell short.

Institutional investors can utilize synthetic puts to mask their trading predisposition — be it bullish or bearish — on specific securities. Nonetheless, for most investors, synthetic puts are best appropriate for use as an insurance policy. An increase in volatility would be beneficial to this strategy while [time decay](/timedecay) would impact it negatively.

The maximum profit for both a simple short position and a synthetic put is on the off chance that the stock's value falls to zero. Note that any benefit from a synthetic put must be weighted against the options' [premium](/option-premium).

A synthetic put strategy safeguards against an increase in the stock's price, really putting a cap on the stock price. The cap limits [upside](/upside) risk for the investor (for example the risk that the short position's stock price rises).

The risk of a synthetic put strategy is limited to the difference between the price at which the underlying stock was shorted and the option's [strike price](/strikeprice) (as well as any commissions). Put another way, at the hour of the purchase of the option, assuming the price at which the investor shorted the stock was equivalent to the strike price, the loss for the strategy would be the premiums paid for the option.

- **Maximum Gain = Short sale price - Lowest stock price (ZERO) - Premiums**
- **Maximum Loss = Short sale price - Long call strike price - Premiums**
- **Breakeven Point = Short sale price - Premiums**

## When to Use a Synthetic Put

Instead of a profit-production strategy, a synthetic put is a capital-saving strategy. With that, the cost of the call portion (the option premium) turns into an implicit cost. The [option's](/option) price lessens the profitability of the technique — expecting the underlying stock moves in the ideal bearing, lower.

Consequently, synthetic puts are frequently utilized as insurance policies against short-term spikes in stock prices (in a generally bearish stock), or as a protection against an unanticipated move up in the stock price.

Fresher investors might benefit from realizing that their losses in the stock market are limited. This wellbeing net can give them confidence as they get familiar with various investing strategies. Of course, any protection will include some major disadvantages, which incorporates the price of the option, [commissions](/commission), and other potential fees.
