## Types of Riders

Riders come in different forms, including long-term care, term conversion, waiver of premiums, and exclusionary.

As of September 2010, the [Affordable Care Act](/affordable-care-act) (ACA) precluded exclusionary riders from being applied to children. Exclusionary riders have not been permitted in any healthcare insurance beginning around 2014.

## Example of a Rider

A commonplace homeowners insurance policy incorporates coverage for structural damage, personal property damage or loss, and personal liability coverage. Nonetheless, every standard protection is additionally subject to coverage limits or restrictions. A rider expands the standard coverage.

A homeowners policy might have a coverage limit of $50,000 for personal property, yet it could likewise have a sub-limit of $1,500 for jewelry. In the event that valuable jewelry is taken or damaged by a fire, the policyholder would only be repaid up to $1,500 to assist with supplanting it.
