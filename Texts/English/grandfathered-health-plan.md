President Barack Obama marked the Affordable Care Act into law on March 23, 2010. Albeit the ACA rolled out substantial improvements to healthcare in the United States, a large number of these changes applied exclusively to new plans.

These more established plans are in some cases alluded to as "grandfathered wellbeing plans."

Whether a plan is viewed as legacy relies upon when it was made by the insurance company, not when a specific individual person joined the plan. Subsequently, supports are free to keep signing up new policyholders into a legacy plan, as long as the plan doesn't present changes that would substantially reduce benefits or increase [coverage](/insurance) costs for policyholders. Any such changes would bring about the plan losing its legacy status and becoming subject to the new requirements under the ACA.

The ACA permitted legacy wellbeing plans to assist consumers with keeping their coverage in place. On the off chance that a company chooses to cease a legacy wellbeing plan, it must tell policyholders recorded as a hard copy something like 90 days prior and offer other coverage options.
