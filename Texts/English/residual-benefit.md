### What Is Residual Benefit?

A residual benefit is given by disability insurance that furnishes the policyholder with part of the total benefits framed in the policy. The residual benefit is regularly calculated as a percentage of the total disability benefit.

## Grasping Residual Benefits

Residual disability policies pay benefits as per the amount of income you have lost on account of your disability. These policies pay benefits even on the off chance that you can work part-time and are not totally disabled. The benefit is based on the percentage of income you earn working part-time comparable to what you used to earn while working full-time.

Disability insurance gives benefits to policyholders, who are harmed or unable to work in light of medical problems. Policies give a base benefit, which is the month to month amount of income that the policyholder will receive on the off chance that they are unable to work. To receive the benefit, the policyholder needs to show the way that they can't work by any means. The benefit might demonstrate inadequate assuming that the policyholder returns to work. A residual benefit permits the policyholder to receive a portion of the disability benefit, when they get once more into the labor force â€” even if by some stroke of good luck part-time.

## Illustration of How Residual Benefits are Calculated

Residual benefits are normally calculated as a percentage of both the policyholder's loss of earnings and the benefit that the policyholder would receive on the off chance that they were unable to work. For instance, say a worker who has a disability policy supports an injury that prevents them from working full-time.

The worker with a residual disability is genuinely able to be hands on part-time and can earn 60% of the amount that he used to earn. The disability policy pays out $1,500 a month as normal benefits. The residual benefit is calculated by taking the amount of income loss (which is 40%) and increasing it by the normal disability benefit of $1.500. The subsequent residual benefit comes to $600 every month (40% x $1500).

Policies might limit the amount of part-time earnings relative to full-time, pre-disability earnings. This restriction might be a maximum benefit each month or a maximum percentage of pre-disability earnings. For instance, an employee might have purchased a policy with a month to month maximum benefit of $5,000 yet may have a pre-disability income of $80,000. The difference between pre-disability income and annual benefits is $20,000 ($80,000 - $60,000), or a cap of 75%.
