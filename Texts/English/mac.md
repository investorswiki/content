# Municipal Assistance Corporation (MAC)
## What Was the Municipal Assistance Corporation (MAC)?

The Municipal Assistance Corporation (MAC) was a [public-private](/public-private-organizations) corporation made by the state of New York in 1975 to aid New York City in an extreme financial crisis. The city had exhausted all lending organizations and was as of now not able to have any debt issuances endorsed. The MAC was authorized to sell [bonds](/bond) issued by the city to enable cash flow to return to the city's government.

The MAC closed down in 2008, having satisfied its stated purpose.

## Figuring out the Municipal Assistance Corporation

In the spring of 1975, the City was unable to pay its bills, a default on outstanding debt was logical, and the phantom of bankruptcy was genuine. The Corporation was brought into the world of a recommendation to Governor Hugh L. Carey made by a special board contained Simon H. Rifkind, Felix G. Rohatyn, Richard M. Shinn, and Donald B. Smiley. MAC had a Board of Directors comprising of nine private residents and was invested with the authority to borrow billions backed by State revenue and to exercise specific policing powers over City fiscal practices.

The state stepped in to stay away from a breakdown of services in the country's biggest city, which had bungled its finances to the point where it was near the precarious edge of being unable to pay government employees. The state likewise advanced the city with extra funds to help the redoing of their financial state and tide them over until enough of the new bonds could be issued.

The MAC was closed in 2008 after the last $10 billion worth of bonds were paid off. New York City has made some amazing progress since the dark days of the 1970s. In the years that followed the MAC's closure, NYC's revenue has stayed stable, albeit the city was all the while wrestling with a heap of debt â€” its long-term obligations including pensions, compensated unlucky deficiencies for municipal employees (accrued sick and vacation leave payable at retirement), and other post-employment benefits was generally equivalent to its reinforced debt.

## The MAC's Impact

In a unique endeavor, those with contending financial interests and generally ill-disposed connections met up to reestablish the City to a firm financial balance," as per the Baruch chronicle.

At the point when the city asked the federal government for help, then, at that point President Gerald Ford challenged, inciting the **New York Daily News** to print the well known first page headline: "Portage to City: Drop Dead." Although Ford never articulated those words, they summarized the sensations of numerous New Yorkers, who felt abandoned by all levels of government as their city disintegrated.
