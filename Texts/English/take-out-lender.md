Whenever construction is done, Acme Development can go to a takeout lender for a long-term loan with additional positive terms, for example, a 30-year mortgage with the building as [collateral](/collateral). The company can get a lower rate of 4% and utilize the money from the 30-year mortgage to pay off the 18-month loan that financed the construction.
