# Duration
Investing in [bonds](/bond) resembles ordering a cheddar pizza: They're plain, solid, and perhaps a bit exhausting. While fixed-income investments like bonds can assist with expanding your portfolio and give balance during market [volatility](/volatility), bond investing additionally accompanies its own set of complex and fairly confounding terminology. Also, on the grounds that bond prices move the other way of interest rates, numerous investors are much of the time left scratching their heads. However, when you comprehend a couple of essential metrics, similar to bond duration, you will view bonds as a really direct investment — one that can furnish you with a safe and stable stream of income.
## What Is Bond Duration?
Most importantly, you shouldn't befuddle the financial term "duration" with a time span. In the bond world, duration closely relates to [interest rates](/interestrate).
Numerous investors definitely realize that bonds and interest rates have an inverse relationship. You might have even heard the phrase, "Assuming interest rates rise, bond prices will drop." Bonds are sensitive to interest rate risk, and that means that when interest rates rise, the value of bonds falls, and when interest rates decline, bond prices go up.
Bond duration is a measurement that tells us **how much** a bond's price could change on the off chance that interest rates vary. Its full definition is somewhat more technical than that since duration measures what amount of time it will require for an investor to be repaid a bond's price from the cash flows it produces. All things considered, bond investors are putting loans to a borrower (a corporation, the federal government, and so forth), which must be repaid with interest by their maturity date.
##   What Does High Bond Duration Mean?
Bonds with high duration are more inclined to the promising and less promising times of market volatility that occurs in an environment of changing interest rates. Bonds with the highest durations are typically long-term bonds with low coupons.
## What Does Low Bond Duration Mean?
Bonds that have lower duration are more stable against interest rate changes. So these bonds are typically shorter term bonds.
## Are Bonds With Low Duration Better Than Bonds With High Duration?
You could really find bonds with a higher duration an alluring investment in an environment of falling interest rates. At the point when there's volatility, bonds with low duration and high coupons would be best. Everything relies upon your risk preference, your holding period, and your objectives.
### Bond Duration Vs. Maturity
Talking about maturity dates, it's important to note that bond duration and maturity are not exactly the same thing. In plain English, "maturity" means the point in time that something turns out to be fully developed, so the maturity date of a 30-year [Treasury bond](/treasurybond) is 30 years into what's in store. Its duration, notwithstanding, is a calculation that considers several factors, including yields, coupon payments, and others, all moved into one.
On the surface, it can appear to be really confounding, yet for most investors, the primary focal point is that bond duration predicts how strongly the market price of a bond will change because of changes in interest rates. The higher the bond duration, the greater the level of interest rate risk. Realizing that can assist you with determining whether a specific bond is a wise investment for you — particularly on the off chance that you plan on selling your bond prior to its maturity date.
## Instances of Bond Duration
The rule of thumb is, for each 1% change in interest rates, the value of the bond will either increase or decline by similar amount as its duration. By inspecting three distinct bonds, zero-coupon bonds, short-term bonds and long-term bonds, we can reveal insight into just how much duration can influence its value.
### Zero-Coupon Bonds
The most straightforward duration to compute is that of a zero-coupon bond. This bond has zero yield, and that means it pays no interest.
Its duration is equivalent to its opportunity to maturity.
At the point when a coupon is added to a bond, the duration will constantly be **less** than its maturity.
### Short and Medium-Term Bonds
More or less, the overall principle is that for each 1% increase in interest rates, a bond's price will diminish 1% for each year of duration.
On the other hand, for each 1% diminishing in interest rates, the bond will increase 1% for each year of duration.

For instance, in the event that interest rates increased by 2%, a 10-year Treasury with a coupon of 3.5% and a duration of 8.4 years would fall in value by 15%.
### Long-Term Bonds
We should utilize the 30-year Treasury with 4.5% coupon and a duration of 14.5 years as another model. Assuming that rates increased 2% in this scenario, the bond would lose 26% of its value! So you perceive how interest rate changes can truly play ruin based on bonds with longer conditions. Even however its coupon is greater, the higher duration makes it more inclined to interest rate changes.
## Why Is Bond Duration Important?
Generally talking, bonds with shorter maturities carry less risk since they return an investor's principal more rapidly than a long-term bond would. Let's assume you loaned two individuals money. The main person gratefully accepted your loan for a period of 5 years, and the subsequent person took it for quite a long time. You would receive a greater amount of the primary person's money sooner on the grounds that their principal would come due several years sooner.
Likewise, bonds with shorter maturities ordinarily have lower duration than bonds with longer maturities. Just recall, the higher the duration, the more sensitive the bond is to interest rate changes, and subsequently, the more inclined it is to interest rate risk.
### How Do I Calculate the Duration of a Bond?
The great news is that you likely won't have to work out it yourself since brokerage firms distribute data about bond duration on their sites. Be that as it may, to do the heavy lifting, you would have a decision between two equations: Macaulay Duration, which is communicated in years, and Modified Duration, the more modern measurement, which considers differing coupon payment schedules, and is communicated as a percentage. It's a more exact calculation.
### Macaulay Duration Formula

Macaulay Duration lets us know the weighted average time it would take to receive cash flows from a bond.
### Modified Duration Formula

To work out Modified Duration, you want to know a bond's yield to maturity.
## Different Factors Affecting a Bond's Value
Duration might appear to be tricky, however just one factor influences a bond's value. A few different factors incorporate the following.
### Credit quality
This alludes to the issuer's creditworthiness, or the ability to repay its principal and interest on time. Credit quality is illustrated by ratings, which range from high to low, with triple-A being the highest and D being the lowest. Lower-quality bonds generally sport large coupons to make the increased risk more alluring to investors.
### Inflation risk
Since bonds make payments on a fixed schedule, inflation can factor in after some time, eroding the value of the bond. Economic price increases, known as inflation, make the value of the bonds deteriorate.
### Default risk
At the point when a bond issuer enters default, they can't make period coupon payments or pay the principal of a bond. Default risk is one of the risks a bond investor makes while purchasing a lower-rated bond. All things considered, you maintain that should be certain the bond issuer can make ideal payments — or any payments whatsoever!
### Call risk
On account of certain bonds, known as callable bonds, the issuer can "call" the bond before maturity, and that means that the investor must reinvest it at a lower interest rate.
## Determining If Bond Investing Is Right for You
Not that numerous investors paid consideration regarding bond duration before the 1970s in light of the fact that interest rates were moderately stable. During the 1970s and 1980s, notwithstanding, interest rates began fluctuating dramatically, and individuals wanted a metric that would assist them with evaluating price volatility on their fixed-income investments, similar to bonds.
While bond investing is generally safer than stock investing, factors like duration become important contemplations on the off chance that you choose to sell a bond before its maturity date.
And this, of course, all makes investing so energizing.
