# Designated Market Maker (DMM)
## What Is a Designated Market Maker (DMM)?

A designated market maker (DMM) is a [market maker](/marketmaker) responsible for keeping up with fair and orderly markets for an assigned set of listed stocks. Formerly known as specialists, the designated market maker is the official market maker for a set of [tickers](/stocksymbol) and, to keep up with liquidity in these assigned stocks, will take the opposite side of trades while buying and selling imbalances happen. The DMM likewise fills in as a point of contact on the trading floor for the listed company, and furnishes the company with data, for example, the general market conditions, the temperament of traders, and who is trading the stock.

## Grasping Designated Market Maker

The designated market maker position is moderately new to the [New York Stock Exchange](/nyse). This type of position was added to increase intensity and market quality as electronic trading turns out to be more far reaching and overwhelms financial markets. Announced in 2008, the DMM is viewed as a value-added service offering higher touch than what an electronic-no one but platform can give.

Designated market makers will keep up with inside their inventory amounts of shares for the securities they are assigned. Quotes offered by the DMM are on par with what floor brokers offer, and the DMM is committed to quote at the national best bid or offer for a percentage of the time. This can incorporate more than one name. In fact,

 As indicated by NYSE, the DMM serves three important capabilities:

- Deal with a physical auction alongside an automated auction, which incorporates electronic quotes from other DMMs and market participants
- Meet NYSE market depth and continuity guidelines
- Empower participation and further develop market quality by keeping quotes in-accordance with floor broker quotes

As trades are made and quotes get filled on bids and offers, the DMM attempts to as needs be balance their inventory. Part of the responsibility is to decrease [volatility](/volatility) and increase liquidity, yet those factors are not generally influenced quite a bit by. By and by, the market maker is expected to keep up with quotes and to guarantee orders are executed paying little mind to market conditions.

DMMs likewise manage and run opening auctions, when orders are taken before the opening of an exchange to buy and sell securities, and closing auctions also, while closing prices are correspondingly settled after exchanges close on each trading day. Companies, for example, investment banks and trading firms can act as designated market makers.

## Market Makers versus Floor Brokers

Brokers — who address the interests of financial institutions, pension funds, and different organizations investing in the market — work with designated market makers to get trades going. On the trading floor of the NYSE, DMMs are positioned in the center and the floor brokers are situated along the outskirts.

One of the greater changes from the specialist job, which the DMM supplanted, includes the trade data that a DMM approaches. Designated market makers don't approach data on who has bought or sold a security until after the trade is made, implying that the DMM doesn't have inside data and countenances similar risks as other market participants. This levels the playing field between the DMM and floor brokers.
