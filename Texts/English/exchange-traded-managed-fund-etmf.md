# Exchange-Traded Managed Fund (ETMF)
## What Are Exchange-Traded Managed Funds (ETMFs)?

Exchange-traded managed funds (ETMFs) are a type of fund approved by the [Securities Exchange Commission](/sec) (SEC) in 2014. They are a hybrid between [mutual funds](/mutualfund) and [exchange-traded funds](/etf) (ETFs). They were made for the global investment company Eaton Vance and are branded as NextShares on [NASDAQ](/nasdaq).

ETMFs are a middle ground between mutual funds and ETFs, consolidating parts of various existing types of funds to hold both effectiveness and portfolio confidentiality. They carry a considerable lot of similar qualities as mutual funds, including:

- Uncovering quarterly holdings, as opposed to daily holdings, to safeguard confidentiality
- Flexibility to be traded over the course of the day

ETMFs likewise incorporate numerous components of exchange-traded funds, including:

- Tax proficiency, since the funds don't draw capital increases
- [Net asset value](/nav) (NAV)- based trading

Toward the finish of each trading day, ETMFs price the NAV, considering any premiums or discounts in the trades. This NAV is then utilized as a review basis for that day's trading. Basically, trades happen over the course of the day at a proxy price since the real price will not set in stone until the market closes for the afternoon.
