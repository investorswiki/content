# Carryover Basis
## What Is a Carryover Basis?

A carryover basis is a method for deciding the [tax basis](/costbasis) of an asset when it is transferred starting with one individual then onto the next. A carryover basis is much of the time utilized when one party leaves assets or property to someone else as a gift. In this situation, the basis frequently continues as before as when the provider held the asset, however the basis might be adjusted to account for any gift taxes that were paid.

## Figuring out Carryover Basis

The carryover basis varies from a [step-up basis](/stepupinbasis). A carryover basis is utilized during the lifetime of the provider, while a step-up basis is utilized when an asset is inherited after the provider dies. In a step-up basis scenario, the value of the assets being transferred is adjusted to its current market value.

The cost basis of an investment is the total amount originally invested, plus any [commissions](/commission) or charges engaged with the purchase. This can either be portrayed in terms of the dollar amount of the investment or the effective per share price of the investment.

Deciding the right cost basis of an investment — likewise alluded to as the tax basis — is important particularly on the off chance that you reinvested dividends and [capital gains distributions](/capitalgainsdistribution) rather than taking the earnings from the investment in cash. At the point when you reinvest dividends or distributions, the tax basis of your investment increases. This increase ought to be accounted for with the goal that you can report lower capital gains, and hence, pay less taxes. On the off chance that you don't report the higher tax basis, you could wind up paying higher taxes.

At the point when shares are given to you as a gift, your cost basis is the cost basis of the original holder of the asset who gave you the gift. In the event that the shares are trading at a lower price than when the shares were gifted, the lower rate is the cost basis. On the off chance that the shares were given to you as part of an inheritance, the cost basis of the shares for the inheritor is the [market price](/market-price) of the shares on the date of the original proprietor's death.

During the time spent estate planning, the carryover basis decides the initial value of one's estate, so the carryover basis decides the [tax rate](/taxrate) that the heirs of an estate must pay on [capital gains](/capitalgain) when they sell any assets associated with that estate.

## Carryover Basis and Gift Taxes

[Gift taxes](/gifttax) are a critical part in deciding the carryover basis of an asset. This is a federal tax that applies to scenarios wherein the getting party doesn't pay the provider full value for the gift (in spite of the fact that they could pay a lesser amount).

The provider of the gift is the one that endures the worst part of the gift tax. As a general rule, gifts to one's spouse or to a political organization, or gifts valued at not exactly the annual gift tax exclusion, alongside medical and instructive expenses, are excluded from the gift tax.

For 2021, the gift tax maximum is $15,000 per person each year ($16,000 for 2022). This means that an individual might gift another individual $15,000 or less each year without causing a gift tax.

The gift tax varies from the [estate tax](/estatetax), which is imposed on a beneficiary's inherited portion of a [estate](/estate). In 2021, the exclusion limit for the estate value was combined gross assets and prior taxable gifts surpassing $11.7 million ($12.06 million out of 2022). This effectively means that an estate of $11.7 million wouldn't be required to file a [tax return](/taxreturn) and would be exempt from paying the estate tax.

While the estate tax is generally forced on assets passed on to heirs, it doesn't have any significant bearing to the transfer of assets to an enduring spouse. The right of spouses to leave any amount to each other is known as the unlimited [marital deduction](/unlimited-marital-deduction).
