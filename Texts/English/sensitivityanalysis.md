# Sensitivity Analysis
## What Is Sensitivity Analysis?

Sensitivity analysis determines what different values of an independent variable mean for a particular dependent variable under a given set of assumptions. In other words, sensitivity analyses study how different sources of uncertainty in a mathematical model contribute to the model's overall uncertainty. This technique is used inside specific boundaries that depend on one or more input variables.

Sensitivity analysis is used in the business world and in the field of [economics](/economics). It is generally used by financial analysts and economists and is otherwise called an imagine a scenario where analysis.

## How Sensitivity Analysis Works

Sensitivity analysis is a financial model that determines what target variables are meant for based on changes in other variables known as input variables. This model is additionally referred to as consider the possibility that or simulation analysis. It is a method for predicting the outcome of a decision given a certain range of variables. By creating a given set of variables, an analyst can determine what changes in one variable mean for the outcome.

Both the target and input — or independent and dependent — variables are fully analyzed when sensitivity analysis is conducted. The person doing the analysis takes a gander at how the variables move as well as what the target is meant for by the input variable.

Sensitivity analysis can be used to help make predictions about the share prices of [public companies](/publiccompany). Some of the variables that affect stock prices include company earnings, the number of shares outstanding, the [debt-to-equity ratios](/debtequityratio) (D/E), and the number of competitors in the industry. The analysis can be refined about future stock prices by making different assumptions or adding different variables. This model can likewise be used to determine the effect that changes in interest rates have on bond prices. In this case, the interest rates are the independent variable, while bond prices are the dependent variable.

> Investors can likewise use sensitivity analysis to determine the effects different variables have on their investment returns.

Sensitivity analysis takes into consideration forecasting utilizing historical, true data. By studying every one of the variables and the possible outcomes, important decisions can be made about businesses, the economy, and making investments.

## Example of Sensitivity Analysis

Assume Sue is a sales manager who needs to understand the impact of customer traffic on total sales. She determines that sales are a function of price and transaction volume. The price of a widget is $1,000, and Sue sold 100 last year for total sales of $100,000. Sue likewise determines that a 10% increase in customer traffic increases transaction volume by 5%. This permits her to build a [financial model](/financialmodeling) and sensitivity analysis around this equation based on consider the possibility that statements. It can tell her what befalls sales in the event that customer traffic increases by 10%, half, or 100%. Based on 100 transactions today, a 10%, half, or 100% increase in customer traffic equates to an increase in transactions by 5%, 25%, or half respectively. The sensitivity analysis demonstrates that sales are exceptionally sensitive to changes in customer traffic.

## Sensitivity versus Scenario Analysis

In finance, a sensitivity analysis is created to understand the impact a range of variables has on a given outcome. It is important to note that a sensitivity analysis isn't the same as a [scenario analysis](/scenario_analysis). As an example, assume an equity analyst believes should do a sensitivity analysis and a scenario analysis around the impact of [earnings per share](/eps) (EPS) on a company's relative valuation by utilizing the price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple.

The sensitivity analysis is based on the variables that affect valuation, which a financial model can depict utilizing the variables' price and EPS. The sensitivity analysis isolates these variables and then records the range of possible outcomes.

Then again, for a scenario analysis, the analyst determines a certain scenario, for example, a [stock market crash](/stock-market-crash) or change in industry regulation. He then changes the variables inside the model to line up with that scenario. Put together, the analyst has a comprehensive picture. He presently knows the full range of outcomes, given all extremes, and has an understanding of what the outcomes would be, given a specific set of variables defined by real-life scenarios.

## Benefits and Limitations of Sensitivity Analysis

Conducting sensitivity analysis provides a number of benefits for decision-makers. To begin with, it acts as an in-depth study of the multitude of variables. Because it's more in-depth, the predictions might be undeniably more reliable. Secondly, It permits decision-makers to identify where they can make improvements in the future. At last, it takes into consideration the ability to make sound decisions about companies, the economy, or their investments.

Yet, there are some disadvantages to utilizing a model like this. The outcomes are completely based on assumptions because the variables are totally based on historical data. This means it isn't exactly accurate, so there might be room for error when applying the analysis to future predictions.

## Features
- Sensitivity analysis determines what different values of an independent variable mean for a particular dependent variable under a given set of assumptions.
- This model is likewise referred to as an imagine a scenario in which or simulation analysis.
- Sensitivity analysis can be used to help make predictions in the share prices of publicly traded companies or what interest rates mean for bond prices.
- Sensitivity analysis takes into consideration forecasting utilizing historical, true data.
