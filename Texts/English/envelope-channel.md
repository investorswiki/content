# Envelope Channel
## What Is an Envelope Channel?

Envelope channel alludes to upper and lower bands around price bars, produced by a moving average and a pre-determined distance above and below the moving average. The distance can be calculated through a percentage variable higher and below the moving average (i.e., 2%, 5%, or 10%,), or the number of standard deviations (i.e., 1, 2, 3, like [Bollinger Bands](/bollingerbands)).

Not at all like traditional price channels, standard deviation-based envelope channels change after some time in response to a security's [volatility](/volatility) by enlarging or limiting the bands.

## Understanding Envelope Channels

Envelope channels can be made utilizing different methods, insofar as they cooperate to form upper and lower bands that encompass the security's price.

For instance, a trader might utilize a 20-day simple [moving average](/movingaverage) and 5% distance to create an envelope channel for a given security. Different models could incorporate Bollinger Bands or [Keltner Channels](/keltnerchannel), which are volatility-based envelopes made utilizing [exponential moving averages](/ema).

Numerous traders respond to a sell [signal](/exchange signal) when the price arrives at the upper band and a buy signal when the price arrives at the lower band of an envelope channel. Frequently, traders need to try different things with various moving average and distance settings to find what works for a given security or market. They ought to likewise look for breakouts and breakdowns from envelope channels in additional extreme conditions since those signals might produce greater unwavering quality and profitability.

Other technical indicators or [chart patterns](/pattern) can be useful in affirming inversions, bringing down the frequency of false buying or selling signals.

## Envelope Channel Example

Charting services characterize and compute the envelope channel in various ways. For instance, Worden's TC2000 envelope channel uses a moving average and percentage distance above and below the moving average.

The indicator is set to a 20-day simple moving average and 6% distance in this Apple model, drawing upper and lower bands that contain by far most of price development between October 2017 and August 2018.

A rally floods outside the top band in November 2017, setting off a sell signal that goes before a minor decline, trailed by a three-month trading range. A decline into February slices through the base band for seven days, setting off whipsaw losses on the off chance that dip buyers enter too soon. The bounce into March switches at the top band yet the stock posts a marginally higher high before turning strongly lower mid-month.

April and May buying signals yield solid profits while the rally into Memorial Day slows down outside the top band, producing a prolonged consolidation pattern. At long last, the August flood to another high issues one more false sell signal, advising traders to rethink indicator settings.
