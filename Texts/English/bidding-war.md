Alice and Brynne each longing to buy a house listed at $250,000. Alice offers the rundown price, and Brynne answers with an offer of $260,000. Not set in stone to buy the house, Alice offers $270,000. Brynne counters with a $280,000 offer. Alice perceives that she has a bidding cap of $300,000, so her next bid is a $20,000 raise.

## Special Considerations

At the point when a real estate market turns out to be profoundly competitive, a few investors and examiners decide to carry out [escalation clauses](/escalatorclause) into their bidding contract on a property. A heightening clause is a statement showing a base bid price for the property and an agreement to naturally increase that bid by a certain amount assuming that another buyer submits a checked higher bid. Commonly, an acceleration clause will likewise incorporate the maximum price the buyer will pay for that property.

If, for example, in the above model, Alice and Brynne each had incorporated heightening clauses expanding their bids by $10,000 until meeting a $300,000 cap, the outcome would be unique. Alice's initial offer of $250,000 would be met with Brynne's offer of $260,000. Alice's heightening clause would answer with a $270,000 offer, and Brynne would offer $280,000. After Alice's subsequent offer of $290,000, Brynne would win the bidding war with a $300,000 bid.

This strategy, while advantageous, has its disadvantages. Normally, a seller of a property will know about the [maximum price](/price-roof) set in a heightening clause, implying that the seller can know how much the potential buyer will pay.
