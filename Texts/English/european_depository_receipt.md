# European Depositary Receipt (EDR)
## What Is an European Depositary Receipt (EDR)?

An European depositary receipt (EDR) is a negotiable security issued by an European bank that addresses the public security of a non-European company and trades on neighborhood exchanges. The shares issued by the bank are priced in neighborhood currencies (fundamentally Euro) and furthermore pay dividends, if applicable, in nearby currencies. Non-European companies might list EDRs to draw in a more extensive base of investors.

EDRs are the functional equivalent of [American depositary receipts](/adr) (ADR), which allow foreign companies to list shares on U.S. exchanges.

## Understanding European Depositary Receipts (EDR)

European depositary receipts have existed for a really long time however they have become more well known with the rise of [global investing](/international-investing). The benefits are clear: investors in Europe gain advantageous access to shares of public companies based in the U.S. what's more, other foreign nations; non-European companies draw in tap a bigger pool of capital by listing in Europe; the banks that issue and support EDRs produce trading commissions and fees for their books.

Subsequent to confirming that the stock of a public company meets neighborhood exchange requirements, an European-based bank purchases a block of shares of the company and places them in custody at its depositary arm. It then packages them in bundles and reissues them in nearby currencies to be traded and chosen neighborhood exchanges.

Past the creation of an EDR, a bank handles dividend payments, currency transformations, and distributions of receipts. It likewise gives transmission of shareholder data to EDR holders, including [annual reports](/annualreport), [proxy filings](/proxymaterials), and other corporate action materials.

## EDR Risks

To an European investor, having the option to invest in foreign security on a neighborhood exchange has its appeal. Be that as it may, there are somewhere around two fundamental risks. In the first place, there is [currency risk](/currencyrisk).

Take, for instance, a stock of a U.S. company purchased by an European investor at one point in time. If sometime in the future the U.S. dollar is worth less against the euro currency, the EDR will see a reduction in value.

Second, an EDR might have low trading [liquidity](/liquidity), and that means that investors wouldn't have the option to trade in and out at tight [bid-ask spreads](/bid-askspread) at their ideal amounts of shares.

## EDRs, ADRs, and GDRs

EDRs and ADRs are very comparative. The primary difference is that ADRs allow non-U.S. companies to list shares on American exchanges while EDRs allow non-European companies to list shares on European exchanges. While ADRs are priced in U.S. dollars, EDRs are priced in euros.

ADRs and EDRs both give listings to foreign shares in a single market: the U.S or Europe, separately. [Global Depositary Receipts](/gdr) (GDRs) rather give access to at least two markets, most often the U.S. market and the Euromarkets, with one fungible security. GDRs are most regularly utilized when the issuer is bringing capital up in the nearby market as well as in the international and US markets, either through private placement or public offerings. In this way, a company based in Japan might try to list GDRs than have both an American and European partner.
