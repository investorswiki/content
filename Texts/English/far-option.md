To an options trader, the far option is the one with the longest time left until its expiration date in a series called a [calendar option spread](/calendarspread).

A calendar spread includes buying or selling several options with various expiration times. In such a spread, the more limited dated option is called the close to option.

Far options have additional opportunity to arrive at the strike price or move [in the money](/inthemoney). In this way, they accompany more huge [premiums](/premium) than comparable close to options.

Far options can exist in the event that there is a nearer option. For this reason the term is utilized for spread trades, in which a trader buys or sells a series of contracts with various expiration dates.
