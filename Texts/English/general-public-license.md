# Overall population License

GPL, or General Public License (GPL), alludes to a free, copyleft license for software. It awards anybody the rights to freely utilize, read, copy, share, change, and convey a computer program or different sorts of work. GPL was originally written for the GNU Project and was the first copyleft license to be adopted for general use. It was made in mid 1989 by Richard Stallman, the organizer behind the Free Software Foundation (FSF).
Rather than copyright, the term copyleft means that the GPL takes into consideration derivative attempts to be distributed, however expect them to be distributed under a similar license terms as the original work. Subsequently, users can't utilize GPL-licensed software and release a derivative work under one more type of license. This isn't the case for different types of free software licenses, like the Berkley Software Distribution (BSD) and the MIT licenses.
The BSD and MIT licenses fall inside the category of lenient licenses. While both copyleft and lenient licenses permit users to copy, change, and appropriate software, their conditions are to some degree unique.
From one perspective, copyleft licenses guarantee that open-source software stays accessible to everybody. It likewise evades another person to profit from a piece of work that was made accessible for free. Copyleft advocates will quite often be more worried in holding some control over their work.
Then again, lenient licenses permit software to be utilized widely, the length of the original designers are referred to and credited for their work. As such, a lenient license permits anybody to copy, change, and convey a piece of work, under any sort of license. The main requirement is to give credits to the original makers.
As of now, the GPL license is the most widely utilized method for dispersing free and open-source software. Well known free-software programs like the GNU Emacs, the GNU Compiler Collection (GCC) and, surprisingly, the [Linux](/linux) piece are licensed under this license.
