# Fibonacci Arc
## What is a Fibonacci Arc?

Fibonacci arcs are half circles that expand outward from a line interfacing a high and low, called the base line. These arcs meet the base line at the 23.6%, 38.2%, half, 61.8%, and 78.6%. Fibonacci arcs address areas of likely support and resistance. The arcs are based on both price and time as the arcs will get more extensive the longer the base line is, or smaller the more limited it is. Fibonacci arcs are commonly used to interface two huge price points, for example, a [swing high](/swinghigh) and a swing low. A base line is drawn between these two points and afterward the arcs show where the price could [pull back](/pullback) to, and possibly bounce off of.

## The Formula for Fibonacci Arcs is

There is no formula for a Fibonacci arc, in spite of the fact that there are a couple of things to note while dealing with them. A Fibonacci arc converges at 23.6%, 38.2%, half, 61.8%, and 78.6% of the baseline. Many charting platforms just show 38.2%, half and 61.8% of course. Fibonacci arcs are half circles, yet can likewise be displayed as full circles whenever wanted.

## Step by step instructions to Calculate Fibonacci Arcs

There isn't anything expected to compute a Fibonacci arc, albeit, here are steps and guides to assist with understanding how they are drawn. Charting software will draw Fibonacci arcs for you.

1. In an uptrend, associate the latest swing high (A) with a huge prior swing low (B). This is the base line.
1. Assuming the base line goes from $10 to $20, the base line is $10 long, for instance. The arc will converge at 23.6%, half and 61.8% of that, plus some other levels referenced previously. For instance, 23.6% of $10 is $2.36, so the arc will converge at $20 - $2.36 = $17.64 on the chart. The half level will be at $15.
1. When the level is found that crosses the arc, draw a perfect circle utilizing point An as the anchor. For instance, envision utilizing a drawing compass. The pencil begins at the 23.6% level, and the anchor would go at point A. Turn the compass to draw a full or half circle. In the event that drawing a half circle, they just have to go up to point A. Do exactly the same thing for the other percentage levels.
1. The cycle is no different for a downtrend. Interface a swing low (A) to a swing high (B) to form the baseline. This time, compute the convergence point by taking the percentages of the base line in dollars and afterward adding them to A. Draw arcs that meet at the percentages (23.6%, half, etc) of the baseline, and utilize An as the anchor for drawing the circles.

## What Does the Fibonacci Arc Tell You?

Fibonacci arcs account for both time and price while showing expected support and resistance areas.

The arcs are derived from the base line that interfaces a high and a low. The half circle arcs show where the price might track down support or resistance later on. Following a price rise, the arcs show where the price could pull back to before starting to rise once more. Following a price decline, the arcs show where the price could rally to before starting to fall once more.

Arcs are viewed as dynamic support and resistance levels on the grounds that the arc will be at a marginally unique price as it bends through each progressing period of time.

Since arcs offer likely help and resistance at various levels over the long run, the indicator surmises that pullbacks that happen rapidly could be more serious (in dollar terms) than pullbacks that carve out opportunity to happen. For instance, following a vertical move, the arcs will rise over the long haul, meaning the particular support levels for the resulting pullback likewise rise over the long haul.

## The Difference Between Fibonacci Arcs and Fibonacci Retracements

[Fibonacci retracements](/fibonacciretracement) line up with Fibonacci arcs at the baseline convergence points. In the event that you draw Fibonacci arcs and Fibonacci retracements with a similar baseline, the retracement level will line up with where the arc converges the base line. For instance, both 23.6% levels ought to be at a similar price on the chart. Fibonacci retracements are horizontal levels, meaning they stay fixed over the long run. Arcs, then again, are just at the convergence point once. For each and every other period, they will be moving based on the range of the arc. Retracement levels are static, while arc levels are dynamic.

## Limitations of Using Fibonacci Arcs

Fibonacci arcs are intended to highlight areas of conceivable support and resistance, yet there are no confirmations the price will stop or reverse at these levels. Additionally, since there are numerous arcs, it isn't apparent in advance which arc will offer help/resistance, if any.

Fibonacci arcs are frequently combined with different forms of technical analysis, for example, chart examples and technical indicators. For instance, traders could utilize Fibonacci arcs to distinguish expected areas of support and resistance, however hold on until the price stops and afterward starts to reverse off the level (begins moving back in the [trending](/pattern) bearing) before making a trade in the trending course.

## Highlights
- Fibonacci arcs are based on Fibonacci numbers, which are found all through nature and some accept assistance forecast financial markets.
- Fibonacci arcs produce dynamic support and resistance levels that change over the long run as the arc rises or falls. All in all, the support and resistance level indicated by the arc changes marginally with each passing period.
- The vastness of an arc (which is consistently a half circle) is a function of both the distance and time a base line covers. The longer the base line the more extensive the arcs.
- The base line is commonly drawn between a critical high and low point, yet could likewise be drawn between huge [closing prices](/closingprice) to see areas between those two points which could be important later on.
- Fibonacci arcs are made by drawing a base line between two points.
