# Fair Market Value (FMV)

The fair market value of a home, which depends on the price a potential buyer might want to pay for it, is an important factor for the two sellers and buyers. You'll frequently see it abbreviated as FMV.

## What is fair market value in real estate?
Fair market value is the price that a willing buyer would pay a willing seller for a home in an open market, without current supply and demand conditions being available, makes sense of Tim Garrity, partner and broker at Copper Hill Real Estate in Philadelphia. In spite of the fact that Garrity isn't an appraiser, he is an experienced listing agent and brokerage owner.
As such, the two players would have sufficient information to continue with the sale, yet outside factors wouldn't be pertinent to the negotiation of price and terms.
"Essentially, it is what the buyer crowd sees the home to be value-wise," says Cara Ameer, a real estate agent at Coldwell Banker Global Luxury in Los Angeles.

## How fair market is calculated
Whether an agent is preparing a comparative market analysis (CMA) or an appraiser is finishing an appraisal report, fair market value is in many cases calculated by taking the value of at least three comparable homes, or comps, that have recently sold and getting an average, Garrity says.
For an appraisal, an appraiser looks at this group of homes and factors in any up-sides or negatives to each in view of certain highlights. For instance, in the event that the home being referred to were 1,500 square feet and one of the comps were 1,250 square feet, it very well may be a plus for the comp, however a minus for the house being appraised.
"This cycle helps portray what a home's value is, as most homes are not quite the same as each other," Garrity says.

## What fair market value assessments are utilized for
Real estate agents regularly utilize fair market value to decide a price or price range at which a home will sell while working with a seller or buyer to devise a listing or offer strategy.
Appraisers likewise consider fair market value in an appraisal report, which is completed during the home-buying process while financing is involved, or when a homeowner renegotiates. Albeit the appraised value of a home — the assessment of a single appraiser — isn't generally equivalent to fair market value, the appraisal report is as yet the most common method for finding it, Garrity says.
Outside of a real estate transaction, lawyers, government authorities and insurance companies likewise consider fair market value in different situations, like divorce, death, eminent domain and loss from a natural disaster.
For the two agents and appraisers, there are numerous ways of narrowing down a rundown of comps. Ameer researches active, under contract and sold properties, comparative in size and age, from the past 90 to 180 days. Nowadays, the later the sale, the better.
"Given the current pace of sales in many markets, thinking back 180 days right presently may show data that is too old as prices have emphatically increased in many markets from where they were six to 90 days prior," Ameer says.
She then picks the most applicable homes nearest in style and location to the one she's pricing, and adapts for different factors, for example,
- Square footage
- Type of garage
- Pool versus no pool
- Number of bathrooms
- Fireplace versus no fireplace
- Type of parcel (privacy, nearness, view)

These changes depend on a generally accepted scope of values in CoreLogic's Marshall and Swift Residential Cost Handbook.
"For instance, the value of a pool might be around $15,000 to $30,000 relying upon the size and highlights, a third vehicle garage bay might be valued around $5,000 to $7,000 and a full bath might be worth $5,000 to $7,000," Ameer says.
Appraisers use the handbook more so than real estate agents, however agents frequently talk with appraisers to remain current on changes.
After changes are made, the agent or appraiser normally has a "generally excellent thought of what the value is for the property," Ameer says.
## Other common methods to decide FMV
Beside the comps strategy, appraisers some of the time utilize what's called the cost approach to decide fair market value, particularly when the house is unique and there aren't numerous comps to weigh it against. In the cost approach, an appraiser considers the previous sale price of the parcel and estimates the cost of construction to replace the home on the property, factoring in depreciation and deducting that from the value.
A lesser-utilized third method is known as the income capitalization approach, which is generally saved for income or rental properties, and depends on how much income can be created from the home.
### Fair market value in the present market
The comps strategy is a well known method for deciding a home's fair market value, the price a buyer will pay in a given market.
In any case, in many markets today, there are homes selling above fair market value, so utilizing comps to create an offer strategy may not bring about a fruitful outcome for buyers in numerous offer circumstances.
"Numerous sellers all through the country are pushing their requesting that prices see what the market will bear, given the low supply/popularity market we are currently encountering," Ameer says. "This approach doesn't fill in too in a slowing market, where inventory levels are building and afz seller is frequently rivaling a great deal of options in their price range, including new construction."
Under additional balanced conditions, however, agents and appraisers frequently depend on the comps method, and at times the cost or income utilization approaches, to estimate fair market value. On the off chance that you're interested about the fair market value of your home, either formula would be a decent place to begin.
