# Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM)
## What Is an Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM)?

An original equipment manufacturer (OEM) traditionally is characterized as a company whose goods are utilized as parts in the products of another company, which then, at that point, sells the completed thing to users.

The subsequent firm is alluded to as a [value-added reseller](/value-added-reseller) (VAR) on the grounds that by enlarging or consolidating highlights or services, it enhances the original thing. The VAR works closely with the OEM, which frequently customizes designs in light of the VAR company's requirements and specifications.

## Grasping an Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM)

VARs and OEMs cooperate. OEMs make sub-gathering parts to sell to VARs. Albeit some OEMs really do make complete things for a VAR to market, they for the most part don't play a very remarkable direct job in determining the completed product.

A common model may be the relationship between an OEM of individual electronic parts and a company, for example, Sony or Samsung that collects those parts in making their HDTVs. Or on the other hand a maker of buttons that sells to Ralph Lauren its little latches customized with the letters RL stepped on them. Regularly, nobody integrated part from an OEM is recognized as playing an especially huge job in the completed product, which goes out under the corporate [brand](/brand) name.

Traditionally, OEMs zeroed in on [business-to-business](/btob) sales, while VARs marketed to the public or opposite end users. Starting around 2021, a rising number of OEMs are selling their parts or services directly to consumers (which, as it were, makes them a VAR).

For instance, individuals who build their own computers can buy graphics cards or processors directly from Nvidia, Intel, or retailers that stock those products. Likewise, if a person believes should do their own vehicle repairs, they can frequently buy OEM parts directly from the manufacturer or a retailer who stocks those parts.

One of the most fundamental instances of an OEM is the relationship between an auto manufacturer and a maker of auto parts. Parts, for example, exhaust systems or brake chambers are manufactured by a wide variety of OEMs. The OEM parts are then sold to an auto manufacturer, which then gathers them into a vehicle. The completed vehicle is then marketed to auto dealers to be sold to individual consumers.

There is a second, more current definition of OEM, normally utilized in the computer industry. In this case, OEM might allude to the company that buys products and afterward incorporates or rebrands them into another product under its own name.

For instance, Microsoft supplies its Windows software to Dell Technologies, which incorporates it into its personal computers and sells a complete PC system directly to the public. In the traditional feeling of the term, Microsoft is the OEM and Dell the VAR. In any case, the computer's product guide for consumers is probably going to allude to Dell as the OEM.

## Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) versus Aftermarket

An OEM is something contrary to the [aftermarket](/aftermarket-parts). An OEM alludes to something made specifically for the original product, while the aftermarket alludes to equipment made by one more company that a consumer might use as a replacement.

For instance, say a person needs to supplant their vehicle indoor regulator, made explicitly for their Ford Taurus by ABC Thermostats. They might buy the OEM part, which is a copy of their original ABC indoor regulator that was utilized in the original manufacturing of the vehicle. Or on the other hand they might buy an aftermarket part, an alternative made by another company. At the end of the day, assuming the replacement additionally comes from ABC company, it is an OEM; in any case, it is an aftermarket product.

Normally, consumers buy an aftermarket product since it's less expensive (the equivalent of a [generic](/generic-brand) medication) or more helpful to get. In any case, some of the time aftermarket producers do great work in manufacturing a specific part that it turns out to be notable to consumers, who actively search it out.

An illustration of this is the progress of Hurst Performance of Warminster Township, Penn., a manufacturer of stuff shifters for automobiles. Hurst shifters turned out to be so notable for their prevalent performance that vehicle buyers would demand having them as a replacement part, or at times would purchase and introduce them before the originals even required supplanting. Hurst likewise made OEM parts for muscle cars from several automakers.

## Special Considerations

This to some degree contradictory development in the utilization of the term OEM (which can likewise be utilized as a modifier, as in "OEM parts" or even an action word, as a manufacturer saying it plans to OEM another doohickey) is generally credited to the computer hardware industry.

Some VAR companies like Dell, IBM, and Hewlett Packard began to acknowledge branded parts from outside sources in their own products. So over the long run, OEM came to allude to companies that rebrand or straightforwardly utilize other manufacturers' products for resale.

The vast majority of this had to do with which company was responsible for [warranties](/guarantee), customer support, and different services, yet it likewise mirrored an unpretentious shift in the manufacturing dynamics. In one example, Dell stopped utilizing chips from anonymous makers and changed to Intel for the computer processors in its computers.

Since Intel is a brand name, it brought [added value](/valueadded) to Dell's computers. In addition to the fact that Dell advertised this noticeably (utilizing the trademark "Intel Inside!"), yet its marketing materials likewise suggested that Intel and Dell were equivalent partners in the processor and computer design. This is a difference with Dell just advising Intel how to build the processors, as it did with its old providers. All of this made Dell the OEM, both in the minds of companies providing the collected parts and in the public's brain (all things considered, individuals think of the completed hardware and software package they buy as "a Dell computer").
