Senkou Span B moves slower than Senkou Span An on the grounds that Span B is calculated utilizing 52 periods of data. Senkou Span An is calculated utilizing 26 periods and nine periods. The less periods utilized in Span A mean that the indicator will react speedier to price changes.

In the event that Senkou Span B is at the highest point of the cloud, this is generally considered [bearish](/bearmarket). Short-term prices (Span A) have fallen below the longer-term price midpoint (Span B). The Senkou Span lines give the midpoint of a price range since they are partitioning the sum of the high and the low by two.

At the point when Senkou Span An is forming the highest point of the cloud, it is considered [bullish](/bullmarket), since the shorter-term price (Span A) is moving over the longer-term midpoint price (Span B).

Leading Span An and Span B [crossovers](/crossover) may signal a trend change. At the point when Span A crosses above Span B, it might demonstrate the beginning of an uptrend. At the point when Span A crosses below Span B, a downtrend or [correction](/correction) might begin.

On the off chance that the price tumbles to these lines, it might bounce off of them. At the point when the price is below Leading Span An or potentially Span B, these lines are seen as giving resistance or potential areas to sell or [short sell](/shortselling).

The calculation is as follows:

1. Track down the high price during the last 52 periods.
1. Track down the low price during the last 52 periods.
1. Gather the high and low periods into a single unit, then partition by two.
1. Plot the value 26 periods into what's to come.
1. Repeat stages one through four when every period closes.

A [simple moving average](/sma) (SMA) sums up the closing prices over X number of periods, then, at that point, separates the outcome by X to give an average of the closing prices in general. Leading Span B doesn't work out an average; rather, it computes the midpoint of a 52-period range. These two indicators will look very changed on a chart. The Senkou Spans additionally are plotted 26 periods into the future, and that isn't the standard for a SMA.
