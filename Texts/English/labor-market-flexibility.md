# Labor Market Flexibility
## What Is Labor Market Flexibility?

Labor market flexibility is an important part of the [labor market](/labor-market). It allows companies to arrive at certain conclusions about changing their labor force in response to variances in the market and to assist with helping production.

Organizations can make changes to their labor pool based on factors, for example, employee hiring and terminating, compensation and benefits, and working hours and conditions. Companies don't have carte blanche, in any case, to execute a flexible labor market as a result of laws and policies that safeguard employees and the labor pool.

## How Labor Market Flexibility Works

Labor market flexibility alludes to how rapidly a firm answers changing conditions in the market by making alterations to its workforce. A flexible labor market allows employers to make changes in response to supply and demand issues, [the economic cycle](/economic-cycle), and other market conditions.

However, a really flexible labor market possibly exists when there are not many labor force regulations in place. At the point when this is the case, employers are able to set wages, fire employees, and change employee work hours freely. Furthermore, the changes can go one way or another.

During extreme economic times, for instance, an employer that has high flexibility can cut wages and increase the number of hours that employees are expected to attempt to support productivity. On the other hand, when the economy is strong, a similar employer might choose to give employees a slight raise and cut back on their hours.

> Labor unions can limit labor market flexibility by arranging higher wages, benefits, and better working conditions with employers.

Less flexible labor markets are subject to additional rules and regulations including [minimum wages](/minimum_wage), limitations on terminating, and different laws including employment contracts. [Labor unions](/labor-union) frequently have considerable power in these markets.

A portion of different factors that influence labor market flexibility incorporate employee skills and training, occupational mobility, least wages, parttime and impermanent work, and job-related data that employers make available to their employees.

Allies of increased labor market flexibility contend that it prompts lower [unemployment rates](/unemploymentrate) and higher gross domestic product (GDP) due to the potentially negative side-effects of tight labor market limitations. A firm might consider hiring a full-time employee, for instance, however be worried that the employee would be incredibly challenging to fire (should that demonstrate essential) and could claim costly laborer's compensation or sue based on supposed unfair treatment. The firm might decide rather to take on short-term contract workers.

Such a system benefits the somewhat small number of full-time employees with particularly secure positions, yet harms those outwardly — the individuals who must move between unreliable, [short-term gigs](/gig-economy).

Defenders of extreme labor market regulations, then again, claim that flexibility puts all the power in the hands of the employer, bringing about an insecure workforce. The labor movement started in the late eighteenth and nineteenth hundreds of years in the U.S. what's more, Europe in response to dangerous and dirty workplace conditions, very long moves, manipulative practices by management and proprietors — wage garnishment, dangers, and other maltreatment — and erratic excusals.

Employers had minimal incentive to guarantee that workplace wounds and passings were rare, since they confronted no ramifications for making hazardous conditions, and employees who could never again work were not difficult to replace.

### Least Wages
