## History of the Federal Housing Finance Agency

The FHFA was laid out under the Federal Housing Finance Regulatory Reform Act, a sub-act of the [Housing and Economic Recovery Act (HERA)](/housing-and-economic-recovery-act-hera) endorsed into law on July 30, 2008. It was made to assist with reinforcing the U.S. housing-finance system after the fallout from the subprime mortgage meltdown of 2007, which started a worldwide financial crisis and in the long run the [Great Recession](/great-recession).

The FHFA supplanted two elements: the Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight and the Federal Housing Finance Board, the original administrator of the FHLB system (it was made by the [Federal Home Loan Bank Act](/federal-home-loan-bank-act) of 1932). The FHFA assumed control over the legal and regulatory authority of these agencies, which stopped presence one year after HERA was passed.

The Housing and Economic Recovery Act's underlying aim was to reestablish public faith in the government-sponsored enterprises (GSEs) that backed and purchased home loans — specifically, Fannie Mae and [Freddie Mac](/freddiemac) — and the FHFA was to play a key job in that. It was enriched with "far greater specialists than its ancestors," as its director James Lockhart stated. Also, in fact, it immediately practiced that authority to assume responsibility for the two troubled GSEs.

## Federal Takeover of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac

As another agency, the FHFA immediately got the ball rolling: It utilized its powers to put Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac under conservatorship on Sept 6, 2008.

The two GSEs, which buy and guarantee mortgages issued through banks and different lenders, had been seriously hit by the subprime mortgage meltdown. In 2007, they started to experience large losses on their arrangement of loans; by 2008, they were billions of dollars in debt. Since Fannie and Freddie are by a long shot the largest mortgage market-producers in the U.S. — they have, in effect, a government-sponsored [monopoly](/monopoly) in a significant part of the country's secondary mortgage market — their concerns caused panic all through the banking and investment universes, filling the financial crisis.

Thus, in the harvest time of 2008, the FHFA stepped in. It set up for the U.S. Treasury to give the two $190 million in bailout money. Be that as it may, it additionally redid their boards of directors and started executing plans to reduce their losses and operational and credit risk.

Fannie and Freddie gradually returned to solvency. They paid back the $190 million. In September 2019, the Treasury and FHFA announced that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac could fire keeping their earnings to support capital reserves of $25 billion and $20 billion, separately.

In October 2019, FHFA delivered another Strategic Plan for the Conservatorships of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. The three broad objectives of the Strategic Plan are to guarantee that the enterprises:

1. Center around their core mission obligations to foster competitive, liquid, efficient, and strong (CLEAR) national housing finance markets that support sustainable homeownership and affordable rental housing;
1. Operate in a safe and sound way suitable for substances in conservatorship; and
1. Prepare for their possible exits from the conservatorships.

These objectives were reestablished in 2020 and 2021.
