# Proof of Elapsed Time (PoET)
## What Is Proof of Elapsed Time (PoET)?

Proof of elapsed time (PoET) is a [blockchain](/blockchain) network consensus mechanism that prevents high resource utilization and energy consumption; it keeps the cycle more efficient by following a fair lottery system.

The algorithm utilizes a randomly produced elapsed opportunity to choose mining rights and block victors on a blockchain network. By running a confided in code inside a secure environment, the PoET [algorithm](/algorithm) likewise upgrades transparency by guaranteeing lottery results are certain by outside participants.

## Grasping Proof of Elapsed Time (PoET)

A consensus mechanism is a method utilized by blockchain networks to check transactions and make more blocks. Proof of elapsed time (PoET) is a [consensus mechanism](/consensus-mechanism-cryptocurrency) frequently utilized on permissioned blockchain networks to conclude the mining rights or the block champs on the network. [Permissioned blockchain](/permissioned-blockchains) networks are types that require any future participant to recognize themselves before they are permitted to join.

The PoET network consensus mechanism necessities to guarantee two critical factors. To begin with, it guarantees that the participating nodes genuinely select a period that is to be sure random and not a more limited duration picked deliberately by the participants to win. Second, it lays out that the victor has completed the waiting time.

The PoET concept was concocted in mid 2016 by Intel Corporation (INTC), the chip manufacturing monster. It offers a readymade high-tech device to take care of the figuring issue of "random leader election." The imbued mechanism permits applications to execute confided in code in a protected environment, guaranteeing that the two requirements — randomly choosing the waiting time for every participating node and genuine completion of waiting time by the triumphant participant — are satisfied.

Related to different organizations, for example, the Linux Project and IBM, Intel sponsored the open-source Hyperledger Sawtooth project, which utilizes the PoET consensus mechanism. [Hyperledger Sawtooth](/hyperledger-sawtooth) is a distributed ledger solution that is both versatile and versatile for some purposes at the enterprise level.

## How Does PoET Work?

In view of the principle of a fair lottery system where each node is similarly liable to be picked, the PoET mechanism spreads the chances of winning across the biggest conceivable number of network participants.

Under PoET, each participating node in the network must hang tight for a randomly picked period; the first to complete the designated waiting time wins the new block. Every node in the blockchain network produces a random hang tight time and dozes for that predefined duration.

The one to wake up first — that is, the one with the most brief stand by time — wakes up and commits a new [block](/block-bitcoin-block) to the blockchain, broadcasting the important data to the whole peer network. A similar cycle then, at that point, rehashes for the discovery of the next block.

## How Is PoET Different from PoW?

Essentially, the workflow is like the consensus mechanism followed by Bitcoin's [proof of work (PoW)](/proof-work) algorithm, however without its high power consumption. It permits a node to rest and switch to different tasks for the predetermined time, in this way expanding the network's productivity.

> Proof of elapsed time doesn't advance decentralization and transparency like proof of work does in light of the fact that it requires a certificate to be issued to anybody that needs to join the network.

The mechanism of running believed code inside a secure environment likewise deals with numerous other network necessities. It guarantees that the believed code runs inside the secure environment and isn't alterable by any participant. It additionally guarantees that the outcomes are undeniable by participants or other permissioned substances, consequently upgrading the transparency of the network consensus.

PoET controls the cost of the consensus interaction and keeps it deft with the goal that it stays proportional to the value derived from the cycle, an essential requirement for the [cryptocurrency](/cryptocurrency) economy to prosper.

## Highlights
- The PoET workflow is like Bitcoin's proof of work (PoW) however consumes less power since it permits a node to rest and switch to different tasks for the predetermined time, consequently expanding network energy productivity.
- The node with the briefest stand by time will wake up first and win the block, consequently being permitted to commit another block to the blockchain.
- PoET follows a lottery system that spreads the chances of winning similarly across network participants, allowing each node a similar opportunity.
- The PoET algorithm creates a random hang tight time for every node in the blockchain network; every node must rest for that duration.
- Proof of elapsed time (PoET) is a consensus algorithm developed by Intel Corporation that empowers permissioned blockchain networks to figure out who makes the next block.
## FAQ
### What Is Hyperledger Sawtooth?
Hyperledger Sawtooth is a distributed ledger — like a blockchain — intended for enterprise utilizes like supply chain and logistics. It might be utilized for inventory management, accounting, or other business tasks that consume time and are inclined to blunder.
### Is There a Proof of Elapsed Time Coin?
PoET is basically utilized in Hyperledger Sawtooth. As of January 2022, there isn't a cryptocurrency that utilizes PoET.
### What Is the Difference Between Proof of Work and Proof of Elapsed Time?
PoW is a competitive work mechanism, where PoET is a random selection mechanism.
