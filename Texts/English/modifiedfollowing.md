# Modified Following
## What Is Modified Following?

Modified following is a form of [date rolling](/rolling-choice) that happens when a contractual transaction day falls on a holiday. Assuming this happens, the date is generally pushed forward or backward so it concurs with a business day. At the point when contracts are endorsed between parties in various districts with various banking days, then modified following is applied by the holidays of whichever party is making the payment as they will require banking services to start the transaction.

## Grasping Modified Following

An illustration of modified following is the business day convention. That's what this implied rule states in the event that the payment date on a [swap](/swap) or other contractual transaction doesn't fall on a banking day, the modified following date will be the next banking day. The exception to the rule is assuming the banking day stretches out into another month; in this case, parties will utilize the banking day that goes before the payment date.

## Modified Following and Swaps

A swap is an illustration of a contractual agreement where a payment date could be changed according to the terms of modified following. A swap is a derivative contract; in this contract, two parties exchange financial instruments, generally including cash flows in light of a notional principal amount.

Each cash flow includes one [leg](/leg) of the swap. One cash flow is generally fixed, while the other is variable (for example in view of a benchmark interest rate). Swaps don't trade on exchanges. All things considered, swaps are over-the-counter contracts between businesses or financial institutions, so a payment date is agreed upon among the two players as part of the contract. In the event that the payment date falls on a holiday, modified following could push it ahead or back in time so it falls on a business day, and the contract finishes.

## Modified Following and Bank Holiday

Modified following is at times required on the off chance that a transaction is set to happen on a [bank holiday](/bank-holiday). While bank holidays and stock market holidays don't necessarily in every case agree, either could make it challenging for payment to occur.

U.S. bank holidays generally incorporate the accompanying: New Year's Day (Jan. 1), Martin Luther King Day (the third Monday of January), President's Day (the third Monday of February), Memorial Day (the last Monday in May), Independence Day (July 4), Labor Day (the main Monday in September), Indigenous People's Day/Columbus Day (the second Monday in October), Veteran's Day (Nov. 11 or the work day nearest to it if November 11th falls on an end of the week), Thanksgiving Day (the fourth Thursday in November), and Christmas Day (Dec. 25).

Of these, five days might switch consistently: Martin Luther King Day, President's Day, Memorial Day, Labor Day, Indigenous People's/Columbus Day, and Thanksgiving Day. In this way, modified following makes it simpler to oversee contractual payments of derivatives without unequivocally listing each payment date and the exceptions inside a contract.

## Features
- To redress such a date, the effective date of the contract is normally moved onward or backward to the nearest business day.
- Modified following likewise helps settle transaction dates when national or bank holidays don't concur with stock exchange holidays.
- Modified following changes the official date explained in a contract when it falls on a holiday or bank holiday.
