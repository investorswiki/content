# Carmack Amendment
## What Is the Carmack Amendment?

The Carmack Amendment is a 1906 update to the Interstate Commerce Act of 1877, which manages the relationship between transportation companies and the owners of goods under shipment.

The Carmack Amendment limits the liabilities of these delivery companies, known as [carriers](/private-carrier), to loss or damage of the property itself.

## Grasping the Carmack Amendment

Before the Carmack Amendment, companies engaged with the transportation of goods across state borders were subject to state laws managing the liabilities of delivery companies to their clients. Carmack was an important step in the harmonization regulations applied to interstate transporters and interstate carriers from claims made by companies in excess of the value of the goods.

The Carmack Amendment is important for delivery companies to comprehend in light of the fact that it outlines the idea of their liability to their customers. Due to the different exemptions framed in the law, common sense would suggest that delivery companies should keep careful documentation of the nature and state of goods under their care.

One of the main highlights of Carmack is that it doesn't need the transporter to give proof of negligence, just that the goods were damaged. This makes the carrier obligated for the damage, paying little mind to how the damage was caused. The transporter is required to ensure that the things being delivered are in great shape when they were gotten by the carrier, that the goods were damaged after they were gotten and that the amount of damages can be measured.

The carrier is, in fact, held responsible for damages to the goods it shipped, without proof of negligence, except if it can demonstrate it was not careless or meets one of the special cases or exemptions. The carrier might be exempt from damage claims under special conditions, for example, damage brought about by a [Act of God](/act-god), like a cyclone or seismic tremor, the government, criminals, or inherent vice, really intending that there is something inherently temperamental about the product (e.g., profoundly combustible).

## Carmack and Bills of Lading

A [bill of lading](/uniform-bill-of-lading) addresses proof of delivery for when goods are delivered to their objective and finished paperwork for by the receiver. The substance of the bill reflects either the transporter's portrayals to the carrier of the terms of the service or the carrier's notes from its own inspection of the goods. In the event that the bill of lading notes the defective condition of the goods or their bundling, it is thought of "[claused](/claused-bill-of-lading)" or "fouled." If no imperfections are noted, it is viewed as a "spotless" bill of lading.

The bill of lading states that the carrier is responsible for loss, damage, postponement, and liability in the transportation of the goods for transporters from the time the carrier gets the goods until delivery is complete. The carrier is responsible for full [actual loss](/actual-complete loss). On the off chance that the receiver finds the freight damaged or unsuitable, the bill of lading can be utilized as a legal report to dispute the delivery of goods as per the provisions of Title 49 of the Code of Federal Regulations Section 1005, Section 14706, the Carmack Amendment.

## The Carmack Amendment and the U.S. Constitution

Before the [Great Depression](/great_depression), Congress adopted an exceptionally severe interpretation of the Commerce Clause, which permits it to direct interstate commerce. Interstate delivery plainly falls into the category of interstate commerce, thus Congress was long active in proclaiming regulations connected with transportation companies.

With an end goal to fight the Great Depression, Congress started enacting laws that didn't rigorously connect with interstate commerce, similar to the regulation of the securities industry. The Supreme Court at first opposed this new job, yet at last expanded its definition of what regulation of interstate commerce intended to incorporate these new activities.

## Features
- After the Great Depression, several exemptions and limitations were made to Carmack, making it today a seriously tangled piece of legislation.
- It overhauled the Interstate Commerce Act of 1877 to limit the liability of delivery carriers to that of property damage as it were.
