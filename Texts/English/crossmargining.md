# Cross Margining
## What Is Cross Margining?

Cross margining is the method involved with offsetting positions by which excess [margin](/margin) from a trader's [margin account](/marginaccount) is moved to another of their margin accounts to fulfill [maintenance margin](/maintenancemargin) requirements. It is allowing the trader to utilize their available margin balance across their accounts in general.

## Figuring out Cross Margining

Presented in the late 1980s when the rise of financial instruments met increased market [volatility](/volatility), the utilization of cross margining builds a company's liquidity and financing flexibility through reduced margin requirements and lower net settlements. It likewise prevents superfluous [liquidation](/liquidation) of positions and accordingly expected losses.

Before the foundation of cross margining, a market participant could experience liquidity issues assuming it had a [margin call](/margincall) from one [clearing house](/clearinghouse) that couldn't offset a position held at another clearing house. The cross margining system joins margin accounts for member firms so margin can be moved from accounts that have an excess of margin to accounts that require margin.

Toward the finish of each trading day, the clearing houses send settlement activity to organizations like the [Intercontinental Exchange](/intercontinentalexchange) (ICE) and the [Options Clearing Corporation](/occ) (OCC), which then, at that point, perform the estimations for clearing level margins and produce settlement reports to clearing members. [Prime brokerages](/primebrokerage) likewise furnish cross margining services by connecting with the clearing houses in the interest of their clients.

## Illustration of Cross Margining

Assuming that a client has different trading accounts that are margin accounts, it is better to margin them by means of cross margining rather than isolated margining. The primary explanation is that it is a decent [risk management](/riskmanagement) tool that prevents a superfluous liquidation of positions.

For instance, in the event that a trader has $5,000 in account A with a margin requirement of $2,000, and $3,000 in account B with a margin requirement of $4,000, the client can undoubtedly fulfill the $1,000 shortfall in account B from the $3,000 excess in account An in the event that they had a cross margining account set up.

In the event that the trader couldn't cross margin their accounts and didn't have any available [capital](/capital) at the moment to meet the shortfall in account B or couldn't take out the excess in that frame of mind due to a [minimum account balance](/least balance) of $5,000, then, at that point, they would need to liquidate positions in account B to reduce the margin requirement. In the event that the trader's positions at that moment were at a loss, they would cause a pointless trading loss by finishing off positions before a profit could be realized.

The benefit of a cross margined account is especially helpful in unstable markets that are seeing extreme vacillations by which the consistency of margin requirements is hard to measure. This is especially true for long-term strategies carried out by traders and investment funds.

## Special Considerations

The primary motivation for cross margining is the risk management of a portfolio of sophisticated or complex financial instruments. Cost savings from a more efficient placement of margin is secondary.

In addition, even however margin can be moved grating free among accounts to meet least requirements, traders should don't keep margin balances (over the requirements) too low, as this could limit flexibility in times of market volatility.
