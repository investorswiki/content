## What Is a Stock Split?

A stock split happens when a company increases the number of its shares to support the stock's [liquidity](/liquidity). Albeit the number of shares outstanding increases by a specific numerous, the total dollar value of all shares outstanding continues as before in light of the fact that a split doesn't fundamentally change the company's value.

The most common split ratios are 2-for-1 or 3-for-1 (sometimes meant as 2:1 or 3:1). This means for each share held before the split, every stockholder will have a few shares, individually, after the split.

## How a Stock Split Works

A stock split is a corporate action where a company issues extra shares to shareholders, expanding the total by the predefined ratio in view of the shares they held beforehand. Companies frequently decide to split their stock to bring down its trading price to a more comfortable reach for most investors and to increase the liquidity of trading in its shares.

Most investors are more comfortable purchasing, say, 100 shares of a $10 stock instead of 1 share of a $1,000 stock. So when the share price has risen substantially, numerous public companies wind up pronouncing a stock split to reduce it. Albeit the number of shares outstanding increases in a stock split, the total dollar value of the shares continues as before compared with pre-split sums, on the grounds that the split doesn't make the company more valuable.

A company's board of directors can decide to split the stock by any ratio. For instance, a stock split might be 2-for-1, 3-for-1, 5-for-1, 10-for-1, 100-for-1, and so on. A 3-for-1 stock split means that for each one share held by an investor, there will currently be three. All in all, the number of [outstanding shares](/outstandingshares) in the market will triple.

Then again, the price per share after the 3-for-1 stock split will be reduced by separating the old share price by 3. That is on the grounds that a stock split doesn't change the company's value as estimated by [market capitalization](/marketcapitalization).

## Special Considerations

Market capitalization is calculated by duplicating the total number of shares outstanding by the price per share. For instance, expect XYZ Corp. has 20 million shares outstanding and the shares are trading at $100. Its market cap will be 20 million shares x $100 = $2 billion.

Suppose the company's board of directors chooses to split the stock 2-for-1. Right after the split produces results, the number of shares outstanding would double to 40 million, while the share price would be divided to $50. Albeit both the number of shares outstanding and the market price have changed, the company's market cap stays unchanged at (40 million shares x $50) $2 billion.

A significant number of the best companies regularly see their share price return to levels at which they recently split the stock, leading to another stock split. Walmart, for example, split its stock 11 times on a 2-for-1 basis between the retailer's stock-market debut in October 1970 and March 1999. An investor who bought 100 shares in Walmart's [initial public offering](/ipo) (IPO) would have seen that stake develop to 204,800 shares over the course of the next 30 years with next to no extra purchases.

Should the company's stock price still not meet least pricing requirements, the company risks being [delisted](/delisting).
