Meta (META), formerly Facebook, has set a couple of BHAGs over the long haul, including to "make the world more open and associated" and "enable everybody to share anything with anybody."

Google (GOOGL) needs to "sort out the world's data and make it generally available and helpful." Given what these companies have accomplished as of now, it appears to be that setting BHAGs takes care of business.
