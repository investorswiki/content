# Aggregate Capacity Management
## What Is Aggregate Capacity Management?

Aggregate capacity management (ACM) is the method involved with planning and dealing with the overall capacity of an organization's resources. Aggregate capacity management plans to balance capacity and demand in a savvy way. It is generally medium-term in nature, rather than everyday or week by week capacity management.

The term "aggregate" signifies the way that this form of capacity management considers a resource like labor or production capacity altogether, without recognizing various types.

## How Aggregate Capacity Management Works

To act as an illustration of this concept, in a plant that fabricates different types of PCs, aggregate capacity management would consider the total number of PCs to be manufactured north of a three-month period, disregarding the sythesis of the product mix — work area, PC, or tablet PCs. An aggregate capacity plan expects the mix of various products and services will remain moderately consistent during the planning period.

Aggregate capacity management is generally a three-step process — measuring aggregate demand and capacity levels for the planning period, recognizing alternative capacity plans in case of demand vacillations, and picking a fitting capacity plan.

[Operations managers](/operations-management) are typically confronted with a forecast of demand, which is probably not going to be either certain or consistent. They will have their very own thought ability to fulfill this need, however before official conclusions are made, they must have quantitative data on both capacity and demand. So step one will be to measure the aggregate demand and capacity levels for the planning period.

The subsequent step will be to distinguish the alternative capacity plans that could be adopted in response to the demand changes. The third step will be to pick the most suitable capacity plan for their conditions. Demand [forecasting](/forecasting) is a major contribution to the capacity management decision. All things considered, there are three requirements from a demand forecast.

## Why Aggregate Capacity Management Is Important

An organization really should grasp the capacity of its resources. This information will help the business know and comprehend its production capacity and limitations and what will lead to additional business forecasting and brief supply of products to go to the customers.

Aggregate capacity management likewise assists a company with keeping up with the right amount of balance between the [demand and supply](/law-of-supply-demand) without worrying the resources. Resources can fluctuate from one company to another, however aggregate capacity considers both manual and machinery resources and doesn't actually separate between the two.

- ACM doesn't recognize the types of resources a firm has at its disposal.
- Aggregate capacity management (ACM) is a management strategy that tries to upgrade a firm's overall capacity utilization over its resources.
- ACM follows a 3-step process: measuring aggregate demand and capacity levels for the planning period, recognizing alternative capacity plans in case of demand variances, and picking a fitting capacity plan.
