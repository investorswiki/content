## What Is Group Depreciation?

Group depreciation joins comparative fixed assets into a pool with a common cost base for computing [depreciation](/depreciation) on financial statements. The assets grouped together ought to be comparative in the manner they function, or each [asset](/asset) ought to be small sufficient that it isn't viewed as material all alone.

Since modern [accounting software](/accounting-software) effectively records depreciation for individual assets, the utilization of group depreciation, otherwise called "composite depreciation", has become more uncommon.

## Figuring out Group Depreciation

Depreciation is a [accounting technique](/accountingmethod) that permits business owners to discount an asset's value bit by bit — commonly throughout the span of its [useful life](/usefullife) or life expectancy. As opposed to understanding the whole cost in year one, devaluing the asset empowers companies to spread out that cost and match it to associated revenues.

Companies generally make heaps of purchases throughout the long term, giving them various assets and expenses to keep track of. To make life more straightforward, it's occasionally conceivable to get around this exhausting exercise by deteriorating a group of comparable assets as a single entity, instead of individually.

When applied accurately, this can be accomplished without compromising exactness.

## Group Depreciation Requirements

As a general rule, group depreciation is intended to be utilized for various smaller things of lower cost. The [Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB](/fasb)), an independent nonprofit organization responsible for laying out accounting and financial reporting standards for companies in the United States, prescribes that unit depreciation is applied to fixed assets that have large [unit costs](/unitcost) and are nearly very few and that group depreciation be applied to assets that are huge in number and have relatively small values.

These are ideas, however, as opposed to requirements. Now and again, it is likewise feasible for larger, more costly things, including structures, to be pooled together for group depreciation purposes.
