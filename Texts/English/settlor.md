# Settlor Defined Legally

A settlor is the entity that lays out a trust. The settlor goes by several different names: contributor, grantor, trustor, and trustmaker. Despite what this entity is called, its job is to legally transfer control of an asset to a trustee, who oversees it for at least one beneficiaries. In certain types of trusts, the settlor may likewise be the beneficiary, the trustee, or both.

## Breaking down a Settlor

[Trusts](/trust) are intended to hold money, investments, or property for different purposes. Various types of trusts — testamentary trusts, living (inter vivos) trusts, [revocable trusts](/revocabletrust), irrevocable trusts, from there, the sky is the limit — safeguard assets in various ways. Trusts can work with a smooth and quick transfer of assets upon death, dispose of [probate](/probate) costs, limit [estate taxes](/estatetax), and guarantee that the settlor's assets are utilized in the manner planned. For instance, a trust can permit a parent to ensure a child doesn't waste an inheritance. Trusts likewise let the settlor choose, when they are completely mentally able, what might befall their assets in the event of mental disability or insufficiency.

Setting up a simple trust can be a modest task that the settlor can achieve with self improvement legal forms or a more confounded process including an attorney and costs of up to $2,000. If a bank or [trust company](/trustcompany) is selected as trustee, there are likewise administrative costs to keep up with the trust over the long run.

To perceive how the settlor's job functions, let's consider an illustration of a revocable [living trust](/living-trust). The settlor, Hailey, lays out the trust. She does this as opposed to composing a [will](/will) to figure out what will befall her assets after she dies. Like that, when Hailey dies, her assets will not need to go through probate, and since the most common way of distributing trust assets doesn't include the courts, her assets won't turn into a question of public record.

She puts every last bit of her assets — her home, her ocean side condo, different family treasures and several investment accounts — into the trust and retitles these assets in the trust's name. For the trustee — the person or company that will oversee and circulate the trust assets — Hailey picks a trust company. The trust's [beneficiaries](/beneficiary) upon her death will be her three children, however while she is alive, Hailey will be the beneficiary even however she is likewise the settlor. Since she has picked a revocable living trust, Hailey can make changes to it for however long she is alive. For instance, assuming that one of her children becomes fosters an addiction to drugs or is indicted for a crime, she can eliminate that child as a beneficiary.
