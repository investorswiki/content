# Deferred Interest Bond
## What Is a Deferred Interest Bond?

All a deferred interest bond, likewise called a deferred coupon bond, is a debt instrument that pays its interest that has accrued as a single payment made sometime in the not too distant future as opposed to in periodic augmentations.

## Understanding Deferred Interest Bond

A conventional bond pays interest periodically to investors until the bond develops, at which point, investors are repaid the [principal](/principal) amount. Certain types of bonds don't pay interest; all things considered, the [interest that accrues](/accruedinterest) over the life of the bond is paid out when the bond develops notwithstanding the principal. Such bonds are alluded to as deferred interest bonds.

For instance, a one-year deferred interest bond with a [par value](/parvalue) of $1,000 and an annual yield of 8% would pay the investor $80 interest + $1,000 initial investment for a total sum of $1,080 when the bond develops.

Most deferred interest bonds pay the accrued interest in full just upon [maturity](/maturity). These bonds are initially offered at a [deep discount](/deepdiscountbond) to captivate likely bondholders to buy these even however they realize that the normal periodic interest payments won't be impending.

A common form of deferred interest bond is one that doesn't make interest payments until a certain period has passed. Toward the finish of the deferred-interest period, the bond starts to pay interest on a periodical basis until its maturity date or [call date](/calldate). For instance, a bond with a maturity date of 10 years has a provision in its [trust indenture](/trust_indenture) that coupon payments are to begin four years after issuance. In this case, this bond has a zero-coupon for the initial four years, and afterward a fixed coupon for the leftover six years.

A deferred interest bond can be a decent decision for those hoping to set aside cash while building more interest than they could receive in a bank savings account or a [money market fund](/money-marketfund). Alternately, investors searching for periodic income may not track down these bonds an appealing investment for their portfolios.

## Model: Z-Bonds

A common type of a deferred interest bond is a [zero-coupon bond](/zero-couponbond) (z-bond), which pays no interest by any means except for offers appreciation in bond value through the par value. The difference between the purchase price and face value repaid at maturity is the interest earned on the bond for the investor. Since there are no payments prior to maturity, zero-coupons have no [reinvestment risk](/reinvestmentrisk). Zero-coupon bonds technically pay no interest except for are rather sold [at a discount](/at-a-discount), developing to face value.

## Model: Toggle Notes

One more type of deferred interest bonds is a [toggle note](/toggle-note) which can be utilized by giving firms with brief cash flow to raise debt while remaining above water during times of stressed cash flow without defaulting. A toggle note is a loan agreement that permits a borrower to concede an interest payment by consenting to pay an increased [coupon](/coupon) later on. Interest will, in effect, be paid for by causing extra debt, frequently at a higher rate of interest. For instance, in the event that a company decides to concede paying interest until the bond develops, its interest on the debt might increase from 7.8% to 9.1%.
