# Credit Card Encryption
## What is Credit Card Encryption?

Credit card encryption is a security measure used to reduce the probability of credit or debit card information being taken. Credit card [encryption](/encryption) involves both the security of the card, the security of the terminal where a card is checked, and the security of the transmission of the card's information between the terminal and a back-end computer system.

## Understanding Credit Card Encryption

Credit cards are an integral part of the payment interaction. Consumers expect that most businesses will acknowledge cards as a method of payment, as opposed to relying on cash to conduct transactions. Businesses give electronic terminals that a consumer can check their credit card through, with the terminals sending the card's identifying information to computer servers in order to confirm that the consumer has adequate funds.

## How Credit Card Encryption Works

At the point when a credit account holder makes a purchase with their card, the information, for example, the account number is scrambled by an algorithm. The intent is to make it difficult to access that information without the corresponding encryption key that lets the merchant and financial institution conduct their transactions. Until the information is decoded by the key, the information isn't usable, making it safe insofar as it remains locked.

> Since credit cards require the utilization of an electronic transfer of information, they can be presented to [third parties](/outsider) who can take the card's information. Types of fraud include skimming, [carding](/carding), and RAM scraping.

Card issuers utilize different methods to scramble credit cards. The magnetic strip on the back of a card is ordinarily encoded and must be perused by a card scanner. Relying entirely on the magnetic strip is a less secure method than requiring the utilization of a PIN-and-chip, in light of the fact that a [PIN](/individual ID number) makes it more challenging for taken credit cards to be authorized and utilized. A smart card with an electronic chip might be more earnestly for criminals and programmers to take information from, compared with different forms of encryption and security put in place to safeguard credit account information.

For transactions that don't need a card to be checked, like an online transaction or [in-app purchase](/inapp-purchasing), sites require both the credit card number on the front of the card and a CVV number situated on the back of the card to be utilized. Using a CVV keeps an individual from being able to utilize just a taken credit card number to conduct a transaction.
