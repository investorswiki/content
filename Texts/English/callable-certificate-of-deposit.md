# Callable Certificate of Deposit (CD)
## What Is a Callable Certificate of Deposit (CD)?

A callable certificate of deposit (CD) is a FDIC-insured [CD](/certificateofdeposit) that contains a [call feature](/callprovision) like different types of [callable](/callable-security) fixed-income securities. Callable CDs can be reclaimed (called away) ahead of schedule by the responsible bank prior to their stated maturity, as a rule inside a given time span and at a preset call price. This is most frequently done when interest rates move lower, permitting the responsible bank to stop paying CD holders higher than the overall rates.

Due to the possibility of the CD being called before maturity, which would bring about a loss of interest earnings and which presents [reinvestment risk](/reinvestmentrisk), interest rates on callable CDs are normally higher than those for customary CDs.

## Grasping a Callable CD

A callable CD has two features: a certificate of deposit and an embedded [call option](/calloption) owned by the CD issuer. An issuer will typically try to call back CDs when interest rates fall, since this will keep the issuer from paying fixed interest that is higher than the predominant market rates.The bank may then re-issue new CDs with lower interest rates.

A CD is basically a [time deposit](/timedeposit) issued by banks to investors, who purchase CDs to earn interest on their investment for a fixed period of time that might be higher than interest paid on [demand deposits](/demanddeposit). These financial products pay interest until they mature, at which point the investor can access the funds. In spite of the fact that it is as yet conceivable to pull out money from a CD prior to the maturity date, this action will frequently cause a [early withdrawal penalty](/withdrawal-penalty). A CD typically offers a higher rate of return than a standard savings account on the grounds that the funds are less liquid, but on the other hand is viewed as an okay investment as it is generally insured up to $250,000 by the [Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC)](/fdic) or [National Credit Union Administration (NCUA)](/ncua).

A callable security is one that can be reclaimed right on time by the issuer, permitting the issuer to refinance its interest-bearing securities. A bank adds a call feature to a CD so it doesn't need to keep paying a higher rate to the CD holder in the event that interest rates drop. Callable CDs frequently pay a [call premium](/callpremium) to the investor when reclaimed right on time, as an incentive for investors to take on the [call risk](/callrisk) associated with the investment.

## Special Considerations

The [call premium](/callpremium) is the amount over the [par value](/parvalue) of the CD expected to repay investors for the risk of being called away, and it typically diminishes as the CD approaches its maturity date. It is typically priced as an increase in the CD's yield to investors, and is plainly unveiled in the disclosure statement that specifies the terms of the CD to likely investors.

The [call date](/calldate) is the date up until which the bank can call back its outstanding CDs, and it is additionally remembered for the disclosure statement.

The expansion of call provisions to CDs makes reinvestment risk to investors. This is the risk that the time deposit might be retired early, constraining the investor to reinvest their proceeds in a CD paying lower interest.

## Illustration of a Callable CD

In the event that a bank issues a traditional CD that pays 4.5% to the investor, and interest rates fall to a point where the bank could issue a similar CD to another person for just 3.5%, the bank would be paying a 1% higher rate however long the CD might last. By utilizing a callable CD, the bank can decide to refinance it and reissue another CD at a 3.5% yield.

In the event that the bank issued the callable 4.5% CD to mature in two years yet set its most memorable call date following six months from the date of issuance, it can not retire its CD until those six months have gone by. This lockout period gives a guarantee to investors that 4.5% interest will be paid for half a year. Should the bank choose to call the CD by then, the loss of the higher interest rate will be fairly ameliorated by the lump-sum call premium the bank pays to the CD holder.

## Primary concern

Callable CDs shift the interest rate to you from the bank. For the higher risk, you'll will generally receive a higher return than you'd find with a traditional CD with a comparable maturity date. Before you invest, you ought to compare the rates of the two products. Then, at that point, think about which course you think interest rates are going from now on. Assuming you have worries about reinvestment risk and incline toward simplicity, callable CDs most likely aren't really for you.
