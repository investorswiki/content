# Risk Premium
## What is risk premium?
The individuals who take on riskier investments are compensated with a greater return. The risk premium is the amount the investor ought to hope to receive for risking the loss of their money for making the investment.
## More profound definition
The risk premium is the rate of return on an investment far beyond the risk-free or guaranteed rate of return.
To work out risk premium, investors must initially ascertain the estimated return and the risk-free rate of return. The estimated return, or the expected return, on a stock alludes to the amount of profit or loss that an investor anticipates from a specific investment.
The estimated return is a projection and is certainly not a guaranteed return. Investors can ascertain the estimated return by increasing the likely results by the percent chance of them happening and afterward adding those computations together.

For instance, on the off chance that the estimated return on an investment is 6 percent and the risk-free rate is 2 percent, then the risk premium is 4 percent. This is the amount that the investor desires to earn for making a risky investment.
