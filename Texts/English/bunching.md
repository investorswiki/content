# Bunching
## What Is Bunching?

Bunching is the consolidating of numerous [odd-lot](/oddlot) or [round-lot](/roundlot) orders for a similar security so they can be generally executed simultaneously. All impacted clients must consent to the bunching, otherwise called [block trades](/blocktrade), before the order is submitted.

Bunching likewise alludes to a pattern that shows up on a ticker tape when a series of same-security trades print consecutively, consistently.

## Understanding Bunching

Most securities trade in a standard number of units. A round part is normally 100 units (shares, contracts, and so forth) of the asset or a number that is equitably separated by 100. An odd part contains under 100 units. Frequently, bunching happens on the floor of a securities exchange when [traders](/stock-trader) and [brokers](/merchant) roll up small or surprisingly measured trade orders into one larger order and afterward trade it in one single transaction.

Bunching can be monetarily advantageous for [investors](/financial backer) with orders for under 100 shares of a particular security. Odd-part orders are challenging to match, thus extra charges for them are common.

Bunching trades provides a means for traders to treat all clients similarly, by collecting odd-parcel orders together for purchase or sale, and afterward breaking them down a short time later into the different client accounts through a process known as the allocation process. Generally, the allocation is done electronically through [order management systems (OMS)](/oms), which smoothes out the process and stay away from errors with respect to the trader.

There are no procedures for trade allocation laid out by regulatory bodies; these procedures are settled on a firm-by-firm basis. Be that as it may, all traders and advisors must be careful to carefully follow their company's procedures. Current best practices treat all clients similarly, without showing preference to any single client. Generally, allocations ought to be concluded before an order is put, and any partial fills ought to utilize a [pro-rata](/pro-rata) allocation formula. Accurate and definite documentation of packed trades is additionally essential.

## Singling out

Some deceitful informal investors participate in a bunching practice known as [cherry-picking](/carefully choosing), which looks to exploit normal changes in trading prices over the course of the day to select winning or losing trades and distribute them in a way that inclines toward the traders or their client's accounts.

This practice disregards the [Securities and Exchange Commission's](/sec) (SEC) regulations. For instance, a 2018 case including a Minneapolis commodities trading advisor found that the advisor, Christian Robert Mayer, was deceitfully filtering out winning trades from customer accounts and transferring them into his own account, by claiming that he had allocated them to some unacceptable accounts. The cheated customers were at last repaid $105,090.

To stay away from singling out, traders and advisors must carefully follow rules intended to keep away from abuse. Regulators vigorously examine bunching and trade allocation practices to guarantee that traders aren't utilizing carefully choosing to dupe customers. Firms must, in this way, survey all allocations made every day, as well as any special cases for the procedure. Anomalies must be reported to act as evidence in the face of regulatory examination.
