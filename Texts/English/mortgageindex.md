# Mortgage Index
## What Is a Mortgage Index?

A mortgage index is the benchmark interest rate a [adjustable-rate mortgage's](/arm) (Arm's) completely indexed interest rate depends on. An adjustable-rate mortgage's interest rate, a type of [fully indexed interest rate](/fullyindexedinterestrate), comprises of an index value plus a [ARM margin](/armmargin). The margin will in general be steady, however the index's value is variable. Several benchmark interest rates act as mortgage indexes.

It is otherwise called a [ARM index](/arm_index).

## Understanding Mortgage Indexes

Some common mortgage indexes incorporate the prime lending rate, the [one-year steady maturity treasury](/cmtindex) (CMT) value, the one-month, half year, and year [LIBORs](/libor), as well as the [MTA index](/mtaindex), which is a year moving average of the one-year CMT index.

The index that an adjustable-rate mortgage is tied to is an important factor in the decision of a mortgage. For instance, assuming that a borrower accepts that interest rates will rise from now on, the MTA index would be a more conservative decision than the one-month LIBOR index on the grounds that the moving average calculation of the MTA index makes a lag effect.

## Ways a Mortgage Index Influences Competition in Lending

The decision of mortgage index can meaningfully affect what a lender charges the borrower as mortgages are assessed at their designated stretches. The mortgage will indicate when the acclimations to the interest rate will be made, which could be at half year, one, little while year stretches for instance. Around then, the lender will make a recalculation of the interest utilizing the index and the margin to determine the new figure.

Each index has its own qualities that set it separated. For instance, the prime lending rate is centered around the United States as a market tied to the country's banking system. It is a short-term interest rate that sees common use by all forms of lenders, including [credit unions](/creditunion), banks, and different institutions. The prime rate is regularly utilized in the pricing of short-term and medium-term loans, or for changes at set spans on long-term loans. This index is steady all through the country to consider examinations on loans paying little heed to where they are offered.

For example, the [prime rate ](/primerate)will be similar in California or Maine, which makes the specific parts of the mortgages more the game changers in determining in the event that a loan is competitive or not. The margins on the loan and whether the interest is set below the prime rate all become components in looking at loan offers. A borrower who has magnificent credit may be offered a mortgage with an interest rate a lot of lower than the prime rate index, which could promise the customer that the loan is competitive.
