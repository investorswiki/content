# Essential Reparations Benefits
## What Are Basic Reparations Benefits?

In the insurance industry, fundamental reparations benefits are a type of [automobile insurance](/collision protection) that gives assistance medical expenses, lost income, and essential services following a fender bender. Critically, fundamental reparations benefits are a type of "no-issue" insurance option, implying that the benefits are paid whether or not the policyholder was responsible for the accident.

## How Basic Reparations Benefits Work

[Insurance policies](/insurance) fluctuate with respect to the coverage they give following a fender bender. For certain policies, the insurance coverage stretches out just to direct medical expenses or to the value of the vehicle.

Different policies incorporate [third-party liability coverage](/third-party-insurance) to cover legal costs and damages assuming that the policyholder is effectively sued for having caused the death or injury of someone else. Of course, more broad policies that cover a more extensive scope of potential claims will be more costly, requiring higher month to month [premiums](/premium).
