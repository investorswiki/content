## What Is Secular?

In finance, secular is a descriptive word used to allude to market activities that happen over the long term.

Secular can likewise point to explicit stocks or [stock sectors](/sector) unaffected by short-term trends. Secular trends are not occasional or [cyclical](/cyclical_industry). Instead, they stay consistent over the long haul.

## Understanding Secular

Investors and analysts expect secular [trends](/trend) and secular stocks to stay moving in a similar direction over the long term, maintaining a static trajectory paying little mind to current [economic conditions](/economic-conditions). While applying the term to the stock market, a secular market is the market's overall trend or direction for a long period of time. Further, secular trends might be vertically or descending in direction.

It is important for investors to identify secular trends in markets, not just short-term trends, to foster a long-term [investment strategy](/investmentstrategy). Instances of secular trends incorporate an aging population, which tends to have different spending and savings habits than a more youthful population, the expansion of a particular technology like the internet, the spotless energy movement, and the growth in [impact investing](/impact-investing).

Within the [stock market](/stockmarket), experts consider technology companies, for example, Netflix and Google parent Alphabet secular since short-term economic trends lastingly affect their long-term performance. David Kostin of Goldman Sachs, as reported by **CNBC** in March of 2018, thought of a list of the best secular growth stocks prime for investment. The short-list incorporates internet companies Amazon and Google's Alphabet as well as Domino's Pizza and Summit Materials. Goldman picked these companies since they developed sales by more than 10% over the three previous years and have robust and forward-looking potential.

A stock is secular when the associated company [earnings](/earnings) stay constant paying little mind to other trends happening within the market. Companies are often secular when the primary business relates to [consumer staples](/consumerstaples) or products that most families consistently use. Consumer staples can incorporate personal care items, for example, cleanser and toilet paper, different food-item producers, and certain pharmaceutical companies.

> Secular stocks are altogether different from [cyclical stocks](/cyclicalstock), which are securities whose price is impacted by the movement in the overall economy due to consumer buying power.

## Special Considerations

Secular movements can continue in either a positive or negative direction. Therefore, the term doesn't generally mean growth. Investors might be secular [bears](/bear) or secular [bulls](/bull).

Additionally, secular can allude to subtle or dramatic movements as the term doesn't identify the degree of progress. The principal attributes are the long-term nature of the movement and the lack of impact of short-term trends on associated activity.

In his book, **Stocks for the Long Run (McGraw-Hill Education, 5th edition**, 2014), Jeremy Siegel, an economics Ph.D., and finance teacher at the Wharton School, University of Pennsylvania, contends that equity securities-particularly U.S. equities-are secular and will probably outperform the other major [asset classes](/assetclasses) secularly or over the long term.

In support of his argument, Siegel points to the 130 years between 1871 and 2001. During any rolling 30-year period within this timeframe, stocks outperformed any remaining asset classes, especially [bonds](/bond) and [T-bills](/treasurybill). Most experts concur that a 30-year period constitutes a secular trend.

> While experts believe them to be long term, secular trends are not really permanent.
