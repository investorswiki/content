# Wage Push Inflation
## What Is Wage Push Inflation?

Wage push inflation is an overall rise in the cost of goods and services that outcomes from a rise in wages. To keep up with [corporate profits](/corporate-profits) after an increase in wages, employers must increase the prices they charge for the goods and services they give. The overall increased cost of goods and services circularly affects the wage increase; in the end, as goods and services in the market overall increase, higher wages will be expected to make up at the increased costs of [consumer goods](/consumer-goods).

## Understanding Wage Push Inflation

Companies can increase wages for a number of reasons. The most common justification for raising wages is an increase in the lowest pay permitted by law. The federal and state legislatures have the power to increase the lowest pay permitted by law.

Consumer goods companies are additionally known for making incremental wage increases for their workers. These lowest pay permitted by law increases are a leading factor for wage push inflation. In consumer goods companies particularly, wage push [inflation](/inflation) is profoundly pervasive, and its effect is a function of the percentage increase in wages.

## Industry Factors

Industry factors likewise play a part in driving wage increases. In the event that a specific industry is developing quickly, companies could raise wages to draw in ability or give higher compensation to their workers as an incentive to help business growth. All such factors affect the goods and services the company gives.

Financial analysts track wages closely due to their wage push inflation effects. Wage push inflation has an inflationary spiral effect that happens when wages are increased and businesses must — to pay the higher wages — charge something else for their products as well as services. Also, any wage increase that happens will increase the money supply of consumers.

With a higher money supply, consumers have seriously spending power, so the demand for goods increases. An increase in demand for goods then increases the price of goods in the more extensive market. Companies charge something else for their goods to pay higher wages, and the higher wages additionally increase the price of goods in the more extensive market.

As the cost of goods and services rises at the companies paying higher wages and in the more extensive market overall, the wage increase isn't as useful to employees, since the cost of goods in the market has additionally risen. Assuming prices stay increased, workers in the end require another wage increase to make up for the [cost of living](/cost-of-living) increase. The percentage increase of the wages and prices and their overall effect on the market are key factors driving inflation in the economy.

## Illustration of Wage Push Inflation

In the event that a state raises the lowest pay permitted by law from $5 to $20, a company must pay its employees $20; nonetheless, presently its cost of creating its goods and services has gone up in light of the fact that its cost of labor is currently more costly. To make up for the increase in costs, the company must increase the prices of its products on the market. But since the goods and services become more costly, the initial $15 raise in wages isn't sufficient to push a consumer's [purchasing power](/purchasingpower), and the wage must be raised once more, hence causing an inflationary spiral.
