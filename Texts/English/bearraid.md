A bear-raid target is generally a company that is going through a difficult period, since its weak position makes it simple grain for short sellers. While short selling is legal, composed short selling is seen as market manipulation by the [Securities and Exchange Commission](/sec) (SEC), and spreading false reports is tantamount to fraudulent activity.

In a normal bear raid, short sellers might scheme ahead of time to discreetly lay out large [short positions](/short) in the target stock. Since the short interest in the stock builds the risk of a [short squeeze](/shortsqueeze) that can cause substantial losses for the shorts, the short sellers can't stand to stand by without complaining for a really long time until their short strategy works out.

The next step in the bear raid is likened to a slanderous attack, with murmurs and bits of gossip about the company spread by obscure sources. These tales can be whatever depicts the target company in a negative light, for example, claims of accounting fraud, a SEC investigation, an earnings miss, financial challenges, etc. The tales might make nervous investors exit the stock in huge numbers, driving the price down further and giving the short sellers the profit they are searching for.

## Special Considerations

They may likewise voice their genuine concerns. However long the data isn't intentionally false and the shorts are not intriguing with one another, a stock might see downward pressure due to the selling and expanding negative news. Many individuals will allude to this natural market behavior as a bear raid.

## Bear Raids as an Excuse at Falling Stock Costs

At the point when a stock price falls, especially when the company is entangled in some debate, owners of the stock frequently attribute the falling price to bears or short sellers. Short sellers have been undoubtedly somewhat faulted for most major [stock market crashes](/stock-market-slump) ever. Regularly short sellers are not the reason for falling prices, individuals who are selling current holdings are. Short interest can be followed by means of the [short interest](/shortinterest) figures.

Yet, short sellers really play a vital job in the markets. Frequently the short sellers uncover or expose major problems inside companies. Generally speaking, these are not manufactured stories intended to briefly push the price down, yet undeniable realities which could incredibly influence the value of the company. While the vast majority are pushing uplifting news to drive prices up, the bears present the contrary side of the contention, assisting stocks with remaining closer to their true value.

The key difference between an illegal bear raid and short sellers communicating their concern about a company is whether the short sellers have connived and are spreading false data. In some cases this isn't known for quite a while after the raid starts.

## Illustration of a Legal Bear Raid in the Pound Sterling

Quite possibly of the most notable exchange history is generally alluded to as a bear raid, or currency raid, yet it was legal on the grounds that it didn't include collusion and depended on sound thinking and not false reports.

In 1992 [George Soros](/soros) started selling the British pound. In currencies, while "shorting" is utilized, one currency is just exchanged for another currency. So by selling pounds, Soros was buying different currencies against the pound.

Soros was selling pounds since he accepted that Britain would not be able to hold their currency inside the band stipulated by the European [Exchange Rate Mechanism](/exchange-rate-mechanism) (ERM). This mechanism was intended to balance out exchange rates in Europe and required that the pound stay inside 6% of other ERM currencies. The problem was that Britain had a [inflation](/inflation) rate far higher than a few different countries in the ERM, similar to Germany.

The ERM forced Britain to hold their currency up, inside the band, at misleadingly high levels. Soros saw this and accepted that at last Britain would not be able to hold the currency in the band for a really long time and would ultimately need to abandon the ERM. With the currency as of now not falsely expanded by Britain buying pounds with an end goal to hold the currency in the band, the pound would fall.

On September 16, 1992, Britain deserted the ERM after several last-ditch endeavors to support the currency â€” like raising interest rates from 10% to 12%, and afterward saying they would raise the rates to 15%, albeit that last raise didn't happen as expected.

In the wake of leaving the ERM the [GBPUSD](/gbp-usd-british-pound-us-dollar-currency-pair) fell over 25% by December. The legal bear raid was a triumph, and Soros made roughly $1 billion for seeing the problem with the pound.
