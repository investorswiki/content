# Pushdown Accounting
## What Is Pushdown Accounting?

Pushdown accounting is a bookkeeping method utilized by companies to record the purchase of another company. The acquirer's accounting premise is utilized to prepare the [financial statements ](/financial-statements)of the purchased entity. Simultaneously, the [assets](/asset) and [liabilities](/risk) of the target company are refreshed to mirror the purchase cost as opposed to the historical cost.

This method of accounting is an option under U.S. [Generally Accepted Accounting Principles](/gaap) (GAAP) yet isn't accepted under the [International Financial Reporting Standards](/ifrs) (IFRS) accounting standards.

## How Pushdown Accounting Works

At the point when a company purchases another company, accountants must record the transaction exhaustively, including the value of the assets and liabilities of the company that have been purchased. In pushdown accounting, the target company's assets and liabilities are [written up](/writeup) (or [down](/writedown)) to mirror the purchase price.

As indicated by the U.S. [Financial Accounting Standards Board](/fasb) (FASB), the total amount that is paid to purchase the target turns into the target's new [book value](/bookvalue) on its financial statements.

Any gains and losses associated with the new book value are "pushed down" from the acquirer's to the acquired company's [income statement](/incomestatement) and [balance sheet](/balancesheet). In the event that the purchase price surpasses [fair value](/fairvalue), the excess is recognized as [goodwill](/goodwill), which is a [intangible asset.](/intangibleasset)

In pushdown accounting, the costs incurred to procure a company show up on the separate financial statements of the target, as opposed to the acquirer.

It very well may be useful to think of pushdown accounting as another company that is made utilizing borrowed money. Both the debt and the assets acquired are recorded as part of the new [subsidiary](/subsidiary).

## Illustration of Pushdown Accounting

Say Company ABC chooses to purchase its rival, Company XYZ, which is valued at $9 million.

ABC is purchasing the company for $12 million, which translates to a [premium](/premium). To finance its [acquisition](/acquisition), ABC gives XYZ's shareholders $8 million worth of ABC shares and a $4 million cash payment, which it raises through a [debt offering](/debt-issue).

Even however ABC acquires the money, the debt is recognized on XYZ's balance sheet under the liabilities account. What's more, the interest paid on the debt is recorded as an expense to the acquired company's balance sheet.

In this case, XYZ's net assets, that is assets minus liabilities, must rise to $12 million, and goodwill will be recognized as $12 million - $9 million = $3 million.
