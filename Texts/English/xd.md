## What Is XD?

XD is a symbol used to imply that a security is trading ex-dividend. An alphabetic qualifier acts as shorthand to enlighten investors key information regarding a specific security in a stock quote. At times X alone is utilized to demonstrate that the stock is trading [ex-dividend](/ex-dividend).

Qualifiers can shift contingent upon where the stock is quoted, in light of the fact that the different news and market information benefits that give stock quotes might utilize various qualifiers. These symbol letters might happen as part of a display on a broker's trading platform, on a charting program, or in a convenient distributed report.

## Figuring out XD

A dividend is a distribution of part of a company's earnings to the company's [shareholders](/shareholder). At the point when a stock is trading ex-dividend, the current stockholder has received a recent dividend payment and whoever purchases the stock won't receive the dividend. The stock's price is probably going to be lower subsequently.

There are many qualifiers that connect with dividends. For example, - j as a postfix demonstrates that the stock paid a dividend before in the year yet currently doesn't carry a dividend.

## Contrasting XD And the Record Date

You'll have to take a gander at two important dates to figure out who ought to get a dividend — the "ex-date" (or XD) and the [record date](/recorddate).

An investor must be on the company's books as a shareholder to receive a dividend. When the company sets the record date, the ex-dividend date is set. The ex-dividend date for stocks is generally set one business day before the record date. An investor who purchased shares before the ex-dividend date will get the impending dividend. On the off chance that a purchase occurred on or after the ex-dividend date, the seller gets the dividend.

Companies additionally utilize the record date to decide to whom to send financial reports, [proxy statements](/proxystatement), and other required information.

## Special Rules for Determining XD

In the event that a dividend is 25% or a greater amount of the stock's value, special rules will apply to decide the ex-dividend date. At the point when this occurs, the ex-dividend date is deferred until one business day after the dividend is paid.

At times a company delivers a dividend as stock as opposed to cash — either as extra shares in the company or in a [subsidiary](/subsidiary) that is being veered off. Setting the ex-date for stock dividends might be not the same as cash dividends. It will be set the primary business day after the stock dividend is paid (and is likewise after the record date).

Selling before the ex-dividend date incorporates an obligation to deliver any shares acquired because of the dividend to the buyer of your shares since the seller just receives an I.O.U. from their broker for the extra shares.

As per the [Securities and Exchange Commission](/sec) (SEC), the day you can sell your shares without being committed to deliver the extra shares is "not the primary business day after the record date, yet ordinarily is the principal business day after the stock dividend is paid."
