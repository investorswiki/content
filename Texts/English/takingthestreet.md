## What is Taking the Street

Taking the street is the practice of rapidly buying a prevailing position in one stock determined to sell the stock, frequently to similar institutions from which it was purchased, at a profit.

Taking the street is a practice which could give off an impression of being a valuable generally safe, short-term trading strategy. An institution with deep pockets and sophisticated market information, frequently a hedge fund, knows that [market makers](/marketmaker) need to keep an inventory of a given stock.

## Grasping Taking the Street

Market makers, at times alluded to as [specialists](/subject matter expert) on the NYSE, depend on their inventories to handle trades for individual and institutional traders the same. This inventory is significant to the business model of a market maker. Without shares close by, the market maker is helpless before the market to fill trades.

Taking the street depends on three assumptions.

- First is the assumption that the market makers will be forced to renew their inventories by repurchasing shares from the firm endeavoring to take the street. In the event that one more institution likewise stands firm on a critical foothold in the stock, the market maker ought to have the option to revamp its inventory at a lower price.
- The subsequent assumption is that other market forces, for example, adverse financial outcomes or short selling, won't intercede to drive the share price down.
- At long last, the firm seeking to take the street must have the resources to rapidly buy a substantial position in that stock so it doesn't drive its purchase price sufficiently high to sabotage its strategy.

The strategy is bound to succeed in the event that the stock is gently traded and has less market makers. Under these conditions, the firm seeking to take the street is in a position of higher market power to both store up a prevailing position and to force market makers to recharge their inventories from the street taker.

## Taking the Street versus Cornering the Market

Taking the street and cornering the market are terms which are some of the time befuddled and include comparative principles yet contrast in timing and, in some cases, in legitimateness. Both depend on gathering a market position which permits an institution to apply control over price vacillations. Taking the street happens in a short period, frequently that very day of trading, while at the same time [cornering the market](/corneramarket) generally portrays a more drawn out term strategy.

Cornering the market is bound to include market manipulation, and many case studies exist in which this manipulation has grabbed the eye of regulators. A classic model, as reported by **Bloomberg News**, includes Salomon, the Steinhardt Management Company, and the Caxton Corporation. In this case, the cornering the market was on U.S. Treasury bonds during the 1990s. Numerous different cases have occurred in global commodities markets.

## Highlights
- Taking the street is when investors take a predominant position in one stock and exchange it back to a similar institution from which it was purchased, at a profit.
- Taking the street is not quite the same as cornering the market, which is a more extended term strategy.
- The strategy is bound to succeed when there are not many outside factors, like light trading and less market makers, influencing its price.
