## What Is Positive Correlation?

A positive correlation is a relationship between two variables that move in tandem â€” that is, in a similar course. A positive correlation exists when one variable declines as the other variable reductions, or one variable increases while different increases.

## Understanding Positive Correlation

A perfectly positive correlation means that 100% of the time, the variables being referred to move together by precisely the same percentage and heading. A positive correlation should be visible between the demand for a product and the product's associated price. In circumstances where the accessible supply remains something very similar, the price will rise assuming demand increases.

In statistics, a perfect positive correlation is addressed by the [correlation coefficient](/correlationcoefficient) value +1.0, while 0 demonstrates no correlation, and - 1.0 shows a perfect inverse (negative) correlation.

Moreover, gains or losses in certain markets might lead to comparative developments in associated markets. As the price of fuel rises, the prices of airline tickets additionally rise. Since planes expect fuel to operate, an increase in this cost is frequently passed to the consumer, leading to a positive correlation between fuel prices and airline ticket prices.

A positive correlation doesn't guarantee growth or benefit. All things considered, it is utilized to signify any at least two variables that move in a similar bearing together, so when one increases, so does the other. However, the presence of a correlation doesn't be guaranteed to demonstrate a causal relationship between variables.

Correlation is a form of dependency, where a shift in one variable means a change is possible in the other, or that certain realized variables produce specific outcomes. An overall model should be visible inside complementary product demand. In the event that the demand for vehicles rises, so will the demand for vehicular-related products and services, like tires. An increase in one area affects complementary industries.

In certain circumstances, positive mental reactions can cause positive changes inside an area. This can be demonstrated inside the financial markets, in situations where general positive news about a company leads to a higher stock price.

## Positive Correlation in Finance

A simple illustration of positive correlation includes the utilization of an interest-bearing savings account with a set interest rate. The more money that is added to the account, whether through new deposits or earned interest, the more interest that can be accrued. Likewise, a rise in the interest rate will connect with a rise in interest generated, while a diminishing in the interest rate causes a lessening in real interest accrued.

Investors and analysts additionally see how stock developments associate with each other and with the more extensive market. Most stocks have a correlation between one another's price developments some place in the reach, with a coefficient of 0 showing no relationship at all between the two securities. A stock in the online retail space, for instance, possible has little correlation with the stock of a tire and auto body shop, while two comparable retail companies will see a higher correlation. This is on the grounds that organizations that have totally different operations will create various products and services utilizing various inputs.

A brick-and-mortar book retailer, then again, is probably going to have a negative correlation with the stock of Amazon.com, as the online retailer's notoriety is ordinarily terrible information for traditional book stores. The stock of the famous payment processor PayPal is probably going to be positively related with the stocks of online retailers that utilization its services. On the off chance that the stocks of eBay, Amazon, and Best Buy get due to increased online revenue, all things considered, PayPal will experience a comparative lift as its expense driven income picks up and positive earnings reports empower investors.

## Beta and Correlation

Beta is a common measure of how connected an individual stock's price is with the more extensive market, frequently involving the S&P 500 index as a benchmark. Assuming a stock has a [beta](/beta) of 1.0, it shows that its price activity is emphatically connected with the market. A stock with a beta of 1.0 has a systematic risk, however the beta calculation can't distinguish any unsystematic risk. Adding a stock to a portfolio with a beta of 1.0 adds no risk to the portfolio, yet it likewise doesn't increase the probability that the portfolio will give an excess return.

A beta of under 1.0 means that the security is hypothetically less unpredictable than the market, meaning the portfolio is safer with the stock included than without it. For instance, utility stocks frequently have low betas since they will quite often move more slowly than market averages.

A beta that is greater than 1.0 demonstrates that the security's price is hypothetically more unpredictable than the market. For instance, on the off chance that a stock's beta is 1.2, being 20% more unstable than the market is assumed. Technology stocks and small covers will quite often have higher betas than the market benchmark. This shows that adding the stock to a portfolio will increase the portfolio's risk, yet additionally increase its expected return.

A few stocks even have negative betas. A beta of - 1.0 means that the stock is inversely connected to the market benchmark as though it were an inverse, mirror picture of the benchmark's trends. Put options or inverse ETFs are intended to have negative betas, yet there are a couple of industry gatherings, similar to gold excavators, where a negative beta is likewise common.

## Positive Correlation versus Inverse Correlation

In statistics, positive correlation portrays the relationship between two variables that change together, while a [inverse correlation](/inverse-correlation) depicts the relationship between two variables which change in contradicting headings. Inverse correlation is at times depicted as negative correlation. Instances of positive correlations happen in the vast majority's daily lives. The more hours an employee works, for example, the bigger that employee's paycheck will be toward the week's end. The more money is spent on advertising, the more customers buy from the company.

Inverse correlations depict two factors that teeter-totter relative to one another. Models incorporate a declining bank balance relative to increased spending habits and diminished gas mileage relative to increased average driving speed. One illustration of an inverse correlation in the world of investments is the relationship among stocks and bonds. As stock prices rise, the bond market will in general decline, just as the bond market in all actuality does well when stocks are underperforming.

It is important to understand that correlation doesn't be guaranteed to infer causation. Variables An and B could rise and fall together, or A could rise as B falls, yet it isn't generally a fact that the rise of one factor straightforwardly impacts the rise or fall of the other. Both might be brought about by an underlying third factor, for example, commodity prices, or the apparent relationship between the variables may be a happenstance.

The number of individuals associated with the Internet, for instance, has been expanding since its beginning, and the price of oil has generally moved vertically over a similar period. This is a positive correlation, yet the two factors without a doubt have no meaningful relationship. That both the population of Internet users and the price of oil have increased is logical by a third factor, in particular, general increases due to time elapsed.

## Highlights

- Beta is a common measure of market correlation, normally involving the S&P 500 index as a benchmark.
- A positive correlation is a relationship between two variables that will quite often move in a similar bearing.
- A positive correlation exists when one variable will in general diminish as the other variable reductions, or one variable will in general increase when different increases.
- A beta of 1.0 portrays a stock that is perfectly connected with the S&P 500. Values higher than 1.0 portray stocks that are more unpredictable than the S&P 500, while lower values depict stocks that are less unstable.
## FAQ
### Does Correlation Imply Causation?
Correlation doesn't need causation, and it is a common coherent fallacy to accept in any case. At the point when two variables are positively associated, that doesn't be guaranteed to mean that one variable causes changes in the other. The two variables might be impacted by an obscure third factor, or the apparent relationship between the variables may be a fortuitous event.
### What Is the Relationship Between Beta and Positive Correlation?
Beta is a common measure of the correlation between an individual stock and the more extensive market, frequently involving the S&P 500 index as a benchmark. A beta value greater than zero demonstrates that the stock is positively corresponded with the market, meaning that its share price will in general rise when the market rises. In the event that a stock has a beta under 1.0, its developments will be smaller than the developments of the more extensive market. A beta higher than 1.0 shows that the stock will vacillate more than the market as a whole.
### What Is an Example of Positive Correlation?
One illustration of positive correlation is the relationship among employment and inflation. High levels of employment expect employers to offer higher salaries to draw in new workers, and higher prices for their products to fund those higher salaries. On the other hand, periods of high unemployment experience falling consumer demand, bringing about descending pressure on prices and inflation.
### What Is Inverse Correlation?
A positive correlation depicts a relationship between variables that move together, and an inverse correlation portrays variables that will quite often move in inverse headings. This may likewise be alluded to as a negative correlation. In investing, negative correlations are indicated by beta values below zero: a beta of - 1.0 demonstrates a stock whose developments are a mirror inverse of the benchmark's trends.
