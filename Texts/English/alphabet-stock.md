## What Is Alphabet Stock?

An alphabet stock alludes to a separate class of [common stock](/commonstock) that is tied to a specific subsidiary of a corporation. All the more comprehensively, it alludes to shares of common stock that are recognized somehow or another from other common stock of a similar company.

Alphabet stock might have different [voting rights](/votingright) from the parent company's stock.

## Understanding Alphabet Stock

This unit turns into a [subsidiary](/subsidiary) of the acquirer, and holders of the alphabet stock are simply qualified for the earnings, dividends, and rights of the subsidiary, not the whole acquirer. A comparable situation would be the issuance of [tracking stock](/trackingstocks), where a firm issues a subclass of shares on an existing subsidiary.
