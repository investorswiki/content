# Invoice Financing
## What is Invoice Financing?

Invoice financing is a way for businesses to borrow money against the amounts due from customers. Invoice financing assists businesses with further developing cash flow, pay employees and providers, and reinvest in operations and growth sooner than they could in the event that they needed to hold on until their customers paid their balances in full. Businesses pay a percentage of the invoice amount to the lender as a fee for borrowing the money. Invoice financing can tackle issues associated with customers consuming a large chunk of the day to pay as well as hardships getting different types of business credit.

Invoice financing is otherwise called "[accounts receivable financing](/accountsreceivablefinancing)" or just "receivables financing."

## Understanding Invoice Financing

At the point when businesses sell goods or services to large customers, for example, wholesalers or retailers, they typically do as such on credit. This means that the customer doesn't need to pay immediately for the goods that it purchases. The purchasing company is given an invoice that has the total amount due and the bill's due date. Notwithstanding, offering credit to clients ties up funds that a business could somehow use to invest or develop its operations. To finance slow-paying [accounts receivable](/accountsreceivable) or to meet short-term liquidity, businesses might opt to finance their invoices.

Invoice financing is a form of short-term borrowing that is extended by a lender to its business customers in light of unpaid invoices. Through invoice factoring, a company sells its accounts receivable to further develop its [working capital](/workingcapital), which would furnish the business with immediate funds that can be utilized to pay for company expenses.

## Invoice Financing From the Lender's Perspective

Invoice financing benefits lenders in light of the fact that, not at all like broadening a [line of credit](/lineofcredit), which might be [unsecured](/unsecured) and leave little recourse on the off chance that the business doesn't repay what it borrows, invoices act as [collateral](/collateral) for invoice financing. The lender additionally limits its risk by not progressing 100% of the invoice amount to the borrowing business. Invoice financing doesn't dispose of all risk, however, since the customer may in all likelihood never pay the invoice. This would bring about a troublesome and costly collections process including both the bank and the business doing invoice financing with the bank.

## How Invoice Financing is Structured

Invoice financing can be structured in a number of ways, most usually through factoring or discounting. With invoice factoring, the company sells its outstanding invoices to a lender, who could pay the company 70% to 85% front and center of what the invoices are eventually worth. Accepting the lender gets full payment for the invoices, it will then, at that point, dispatch the leftover 15% to 30% of the invoice amounts to the business, and the business will pay interest or potentially fees for the service. Since the lender gathers payments from the customers, the customers will know about this arrangement, which could consider ineffectively the business.

As an alternative, a business could utilize invoice discounting, which is like invoice factoring with the exception of that the business, not the lender, gathers payments from customers, so customers are not aware of the arrangement. With invoice discounting, the lender will advance the business up to 95% of the invoice amount. At the point when clients pay their invoices, the business repays the lender, minus a fee or interest.
