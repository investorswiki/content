Risk control is a plan-based business strategy that expects to recognize, evaluate, and prepare for any risks, hazards, and different possibilities for disaster — both physical and non-literal — that might slow down an association's operations and objectives. The core concepts of risk control include:

- Avoidance is the best method of loss control. For instance, in the wake of finding that a compound utilized in manufacturing a company's goods is dangerous for the workers, a factory owner finds a safe substitute synthetic to safeguard the workers' wellbeing.
- Loss prevention [accepts a risk](/tolerating risk) however endeavors to limit the loss as opposed to dispense with it. For instance, inventory stored in a warehouse is helpless to theft.
