## Understanding Brent Blend

Brent blend is a blend of crude oil separated from oilfields in the North Sea between the United Kingdom and Norway. It is an industry standard since it is "light," meaning not excessively thick, and "sweet," meaning it's low in sulfur content. It is utilized as a benchmark for pricing crude oil, alongside [West Texas Intermediate (WTI)](/wti) crude oil.

Brent blend is the benchmark for the greater part of the crude oil from the Atlantic bowl and is the benchmark used to price 66% of the crude oil traded globally.

Brent blend initially came from the Brent Oilfield off the shoreline of Scotland. At that point, the naming standards for the UK oil industry were to name oilfields arranged by development, alphabetically, after birds found in the region. The Brent Oilfield was the second developed, so it was named after a bird that started with the second letter of the alphabet, the Brent goose.

Brent blend and WTI are the two fundamental benchmark crude oils. A third, called Shanghai crude futures, was sent off by China in 2018 to make an Asian benchmark at oil costs. Brent is less light and less sweet than is WTI. Brent makes up the majority of the crude oil traded globally, so it is more generally utilized as a benchmark than is WTI. Brent has stayed the predominant benchmark at crude costs yet its position might be under threat due to exhausting reserves in the North Sea and the developing crude output in the United States starting around 2015.
