# Refinancing Risk
## What Is Refinancing Risk?

[Refinancing](/refinance) risk alludes to the possibility that an individual or company wouldn't have the option to replace a debt obligation with new debt at a critical time for the borrower. Your level of refinancing risk is unequivocally tied to your [credit rating](/creditrating). To try not to refinance risk, lenders place great value on a borrower's history of paying down their debt dependably. Nonetheless, outside factors —, for example, interest rate developments and the overall condition of the credit market — frequently play an even larger job in a borrower's ability to refinance.

## Understanding Refinancing Risk

[Refinancing](/refinance) — supplanting debt that is coming due with new debt — is common for the two businesses and individuals. A major motivation to refinance is to get a good deal on interest costs. So commonly, you really want to refinance into a loan with a [interest rate](/interestrate) that is lower than your existing rate. The risk is that you probably won't have the option to find such a loan when you want it.

Any company or individual can experience refinancing risk — either on the grounds that their own credit quality has deteriorated, or because of outside conditions. The Fed could have raised interest rates, for instance, or credit markets could have fixed, and banks are not giving new loans.

A [inventory-based business](/stock financing) can lose a whole year of operations assuming financing is unavailable at the terms that it needs to create a gain. Most businesses look to limit their refinancing risk by working closely with lenders and investors to ensure that they grasp the requirements of the business.

## Analyzing the "Risk" in Refinancing Risk

There are various manners by which a business or individual who has relied on refinancing to cover their debt could wind up losing money all things considered, as the following situations portray.

### Refinancing Risk in Short-Term Debt

A homebuilding company takes on large measures of [short-term debt](/shorttermdebt) to fund its tasks. The company's strategy was to replace this debt with new debt consistently. This functioned admirably for a number of years until [credit markets](/credit_market) out of nowhere seized up in light of a banking crisis and banks became reluctant to offer the company any new loans. Subsequently, the manufacturer expected to sell a portion of its properties at a large discount to rapidly fund-raise to cover its existing short-term debt obligations, which brought about a sizable financial loss.

### Refinancing Risk in Personal Mortgages

Borrowers frequently face unexpected risks challenges they expect that they will actually want to refinance out of an existing [adjustable-rate mortgage (ARM)](/arm) sometime not too far off — typically before a [interest-rate reset date](/reset-date) — to keep away from an increase in their regularly scheduled payments. Interest rates could rise substantially before that date, or home price depreciation could lead to a loss of equity, which could make it hard to refinance as expected. This, of course, basically occurred in the [subprime meltdown in 2007-08](/subprime-meltdown) when recently overlooked refinancing risks happened as expected.

### Refinancing Risk in Long-Term Debt

A gadgets company makes a large offering of five-year bonds. The bonds are structured with small payments in the initial four years followed by large [balloon payments](/balloon-payment) in the last year. The company accepts that it will actually want to make these balloon payments with new bond issues. At the point when the balloon payments come due, in any case, the company experienced a failed product send off that damages its profitability and financial condition. The company is unable to find financing to cover the balloon payments and must [issue new equity](/equityfinancing) at a discount to market prices. The company's stock price plunges decisively as existing shareholders' holdings are diluted by the issuance of new shares.

## Refinancing a Mortgage For the Wrong Reasons

Refinancing a mortgage isn't the best thing in the world everybody, even on the off chance that mortgage rates are low. By and large, refinancing checks out if you need to decrease your month to month cash flow or pay off your home loan sooner. Be that as it may, refinancing, itself can be expensive and on the off chance that you have not done your [due diligence](/duediligence) with respect to the fees and closing costs of refinancing, you could get into even further debt.

Refinancing is just similar to applying for a mortgage once more. It's a long drawn-out process — recollect gathering all your pay nails, bank statements, etc — that certain individuals wouldn't be anxious to repeat. Others may not need (or can't) get some down time from work or raising another family to go through the method involved with refinancing. In addition, contingent upon your personal situation, refinancing might be an outright misstep.

## Moderating, or Avoiding, Refinancing Risk?

Most investments imply some level of risk. As a general rule, making gains in business or life without facing challenges is unimaginable. Thus, it's important to acknowledge that assuming debt is risky. Normally — whether you're a professional investor, a consumer with [credit card debt](/credit-card-debt), or a homeowner attempting to refinance — we cause a specific debt on the grounds that its [risk-reward profile](/risk-profile) is alluring and inside our tolerance for risk.

The best method for removing the risk from refinancing is just to stay away from it. Try not to refinance in the event that it's unreasonable for you to expect the financial risk. Lenders, too, utilize the "tool" of avoidance by vetting you and your financial history completely. They won't grant the loan on the off chance that you appear to present too a very remarkable risk to them.

In the event that, as in the models above, in any case, you're as of now encountering a few negative consequences of refinancing risk, then, at that point, the world of finance contains heaps of data about [how to moderate it](/riskmanagement).
