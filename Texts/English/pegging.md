For instance, an investor buys a $50 call option, which gives them the right to buy XYZ stock at the [strike price](/strikeprice) of $50 by June 30. The writer has previously collected the [premium](/premium) from the buyer and might in a perfect world want to see the option lapse worthless (stock price under $50 at expiry).

The buyer maintains that the price of XYZ should rise over the strike price plus the premium paid per share. Just at this level would it seem OK for the buyer to [exercise](/exercise) the option.
