# Gas (Ethereum)
The term gas alludes to the pricing mechanism utilized on the Ethereum network. Such a mechanism works out the costs (fees) for performing a transaction or executing a [smart contract ](/smart-contract)operation. While ether (ETH) is the currency that fuels the Ethereum network, Gas is a special unit that is utilized to measure how much "work" (computational resources) certain task requires. Normally, demanding tasks will have a higher gas cost than different operations that require less computational resources.
Note that fees are as yet paid in ether (ETH), yet gas and ETH are two distinct things. Basically, computational tasks are measured in terms of "gas cost". Then again, every unit of gas has a "gas price" that is defined in ether (ETH). In that capacity, each transaction has a specific "gas price" for every unit of gas.
Put in another manner, the gas cost is the amount of work, and the gas price is the price paid for "every hour" of work. The connection between these two, alongside the [gas limit](/gas-limit), characterizes the total fee for an operation or transaction.
So assuming you really want your transaction to be approved rapidly, it's a good idea to pay higher gas prices, so that validators (diggers) are boosted to confirm your transaction first than others. Likewise, setting a low gas price can make your transaction be stuck as diggers will not have any incentive to approve it.
The gas pricing mechanism is important on the grounds that it guarantees that fees are being charged in a fair and fitting manner. So it keeps resources from being squandered on operations that are not significant to the Ethereum network.
It is worth taking note of that on the grounds that the gas price is made of tiny numbers, they are typically communicated in "gwei" rather than ETH, where 1 [gwei](/gwei-ethereum) is equivalent to 0.000000001 (or 10-9) ETH. You can find different divisions of ether [here](/wei).

## Features
- The value of gas for internal processing, which is distinct from how ether tokens value the genuine valuation of the cryptocurrency, disaggregates the value layer and the processing layer of the Ethereum platform.
- Diggers set the price of gas in light of supply and demand for the computational power of the network expected to handle smart contracts and different transactions.
- Gas prices are denoted in small parts of ether called gwei.
- On the Ethereum blockchain, gas alludes to the cost important to perform a transaction on the network.
