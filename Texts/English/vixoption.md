# VIX Option
## What Is VIX Option?

A VIX option is a non-equity index option that utilizes the [Cboe Volatility Index](/vix) as its [underlying asset](/underlying-asset).

## Figuring out VIX Options

Call and put VIX options are both accessible. The call options hedge portfolios against a sudden market decline, and put options hedge against a fast reversal of short positions on the S&P 500 index. These options consequently permit traders and investors to theorize on future moves in volatility.

The VIX option, which originated in 2006, was the first [exchange-traded option](/exchangetradedoption) that empowered individual investors to trade on market volatility. The trading of VIX options can be a helpful device for investors. By purchasing a VIX [call option](/calloption) a trader can profit from a quick increase in volatility. Sharp increases in volatility correspond with a short-term price shock in stocks. Volatility increase frequently, yet not consistently, harmonizes with a descending trending market. In that capacity, this sort of call option is a [natural hedge](/natural-hedge) and can be utilized strategically over longer periods, and tactically in the short term. By and large, it very well may be a more efficient hedge than equity index options.

The VIX is powerless to a pattern of slow decline and quick increase. As such VIX call options, when very much coordinated can be an extremely effective hedge; notwithstanding, VIX put options are more challenging to effectively utilize. The put options can be profitable for traders who accurately guess that a market is going to pivot from a descending trend to a vertical trend.

VIX options get comfortable cash and trade in the [European style](/europeanoption). European style limits the exercise of the option until its expiration. The trader may constantly sell an existing long position or purchase an equivalent option to close a [short position](/short) before expiration.

For advanced options traders, it is feasible to incorporate a wide range of advanced strategies, for example, [bull call spreads](/bullcallspread), [butterfly spreads](/butterflyspread), and some more, by utilizing VIX options. Nonetheless, [calendar spreads](/calendarspread) can be risky since various expiration series don't follow each other as closely as their equity options partners.

## VIX Explained

The Volatility Index of the [Cboe Global Markets (Cboe)](/cboe) trades with the symbol [VIX](/vix). Nonetheless, the VIX isn't similar to other traded instruments. As opposed to addressing the price of a commodity, interest rate, or exchange rate, the VIX shows the market's expectation of 30-day volatility in the stock market.

It is a calculated index in light of the price of options on the [S&P 500](/sp500). The assessment of volatility for these S&P options, between the current date and the option's expiration date, forms the VIX. The Cboe consolidates the price of different options and derives an aggregate value of volatility, which the index tracks.

Presented in 1993, the Volatility Index (VIX) was initially a weighted measure of the [implied volatility (IV)](/iv) of eight S&P 100 [at-the-money](/atthemoney) put and call options. After a decade, in 2004, it expanded to utilize options in view of a more extensive index, the S&P 500. This expansion considers a more accurate perspective on investors' expectations on future market volatility. VIX values higher than 30 are generally associated with a lot of volatility because of investor fear or vulnerability. Values below 15 commonly relate to less distressing, or even smug, times in the markets.

Due to its inclination to move altogether higher during periods of market fear and vulnerability, one more name for the VIX is the "fear index."
