# Direct Cost
## What Is a Direct Cost?

A direct cost is a price that can be directly tied to the production of specific goods or services. A direct cost can be traced to the cost object, which can be a service, product, or department. Direct and indirect costs are the two major types of expenses or costs that companies can bring about. Direct costs are many times variable costs, meaning they change with production levels like inventory. In any case, a few costs, for example, indirect costs are more hard to assign to a specific product. Instances of indirect costs incorporate [depreciation](/depreciation) and administrative expenses.

## Seeing Direct Costs

Albeit direct costs are normally variable costs, they can likewise incorporate fixed costs. Rent for a factory, for instance, could be tied directly to the production facility. Regularly, rent would be viewed as overhead. Notwithstanding, companies can some of the time tie fixed costs to the units created in a specific facility.

### Direct Costs Examples

Any cost that is engaged with delivering a decent, even assuming that main a portion of the cost's allocated to the production facility, are incorporated as direct costs. A few instances of direct costs are listed below:

- Direct labor
- Direct materials
- Manufacturing supplies
- Wages for the production staff
- Fuel or power utilization

Since direct costs can be specifically traced to a product, direct costs needn't bother with to be allocated to a product, department, or other cost objects. Direct costs normally benefit just a single cost object. Things that are not direct costs are pooled and allocated in light of cost drivers.

## Direct versus Indirect Costs

Direct costs are genuinely clear in deciding their cost object. For instance, Ford Motor Company (F) makes vehicles and trucks. The steel and bolts required for the production of a vehicle or truck would be classified as direct costs. Be that as it may, an indirect cost would be the power for the manufacturing plant. Albeit the power expense can be tied to the facility, it can't be directly tied to a specific unit and is, subsequently, classified as indirect.

## Fixed versus Variable

Direct costs needn't bother with to be fixed in nature, as their unit cost might change over the long run or it being used to rely upon the quantity. A model is the salary of a supervisor that dealt with a single project. This cost might be directly credited to the project and connects with a fixed dollar amount. Materials that were utilized to build the product, like wood or gas, may be directly traced however don't contain a fixed dollar amount. This is on the grounds that the quantity of the supervisor's salary is known, while the unit production levels are variable in light of sales.

## Inventory Valuation Measurement

Utilizing direct costs requires severe management of inventory valuation when inventory is purchased at different dollar amounts. For instance, the cost of an essential part of a thing being manufactured may change over the long run. As the thing is being manufactured, the part piece's price must be directly traced to the thing.

For instance, in the construction of a building, a company might have purchased a window for $500 and one more window for $600. If by some stroke of good luck one window is to be introduced on the building and the other is to stay in inventory, predictable application of accounting valuation must happen.

Companies commonly trace these costs utilizing two methods: [first-in, first-out (FIFO)](/fifo) or [last-in, first-out (LIFO)](/lifo). FIFO includes the assigning of costs, for example, the purchase of inventory, in view of what things showed up first. As inventory is spent in the production of goods, the initial ones or the most established inventory things are utilized first while measuring the cost of the thing. On the other hand, LIFO assigns the value of a cost thing in view of the last thing purchased or added to inventory.
