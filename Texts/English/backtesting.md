# Backtesting
## What Is Backtesting?

Backtesting is the overall method for perceiving how well a strategy or model would have done [ex-post](/expost). Backtesting surveys the practicality of a [trading strategy](/trading-strategy) by finding how it would play out utilizing historical data. In the case of backtesting works, traders and analysts might have the confidence to utilize it going ahead.

## Grasping Backtesting

Backtesting permits a trader to reenact a trading strategy utilizing [historical data](/historical-returns) to generate results and break down risk and profitability before risking any genuine capital.

A very much directed backtest that yields positive outcomes guarantees [traders](/trader) that the strategy is fundamentally strong and is probably going to yield profits when carried out in reality. Conversely, a very much directed backtest that yields poor outcomes will provoke traders to modify or dismiss the strategy.

> Especially muddled trading strategies, for example, strategies executed via automated trading systems, depend intensely on backtesting to demonstrate their worth, as they are too obscure to assess in any case.

Up to a trading thought can be measured, it very well may be backtested. A few traders and investors might look for the expertise of a qualified software engineer to form the thought into a testable form. Regularly, this includes a developer coding the thought into the proprietary language facilitated by the [trading platform](/trading-platform).

The developer can incorporate client characterized input variables that permit the trader to "change" the system. An example of this would be in the [simple moving average](/sma) (SMA) crossover system. The trader would have the option to information (or change) the lengths of the two moving averages utilized in the system. The trader could then backtest to figure out which lengths of moving averages would have performed the best on the historical data.

## The Ideal Backtesting Scenario

The ideal backtest picks sample data from a significant time period of a duration that mirrors an assortment of market conditions. Along these lines, one can better judge whether the consequences of the backtest address an accident or sound trading.

The historical data set must incorporate a genuinely [representative sample](/representative-sample) of stocks, including those of companies that eventually went [bankrupt](/insolvency) or were sold or liquidated. The alternative, including just data from historical stocks that are still around today, will deliver falsely high returns in backtesting.

A backtest ought to consider all trading costs, but unimportant, as these can accumulate throughout the backtesting period and definitely influence the presence of a strategy's profitability. Traders ought to guarantee that their backtesting software accounts for these costs.

Out-of-sample testing and forward performance testing give further confirmation in regards to a system's viability and can show a system's true varieties before real cash is on the line. A strong [correlation](/correlation) between backtesting, out-of-sample, and forward performance testing results is imperative for deciding the practicality of a trading system.

## Backtesting versus Forward Performance Testing

Forward performance testing, otherwise called [paper trading](/papertrade), gives traders one more set of out-of-sample data on which to assess a system. Forward performance testing is a simulation of real trading and includes following the system's logic in a live market. It is additionally called paper trading since all trades are executed on paper just; that is, trade sections and exits are reported along with any profit or loss for the system, yet no real trades are executed.

An important part of forward performance testing is to follow the system's logic exactly; in any case, it becomes troublesome, on the off chance that certainly feasible, to assess this step of the cycle accurately. Traders ought to speak the truth about any trade passages and exits and stay away from behavior, for example, [cherry-picking](/filtering out) trades or excluding a trade on paper justifying that "I couldn't ever have taken that trade." If the trade would have happened following the system's logic, it ought to be recorded and assessed.

## Backtesting versus Scenario Analysis

While backtesting utilizes genuine historical data to test for fit or achievement, [scenario analysis](/scenario_analysis) utilizes speculative data that reproduces different potential results. For example, scenario analysis will recreate specific changes in the values of the portfolio's securities or key factors that occur, for example, a change in the [interest rate](/interestrate).

Scenario analysis is regularly used to estimate changes to a [portfolio's](/portfolio) value in response to an unfavorable event and might be utilized to examine a hypothetical worst situation imaginable.

## A few Pitfalls of Backtesting

For backtesting to give meaningful outcomes, traders must foster their strategies and test them sincerely, keeping away from bias however much as could be expected. That means the strategy ought to be developed without depending on the data utilized in backtesting.

That is more diligently than it appears. Traders generally build strategies in light of historical data. They must be severe about testing with various data sets from those they train their models on. In any case, the backtest will create sparkling outcomes that don't mean anything.

Essentially, traders must keep away from data digging, in which they test a large number of speculative strategies against similar set of data, which will likewise deliver victories that fail in [real-time](/real_time) markets since there are many invalid strategies that would beat the market throughout a specific time period by chance.

One method for making up for the propensity to data dig or single out is to utilize a strategy that prevails in the significant, or in-sample, time period and backtest it with data from an alternate, or out-of-sample, time period. In the event that in-sample and out-of-sample backtests yield comparable outcomes, they are bound to be proved substantial.

## Highlights
- The underlying theory is that any strategy that functioned admirably in the past is probably going to function admirably from here on out, and alternately, any strategy that performed inadequately in the past is probably going to perform inadequately from now on.
- Backtesting surveys the reasonability of a trading strategy or pricing model by finding how it would have played out retrospectively utilizing historical data.
- While testing a thought on historical data, holding a time period of historical data for the purpose of testing is beneficial. Assuming it is effective, testing it on alternate time periods or out-of-sample data can assist with affirming its expected reasonability.
