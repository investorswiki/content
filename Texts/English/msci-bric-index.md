## What Is the MSCI BRIC Index?

The MSCI BRIC index measures the equity market performance of the emerging market indices of Brazil, Russia, India, and China. The MSCI BRIC Index is one of MSCI's Regional Equity Indices and is a free float-adjusted, market [capitalization weighted index](/capitalizationweightedindex) of four of the greatest [emerging market](/emergingmarketeconomy) economies. .

## Figuring out the MSCI BRIC Index

The term [BRIC](/bric) first appeared in a 2001 Goldman Sachs report called "Building Better Global Economic BRICs." The paper accurately guage that the weight of the BRIC economies (particularly China) in global [GDP](/gdp) would develop fundamentally.

Financial backers can gain exposure to BRIC markets through a rising assortment of instruments, including [ADRs](/adr) (American Depositary Receipts), [closed-end funds](/closed-endinvestment), [ETFs](/etf), and mutual funds. In 2007, for instance, iShares sent off the MSCI BRIC Index ETF. With 642 constituents, the index covers 85% of the free float-adjusted market capitalization in every country, as per MSCI.

Before this index, MSCI sent off the principal Emerging Markets Index in 1988. Starting around 2021, it was zeroing in on 26 markets.

## Index Makeup

"The index is checked on quarterly — in February, May, August and November — with the objective of mirroring the change in the underlying equity markets as quickly as possibly, while restricting undue index [turnover](/turnover). During the May and November semi-annual index surveys, the index is [rebalanced](/rebalancing) and the large, mid and small capitalization cutoff points are recalculated," as per MSCI.

As of December 2020, the inexact weighting of the index was: China 69.3%, India 16.4%, Brazil 9.1%, and Russia 5.2%.

Area weights were: Information Technology 7.6%, Financials 17.4%, Energy 6.7%, [Consumer Discretionary](/consumer-discretionary) 26.6%, Materials 5.9%, [Consumer Staples](/consumerstaples) 6%, Industrials 4.3%, Real Estate 2.6%, Health Care 5.8% and Utilities 2.3%.

## Investing in Emerging Markets

Investing in BRICs, be that as it may, conveys inherent risks on the grounds that the markets are not completely developed. Risks, for example, lack of transparency, undeveloped regulatory systems, liquidity issues, and [volatility](/volatility) can influence the performance of investments.

An emerging market economy is a country's economy that is advancing toward becoming advanced, as shown by some [liquidity](/liquidity) in neighborhood debt and [equity markets](/equitymarket), and the presence of some form of market exchange and regulatory body. Emerging markets are not quite so advanced as developed countries but rather keep up with economies and foundations that are further developed than frontier market countries. Emerging markets generally don't have the level of [market efficiency](/marketefficiency) and severe standards in accounting and securities regulation to be on par with [advanced economies](/advanced-economies) (like the United States, Europe, and Japan), yet emerging markets truly do regularly have a physical, monetary foundation, including banks, a stock exchange, and a unified currency.
