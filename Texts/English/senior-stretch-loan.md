# Senior Stretch Loan
## What is a Senior Stretch Loan?

A senior stretch loan is a type of hybrid loan structure offered basically to center market companies to finance [leveraged buyouts](/leveragedbuyout) (LBOs). Like "[unitranche](/unitranchedebt)" financing, the senior stretch loan consolidates senior debt and junior (or [subordinated debt](/subordinateddebt)) into one package, normally at a below cost to the borrower than a separate senior loan and junior piece (mezzanine or second lien).

## How a Senior Stretch Loan Works

Senior stretch loans "stretch" to oblige the financing needs of the borrower, yet at a higher risk to the lender than a conventional senior loan. With this higher risk comes a higher blended interest payment to the lender.

These types of loans have removed market share from the traditional method of financing a leveraged buyout by getting a commitment for a senior loan for a portion of the total funding need, then, at that point, getting junior debt as [mezzanine financing](/mezzaninefinancing) or [second lien debt ](/secondliendebt)for the balance.
