# Agency Debenture
## What Is an Agency Debenture?

An agency debenture is debt (bonds) issued at a fixed, or [variable](/variableinterestrate), interest rate by a United States federal agency or a [government-sponsored enterprise](/gse) (GSE), for the reasons for obtaining funds to finance their activities, which normally involves purchasing mortgages from different lenders.

## Figuring out an Agency Debenture

As opposed to being backed by [collateral](/collateral), agency debentures depend on the [creditworthiness](/credit-worthiness) and integrity of the debt's [issuer](/issuer). The base level of investment for agency debentures is generally $10,000, with the ability to increase that amount in augmentations of $5,000. Interest payments from federal agency debentures are typically tax-exempt while those from GSEs will generally be fully taxable.

Debentures issued by a genuine federal agency, like the Department of Agriculture, are backed by "the [full faith and credit](/full-faith-credit) of the U.S. government." This means that the U.S. government vows to respect the interest payments and the return of principal at [maturity](/maturity), even on the off chance that the underlying agency can't respect their commitments.

Agency debentures issued by GSEs, then again, are just implicitly guaranteed, which raises the risk of loss to the investor. All things considered, GSEs might get money straightforwardly from the [U.S. Treasury](/ustreasury) in the event that they are unable to repay their debts. The vulnerability, brought on by the way that the U.S. Treasury isn't committed to loan them money, is the motivation behind why agency debentures issued by GSEs are considered to have some [credit risk](/creditrisk).

Buying agency debentures as an investment strategy is likewise conceivable. This strategy can be a low-risk form of investing. [Bonds](/bond) issued straightforwardly through a government agency, not through a GSE, are guaranteed (backed by the U.S. government) to pay a [fixed rate](/fixedinterestrate) of interest and the bond's full [principal](/principal) when the bond develops.

The most common government-sponsored substances (GSEs) that issue agency debentures are Fannie Mae, [Freddie Mac](/freddiemac), [Farmer Mac](/farmermac), and [Ginnie Mae](/ginniemae).

## Agency Debentures During the 2008 Financial Crisis

Agency debentures drew far reaching consideration during the mortgage and credit crisis of 2008. The crisis brought into center problems inherent in GSEs. The problem was that GSEs were utilizing the implicit guarantee of a bailout by the U.S. Treasury while operating as private enterprises.

The two most commonly referred to models were Fannie Mae, otherwise called Federal National Mortgage Association Corporation (FNMA), and Freddie Mac, otherwise called Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (FHLMC).

Leading up to the financial crisis, these two substances created colossal gains by borrowing money at low rates, on account of the implicit backing of the U.S. Treasury, and dealing in the [secondary mortgage market](/secondarymarket). At the point when the mortgage market collapsed, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac both confronted potential [bankruptcy](/bankruptcy). The two substances held a tremendous share of mortgages at that point.

The collapse of Freddie and Fannie would have prompted the collapse of the housing market. The U.S. Treasury concluded they were ["too big to fail"](/too-big-to-fizzle) and stepped in with a bailout worth $187 billion as a method for keeping the elements from failing. The federal government has since taken over both of these substances to prevent a comparative future occurrence.
