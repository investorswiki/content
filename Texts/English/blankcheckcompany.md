## What Is a Blank Check Company?

A limitless ticket to ride company is a publicly-exchanged, formative stage company that has no established [business plan](/business-plan). It very well might be used to gather funds as a startup or, more probable, it has the intent to blend or get another business entity. Unlimited free pass companies are speculative in nature and are limited by Securities and Exchange Commission Rule 419 to safeguard investors.

## How a Blank Check Company Works

Unlimited free pass companies are much of the time considered penny stocks or microcap stocks by the SEC. Hence, the SEC imposes extra rules and requirements of these companies. For instance, they must deposit the raised funds into an escrow account until shareholders authoritatively support an acquisition and the business combination is made. Also, these companies are not permitted to use certain exemptions under Regulation D of the Securities Act of 1933. Rule 504 of Regulation D exempts companies from registration of securities in a year period for offerings up to $10 million. The SEC prohibits unlimited free pass companies from using Rule 504.

A type of limitless ticket to ride company is a "[special purpose acquisition company](/spac)" (SPAC), which is formed to raise funds through an initial public offering (IPO) to finance a merger or acquisition inside a certain time period, commonly 24 months. The money is held escrow until a combination transaction closes; in the event that no acquisition is made following 24 months, the SPAC is dissolved and funds are returned. The SPAC managers ordinarily hold 20% equity with the balance going to subscribers of the IPO.

As of 2020, SPACs make up around half of the U.S. IPO market. SPACs partook in a spate of prevalence during the government shutdown of late 2018 and mid 2019 when the SEC was unable to continue with the survey of traditional IPOs. During this period, SPACs had the option to open up to the world without the SEC's endorsement or feedback, thanks to SEC regulations that permit companies to make their own IPO registration effective assuming that they're willing to establish a set IPO price something like 20 days before opening up to the world.

While SPACs might have gained some media consideration during the extended government shutdown, these IPOs offer some risk for investors. For instance, investors don't be aware ahead of time what company a given SPAC will secure, however some might give investors information with respect to the sector they mean to operate in.
