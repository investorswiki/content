# Three-Sigma Limits
## What Is a Three-Sigma Limit?

Three-sigma limits is a statistical calculation where the data are inside three [standard deviations](/standarddeviation) from a [mean](/arithmeticmean). In business applications, three-sigma alludes to processes that operate proficiently and produce things of the highest quality.

Three-sigma limits are utilized to set the upper and lower control limits in statistical [quality control charts](/quality-control-graph). Control charts are utilized to lay out limits for a manufacturing or business process that is in a state of statistical control.

## Understanding Three-Sigma Limits

Control charts are otherwise called Shewhart charts, named after Walter A. Shewhart, an American physicist, engineer, and analyst (1891-1967). Control charts depend on the theory that even in impeccably planned processes, a certain amount of variability in output measurements is inherent.

Control charts determine in the event that there is a controlled or uncontrolled variation in a cycle. Variations in process quality due to random causes are supposed to be in-control; wild processes incorporate both random and special reasons for variation. Control charts are planned to determine the presence of special causes.

To measure variations, analysts and analysts utilize a measurement known as the standard deviation, likewise called sigma. Sigma is a statistical measurement of variability, showing how much variation exists from a statistical average.

> Sigma measures how far a noticed data strays from the mean or average; investors utilize standard deviation to check expected volatility, which is known as historical volatility.

To figure out this measurement, consider the normal [bell curve](/bell-curve), which has a normal distribution. The farther to the right or left a data point is recorded on the bell curve, the higher or lower, individually, the data is than the mean. According to one more point of view, low values demonstrate that the data points fall close to the mean; high values show the data is widespread and not close to the average.

## An Example of Calculating Three-Sigma Limit

We should consider a manufacturing firm that runs a series of 10 tests to determine whether there is a variation in the quality of its products. The data points for the 10 tests are 8.4, 8.5, 9.1, 9.3, 9.4, 9.5, 9.7, 9.7, 9.9, and 9.9.

1. In the first place, **calculate the mean of the noticed data.** (8.4 + 8.5 + 9.1 + 9.3 + 9.4 + 9.5 + 9.7 + 9.7 + 9.9 + 9.9)/10, which approaches 93.4/10 = 9.34.
1. Second, **calculate the variance of the set.** Variance is the spread between data points and is calculated as the [sum of the squares](/sum-of-squares) of the difference between every data point and the mean separated by the number of perceptions. The principal difference square will be calculated as (8.4 - 9.34)^2^ = 0.8836, the second square of difference will be (8.5 - 9.34)^2^ = 0.7056, the third square can be calculated as (9.1 - 9.34)^2^ = 0.0576, etc. The sum of the various squares of each of the 10 data points is 2.564. The variance is, hence, 2.564/10 = 0.2564.
1. Third, **calculate the standard deviation,** which is just the square root of the variance. In this way, the standard deviation = \u221a0.2564 = 0.5064.
1. Fourth, **calculate three-sigma,** which is three standard deviations over the mean. In mathematical arrangement, this is (3 x 0.5064) + 9.34 = 10.9. Since none of the data is at a high point, the manufacturing testing process has not yet arrived at three-sigma quality levels.

## Special Considerations

The term "three-sigma" points to three standard deviations. Shewhart set three standard deviation (3-sigma) limits as a rational and economic manual for least economic loss. Three-sigma limits set a reach for the interaction boundary at 0.27% control limits. Three-sigma control limits are utilized to check data from a cycle and in the event that it is inside statistical control. This is finished by checking assuming data points are inside three standard deviations from the mean. The upper control limit (UCL) is set three-sigma levels over the mean, and the lower control limit (LCL) is set at three sigma levels below the mean.

Since around 99.73% of a controlled cycle will happen inside plus or minus three sigmas, the data from an interaction should rough an overall distribution around the mean and inside the pre-characterized limits. On a bell curve, data that lie over the average and past the three-sigma line address under 1% of all data points.

## Highlights
- On a bell curve, data that lie over the average and past the three-sigma line address under 1% of all data points.
- Three-sigma limits are utilized to set the upper and lower control limits in statistical quality control charts.
- Three-sigma limits (3-sigma limits) is a statistical calculation that alludes to data inside three standard deviations from a mean.
