# European Union (EU)
## What Is the European Union (EU)?

The European Union (EU) is a political and economic alliance of 27 countries. The EU advances vote based values in its member nations and is one of the world's most powerful trade alliances. Nineteen of the countries share the [euro](/euro) as their official currency.

The EU outgrew a craving to reinforce economic and political cooperation all through the mainland of Europe in the wake of World War II.

The EU's [gross domestic product](/gdp) (GDP) added up to $14.45 trillion euros in 2021. That is about $15.49 trillion dollars. The GDP of the U.S. for a similar period was about $23 trillion.

## History of the European Union (EU)

The EU follows its foundations to the European Coal and Steel Community, which was established in 1950 and had just six members: Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, Luxembourg, and the Netherlands. It became the European Economic Community in 1957 under the Treaty of Rome and in this manner was renamed the [European Community](/european-community) (EC).

This effectively developed the integration of the member nations' foreign, security, and internal affairs policies. The EU laid out a common market that very year to advance the free movement of goods, services, individuals, and capital across its internal lines.

The EC at first centered around a common agricultural policy and the elimination of [customs barriers](/customs-boundary). Denmark, Ireland, and the U.K. participated in 1973 in the main wave of expansion. Direct elections to the European Parliament started in 1979.

### Creation of a Common Market

In 1986, the Single European Act left on a six-year plan to make a common European market by fitting national regulations.

The [Maastricht Treaty](/maastricht-treaty) produced results in 1993, supplanting the EC with the European Union (EU). The euro appeared as a common single currency for participating EU members on Jan. 1, 1999. Denmark and the U.K. negotiated "opt-out" provisions that permitted countries to hold their own currencies in the event that they decided.

Several fresher members of the EU have likewise either not yet met the criteria for adopting the euro or decided to opt out.

## The European Debt Crisis

In the wake of the 2007-2008 global financial crisis, the EU and the [European Central Bank](/europeancentralbank) battled to deal with high sovereign debt and sluggish growth in Italy, Spain, Portugal, Ireland, and Greece.

Greece and Ireland received financial bailouts from the EU in 2010 molded on the implementation of fiscal [austerity](/austerity) measures. Portugal continued in 2011. A second Greek bailout was required in 2012.

The crisis decreased after the European Union and the European Central Bank adopted a series of measures to support the sovereign and banking-sector debt of the affected countries.

### Long-Term Measures

These remembered the foundation for October 2012 of the European Stability Mechanism (ESM), laid out to help EU members encountering extreme financial issues, including a powerlessness to access the bond markets. The ESM supplanted the brief European Financial Stability Facility backstop in place starting around 2010.

The European Central Bank directed a series of "targeted longer-term refinancing tasks" in 2014, 2016, and 2019 to give financing based on ideal conditions to EU financial institutions.

In 2015, the European Union slackened the provisions of the 2011 Stability and Growth Act requiring member states to target public debt of below 60% of gross domestic product and annual government budget deficits below 3% of GDP over the medium term.

That very year, another EU agency, the Single Resolution Board, assumed responsibility for settling bank disappointments in the euro area.

## EU's North-South Issues

While the relief measures addressed the crisis, they haven't handled one of its principal causes â€” the wide disparity in wealth and economic growth between the European Union's vigorously industrialized north and its less fortunate southern fringe, which stays not so much urbanized but rather more dependent on agriculture.

Because the industrialized north and the more rural south share a common currency, battling southern economies can't exploit [currency depreciation](/currency-depreciation) to work on their international intensity. Without currency depreciation, southern exporters eventually battle to contend with their northern opponents, which benefit from quicker productivity growth.

### How It Works in the U.S.

In the U.S., federal [transfer payments](/transferpayment) help to address comparative economic abberations among locales and states.

States with higher average salaries will generally contribute a lopsidedly large share of federal revenue, while those with lower earnings will more often than not account for a higher share of federal outlays.

In the European Union, the COVID-19 pandemic provoked joint spending measures some have called "a fragmented and delicate fiscal union really taking shape."

## The Brexit Bomb

In the wake of rejecting prior calls for a well known mandate on the U.K's. European Union membership, Conservative Prime Minister David Cameron guaranteed a vote in 2013 and scheduled it in 2016. It was a period of developing fame for the U.K. Independence Party, which went against European Union membership.

Subsequent to trailing in late surveys, the Leave option won with almost 52% of the vote on June 23, 2016. Cameron surrendered the next day. The U.K. officially left the EU on Jan. 31, 2020.

In July 2020, a report by the Intelligence and Security Committee of the U.K. Parliament noted boundless media reports of Russian efforts for the benefit of the Leave option and blamed the government for neglecting to investigate Russian contribution in British politics.
