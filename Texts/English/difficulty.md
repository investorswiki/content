# Difficulty
In cryptocurrency, the term difficulty alludes to the work required to mine a [block](/block). Proof of Work blockchains execute certain rules that make this rise or fall contingent upon the amount of hashing power on the network.
This is finished to guarantee that blocks are not created too rapidly, and to guarantee the continuous security of the network. Bitcoin, for example, sets the block time at about ten minutes (the average time it takes to track down another block). Assuming blocks are reliably taking more time to find, the target will be increased. In the event that blocks are found too rapidly, it will be diminished.
The target is a number that is reset occasionally. To effectively mine a block, the miner must find a hash lower than this number. We can utilize a simple model here. Assume that we have the term "binance," and we need to deliver a SHA256 hash whose first character is "0". We can keep adding numbers to "binance" (i.e., "binance1", "binance2", "binance3"), and hash it until we arrive.
When we get to 'binance10', we have it (check for yourself). In the event that we maintain that the initial two characters should be "0", we want to keep hashing until "binance99". To get three zeros, we needed to hash until "binance458". However, shouldn't something be said about four zeros? Out of the initial twenty million numbers, there is certainly not an information that gives us such an output.
This ought to provide you with a thought of how mining functions, with the difference being that miners are endeavoring to track down a number that falls under a target. The lower this is, the more uncertain they are to track down a solution. To this end Bitcoin consumes such a lot of computational power - miners are hashing varieties of a similar data again and again.
Since it is so challenging to mine Bitcoin, participants have long since abandoned ordinary PCs and graphics cards for reason fabricated hardware ([ASICs](/asic)).
