# Employee Savings Plan (ESP)
## What is an employee savings plan?
An employee savings plan is a pooled investment account that is much of the time matched by an employer. Like a 401(k), an employee savings plan, or ESP, allows workers to deposit a portion of their pretax earnings, with employers contributing a certain percentage or dollar amount. Employees conclude the amount they need to set aside and the cash is taken straightforwardly from their paychecks and deposited into the savings plan.
## More profound definition
Employers regularly match an employee's contribution to the savings plan up to a certain dollar amount or up to a certain percentage. Employee savings accounts are expected for long-term financial objectives like retirement, a home purchase or college tuition, and keeping in mind that employees can pull out their contributions whenever, there might be a waiting period before they can access the funds their employer has contributed.
An employee savings plan is ordinarily offered by more modest organizations that can't invest in a 401(k). Since employees contribute their pretax earnings, the employee savings plan diminishes their taxable income, consequently bringing down the amount of tax they need to pay.
The employee savings plan has other tax benefits, remembering the deferral of taxes for the money until it is removed. Meanwhile, it acquires interest. Employers frequently assist employees with setting up the employee savings plan, however workers pick their own investments and deal with the account.
## Employee savings plan model
Gail procures $65,000 every year and contributes $7,000 of that to her company's employee savings plan. Her contribution emerges from her pretax earnings, lessening her taxable income for the year to $58,000. Gail's employer contributes 50 pennies for each $1 she contributes, up to 6 percent of her pay. Gail must be with the company for a long time before she approaches the employer matching funds. At the point when Gail pulls out the money after she resigns, it is taxable.
