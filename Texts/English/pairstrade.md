## What Is a Pairs Trade?

A pairs trade is a trading strategy that includes matching a [long position](/long) with a [short position](/short) in two stocks with a high correlation.

## Understanding Pairs Trade

Pairs trading was first presented during the 1980s by a group of technical analyst specialists that were employed by Morgan Stanley, the multinational investment bank and financial services company. The pairs trade strategy utilizes statistical and [technical analysis](/technicalanalysis) to search out potential market-neutral profits.

[Market-neutral](/marketneutral) strategies are a key part of a pairs trade transaction. Market-neutral strategies include long and short positions in two distinct securities with a positive [correlation](/correlation). The two offsetting positions form the basis for a hedging strategy that looks to benefit from either a positive or negative trend.

A pairs trade strategy depends on the historical correlation of two securities. The securities in a pairs trade must have a high positive correlation, which is the primary driver behind the strategy's profits. A pairs trade strategy is best conveyed when a trader recognizes a correlation inconsistency. Depending on the historical thought that the two securities will keep a predefined correlation, the pairs trade can be conveyed when this correlation vacillates.

At the point when pairs from the trade at last veer off — up to an investor is utilizing a pairs trade strategy — they would look to take a dollar matched the long position in the [underperforming](/underperform) security and sell short the outperforming security. On the off chance that the securities return to their historical correlation, a profit is produced using the convergence of the prices.

## Benefits and Disadvantages of Pairs Trade

At the point when a pairs trade performs true to form, the investor profits; the investor is likewise able to relieve potential losses that would have happened simultaneously. Profits are created while the underperforming security recaptures value, and the [outperforming](/outperform) security's price flattens. The net profit is the total acquired from the two positions.

There are several limitations for pairs trading. One is that the pairs trade depends on a high statistical correlation between two securities. Most pairs trades will require a correlation of 0.80, which can be trying to distinguish. Second, while historical trends can be accurate, past prices are not generally indicative of future trends. Requiring just a correlation of 0.80 can likewise diminish the probability of the expected outcome.

## Illustration of Pairs Trade

To represent the expected profit of the pairs trade strategy, look at Stock As an and Stock B, which have a high correlation of 0.95. The two stocks veer off from their historical trending correlation in the short-term, with a correlation of 0.50.

The arbitrage trader steps in to take a dollar matched the long position on underperforming Stock An and a short position on outperforming Stock B. The stocks meet and return to their 0.95 correlation over the long haul. The trader profits from a long position and closed [short position](/short).
