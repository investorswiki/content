# Worthless Securities

Worthless securities have a [market value](/marketvalue) of zero and, along with any securities that an investor has abandoned, result in a [capital loss](/capitalloss) for the owner. They can be claimed as such while filing taxes.

## What Are Worthless Securities?

Worthless securities can incorporate stocks or bonds that are either publicly traded or privately held. To declare a capital loss from worthless securities, the [Internal Revenue Service](/irs) (IRS) proposes investors treat them as though they were capital assets sold or traded on the last day of the tax year. Likewise with different securities, investors must first figure out the [holding period](/holdingperiod) to determine assuming that the capital loss is short-term (one year or less) or long-term (greater than one year).

On account of a short-term loss, investors must report this on Part I of Schedule D. Investors can net short-term gains and losses against another to determine a net short-term gain or loss.

For long-term losses, investors report these in Part II of Schedule D. Again, investors can net long-term gains and losses against one another to determine the net long-term gain or loss. After the investor finishes these computations separately in Parts I and II of Schedule D, they can net them together for an overall outcome.

> You might have the option to involve a worthless security in a tax strategy called [tax selling](/tax_selling), where an investor sells an asset with a capital loss to lower or take out the capital gain that they understand through different investments.

## Figuring out Worthless Securities

For a private company, valuation methods incorporate comparable company analysis or an assessment of discounted cash flows. Worthless securities will have a market value of zero as indicated previously.

For a security to become worthless, it necessities to have no value, yet it requirements to can possibly regain value. For instance, a company's stock could reduce in value to zero in the event that the market varies enough. In the event that the company gets an opportunity to regain ground in the market, it wouldn't be worthless stock. In any case, assuming the company closed its entryways after bankruptcy, its stock would probably be worthless.
