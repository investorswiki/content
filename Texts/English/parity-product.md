## Grasping Parity Products

A business selling a parity product will much of the time not be able to command premium pricing for it, in view of the substitution effect. Assuming the business raises its price while rivals don't raise theirs, consumers will buy less of its product and on second thought purchase the contending parity products.

In this sense, the cross elasticity of demand for the contending goods will be positive, since an increase in the price of one brand's product will bring about an increase in demand for another brand's product. This is on the grounds that a parity product is a broad product that many companies make, and as a result of the products' likenesses across various manufacturers, they can be utilized reciprocally. Substitution is conceivable on the grounds that every product has comparable capabilities, fixings, or both.

The presence of parity products decreases the possibilities of imposing business model while keeping prices low across the product category. The fight for sales consequently comes down to marketing and branding strategies that are designed to lift a company's product over the competition. Now and again, this is the best way to make differentiation among parity products, however such strategies can find actual success relying upon how well they're executed.

This is fundamental, so you can initially level the playing field between your product and the contending parity products.

Whenever that has been achieved, the next step is to feature areas that make a product unique compared to the competition.

Samsung, in the mean time, has tried to hoist their points of differentiation, which have of late been higher performance parts, like a higher performance camera.
