# Credit Balance
## What Is a Credit Balance?

With regards to investing, a credit balance alludes to the funds produced from the execution of a [short sale](/shortsale) that is credited to the client's [margin account](/marginaccount). It is the amount of borrowed funds deposited in the customer's margin account following the effective execution of a short sale order and incorporates both the proceeds from the short sale itself and the predefined margin amount the customer is required to deposit under [Regulation T](/regulationt).

A credit balance can be diverged from a [debit balance](/debitbalance) in a margin account.

## Understanding Credit Balances

There are two types of investment accounts used to buy and sell financial assets — a [cash account](/cashaccount) and a margin account. A cash account is an essential trading account in which an investor can make trades with their accessible cash balance. On the off chance that an investor has $500 in the account, they can purchase shares worth $500, comprehensive of commission — that's it, nothing less.

A margin account permits an investor or trader to borrow money from the [broker](/broker) to purchase extra shares or, on account of a short sale, to borrow shares to sell. An investor with a $500 cash balance might need to purchase shares worth $800. In this case, their broker can loan them the extra $300 through a margin account.

While a [long margin position](/long) has a debit balance, a margin account with just [short positions](/short) will show a credit balance. The credit balance is the sum of the proceeds from a short sale and the [required margin](/initialmargin) amount under Regulation T.

In short selling, an investor basically borrows shares from their broker and afterward sells the shares on the [open market](/open-market). The goal is to buy them back at a lower price sometime in the future and afterward return the shares to the broker, stashing any excess cash. At the point when the shares are first sold short, the investor gets the cash amount of the sale in their margin account.

## Credit Balance Example

Say an investor shorts 200 Meta, formely Facebook, shares at $180 per share for total proceeds of $36,000. The margin requirement of 150% means that the investor needs to deposit half x $36,000 = $18,000 as initial margin into the margin account for a total credit balance of $18,000 + $36,000 = $54,000.

The credit balance in a short margin account is steady; it doesn't change paying little heed to price [volatility](/volatility). The two factors that change with market vacillations are the value of equity (or margin) in the account and the cost to [buy back the borrowed shares](/shortcovering). How about we analyze the credit balance following changes in the price of Meta.
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td> </td><td>FB Market Value</td><td>Margin Requirement or Equity</td><td>Credit Balance</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>Initial short</td><td>$36,000</td><td>$18,000</td><td>$54,000</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>Price Increase to $250/share</td><td>$50,000</td><td>$4,000</td><td>$54,000</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>Price decrease to $150/share</td><td>$30,000</td><td>$24,000</td><td>$54,000</td></tr>
</tbody>
</table>
The short seller is required to deposit an extra margin in the account when the margin falls below the total margin requirement of $18,000. At the point when the price of Meta shares increases from $180 to $250, the [market value](/marketvalue) of the shares increases by $14,000, which diminishes the margin to $4,000 ($18,000 - $14,000). Likewise, the margin following the price increase presently falls below the Reg T half requirement since $4,000/$50,000 = 8%.

This is the fundamental principle of short selling — a short seller's equity will fall when the stock price increases and the equity will rise when prices decline. Keep in mind, short-sellers hope that the stock's price will drop so they can buy back the borrowed shares at the lower price to earn a profit. Taking a gander at the table, you can see that a price diminishing or increase didn't change the value of the credit balance.

## Special Considerations

Since the shares being sold are borrowed, the funds that are received from the sale technically don't belong to the short seller. The proceeds must be kept up with in the investor's margin account as a form of assurance that the shares can be repurchased from the market and returned to the brokerage house.

In effect, the funds can't be removed or used to purchase different assets. Since the risk of loss from short selling is high, given that the price of a share can increase endlessly, a short seller is required to deposit extra funds in the margin account as a buffer in case the stock increases to the point of loss for the seller.

A few brokers specify the margin requirement on short sales to be 150% of the value of the short sale. While 100% of this value as of now comes from the short sale proceeds, the leftover half must be put up by the account holder as margin. The 150% margin requirement is the credit balance required to short sell a security.
