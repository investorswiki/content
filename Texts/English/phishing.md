# Phishing
## What is phishing?
Phishing is a sort of cyberattack that gives hackers access to the casualty's secure data. While traditional hacking includes a beast force method of attempting various secret key blends, phishing utilizes social engineering to fool users into surrendering their login information. A homophone of "fishing", in that hackers target numerous users in the hope of a "nibble", phishing costs users billions of dollars worldwide, and has been involved by agents of state legislatures for both economic and political warfare.
## More profound definition
Phishing works by hushing casualties into a false feeling that everything is good. Frequently, the targeted client has no clue anything is not right: the attack will appear to come from a confided in source, like a partner or a companion, or from a company like the client's bank or email provider. In spite of the fact that email has been the primary means of attack, a few hackers have utilized telephone communication and messaging to target individuals.
In a phishing attack, a hacker makes a website or email that perfectly looks like those usually seen by users consistently. At times, the email contains a harmless appearing join that introduces [malware](/malware) on the client's computer that can record keystrokes or give a "burrow" into the casualty's data. Others frequently direct users to a login page vague from the benevolent individuals underestimate when they utilize their email, social media accounts, or [online bank](/onlinebanking). Be that as it may, data went into these pages goes directly to the hacker, which permits him to sign in and take information.
Those caricature websites live on fake URLs that look like the real ones casualties are utilized to. A regular parody of the real Gmail URL, **https://mail.google.com/**, could look something like **http://mail.googlecom.com**. Note the slight modifications to the name. Such a connection could take cover behind text, for example, "Snap here", to look real. Phishers likewise utilize real-looking email addresses, yet when they access a casualty's account, they could email others on her contact list from the casualty's genuine email address.
Practically all email systems have some form of phishing protection that recognizes fraudulent email addresses or connections in the body message of an email and moves that message to the spam envelope. In any case, no automated protection is perfect, and it just takes one effective attack to damage an organization harshly.
## Phishing model
The most unmistakable recent phishing attack was targeted at the 2016 presidential campaign of Hillary Clinton. Her campaign administrator, John Podesta, who had filled in as President Bill Clinton's vice president of staff, received an email apparently from Google demonstrating that his Gmail account had been undermined by hackers and that he expected to change his secret phrase. It wasn't accurate; the hackers had themselves sent the email. In any case, he entered his old login information, which was shipped off the hackers, who then delivered 20,000 of Podesta's personal emails to WikiLeaks, and the resulting fallout was a major factor in Clinton's loss in the overall election. The phishing endeavor was great to such an extent that it even tricked the campaign's IT manager, who let Podesta know that it was "a real email."
