# Annualized Income Installment Method
## What Is the Annualized Income Installment Method?

Taxpayers who are self-employed ordinarily pay quarterly installments of their [estimated tax](/estimated-tax) in four even amounts as figured by the normal installment method. Moreover, taxpayers ought to pay estimated taxes assuming they receive substantial dividends, interest, alimony, or different forms of income that are not subject to income tax withholding.

At the point when a taxpayer has a fluctuating income, it frequently makes them underpay on at least one of the quarterly estimates leading to underpayment punishments. The annualized income installment method works out the taxpayer's estimated tax installment payments and assists with diminishing underpayment and comparing underpayment punishments connected with fluctuating income. Using the [annualized](/annualize) income installment method, taxpayers might estimate their taxes in light of known information from the outset of the tax year through the finish of the period paid.

## How the Annualized Income Installment Method Works

The purpose of the ordinary installment method is to figure in quarterly tax installments. It isolates the annual estimated tax into four equivalent portions. The subsequent payments are proper for the quarterly estimated taxes of taxpayers with a consistent income, yet this doesn't function too for taxpayers whose income changes. A few taxpayers might struggle with finding the cash to pay estimated taxes in slower months.

Consider, for instance, taxpayers Jane and John. Every one of them owes $100,000 in annual estimated tax. Jane pays her estimated payments in four $25,000 installments for each the ordinary installment method. She evenly earned her income, 25% each quarter, so the quarterly partitions paid her estimated tax in full and on time.

John's earnings were uneven, with each tax quarter at 0%, 20%, 30%, and half, separately. John might struggle with concocting the cash important to make his first and second quarter estimated tax payments when his earnings are low. Utilizing the ordinary installment method, if John somehow managed to pay less estimated tax in the first two quarters and more in the subsequent two quarters, he would owe a [underpayment penalty](/underpaymentpenalty) for the first two quarters.

The annualized income installment method allows John to refigure his installments, so they correspond to his income as he acquires it. It does as such by annualizing John's installments more than four overlapping periods. Every period starts on Jan. 1. The first period closes on March 31, the subsequent closures on May 31, the third on Aug. 31, and the fourth period closes on Dec. 31. Every period incorporates every one of the previous periods, with the last period enveloping the whole year. It allows John to estimate his tax payments in view of his income to that point in the year.

In this model, we know the specific percentage of John's annual earnings from each tax quarter. John pays $0 in March, $20,000 in May, $30,000 in August, and $50,000 in December. John currently has four installments of various amounts that, when added together, equivalent his full annual estimated tax of $100,000. John's refigured installments are presently paid on time, his underpayment punishments [abated](/reduction).

IRS Publication 505 has forms, timetables, and worksheets that guide taxpayers wanting to refigure their installments utilizing the annualized income installment method. In any case, figuring installments this way is convoluted and best finished on an IRS worksheet by your #1 tax professional.
