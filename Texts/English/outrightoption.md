# Outright Option
## What Is an Outright Option?

An outright option is a [option](/option) that is bought or sold separately. This option isn't part of a spread trade or different types of options strategy where multiple various options are purchased.

## Figuring out the Outright Option

An outright option, which can incorporate [calls](/calloption) and [puts](/putoption), can allude to any fundamental option purchased on a single underlying security. They are the most fundamental form of options trading.

Outright options trade on a [exchange](/exchange) like security assets, similar to stocks. In the United States, there are various exchanges listing a wide range of outright options for investors. In this way, the options market will see activity from both institutional and retail investors the same.

Institutional investors might utilize options to [hedge](/hedge) the risk exposure in their portfolios. Managed funds might involve options as the central focal point of their investment objective. Numerous [leveraged](/influence) bullish and bearish strategies likewise depend on the utilization of options.

Retail investors might decide to involve options as an advanced strategy or as a cheaper alternative relative to investing straightforwardly in the underlying asset. Accessing options trading is generally more complex and requires extra brokerage permissions. Most brokerage platforms will require a [margin account](/marginaccount) and a base deposit, usually in excess of $2,000, to trade options.

Both institutional and retail investors utilizing outright options will generally zero in on either calls or puts. Calls and puts are typically contracted in 100 share increases. This means one option controls 100 shares of the underlying stock. Option [premiums](/premium) are quoted on a per-share premise; a $0.50 option will cost $50 to buy ($0.50 x 100 shares).

Spreads and exotic options include further developed utilization of option trading instruments and are not viewed as outright options. Spread strategies include the utilization of at least two options contracts in a unit trade. Exotic option strategies can be developed in a multitude of ways. Exotic options can incorporate a contract in light of a basket of underlying securities with a wide range of option contract conditions.

## Outright Call and Put Options

An outright option is either a call or put. The trader either buys or sells either, yet not both, as a directional bet on where the underlying asset is going, or to hedge another non-option position. The purchase of an option is likewise called a "long option," though it is likewise called a "short option." Taking on more than one type of option for a similar trade doesn't qualify as an outright options trade to sell one.

A long call option gives the buyer the right to buy an underlying security at a predetermined [strike price](/strikeprice). With an American option, the buyer can [exercise](/exercise) the option whenever up until the expiration date. The strike price is the price at which the buyer can take ownership of the underlying, and practicing is making the most of that opportunity. In exchange for this right, the option buyer pays a premium to the option seller. The option seller will keep the premium however is obliged to sell the underlying security to the call buyer at the strike price on the off chance that the buyer exercises their option.

On the other hand, a long put option gives the buyer the right to sell an underlying security at a predetermined strike price. In exchange for this right, the put option buyer pays a premium to the option seller. The option seller will keep the premium yet is obliged to buy the underlying from the put buyer at the strike price on the off chance that the buyer exercises their option.

Call and put options have an expiry date. [American options](/americanoption) can be exercised any time up until expiry, while [European options](/europeanoption) must be exercised at expiration.

## Outright Option Example

Accept an investor is [bullish](/bull) on Apple Inc. (AAPL) and accepts that the stock price will increase in value over the course of the next couple of months. To buy an outright option, they would purchase a call option. The call option gives the call buyer the right to buy Apple at a predefined price.

Expect the stock is currently trading at $183.20 on May 22. The investor accepts that by August the stock could be trading north of $195.

Taking a gander at the accessible call options, the trader needs to pick how they need to continue.
<!--7F5CEC81A76C42F100FE96132302A0D4-->
They could buy an option that is now [in the money](/inthemoney). For instance, they could buy the $170 strike price August call for $19.20 (ask price). This would cost the investor $1,920 ($19.20 x 100 shares). On the off chance that the stock price comes to $195, the option will be worth roughly $25, netting the option buyer a profit of $580 (($25 - $19.20) x 100 shares). They could likewise exercise their option, getting the shares at $170 and afterward selling them for the current market price which in this case is theoretically $195.

The risk is that the trader could lose up to $1,920 assuming the price of Apple stock falls. The greatest loss would happen assuming that it tumbled to $170 or below. The trader would lose their full premium. In spite of the fact that, they could sell the option before that ended up recovering a portion of the option's cost.

Another possibility is to buy a [near the money](/close the-money) or [out of the money](/outofthemoney) call option. These cost less yet accompanied their own downsides and opportunities.

Expect the trader buys a $185 strike price option for $9.90 (ask price). This cost them $990.

On the off chance that the stock is trading close $195 at expiry, the option ought to be worth about $10. This nets the trader a profit of $10, which (less [commissions](/commission)) means they probably lose a bit of money. Put an alternate way, the trader could exercise the option and assume command over the shares at $185. They could then sell them at $195 on the stock market for a profit of $1000 ($10 x 100 shares), yet they paid $990 for the option, so their net profit is $10.

To bring in money on this trade, the price should rise above $195 before or at expiry. In the event that it goes to $200, the trader nets a profit of $510. The option will be worth $15 ($200 - $185), however they paid $9.90 for it. That leaves $5.10 in profit per share, or $510 ($5.10 x 100 shares). The price needs to climb more than in the previous model.

Looking at the two scenarios, the first clearly costs much more. The principal option will be worth something at expiry except if the stock price falls below $170. That means the trader can almost certainly recover a portion of the cost of the option even on the off chance that the price doesn't rise true to form (or falls).

Then again, the subsequent choice will keep on losing value, and be worth nothing at expiry in the event that the price of the stock doesn't rise over the $185 strike. Even assuming that the stock transcends the strike price, the trade might in any case lose money even on the off chance that the price arrives at its $195 target. The price should move above $195 in the order for the trader to bring in money in the subsequent scenario.
