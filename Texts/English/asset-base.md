# Asset Base
## What Is an Asset Base?

An asset base alludes to the underlying assets that give value to a company, investment, or loan. The asset base isn't fixed; it will appreciate or [depreciate](/devaluation) as indicated by market powers, or increase and decline as a company sells or obtains new assets.

In spite of the fact that it is totally normal for a company to make changes to its asset base occasionally by buying and selling assets, large swings in asset base will influence the company's valuation and can be a red flag for analysts. Lenders use [physical assets](/physicalasset) as a guarantee that essentially a portion of money loaned can be recovered through the sale of the backed asset in the case that the loan itself can't be repaid.

## Understanding Asset Base

A company's asset base is remembered for its valuation and incorporates substantial, hard assets like property, plant, equipment, and inventory. It likewise incorporates financial assets like cash, cash equivalents, and securities. Commonly, a company's market value will surpass its asset base since market value incorporates intangibles as well true to form future growth from cash flows and profits.

With an investment in a futures contract, for instance, the price of the underlying asset utilized as the asset base of such a [derivative](/derivative) contract can increase or diminish quickly, changing the price that investors will pay for it.

With a loan, the value of a home could increase or diminish over the long run, influencing the underlying [collateral](/collateral) in a mortgage. Margin loans are especially sensitive to the underlying value of the collateral, as pledged securities whose value vacillates with the market are frequently utilized for this purpose.

## Book Value

A company's asset base is many times understood as its book value. The [book value](/bookvalue) of a company in a real sense means the value of a business as per its books (accounts) that is reflected through its [financial statements](/financial-statements). Hypothetically, book value addresses the total amount a company is worth on the off chance that every one of its assets are sold and every one of the liabilities are paid back. This is the amount that the company's creditors and investors can hope to receive assuming the company is liquidated.

Numerically, book value is calculated as the difference between a company's total [assets](/asset) and [total liabilities](/total-liabilities).

For instance, assuming that Company XYZ has total assets of $100 million and total liabilities of $80 million, the book value of the company is $20 million. From a broad perspective, this means that in the event that the company sold off its assets and paid down its liabilities, the equity value or [net worth](/networth) of the business would be $20 million.

Total assets incorporate a wide range of assets, for example, cash and short term investments, total [accounts receivable](/accountsreceivable), inventories, net [property, plant and equipment (PP&E)](/ppe), investments and advances, theoretical assets like generosity, and unmistakable assets.

Total liabilities incorporate things like short and long term debt obligations, [accounts payable](/accountspayable), and [deferred taxes](/deferredtaxliability).
