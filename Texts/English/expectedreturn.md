# Expected Return
## What Is Generally anticipated Return?

The expected return is the profit or loss that a [investor](/investor) expects on an investment that has known historical [rates of return](/rateofreturn) (RoR). It is calculated by increasing likely outcomes by the chances of them happening and afterward totaling these outcomes.

## Grasping Expected Return

Expected return calculations are a key piece of both business operations and financial theory, remembering for the notable models of the [modern portfolio theory](/modernportfoliotheory) (MPT) or the [Black-Scholes](/blackscholes) options pricing model. For instance, in the event that an investment has a half chance of acquiring 20% and a half chance of losing 10%, the expected return would be 5% = (half x 20% + half x - 10% = 5%).

The expected return is a device used to determine whether an investment has a positive or negative average net outcome. The sum is calculated as the [expected value](/expected-value) (EV) of an investment given its likely returns in various situations, as illustrated by the following formula:

>
> Expected Return = \u03a3 (Return~i~ x Probability~i~)
>

where "I" shows each known return and its separate likelihood in the series

The expected return is generally founded on historical data and is in this manner not guaranteed into the future; however, it truly does frequently set reasonable expectations. Hence, the expected return figure can be considered a long-term weighted average of [historical returns](/historical-returns).

In the formulation above, for example, the 5% expected return might very well never be realized from here on out, as the investment is intrinsically subject to [systematic](/systematicrisk) and [unsystematic](/unsystematicrisk) risks. Systematic risk is the risk to a market sector or the whole market, while unsystematic risk applies to a specific company or industry.

While considering individual investments or portfolios, a more conventional equation for the expected return of a financial investment is:

where:

- r~a~ = expected return;
- r~f~ ^^= the [risk-free rate of return](/risk-freerate);
- \u03b2 = the investment's [beta](/beta); and
- r~m~ =the expected market return

Generally, this formula states that the expected return in excess of the risk-free rate of return relies upon the investment's beta, or relative volatility compared to the more extensive market.

The expected return and [standard deviation](/standarddeviation) are two statistical measures that can be utilized to examine a portfolio. The expected return of a portfolio is the anticipated amount of returns that a portfolio might generate, making it the mean (average) of the portfolio's conceivable return distribution. The standard deviation of a portfolio, then again, measures the amount that the returns deviate from its mean, making it a proxy for the portfolio's risk.

## Limitations of the Expected Return

To pursue investment choices exclusively on expected return calculations can be very gullible and dangerous. Before settling on any investment choices, one ought to continuously [review the risk characteristics](/riskreturntradeoff) of investment opportunities to determine in the event that the investments line up with their portfolio objectives.

For instance, assume two theoretical investments exist. Their annual performance results throughout the previous five years are:

- **Investment A:** 12%, 2%, 25%, - 9%, and 10%
- **Investment B**: 7%, 6%, 9%, 12%, and 6%

Both of these investments have expected returns of precisely 8%. However, while examining the risk of each, as defined by the standard deviation, investment An is roughly five times riskier than investment B. That is, investment A has a standard deviation of 11.26% and investment B has a standard deviation of 2.28%. Standard deviation is a common statistical measurement utilized by analysts to measure an investment's historical volatility, or risk.

Notwithstanding expected returns, investors ought to likewise think about the probability of that return. All things considered, one can find cases where certain [lotteries](/lottery) offer a positive expected return, notwithstanding the exceptionally low chances of understanding that return.

## Expected Return Example

The expected return doesn't just apply to a single [security](/security) or asset. It can likewise be expanded to dissect a portfolio containing numerous investments. In the event that the expected return for every investment is known, the portfolio's overall expected return is a weighted average of the expected returns of its parts.

For instance, we should assume we have an investor keen on the tech sector. Their portfolio contains the following stocks:

- Alphabet Inc., (GOOG): $500,000 invested and an expected return of 15%
- Apple Inc. (AAPL): $200,000 invested and an expected return of 6%
- Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN): $300,000 invested and an expected return of 9%

With a total portfolio value of $1 million the loads of Alphabet, Apple, and Amazon in the portfolio are half, 20%, and 30%, separately.

Accordingly, the expected return of the total portfolio is:

- (half x 15%) + (20% x 6%) + (30% x 9%) = 11.4%

## Features
- The expected return is the amount of profit or loss an investor can expect to get on an investment.
- An expected return is calculated by increasing likely outcomes by the chances of them happening and afterward totaling these outcomes.
- The expected return for a portfolio containing various investments is the weighted average of the expected return of every one of the investments.
- Expected returns can't be guaranteed.
## FAQ
### How Does Expected Return Differ From Standard Deviation?
Expected return and standard deviation are two statistical measures that can be utilized to break down a portfolio. The expected return of a portfolio is the anticipated amount of returns that a portfolio might generate, making it the mean (average) of the portfolio's conceivable return distribution. Standard deviation of a portfolio, then again, measures the amount that the returns deviate from its mean, making it a proxy for the portfolio's risk.
### How Is Expected Return Used in Finance?
Expected return calculations are a key piece of both business operations and financial theory, remembering for the notable models of modern portfolio theory (MPT) or the Black-Scholes options pricing model. It is a device used to determine whether an investment has a positive or negative average net outcome. The calculation is typically founded on historical data and subsequently can't be guaranteed for future outcomes, however, it can set reasonable expectations.
### What Are Historical Returns?
Historical returns are the past performance of a security or index, like the S&P 500. Analysts review historical return data while attempting to foresee future returns or to estimate how a security could respond to a specific economic situation, for example, a drop in consumer spending. Historical returns can likewise be valuable while assessing where future points of data might fall in terms of standard deviations.
