## What Is an Easement?

An easement, or easement agreement, is a [real estate](/realestate) concept that characterizes a scenario wherein one party utilizes the property of another party, where a fee is paid to the owner of the property in return for the right of easement. Easements are many times purchased by public utility companies for the right to raise telephone posts or run pipes either above or underneath private property. In any case, while fees are paid to the property owner, easements can negatively influence property values in that unattractive power lines, for instance, can bring down the visual appeal of a land parcel.

## How an Easement Works

Used to portray a significant level agreement between the owner of a property and another party — either a person or an association — a normal easement agreement outlines a form of payment by the solicitor to the owner for the right to use the subject of easement for a specific purpose.

An easement is unique to the agreement between the two gatherings included.

Further, if funneling or a comparable utility is required to be run through an adjoining property for a person's well system, the agreement is dealt with through a private easement.

At last, there is a third common easement agreement alluded to as an easement by necessity. This type of easement is more liberal in that it doesn't need a written agreement and is enforceable by nearby laws.
