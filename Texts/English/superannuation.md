It is important to note the even however benefits under a Superannuation plan are not impacted by market vacillations, the funds in the plan are regularly managed by a trustee that will invest those assets in a mix of equities and fixed securities. In that sense, there is some risk that a market downturn could impact the solvency of the fund. In such cases, the plan could become underfunded, significance there are not adequate funds to meet future obligations.

Companies are required to report the funding status of the plan to the IRS yearly and to make that information available to employees.
