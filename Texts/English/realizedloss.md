# Realized Loss
## What Is a Realized Loss?

A realized loss is the loss that is recognized when assets are sold at a cost lower than the original purchase price. Realized loss happens when an asset that was purchased at a level alluded to as cost or book value is then dispensed for a value below its book value.

## Figuring out Realized Loss

At the point when an investor purchases a [capital asset](/capitalasset), an increase (or reduction) in the value of the security doesn't mean a profit (or loss). The investor can make a claim to a profit or loss after he has sold the security at [fair market value](/fairmarketvalue) in a manageable distance transaction.

## Real World Example of Realized Loss for Investors

For instance, accept an investor purchases 50 shares of Exwhyzee (XYZ) at $249.50 per share on March 20. From this purchase date to April 9, the value of the stock declined by around 13.7% to $215.41. Notwithstanding, the investor possibly has a realized loss on the off chance that he really sells at the depressed price. In any case, the decline in value is essentially a [unrealized loss](/unrealizedloss) which just exists on paper.

Realized losses, in contrast to unrealized losses, can influence the amount of taxes owed. A realized capital loss can be utilized to offset [capital gains](/capitalgain) for tax purposes. From our model over, the investor, in the wake of selling his XYZ stocks, realized a loss of 50 x ($249.50 - $215.41) = $1,704.50. Assume he realized a profit on Aybeecee (ABC), which he purchased for $201.07 and sold for $336.06 during a similar tax year.

In the event that he purchased and sold 50 ABC shares, his capital gain on the transaction will be recognized as 50 x ($336.06 - $201.07) = $6,749.50. Applying the realized loss to this gain means that the investor will just owe taxes on $6,749.50 - $1,704.50 = $5,045, as opposed to the whole capital gains amount.

What's more, in the event that the realized losses for a given tax year surpass the realized gains, up to $3,000 of the leftover losses can be deducted from the taxpayer's [taxable income](/taxableincome). Additionally, assuming net losses surpass the given $3,000 limit, the remainder can be [carried forward](/tax-loss-carryforward) to future years.

This practice is called tax-loss harvesting, and discount brokers have added highlights to their work area and mobile applications in recent years to assist investors with this cycle.

## How Realized Loss Works for Businesses

A realized loss happens when the sale price of an asset is lower than its carrying amount. Albeit the asset might have been held on the [balance sheet](/balancesheet) at a fair value level below cost, the loss just becomes realized once the asset is off the books. An asset is taken out from the books when it is sold, rejected, or gave by the company.

One upside to a realized loss is the conceivable tax advantage. In many cases, a portion of the realized loss might be applied against a capital gain or realized profit to reduce taxes. This might be very alluring for a company hoping to limit its tax burden, and firms may really make a special effort to realize losses in periods where their tax bill is expected to be higher than wished.

In effect, a business might decide to realize losses on however many assets as could be expected under the circumstances when it would somehow need to pay taxes on realized profits or capital gains.
