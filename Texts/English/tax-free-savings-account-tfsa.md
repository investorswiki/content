# Tax-Free Savings Account (TFSA)
## What's a Tax-Free Savings Account (TFSA)?

A tax-free savings account (TFSA) is a Canadian account wherein contributions, interest earned, dividends, and capital gains aren't taxed can be removed tax-free. While it's called a [savings account](/savingsaccount), a TFSA can hold certain investments including mutual funds, securities, and bonds as well as cash. This account is available to people ages 18 and more established in Canada and can be utilized for any purpose.

## Understanding Tax-Free Savings Accounts (TFSAs)

Tax-free savings accounts (TFSA) were presented in Canada in 2009 with a contribution limit of C$5,000 each year. In 2013, that limit was increased to C$5,500 annually and stayed at that level through 2018, besides in 2015 when the limit was C$10,000. In 2019, the contribution limit was raised to C$6,000, where it stays for 2021.

The benefit of holding an investment inside a TFSA is that you will not be taxed on any income the investment procures. For instance, let's take two savers, Joe and Jane. Toward the beginning of the year, Joe puts C$6,000 in an investment account earning 7% each year; Jane does likewise however inside a TFSA. They will each have C$6,420 toward the year's end, however Jane will actually want to pull out all C$6,420 with no tax penalty, though Joe would be taxed on the C$420 he earned in [capital gain](/capitalgain).

### TFSA Contributions

The amount that you're permitted to deposit into a TFSA is called your "contribution room." Even in the event that you didn't have a TFSA at that point, you accumulated contribution room for each year starting around 2009 that you were age 18 or more established and were a resident of Canada.

Any unused contribution room from one year can be carried forward to the next year. For instance, on the off chance that you've contributed the maximum limit until 2019 when you contributed just C$3,000, you can contribute 2019's C$3,000 in 2020, notwithstanding the C$6,000 annual contribution limit for 2020, for a total contribution of C$9,000. Similarly, on the off chance that you haven't made any contributions starting around 2016, your 2020 contribution room for the TFSA account will be C$23,000: C$5,500 each for the years 2017 and 2018, and C$6,000 each for the years 2019 and 2020.

### TFSA Withdrawals

Any withdrawal amount is added back to your contribution room toward the beginning of the next year. For instance, in the event that Jane contributes C$5,500 for the tax year 2020 (with the contribution limit being C$6,000) and pulls out C$2,000, she can't supplant the whole withdrawal amount around the same time since her available contribution room is just C$500. In this case, Jane can supplant C$500 and hold on until the beginning of 2021, when her withdrawal amount is added to her contribution room, to re-contribute the leftover C$1,500.

## TFSAs versus RRSPs

While a [registered retirement savings plan (RRSP)](/rrsp) account is explicitly for retirement savings, a TFSA can be utilized to put something aside for anything. The tax-free savings account varies from a registered retirement account in two other fundamental ways:

1. Deposits made to a RRSP are deducted from your [taxable income](/taxableincome). Deposits into a TFSA are not tax-deductible.
1. Withdrawals from a retirement plan are taxed as income. Withdrawals from a TFSA are not taxed.

## Special Considerations

Any contribution made to a TFSA past the maximum allowable amount is viewed as an over-contribution. The [Canada Revenue Agency (CRA)](/ccra) will charge a penalty of 1% each month on the excess contribution until it is removed.

## Features
- There is an annual contribution limit to TFSAs; in 2021 that limit is C$6,000.
- TFSAs let you get a good deal on taxes on the grounds that the gains on investments in the account are not taxed and withdrawals can be made tax-free.
- Tax-free savings accounts (TFSAs) are a type of tax-advantaged account available to Canadian residents age 18 or more seasoned.
