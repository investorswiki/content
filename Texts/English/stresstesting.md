# Stress Testing
## What Is Stress Testing?

Stress testing is a computer simulation technique used to test the flexibility of institutions and [investment portfolios](/portfolio-investment) against conceivable future financial circumstances. Such testing is generally utilized by the financial industry to assist with measuring investment risk and the adequacy of assets and assist with assessing internal processes and controls. In recent years, regulators have likewise required financial institutions to carry out stress tests to guarantee their capital holdings and different assets are adequate.

## Understanding Stress Testing

Companies that oversee assets and investments normally use stress testing to decide portfolio risk, then, at that point, set in place any [hedging](/fence) strategies important to alleviate against potential losses. Specifically, their portfolio managers utilize internal proprietary stress-testing programs to assess how well the assets they oversee could climate certain market events and outer events.

Asset and liability matching stress tests are widely utilized, too, by companies that need to guarantee they have the legitimate internal controls and procedures in place. Retirement and [insurance portfolios](/portfolioinsurance) are likewise habitually stress-tried to guarantee that cash flow, payout levels, and different measures are all around adjusted.

## Regulatory Stress Testing

Following the 2008 financial crisis, regulatory reporting for the financial industry — specifically for banks — was essentially expanded, zeroing in on stress testing and capital adequacy, mostly due to the [2010 Dodd-Frank Act](/dodd-frank-financial-regulatory-reform-bill).

Beginning in 2011, new regulations in the United States required the submission of Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR) documentation by the banking industry. These regulations expect banks to report on their internal procedures for overseeing capital and carry out different stress-test scenarios.

Notwithstanding CCAR reporting, banks in the United States [deemed too big to fail](/too-big-to-fail) by the Financial Stability Board — ordinarily those with more than $50 billion in assets — should give [stress-test reporting](/bank-stress-test) on planning for a bankruptcy scenario. In the public authority's latest reporting survey of these banks in 2018, 22 international banks and eight situated in the United States were designated as too-big-to-fail.

As of now, [BASEL III](/basell-iii) is likewise in effect for global banks. Similar as the U.S. requirements, this international regulation requires documentation of banks' capital levels and the administration of stress tests for different crisis scenarios.

## Types of Stress Testing

Stress testing includes running simulations to recognize hidden weaknesses. The writing about business strategy and corporate administration recognizes several ways to deal with these activities. Among the most well known are adapted scenarios, hypotheticals, and historical scenarios.

### Historical Stress Testing

In a historical scenario, the business — or asset class, portfolio, or individual investment — is run through a simulation in light of a previous crisis. Instances of historical emergencies incorporate the [stock market decline of October 1987](/stock-market-slump 1987), the Asian crisis of 1997, and the [tech bubble](/tech_bubble) that burst in 1999-2000.

### Speculative Stress Testing

A speculative stress test is generally more specific, frequently zeroing in on how a specific company could climate a specific crisis. For instance, a firm in California could stress-test against a speculative quake or an oil company could do as such against the episode of war in the Middle East.

Adapted scenarios are somewhat more logical as in only one or a couple of test variables are adjusted immediately. For instance, the stress test could include the Dow Jones file losing 10% of its value in seven days.

### Mimicked Stress Testing

With respect to the methodology for stress tests, [Monte Carlo simulation](/montecarlosimulation) is one of the most widely known. This type of stress testing can be utilized for modeling probabilities of different results given specific variables. Factors thought about in the Monte Carlo simulation, for instance, frequently incorporate different economic variables.

Companies can likewise go to expertly managed risk management and software suppliers for different types of stress tests. [Moody's Analytics](/moodys-analytics) is one illustration of a re-appropriated stress-testing program that can be utilized to assess risk in asset portfolios.

## Benefits and Disadvantages of Stress Testing

Stress tests are forward-looking insightful tools that assist financial institutions and banks with bettering grasp their financial position and risks. They assist managers with recognizing what measures to take assuming certain events emerge and how they ought to moderate risks. Thus, they are better able to form action plans to thwart dangers and prevent failure. For investment managers, they are better able to evaluate how very much managed assets could perform during economic slumps.

To perform stress tests, financial institutions need to make the structure and processes for which the tests can be performed. This restructuring is complex and is frequently associated with expensive slip-ups. For instance, it's conceivable that the test scenario doesn't address the types of risks a bank might face. This might be due to deficient data or the test creator's failure to make an important test. Eventually, the consequences of the test might lead to the creation of plans for events not prone to happen. This misrepresentation can make institutions disregard the risks that are conceivable.

Finally, banks with unfavorable outcomes might be banished from paying dividends to their customers and shareholders, as well as might be punished.

## Illustration of Stress Testing

Banks and financial institutions frequently utilize the Federal Reserve's Dodd-Franklin Act Stress Test (DFAST) and Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR) stress test.

The Federal Reserve directs the Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review stress test every year for banks with somewhere around $100 billion in assets. This test recognizes whether banks have adequate capital to operate during economic slumps and plans in place to address such events and other associated risks. Specifically, the Federal Reserve takes a gander at the bank's capital, its plans for its capital (e.g., dividends), and how it surveys capital necessities.

The Dodd-Franklin Act Stress Test (DFAST), required for banks with something like $250 billion in assets, is in many cases utilized related to the CCAR. This test can be conducted straight by the Federal Reserve or by financial institutions under the heading of the Fed. This, similar to the CCAR, surveys whether a bank or financial institution has sufficient capital to account for losses and proceed with operations in the event of economic turmoil.

Albeit the two tests have comparative objectives, they are administered distinctively to address as numerous potential events and risks.

These tests audit the bank's capital and the way that well it can meet obligations and operate during attempting economic times.

### How Is Stress Testing Performed?

Stress testing is many times performed utilizing computer simulations, running various scenarios. Companies could utilize historical events, theoretical circumstances, or simulations to test how well a company would operate under specific conditions.
