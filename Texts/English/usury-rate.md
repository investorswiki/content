# Usury Rate
## What Is a Usury Rate?

The term usury rate alludes to a rate of [interest](/interest) that is viewed as unreasonable as compared to winning market interest rates. They are frequently associated with unsecured consumer loans, especially those connecting with [subprime borrowers](/subprime-borrower).

## Understanding Usury Rates

By and large, the term usury was utilized to depict all forms of lending including the payment of interest by the borrower. In recent times, notwithstanding, the term is generally used to depict just those loans which carry especially high rates of interest. These high rates have consequently come to be known as usury rates.

In the United States, the [Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC)](/fdic) partners usury rates with [predatory lending](/predatory_lending), which it portrays as the practice of "forcing unfair or abusive loan terms on borrowers." Predatory lenders will generally target demographic gatherings with less access to or comprehension of additional affordable forms of financing.

The line between a usurious interest rate and an only high interest rate is the subject of some contention. For example, [payday lenders](/payday-loans) — who give high-interest loans to subprime borrowers — are in many cases blamed for being predatory lenders. Their protectors, notwithstanding, contend that their high interest rates are justified by the way that the loans they give carry surprisingly high risk. Without allowing high interest rates as [compensation for this risk](/riskreturntradeoff), the individuals who depend on payday loans might end up with next to no financing options by any means.

To assist consumers with choosing for themselves whether a specific interest rate is reasonable, several sources exist that distribute current interest rates in different markets. For example, organizations, for example, TreasuryDirect and **The Wall Street Journal** give real-time or periodic reports on interest rates in markets, for example, personal [lines of credit (LOCs)](/lineofcredit), car loans, [student loans](/student-debt), [home mortgages](/home-mortgage), and numerous others. By surveying these sources, consumers can better comprehend whether the rates offered by a specific lender are reasonable.

> ### Strict Responses to Usury
> The practice of lending for interest has existed for millennia. Throughout the long term, Christianity, Judaism, and Islam have all denounced predatory lending and have sought after different strategies to direct the practice.

## Real World Example of a Usury Rate

James is a first-time homebuyer searching for mortgage financing. Despite the fact that James currently has a well-paying job, he disapproved of personal debt in the past and as such has an extremely low [credit rating](/creditrating). Due to his poor credit history, the mainstream banks are reluctant to broaden him a mortgage. Accordingly, James is forced to search for alternative means of financing his home purchase.

One of the options accessible to him is a private lender named Diane, who offers to loan him 80% of the purchase price of the home north of a 25-year [amortization period](/amortization), with an interest rate of 40% each year. That's what diane contends albeit the 40% interest rate is impressively higher than that offered by the banks, it isn't unreasonable due to the way that James' credit score shows he is a high-risk borrower.

In the wake of doing more research into the common interest rates in different markets, James dismisses Diane's proposal. That's what he contends despite the fact that he is considered a subprime borrower, the 40% interest rate is irrationally high and an illustration of predatory lending.
