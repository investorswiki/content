# Net Leverage (Insurance)
## What Is Net Leverage (Insurance)?

Net leverage is the sum of an insurance company's net [written premiums](/written-premium) ratio and its [net liability ratio](/net-liabilities-policyholders-surplus). Net leverage is utilized to decide how uncovered an insurer is to pricing and claims assessment errors. It is utilized as a check of the insurance company's financial wellbeing.

## How Net Leverage (Insurance) Is Used

An insurance company balances two goals: investing the [premiums](/insurance-premium) it gets from underwriting activities to return a profit, and restricting its risk exposure made by the policies that it guarantees. Insurers might surrender premiums to [reinsurance](/reinsurance) companies to move a portion of the risks to the reinsurer. This would eliminate a portion of the [liabilities](/liability) off the primary insurer's [balance sheet](/balancesheet).

Net leverage is a type of [leverage](/leverage) ratio. Not at all like [gross leverage](/gross-leverage-insurance), net leverage does exclude ceded reinsurance leverage. Net leverage is calculated as: (net written premiums/policyholders' surplus) + (net liabilities/policyholders' surplus). The net leverage ratio shows how uncovered the insurer is to errors in claim assessment. A high value shows that the insurance company is more dependent on having adequate [reserve](/claims-reserve) funds.

An insurer's net leverage shows how effectively it has managed its reserves (from the policyholders' surplus) to address claims. The goal is to have adequate surplus reserves to have the option to pay all potential claims while as yet holding a profit. This outcome is accomplished by controlling the number of underwriting activities, so it will not take steps to exhaust the company's reserves. Net written premium ought not be too high over the policyholders' surplus, the assets an insurer possesses minus its liabilities.

An acceptable net leverage ratio relies upon what type of insurance a company guarantees, however the ideal reach regularly falls below 6.0. An insurer's net leverage will ordinarily be lower than its gross leverage in light of the fact that the net leverage ratio does exclude those things that have been ceded to a reinsurance company. The gross leverage ratio is, subsequently, a more [conservative ratio](/bookkeeping traditionalism).

Different types of leverage ratios utilized in the insurance industry incorporate gross leverage, [reinsurance recoverables](/reinsurance-recoverables) to policyholders' surplus, and [Best's Capital Adequacy Relativity](/outmaneuvers capital-adequacy-relativity-bcar) (BCAR).

Notwithstanding net leverage, a ratings agency will likewise take a gander at the [return on assets](/returnonassets), [retention ratio](/retentionratio), gross premiums written, and the amount and type of [assets](/resource).

Leverage ratios are significant given that companies depend on a combination of [equity](/equity) and [debt](/debt) to finance their operations, and realizing the amount of debt held by a company is helpful in assessing whether it can pay its debts off surprisingly.
