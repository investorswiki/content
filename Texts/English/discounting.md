## What Is Discounting?

Discounting is the most common way of deciding the [present value](/presentvalue) of a payment or a flood of payments that will be received from here on out. Given the [time value of money](/timevalueofmoney), a dollar is worth more today than it would be worth tomorrow. Discounting is the primary factor utilized in pricing a flood of tomorrow's cash flows.

## How Discounting Works

For instance, the [coupon](/coupon) payments found in a normal bond are [discounted by a certain interest rate](/1-10net30) and added along with the discounted [par value](/parvalue) to decide the bond's current value.

According to a business viewpoint, an asset has no value except if it can create cash flows from here on out. Stocks pay dividends. Bonds pay interest, and tasks furnish investors with incremental future cash flows. The value of those future cash flows in this day and age is calculated by applying a discount factor to future cash flows.

## Time Value of Money and Discounting
