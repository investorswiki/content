# Altiplano Option
## Altiplano Option: An Overview

An altiplano option is an especially exotic type of derivatives investment that depends on different underlying securities as opposed to on a single underlying asset. It is one of a family of such options, called [mountain range options](/mountain_range_option), that was imagined during the 1990s by the Swiss investment firm Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale.

Likewise with any [options investment](/option), the buyer of an altiplano option gets the ability to buy or sell the underlying asset at a foreordained time and price. In any case, the investor receives a pre-set coupon payout on the off chance that the strike price isn't reached. In effect, the investor is getting insurance with some guaranteed payout if this bet on the price heading of the assets is off-base.

## Grasping the Altiplano Option

As a general rule, altiplano option is one type of basket option. That is, it is an option to buy or sell a number of stocks or different assets, not a single asset. Thusly, the pricing is resolved not just by the implied volatility of every asset yet additionally by the relationships between's them.

On the off chance that none of the securities in the Altiplano basket beats a predetermined benchmark rate of return during the life of the option, the investor will receive just the predefined coupon rate for the option. Yet, on the off chance that any of the underlying passes the benchmark, the investment converts to a vanilla call option on every one of the underlying securities or assets.

### Mountain Range Options

Altiplano options have a place with a group of purported mountain range options made by French bank Societe Generale as an imaginative method for covering several situations with a single [derivative](/equity_derivative). Different types of options were named Atlas, Himalayan, Annapurna, and Everest. The altiplano is a level in the Andes Mountains.

These structured options are intended to give the advantage of lower total [volatility](/volatility) compared to that of individual securities. With lower volatility comes decreased hedging costs.

The market for mountain range options is for the most part involved institutional investors, for example, investment banks and hedge funds. Their pricing equations include complex [Monte Carlo simulations](/montecarlosimulation) or other simulation methods that require designing a set of connections between's the strike price of each underlying security.

Since Altiplano options incorporate a guaranteed payout on the off chance that certain negative events happen, they are appealing securities for investors who look for capital protection.
