## What Is Real Time?

Real time is the point at which a system transfers data to a client at a speed that is close immediate or has a short postponement from when the event happened. Online financiers frequently give a real-time data feed that showcases stock quotes and their individual real-time changes, with an exceptionally inconsequential lag time, so clients can base their investing choices on the most modern data.

## Seeing Real Time

While numerous financial websites truly do offer free [stock quotes](/stockquote) to the overall population, a significant number of these feeds are not real-time feeds and might be delayed as long as 20 minutes. Hence, while survey stock quotes from any financial website, know about the time that is posted close to the stock quote to check whether the quote is in real time.

Having accurate real-time quotes is particularly important for traders, as even the littlest time inconsistency between a gave quote and the real-time situation can change a productive position into a loss.

## Real-Time Stock Quotes versus Delayed Stock Quotes

Stock quotes mirror the consequences of genuine trading on stock market exchanges, for example, the New York Stock Exchange or NASDAQ. Investors and traders can get quotes on the [Dow Jones Industrial Average](/djia), other indices, or individual stocks from a number of financial news sources. Notwithstanding, some financial news services don't report real-time data and on second thought postpone stock quotes for 15 or 20 minutes.

The prices of actively traded stocks can change decisively from one moment to another or from one second to another. That is the reason realizing the current price is basic. In a quickly rising or falling market, otherwise called a fast market, even real-time quotes can struggle with keeping up. In that market scenario, a quote that is delayed 15 or 20 minutes is practically pointless, as a stock's price might have moved by a huge percentage in that time outline.

Delayed quotes are normally sufficient data for a relaxed investor who isn't hoping to time the market. For instance, on the off chance that a dealer has a long-term portfolio of stocks they don't mean to sell, they don't require up-to-the-second price data. Even delayed stock quotes give an overall ballpark of where stocks and files are, and whether they are trending up or down.

Giving real-time quotes requires exertion and innovation; hence, this service has a cost. To assimilate this cost, they'll just offer delayed quotes. Reuters, for instance, gives heaps of financial data, yet its stock quotes are delayed no less than 15 minutes. Financial news services frequently offer real-time quotes as a premium subscription service.
