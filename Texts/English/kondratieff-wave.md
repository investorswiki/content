# Kondratieff Wave
## What Is a Kondratieff Wave?

Kondratieff Wave, named after Russian economist Nikolai Kondratieff, alludes to cycles, going on around 40 to 60 years, experienced by capitalist economies. Otherwise called "Kondratiev waves," "super-cycles," "K-waves," "floods," or potentially "long waves."

## Grasping Kondratieff Waves

A Kondratieff Wave is a long-term [economic cycle](/economic-cycle) accepted to be conceived out of mechanical innovation, which brings about a long period of success. This theory was established by Nikolai D. Kondratieff (likewise spelled "Kondratiev"), a socialist Russia-time economist who saw agricultural commodity and copper prices experienced long-term cycles. Kondratieff accepted that these cycles included periods of development and self-rectification.

Economists have distinguished the accompanying Kondratieff Waves since the eighteenth century.

1. The first come about because of the creation of the steam engine and ran from 1780 to 1830.
1. The subsequent cycle emerged due to the steel industry and the spread of railways and ran from 1830 to 1880.
1. The third cycle came about because of zap and innovation in the compound industry and ran from 1880 to 1930.
1. The fourth cycle was energized via autos and petrochemicals and endured from 1930 to 1970.
1. The fifth cycle depended on data technology and started in 1970 and ran through the present, however a few economists accept we are toward the beginning of a 6th wave that will be driven by biotechnology and healthcare.

Furthermore, each cycle can have four sub-cycles, or phases, that have been named after seasons.

1. Spring: Increase in productivity, along with [inflation](/inflation), meaning an economic boom.
1. Summer: Increase in the overall fortune level prompts changing mentalities toward work that outcomes in a deceleration of economic growth.
1. Pre-winter: Stagnating economic conditions lead to a deflationary growth spiral that leads to noninterventionist policies, further diminishing growth possibilities.
1. Winter: Economy in the pains of a weakening depression that tears the social fabric of society, as the gulf between the lessening number of "haves" and the growing number of "the poor" increases decisively.

## Nikolai D. Kondratieff's Fate

Kondratieff Waves are consigned to a branch of economics called "[heterodox economics](/heterodox-economics)," in that it doesn't adjust to the widely accepted, conventional hypotheses embraced by economists. The theory was likewise not invited in Kondratieff's Russia. His perspectives were utter horror to socialist authorities, particularly Josef Stalin, since they suggested that capitalist nations were not on an inescapable path to destruction in any case, rather, that they encountered high points and low points. Therefore, he ended up in a concentration camp in Siberia and was shot by a discharging crew in 1938.

## Features
- A Kondratieff Wave is a long-term economic cycle, indicated by periods of development and self-rectification, brought about by mechanical innovation that outcomes in a long period of success.
- Kondratieff Waves, a theory dismissed in Kondratieff's nation of origin, are consigned to a branch of economics called "heterodox economics," implying that it doesn't adjust to the widely accepted, customary hypotheses upheld by economists.
- Kondratieff Wave - otherwise called super-cycles, K-waves, floods, and long waves - alludes to cycles, going on around 40 to 60 years, experienced by capitalist economies.
