# Ask Size
## What Is Ask Size?

The ask size is the amount of a security that a [market maker](/marketmaker) is offering to sell at the ask price. The higher the ask size, the more supply there is that individuals need to sell. At the point when a buyer looks to purchase a security, they can acknowledge the ask price and buy up to the ask size amount costing that much. In the event that the buyer wishes to obtain a greater amount of the security over the current ask size, they might need to pay a somewhat higher price to the next accessible [seller](/seller).

Ask size can be diverged from [bid size](/bidsize), or the amount of shares or contracts individuals will buy at a bid price.

## Understanding Ask Size

Market makers are the ones who offer to buy and sell securities. The market maker must state the price it is asking for a given security (the ask price) and the amount it will sell costing that much (the ask size). Additionally, the market maker must state the price at which it will buy the security (the bid price) and the amount of [securities](/security) it will buy (the bid size). At the point when a customer order comes to the exchange, the order is filled by the market marker with the most minimal ask price (for buy orders) or the highest [bid price](/bidprice) (for sell orders).

Ask price and bid price numbers are generally displayed in brackets in a price quote. They address the number of shares, in heaps of 10 or 100, that are [limit orders](/limitorder) pending trade. These numbers are called the bid and ask measures, and address the aggregate number of pending trades at the given bid and ask price.

## How Bid and Ask Prices Work

Think about a stock quote for XYZ Corp. with a bid of $15.30 (25), and an ask of $15.50 (10). The [bid price](/bidprice) is the highest bid placed to purchase XYZ stock, while the ask price is the most minimal price entered for this equivalent stock. The numbers following the bid and ask prices demonstrate the number of shares that are pending trade at their separate prices. In this model, the current limit bid price of $15.30, 2,500 shares are being offered for purchase in [aggregation](/aggregation). The aggregation is for all bid orders being placed at that bid price, regardless assuming the bids are coming from one person bidding for 2,500 shares, or 2,500 individuals bidding for one share each. The equivalent is true for the numbers following the ask price.

The spread between the two prices is called the [bid-ask spread](/bid-askspread). Assuming an investor purchases shares in XYZ, they would pay $15.50. Assuming that this equivalent investor hence liquidated these shares, they would be sold for $15.30. The difference is a loss to the investor.

## Features
- Ask size is generally displayed in round parts addressing 100 shares each. Subsequently, an ask size of four addresses 400 shares.
- Ask sizes are important on the grounds that they mirror the demand and liquidity of a security.
- Ask size addresses the quantity of a security that individuals will sell at a predefined ask (offered) price.
- Level 1 citations will just show the ask size for the best accessible ask price. Level 2 citations show depth of market data on many layers of both bid and ask prices and sizes.
