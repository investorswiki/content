## What Is a Standing Mortgage?

A standing mortgage is a type of interest-only loan, rather than a normal [mortgage](/mortgage) with amortizing principal. A standing mortgage has an interest-only period, where after principal payments kick in and afterward toward the finish of the mortgage's term, the leftover principal is due as a balloon payment.

## Understanding a Standing Mortgage

The most common type of mortgage is an amortized loan, by which the borrower pays a regularly scheduled payment of principal and interest until the loan is paid off toward the loan's term's end. These are level-payment [amortization loans](/amortized_loan) that apply a portion of every payment to the principal over the lifetime of the loan.

A standing mortgage's [principal](/principal), then again, isn't amortized during the life of the loan, yet rather altogether at the finish of the loan term. The principal of a standing mortgage loan is paid in full at maturity as a [balloon payment](/balloon-payment).

A standing mortgage is a subtype of a [standing loan](/standing-loan), which operates in a similar fundamental way, requiring the borrower to only make interest payments over the life of the loan, paying the remainder as a lump sum toward the finish of the loan term.

A standing loan isn't offered frequently on the grounds that its structure means increased risk for the [lender](/lender). The risk comes from a higher probability that the borrower will be unable to make the balloon payment on the principal toward the finish of the mortgage term. Thus, this type of loan is generally offered with a higher [interest rate](/interestrate) than a traditional loan and is generally issued in limited conditions, one of which is a standing mortgage.

A standing loan is just one type of interest-only loan; more normal interest-only loans incorporate [adjustable-rate loans](/arm), with the balloon payment expected toward the finish of a basic period.

## Benefits and Disadvantages of a Standing Mortgage

A standing mortgage can be alluring according to a borrower's viewpoint since they could not in any case have the option to manage the cost of a home. As one model, more youthful and lower-income borrowers expecting lower regularly scheduled payments than a loan requiring repayment of principal can have a significant effect in getting a home.

Assuming these borrowers have valid justification to accept that their income will rise in time and enable them to make that last principal payment, the standing loan structure offers them a chance to [invest](/investing) the money they would somehow apply to loan payments somewhere else, with potential for resource building and greater stability over the long haul. Moreover, interest payments on standing mortgages are generally charge deductible, meaning the whole payment is charge deductible.

A standing mortgage or any sort of standing loan, be that as it may, can mean added risk for a borrower. These loans can be offered at an adjustable rate, so rates can possibly rise, meaning higher regularly scheduled payments. Assuming that the money in any case spent on paying down the principal isn't invested shrewdly, then the borrower probably won't find the security they will require when it comes time to pay off the principal.

This is particularly true on the off chance that the borrower's anticipated income level toward the finish of the loan term doesn't measure up to assumptions. At last, the borrower's home value may not appreciate as fast as wanted, which might mean that selling probably won't be an option to cover the outstanding debt.

## Features
- A standing mortgage is an interest-only loan by which a borrower pays the leftover principal balance toward the finish of the mortgage as a balloon payment.
- Standing mortgages stand rather than amortizing mortgages where the borrower pays a regularly scheduled payment of both principal and interest until the loan is paid off toward the finish of the mortgage term.
- Since there is a risk of the balloon payment toward the finish of the loan not being paid, standard mortgages ordinarily accompany higher interest rates than amortized mortgages.
- Standard mortgages can be profitable to youthful and low-income borrowers as the regularly scheduled payment of the interest-only period makes purchasing a home more affordable.
- Standing loans are not commonly offered as they carry increased risks to lenders who may not receive the balloon payment toward the finish of the loan term in the event that a borrower defaults.
