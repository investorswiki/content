The problem is that profit in a [accounting period](/accountingperiod) can be slanted by things that have essentially nothing to do with the ordinary running of the business. For instance, there are events when a company procures a critical, one-off amount of income from investment securities, a completely owned subsidiary, or the sale of a large part of equipment, property or land.

These types of gains — on top of income earned from recurring occasions outside of the business' primary profession — can essentially change a company's earnings and make it hard for investors to measure how well the company's operations really fared during the reported period.
