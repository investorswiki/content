# Loan Strip
## What is a Loan Strip?

A loan strip is a [commercial loan](/commercial-loan) arrangement through which the initial lender on a long-term loan, like a bank, can get funding for that loan from different lenders or investors.

A loan strip addresses a share of the long-term loan, (for example, a five-year loan). At the point when the loan strip arrives at maturity, its holder will receive a settled upon amount of money. The [maturity](/maturity) of a loan strip is generally short term (frequently 30 or 60 days). A loan strip is otherwise called a strip participation or, all the more officially, a short-term loan participation arrangement.

## How a Loan Strip Works

At the point when a bank or other lender makes a long-term loan, it can sell loan strips to investors to raise [capital](/capital) to fund the loan. For instance, when a bank sells a 60-day loan strip, it is getting money to cover that portion of the loan.

Be that as it may, toward the finish of the 60 days, the source of funding for the loan has evaporated. The bank must either resell the loan strip to that equivalent [investor](/investor), track down another investor, or fund the loan strip itself.

## Regulations on Loan Strips

In specific situations, loan strips might be classified as borrowed amounts in the bank's quarterly financial report to regulators, known as a [call report](/callreport). Since March 31, 1988, bank regulators have considered a loan strip to be a borrowed amount on the off chance that the investor has the option not to recharge the loan strip toward the finish of the term and the bank is committed to restore it.

In that case, loan strips are dealt with not as sales, but rather as borrowings. The loan strips are then viewed as deposits and become subject to reserve requirements for depository institutions as set forward by the [Federal Reserve](/federalreservebank) under Regulation D.

Moreover, on the off chance that the original investor picks not to restore the loan strip toward the finish of the maturity period, the [depository](/depository) institution that sold the loan strip must interpretation of the responsibility of funding the loan strip itself. That is on the grounds that the borrower's loan terms typically stretch out a long ways past the loan strip's maturity period.

For instance, the borrower of the loan being sold as loan strips might have endorsed on for a loan period of one year, five years or longer â€” or may have sorted out for a revolving credit extension of comparable duration. In effect, loan strips bear the qualities of a repurchase agreement in light of the fact that the bank that is selling the loan strip consents to buy it back from the purchaser at the purchaser's prudence.

Loan strip transactions can include deposit liabilities, like affirmations of advance, [promissory notes](/promissorynote) or different obligations. Thusly, exemptions from the definition of a deposit as framed in Regulation D might be applied to these liabilities. For instance, when a domestic bank sells a loan strip to another domestic bank, that loan strip might be exempt from deposit requirements as set forward in Regulation D.
