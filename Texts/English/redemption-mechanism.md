# Redemption Mechanism
## What Is a Redemption Mechanism?

A redemption mechanism is a method utilized by market producers of [exchange-traded funds](/etf) (ETF) to accommodate the differences between [net asset values](/nav) (NAV) and market values. This cycle, likewise alluded to as the ETF creation and redemption mechanism, serves to forestalls shares of an ETF trading at a discount or premium, keeping it in accordance with its underlying NAV, the fair value of a single share of the fund.

## How a Redemption Mechanism Works

The redemption mechanism is utilized by [authorized participants](/authorizedparticipant) (APs): the specialist sellers responsible for obtaining the [securities](/security) that the ETF needs to hold. On the off chance that the ETF's aim is to follow the S&P 500 index, the AP will purchase every one of its constituents in a similar weight and deliver them to the sponsor, in exchange for a block of similarly valued ETF shares, priced at their NAV. This arrangement, known as a creation unit, gives the ETF provider the securities it requirements to follow the index and the AP a block of ETF shares to resell at a profit.

ETFs trade like standard stocks, implying that their prices vacillate over the course of the day. On the off chance that the ETF unexpectedly encounters a flood in notoriety, its share price will rise over the value of its underlying securities. On the other hand, market prices could fall below [fair value](/fairvalue) on the off chance that the fund falls undesirable with investors and a [sell-off](/sell-off) happens.

> At the point when an ETF's share price strays from the fair value of its portfolio of securities, authorized participants (APs) will at the same time buy and sell to make themselves a profit.

At the point when NAV and market values wander, APs can mediate and capitalize on arbitrage opportunities â€” the act of buying a security in one market and all the while selling it in one more to cash in on a brief difference in prices. These measures ought to drive the ETF's share price back toward fair value, disposing of mispricing, and earn the AP a risk-free [profit](/profit).

## Illustration of a Redemption Mechanism

In the event that the ETF is in high demand and trades at a [premium](/at-a-premium), the AP could sell the shares it received during its creation and make a spread between the cost of the assets it bought for the ETF issuer and the selling price from the ETF shares. It might likewise go into the market and buy the underlying shares that make the ETF straightforwardly at lower prices, sell ETF shares on the open market at a higher price, and capture the spread.

## Benefits of a Redemption Mechanism

The redemption mechanism process is the main impetus behind a considerable lot of the advantages associated with ETFs, assisting with keeping them cheap, transparent, and tax-efficient in addition to other things.

APs do the entirety of the buying and selling of securities for the ETF's benefit, tolerating the trading costs and different fees associated with creation and redemption activity that would somehow or another eat into the fund's [returns](/return). Their ability to add or subtract ETF shares from the market to match demand supports productivity, works with more tight tracking of indexes, and guarantees that ETFs are priced fairly and simply immediately subject to [supply and demand](/law-of-supply-demand) dynamics.

Contending products, for example, [closed-end](/closed-endinvestment) mutual funds or [unit investment trusts](/uit) (UITs) loath this luxury. Not having anybody behind them to make or reclaim shares and deal with the market price brings about them forcing higher charges and routinely trading at eminent premiums or discounts to their NAVs.
