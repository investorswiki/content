# Transaction ID (TXID)
A transaction ID (TXID) or transaction hash is a unique string of characters given to each transaction that is confirmed and added to the blockchain. At the end of the day, a TXID is an identification number that names every transaction on the blockchain.
At the point when you make a transaction, and it gets added to the blockchain, it's given a transaction ID as a unique identifier. Contingent upon the blockchain utilized, you can then track down it in a block explorer via looking for the transaction ID. This can be valuable for checking essential transaction data, for example, the amount sent, the date of transfer, the sending/getting address, and the number of network affirmations that the transaction has received.
For instance, this is the TXID of the very first Bitcoin transaction sent by Satoshi Nakamoto to Hal Finney:
**f4184fc596403b9d638783cf57adfe4c75c605f6356fbc91338530e9831e9e16**
This is the TXID of the renowned [Bitcoin Pizza](/bitcoin-pizza) transaction:
**cca7507897abc89628f450e8b1e0c6fca4ec3f7b34cccf55f3f531c659ff4d79**
You can look into these transactions yourself by replicating the TXIDs into a Bitcoin block explorer, for example, blockchain.com, [blockchair.com](/bitcoin), or numerous others.
At the point when you pull out cryptocurrency from a centralized exchange (CEX) like Binance, the platform will show you the TXID of your withdrawal transaction. On Binance, you can find this on your Transaction History page. Assuming you click on a TXID for a given withdrawal, it'll take you to the important transaction in that blockchain's block explorer.
Assuming you send funds to some unacceptable address (or blockchain), the TXID in your withdrawal history is essential to begin investigating whether you can recuperate your funds. Even thus, it's anything but a guarantee, and it's best to contact support on the platform that you're pulling out to.
