# Wildcat Banking
## What Is Wildcat Banking?

Wildcat banking alludes to the banking industry in parts of the United States from 1837 to 1865, when banks were laid out in remote and unavailable areas. During this period, banks were chartered by state law with no federal oversight. Less severe regulations on the banking industry at the time prompted this period, likewise being alluded to as the Free Banking Era.

## Grasping Wildcat Banking

Wildcat banks were not fully free of regulation; they were just free of federal regulation. Wildcat banks were chartered under applicable state laws and regulated on the state level. Banking regulations, consequently, fluctuated starting with one state then onto the next during the Free Banking Era. The Free Banking Era reached a conclusion with the section of the National Bank Act of 1863, which carried out federal regulations overseeing banks, laid out the [United States National Banking System](/national-bank), and supported the development of a national currency backed by the holdings of the [U.S. Treasury](/ustreasury) and issued by the [Office of the Comptroller of the Currency](/office-comptroller-currency-occ).

## Starting points of the Term 'Wildcat Banking'

The term "wildcat banking" apparently had its genesis during the 1830s in Michigan, where bankers were accepted to have set up banks in areas so remote that wildcats wandered there. Others say the term originated with an early bank that issued currency bearing a picture of a wildcat.

As soon as 1812, wildcat was utilized to allude to a rash or foolhardy speculator. By 1838, the term was applied to any business venture considered shaky or risky. The term "wildcat" then, when applied to a bank, came to mean a temperamental bank at risk of disappointment, and it's hence that wildcat banks have been depicted as such in Westerns. For instance, a few Westerns depict wildcat bankers as leaving their vaults open so that investors might see barrels of cash in that. Nonetheless, the barrels are actually full of nails, flour, or other correspondingly worthless things, with a layer of cash on top to fool contributors.

## Currency Issued by Wildcat Banks

No matter what the starting points of the term, wildcat banks issued their own currency until the National Bank Act of 1863 disallowed this practice. These bank areas were in some cases the main spots where the bank's notes could be recovered, in this way making an impressive obstruction for their redemption by note-holders and giving an unfair advantage to corrupt bankers.

Customarily, the currency issued by wildcat bankers has been considered worthless, and the securities used to back wildcat currencies have generally been sketchy. While a few wildcat banks utilized specie to back their issued currencies, others utilized bonds or mortgages. Various currencies issued by various banks traded at various discounts as compared to their face values. Distributed records were utilized to recognize genuine bills from frauds, and to assist bankers and currency traders with assessing wildcat currencies.

Before the Federal Reserve System was laid out in 1913, banks issued notes to stretch out loans to their customers. An individual could take their own banknotes or bills of exchange to the responsible bank and trade them in for a discount of the cash value. Borrowers would acquire bank notes backed by [government bonds](/government-bond) or species. Such a note gave its holder a claim on assets held by the bank, which, during the Free Banking Era, were required to be backed by state bonds in many states.
