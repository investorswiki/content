The subsequent decline ended inside two points of the [initial public offering](/ipo) (IPO) price, far surpassing O'Neil's requirement for a shallow cup high in the prior trend. The subsequent recovery wave arrived at the prior high in 2011, almost 10 years after the principal print. The handle follows the classic pullback expectation, finding support at the half retracement in an adjusted shape, and returns to the high for a subsequent time frame 14 months later.
