## What Are Shares?

Shares are units of [equity](/equity) ownership in a corporation. For certain companies, shares exist as a financial asset accommodating an equivalent distribution of any residual profits, in the event that any are declared, as [dividends](/dividend). Shareholders of a stock that pays no dividends don't take part in that frame of mind of profits. All things being equal, they expect to partake in the growth of the stock price as company profits increase.

Shares address equity stock in a firm, with the two primary types of shares being [common shares](/commonstock) and preferred shares. Therefore, "shares" and "[stock](/stock)" are commonly utilized reciprocally.

Not at all like debt capital, got through a loan or bond issue, equity has no legal command to be repaid to investors, and shares, while they might pay dividends as a distribution of profits, don't pay interest. Essentially all companies, from small partnerships or LLCs to multinational corporations, issue shares or the like.

Shares of [privately held](/privately-owned) companies or partnerships are owned by the founders or partners. As small companies develop, shares are sold to outside investors in the [primary market](/primarymarket). These may incorporate friends or family, and afterward [angel](/angelinvestor) or [venture capital](/venturecapitalist) (VC) investors. On the off chance that the company keeps on developing, it might try to raise extra equity capital by selling shares to the public by means of a [initial public offering](/ipo) (IPO). After an IPO, a company's shares are supposed to be [publicly traded](/publiccompany) and become listed on a stock exchange.

Nonetheless, this type of stock normally has set payment criteria, a dividend that is paid out routinely, making the stock safer than common stock. Since preferred stock takes priority over common stock in the event that the business petitions for financial protection and is forced to repay its lenders, preferred shareholders receive payment before common shareholders yet after bondholders. Since preferred shareholders have priority in repayment upon bankruptcy, they are safer than common shares.

Physical paper [stock certificates](/stockcertificate) have been supplanted with electronic recordings of stock shares. The issue and distribution of shares in public and private markets are managed by the [Securities and Exchange Commission](/sec) (SEC) and trading on the secondary market of shares by the SEC and [FINRA](/finra).
