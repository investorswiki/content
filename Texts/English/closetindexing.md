# Closet Indexing
## What Is Closet Indexing?

Closet indexing is a system used to portray funds that claim to actively purchase investments however end up with a portfolio not entirely different from the benchmark. Thusly, portfolio managers accomplish returns like an underlying benchmark, similar to the [S&P 500](/sp500), without precisely imitating the index. The motivation for closet indexing outgrows long periods of poor performance and the continuous shift from active to [passive management](/passivemanagement). Flows out of active and into passive funds have topped many millions in assets under management for quite a long time. This has put pressure on fund managers who fear the passive industry will dispose of stock-picking position.

## How Closet Indexing Works

Closet indexing could stick to an index in terms of weighting, industry sector, or geology. A manager's performance is normally compared to a benchmark index, so there is an incentive for managers to gain returns that are essentially similar to the index. Even assuming that the fund performs somewhat more regrettable than the benchmark net, everything being equal, the manager is promoted for their stock-picking ability.

Closet indexing is frequently seen negatively by investors since they could basically pick an index fund and pay lower fees. On the surface, it very well may be challenging to distinguish in the event that a fund rehearses closet indexing yet a more critical glance at the prospectus can reveal a fund's true holdings. There are a couple of ways of spotting funds that reproduce a benchmark index.

Instruments like [R Squared](/r-squared) and tracking mistake decides a portfolio's statistical deviation from the benchmark index. R Squared is by definition a statistical measure that addresses the percentage a fund digresses or adjusts to a benchmark. In the interim, tracking mistake portrays the difference between a fund's returns and the benchmark, also called active risk. One more measurement to take a gander at is the active share, which lays out the percentage of holdings that contrast from the benchmark index. A portfolio with an active share somewhere in the range of 20% and 60% is viewed as a closet indexer.

## Disadvantages of Closet Indexing

The greatest issue investors have with closet indexing is the high fees that active managers keep on charging, notwithstanding adopting a passive strategy. Investors end up taking the brunt of this carelessness since they pay higher fees for comparative or unremarkable performance. Notwithstanding, picking a fund with a high active share will not be guaranteed to mean better returns. Eventually, active funds that beat benchmark returns will generally have lower fees than the traditional actively managed fund.

## Highlights
- Metrics, for example, R squared and active share can assist with deciding a portfolio's statistical deviation from the benchmark index, and subsequently on the off chance that it is a closet index.
- Closet indexing is a fund purchasing system that claims to actively purchase investments, yet ends up with a portfolio basically the same as its benchmark.
- Ordinarily viewed negatively, closet indexing brings about higher fees for investors that pay a management fee for fund managers that just mirror an index fund, showing a false feeling of management capacities.
