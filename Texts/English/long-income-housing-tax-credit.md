## What Is the Low-Income Housing Tax Credit (LIHTC)?

The Low-Income Housing Tax Credit (LIHTC) is a [tax incentive](/taxcredit) for housing engineers to develop, purchase, or redesign housing for low-income people and families. The Low-Income Housing Tax Credit was written into the [Tax Reform Act of 1986](/taxreformact1986).

It is expected to animate the creation of additional housing for low and middle-income families in networks that sounds far off. Commonly, the dwelling types that receive the Low-Income Housing Tax Credit are multi-family properties.

There are two fundamental types of credits available. The first is a 9% credit, which must be utilized in the event that the building project will have no different credits or government sponsorships applied to it. The subsequent type is a 4% credit, which can be utilized related to extra tax credits. These credits are applied more than a ten-year period and can cover practically the entirety of the taxable expense for the building.

The tax credits are allocated to each state by the federal government. From that point, each state might pick which engineers can exploit these credits for their housing projects. Only one out of every odd engineer or investor will actually want to exploit this program as there are a larger number of applications than available permits issued for construction.

## Qualifying for the Low-Income Housing Tax Credit

A wide assortment of properties can be eligible for the Low-Income Housing Tax Credit, however a bigger number of projects are seeking the credits than there are credits, as these are allocated in light of state population. To fit the bill for the LIHTC, a project must meet one of the following conditions:

1. 20% or a greater amount of the rental units are rented to tenants earning half or less of the median income in the area in view of the family size.
1. 40% or a greater amount of the rental units are rented to tenants earning 60% or less of the median income in the area in view of the family size.
1. 40% or a greater amount of the rental units are rented to tenants with income averaging something like 60% of the median income in the area and no units are rented to tenants earning over 80% of the median income.
