# Transitory New Account
## What Is a Temporary New Account?

An impermanent new account is a holding place set up inside a fund to hold a balance because of a critical cash inflow or outflow to the fund. The account is set up to briefly hold these funds until they can be distributed to unitholders, used to secure extra [assets](/asset) for the fund, or for other large fund expenditures. Impermanent new accounts improve on fund accounting since they separate the balances expected for inflows or outflows from different balances or assets.

## Grasping Temporary New Accounts

Large outer cash flows in a portfolio can be a problem for most firms. These flows of cash can altogether impact the implementation of an investment command, objective, or strategy. They can likewise influence the performance of a portfolio or a composite.

To better oversee large cash flows, transitory new accounts are set up by funds to streamline and work on the accounting and cash flow process. This interaction is suggested by [Global Investment Performance Standards](/gips) (GIPS), a set of voluntary best practices developed by the [CFA Institute](/cfainstitute) that is intended to give investors extra transparency to assess investment managers.

By setting up separate accounts, a fund can undoubtedly decide the amount of money that will be distributed to unitholders or generally the amount of money it will involve to purchase extra holdings for the fund.

As per the GIPS standards, an outer cash flow is defined as "capital (cash or investments) that enters or leaves a portfolio. A critical cash flow is defined as the level at which the firm discovers that a client-coordinated outer cash flow may briefly keep the firm from executing the composite strategy. Transfers of assets between asset classes inside a portfolio or manager initiated flows must not be utilized to move portfolios out of composites on a transitory basis."

### Impermanent New Accounts and Composites

Large amounts of cash inflow or outflow at one time can be disruptive to the maintenance of a [composite](/composite). A composite is defined by the GIPS as an aggregation of at least one [portfolios](/portfolio) managed by a specific investment command, objective, or strategy.

Expense paying, [discretionary portfolios](/discretionaryaccount) are remembered for composites while non-discretionary ones are not. An anticipated critical inflow or outflow would call for the foundation of an impermanent new account, as per GIPS direction, to limit the impact on the composite that an investment manager might want to keep stable.

## Illustration of the Use of a Temporary New Account

Suppose a huge cash flow is removed from a portfolio toward the month's end, the firm would move the vital cash as well as investments into an impermanent new account for liquidation or distribution to the client.

## Special Considerations

The thresholds for such cash flows that require the set up of transitory new accounts ought not entirely set in stone before a composite is built and imparted to clients.
