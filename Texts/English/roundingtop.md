# Rounding Top
## What Is a Rounding Top?

A rounding top is a [price pattern](/pattern) used in [technical analysis](/technicalanalysis). It is distinguished by daily price movements, in particular the tops, which when diagramed, form a descending slanting curve. Technical analysis of price information suggests that a rounding top might form toward the finish of an extended upward trend and that this price pattern might demonstrate a reversal in the long-term price movement.

The rounding top pattern can foster more than several days, weeks, months, or even years, with longer time spans to completion forecasting longer changes in trend. It could be stood out from a [rounding bottom](/roundingbottom).

## Understanding a Rounding Top

A rounding top pattern is like that of a [inverse saucer pattern](/inversesaucer). It is likewise like, and may occur coincidentally with, a [double top](/doubletop) or [triple top](/tripletop) price pattern. The central matter of perceiving the rounding top pattern is to expect a huge change in trend from upward trending prices to descending trending prices. Perceiving this sort of a change can permit traders to take profits and safeguard themselves from buying into an unfavorable market, or plan to bring in money from falling prices by [short-selling](/shortselling).

The rounding top pattern has three fundamental parts:

While following a rounding top, traders may likewise watch volume which is usually higher as the charted price increases and diminishes on a downtrend. In a rounding top, a curved trend line following pinnacle highs forms an inverted "U" shape. In this pattern, the price of the [security](/security) will increase to another high, then, at that point, consistently diminishes from a resistance level to form the rounding top. Volumes will usually be the highest when the price is expanding and may experience one more high on the downtrend during the selloff phase.

Generally, a rounding top will likewise address a bearish future outlook for the security. Notwithstanding, investors should be cautious while following a rounding top as support at the security's cost can occur causing several rounding tops to follow in a double top or triple top pattern.

## Price Forecast After a Rounding Top

Similarly as with all technical chart patterns, the rounding top pattern isn't some trustworthy prediction gadget. It is a technical pattern suggesting that investors in the stock are debilitating in their determination to hold the stock and may start selling shares in bigger numbers. This doesn't necessarily in all cases occur. At the point when the price neglects to follow through with a descending trend after the pattern has been displayed, it has been seen to rebound from the support level and start remembering higher prices.

That's what a few eyewitnesses suggest on the off chance that the price rises in excess of about a third of the separation from the support level heading back towards support, that the probability that it will make new highs is increased. By then, the price pattern is showing a bullish forecast until it arrives at the previous high.

## Relationship to the Double Top

In the event that a rounding top series chart doesn't lead to a reversal, then it might start to head back to previous highs. In the event that at those highs it meets resistance once more, it is probably going to form a [double top](/doubletop). In a double top pattern, a security's price will show two consecutive upside-down U-shaped patterns. In these situations, investors are not totally bearish despite everything accept that the security's price could stay at top levels.

A double top of this sort, the combination of two rounding tops, is possible an exceptionally bearish indicator because buyers have now attempted two times, and failed, to see their expectations at higher costs accomplished. This pattern forms when investors are opposing a bearish trend, and when they never again oppose and start to exit the pattern, they might do so quickly. Generally, this pattern, similar to a rounding top, will show the finish of a bullish trend.
