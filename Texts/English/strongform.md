# Strong Form Efficiency
## What Is Strong Form Efficiency?

Strong form productivity is the most rigid rendition of the [efficient market hypothesis](/efficientmarkethypothesis) (EMH) investment theory, expressing that all information in a [market](/market), whether public or private, is accounted for in a stock's price.

Specialists of strong form proficiency accept that even [insider information](/insiderinformation) can't give a [investor](/investor) an advantage. This degree of [market efficiency](/marketefficiency) suggests that [profits](/benefit) surpassing normal [returns](/return) can't be realized no matter what the amount of research or information investors approach.

## Figuring out Strong Form Efficiency

Strong form productivity is a part of the EMH and is viewed as part of the [random walk theory](/randomwalktheory). It states that the price of [securities](/security) and, consequently the overall market, are not random and are affected by past events.

Strong form effectiveness is one of the three distinct degrees of the EMH, the others being weak and semi-strong proficiency. Every one depends on a similar essential theory yet changes somewhat in terms of toughness.

### Strong Form Efficiency versus Weak Form Efficiency and Semi-Strong Form Efficiency

The [weak form effectiveness theory](/weakform), the most tolerant of the bundle, contends that stock prices mirror all current information yet additionally surrenders that [anomalies](/irregularity) might be found by researching organizations' [financial statements](/financial-statements) completely.

The [semi-strong form](/semistrongform) effectiveness theory goes one step further, advancing the possibility that all information in the public domain is utilized in the calculation of a stock's [current price](/currentprice). That means it is beyond the realm of possibilities for investors to recognize [undervalued](/undervalued) securities and create higher returns in the market by using either [technical](/technicalanalysis) or [fundamental analysis](/fundamentalanalysis).

The individuals who buy into this variant of the EMH accept that main information that isn't promptly accessible to the public can assist investors with helping their returns to a performance level over that of the general market. The strong form proficiency theory dismisses this idea, expressing that no information, public or inside information, will help an investor since even inside information is reflected in the current stock price.

## History of Strong Form Efficiency

The concept of strong form proficiency was spearheaded by Princeton [economics](/economics) teacher Burton G. Malkiel in his book distributed in 1973 named "A Random Walk Down Wall Street."

Malkiel depicted [earnings estimates](/earningsestimate), technical analysis, and [investment advisory](/investmentadvisor) services as "futile." He said the best method for boosting returns is by following a [buy-and-hold strategy](/buyandhold), adding that [portfolios](/portfolio) developed by specialists ought to fare no better than a basket of stocks put together by a blindfolded monkey.

## Illustration of Strong Form Efficiency

Most instances of strong form proficiency include insider information. This is on the grounds that strong form effectiveness is the main part of the EMH that considers proprietary information. The theory states that in spite of mainstream thinking, holding onto inside information won't assist an investor with earning high returns in the market.

This is an illustration of the way strong form productivity could play out in real life. A [chief technology officer](/chief-technology-officer) (CTO) of a [public](/publiccompany) technology company accepts that his firm will start to lose customers and [revenues](/revenue). After the internal rollout of another product feature to [beta](/beta) analyzers, the CTO's feelings of trepidation are confirmed, and he knows that the official rollout will be a failure. This would be viewed as insider information.

The CTO chooses to take up a [short position](/short) in his own company, successfully betting against the stock price movement. Assuming that the stock price declines, the CTO will benefit and, assuming the stock prices expands, he will lose money.

Be that as it may, when the product feature is delivered to the public, the stock price is unaffected and doesn't decline even however customers are disheartened with the product. This market is strong form efficient on the grounds that even the insider information of the product flop was at that point priced into the stock. The CTO would lose money in this situation.
