# Expectations Theory
## What Is Expectations Theory?

Expectations theory endeavors to anticipate what short-term [interest rates](/interestrate) will be later on in view of current long-term interest rates. The theory proposes that an investor acquires similar interest by investing in two continuous one-year bond investments versus investing in one two-year bond today. The theory is otherwise called the "unprejudiced expectations theory."

## Grasping Expectations Theory

The expectations theory plans to help [investors](/investor) pursue choices in light of a forecast of future interest rates. The theory utilizes long-term rates, regularly from government bonds, to forecast the rate for short-term bonds. In theory, long-term rates can be utilized to demonstrate where rates of short-term bonds will trade from now on.

### Computing Expectations Theory

Suppose that the present [bond market](/bondmarket) gives investors a two-year bond that pays an interest rate of 20% while a one-year bond pays an interest rate of 18%. The expectations theory can be utilized to forecast the interest rate of a future one-year bond.

- The initial step of the calculation is to add one to the two-year bond's interest rate. The outcome is 1.2.
- The next step is to square the outcome or (1.2 * 1.2 = 1.44).
- Partition the outcome by the current one-year interest rate and add one or ((1.44/1.18) +1 = 1.22).
- To ascertain the forecast one-year bond interest rate for the next year, take away one from the outcome or (1.22 - 1 = 0.22 or 22%).

In this model, the investor is earning an equivalent return to the current interest rate of a two-year bond. In the event that the investor decides to invest in a one-year bond at 18%, the bond yield for the next year's bond would have to increase to 22% for this investment to be favorable.

## Burdens of Expectations Theory

Investors ought to know that the expectations theory isn't generally a dependable device. A common problem with utilizing the expectations theory is that it in some cases misjudges future short-term rates, making it simple for investors to wind up with an inaccurate prediction of a bond's [yield curve](/yieldcurve).

One more limitation of the theory is that many factors impact short-term and long-term bond yields. The Federal Reserve changes interest rates up or down, which impacts bond yields, including short-term bonds. Be that as it may, long-term yields may be less impacted on the grounds that numerous different factors impact long-term yields, including inflation and economic growth expectations.

Thus, the expectations theory doesn't consider the outside powers and fundamental macroeconomic factors that drive interest rates and, eventually, bond yields.

## Expectations Theory Versus Preferred Habitat Theory

The preferred habitat theory makes the expectations theory one stride further. The theory states that investors have a preference for short-term bonds over long-term bonds except if the last option pay a [risk premium](/riskpremium). As such, on the off chance that investors will hold onto a long-term bond, they need to be compensated with a higher [yield](/yield) to legitimize the risk of holding the investment until [maturity](/maturity).

The preferred habitat theory can help make sense of, in part, why longer-term bonds normally pay out a higher interest rate than two shorter-term bonds that, when added together, bring about a similar maturity.

While looking at the [preferred habitat theory](/preferred-habitat-theory) to the expectations theory, the difference is that the former accepts investors are worried about maturity as well as yield. Interestingly, the expectations theory accepts that investors are just worried about yield.
