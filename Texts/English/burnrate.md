# Burn Rate
## What Is Burn Rate?

The burn rate is regularly used to depict the rate at which another company is spending its [venture capital](/venturecapital) to finance overhead before generating positive cash flow from operations. It is a measure of negative cash flow.

The burn rate is generally quoted in terms of cash spent each month. For instance, assuming a company is said to have a burn rate of $1 million, it would mean that the company is spending $1 million every month.

## Understanding the Burn Rate

The burn rate is utilized by startup companies and investors to follow the amount of month to month cash that a company spends before it begins generating its own income. A company's burn rate is likewise utilized as a measuring stick for its runway, the amount of time the company has before it runs out of money.

In this way, in the event that a company has $1 million in the bank, and it burns through $100,000 per month, its burn rate would be $100,000 and its runway would be 10 months, derived as:

- ($a million)/($100,000) = 10

> A company can reduce its gross burn rate or the total amount of operating costs it has every month by creating revenue or by cutting costs, like lessening staff or seeking less expensive means of production.

## Burn Rate Example

There are two types of burn rates: net burn and gross burn. A company's gross burn is the total amount of [operating costs](/operating-cost) it causes in expenses every month. A company's net burn is the total amount of money a company loses every month.

Thus, in the event that a technology startup burns through $5,000 month to month on office space, $10,000 on month to month waiter costs and $15,000 on salaries and wages for its engineers, its gross burn rate would be $30,000. Be that as it may, on the off chance that the company was at that point creating revenue, its net burn would be unique. Even on the off chance that the company operates at a loss, with revenues of $20,000 every month and costs of goods sold (COGS) of $10,000, it would in any case attempt to reduce its overall burn.

In this scenario, the company's net burn would be $20,000, derived as:

- $20,000 - $10,000 - $30,000 = $20,000

This is a vital differentiation since it influences the amount of money a company has in the bank and consequently its financial runway. Even on the off chance that it's spending $30,000 gross, the real amount it is losing each month is $20,000. This means, for instance, that assuming it had $100,000 in the bank, its runway would be five months as opposed to around 90 days. This directs the manner by which the managers frame the company's strategy and the amount that a [investor](/investor) would need to invest in the company.

Be that as it may, when the burn rate starts to surpass burn gauges, or revenue neglects to live up to assumptions, the standard [recourse](/recourse) is to reduce the burn rate, paying little mind to money in the bank. This expects that the entrepreneurs reconsider about the startup's cost structure. This typically means diminishing staff and other major cost drivers, for example, office lease, technology, or advertising
